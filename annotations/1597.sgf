C[Hi,
Well, there's no question I wuold like to make about a position, but I would like to hear some comments about what points I missed an interesting hand and where I made some mistakes. There was some times that my opponent made some mistakes that prevented her from invading my territory, but I couldn't find where was my mistake that let her invade

---

Hi!

I am Ethereal, a 10k on KGS. I will try to point out and explain the things that I see are wrong, and where you can improve.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[pq];B[co];W[cp];B[do];W[jc];B[gp]C[This is a good continuation indeed. F4 would've also been strong.]
;W[gq];B[hq]TR[cp][dq]C[Here I would've preferred the hane on the other side (F3). The two marked white stones in the corner aren't that strong and can be killed. By playing the hane on the other side you can seperate the white stones and get a better result by attacking both weak groups.

However a crosscut by white could make things complicated.]
;W[fq];B[fp];W[ep];B[eo];W[dp];B[hr];W[gr];B[mq]C[Here a 'finishing' move at H5, covering your cutting points, would've been very valuable. Making a strong outside wall that radiates power in two directions is very valuable.]
;W[nq];B[np]C[Your position on the left isn't very solid, leaving cutting points here as well would not be a wise thing. N4 would be better.]
;W[oq];B[op]C[Territory is to be made to the left of this fight for black. Try to make that territory and not attack white to severely and leave too many cutting points. N5 would've been better.]
;W[pp];B[po];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn];B[qm]
(;W[rm]C[Your position here is VERY thin with LOTS of cutting points. If white would've played more aggressively she would've gotten a bigger advantage. *see variation*]
;B[rn];W[ro];B[rl]C[Here again white could've made your life sour with about the same moves. *see variation*]

(;W[sn];B[pl];W[mp];B[lq];W[mo];B[no]C[P6 here does a better job of taking the angle out of white's attack.]
;W[nn];B[oo];W[on];B[pm];W[om]C[White should've defended her group and keep it alive with N7.]
;B[mn];W[ln];B[mm]
(;W[lo]C[Here was a big mistake, she lost the opportunit to crash my position at p8

--

P8 isn't as dangerous at it looks. *see variation*];B[ol];W[mc]
;B[hc]LB[qd:C][ci:A][di:B]C[There are more valuable moves here. Playing at A or B would make massive territorial potential on the left side extending from both the stone in the corner as the wall at the bottom of the board.

Also closing the corner at C making territory at the right side would've been better.

White didn't have to respond to this move, as his two-space extension is pretty safe.]
;W[ic]C[This is a very weak response by white. Playing at the points A or B as mentioned before, as well as invading the corner would've been much better.]
;B[hd];W[oc];B[ne];W[pc];B[qd];W[qc];B[rc];W[rb];B[sd];W[sb]
C[Here white is obviously not making the biggest moves (the ones worth most points).]
;B[lm]TR[ln][lo][mo][mp]C[If you are concerned about the four marked stones, it's better to make them die a natural death by closing the weaknesses in its surroundings, than to attack it directly. H5 would still have been good here.]
;W[km];B[ll];W[kl];B[kn];W[ko];B[jn];W[jo];B[in];W[od];B[oe]
;W[nd]C[Another totally unnecessary move by white...];B[ld]

(;W[dj]C[White could've used the ladder to play a ladder-breaker and an invasion at the same time if she would've played a bit lower (D9).

White could've also exploited the holes in your position. *see variation*]
;B[cg];W[ch];B[dh];W[ci];B[ei];W[ej];B[fj];W[fk]C[White could again have played far more aggressively than this, especially with the ladder at M14 still looming.]

TR[le][me][kf][lf][kg][ii][ji][hj][ij][hk][om][nn][on]C[This hand was played because I was fearing a invasion
but it looks like i played on a bad place and I was invaded

If your walls are thick and solid enough, you won't have to fear an internal invasion. Since all the marked stones are dead with one move, the only real danger comes from spot A. Defending here would suffice.]
;W[sc];B[rd];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf];B[qf];W[nf];B[jg];W[of];B[me]
;W[qg];B[ng]LB[pg:A]C[Playing at A is better here, cutting white in two while keeping his liberties low.]

It would have indeed been very bad for you.];B[qh];W[gc];B[fc]
;W[gd];B[ge]C[Well there were a lot of holes in your position. Fortunately for you, white wasn't very good at exploiting them. My advice is to play less aggressively and close the holes in your position before you face an opponent that DOES know how to exploit them. Try to not crawl too closely to your opponent and push beyond your limits. Instead, try to allow the opponent to live and get some territory, while you get more.]

If white tries to capture the two black stones at 2, black just walks the ladder out, which leads to the D16 stone and is thus broken.

If white connects at 3, black plays 1 and wins on liberties.]
