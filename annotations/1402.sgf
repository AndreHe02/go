C[plim : I played Black during this game
Thanks for the review

A:
My name is Aaron. In this game I feel that black got off to a slow start
because of a couple slow fuseki moves. This allowed white to create a large
framework that black had to reduce. It ended up being a close game, but I
felt it was easier for white because black did not defend the weak group
at the top of the board.];B[qd];W[ed]C[plim : I don't know how to deal with White opening...

A: My advice is to play this type of move yourself as much as you can to get more experience with it.]
;B[cp];W[qp];B[oq];W[lp]
(;B[oo]C[A:
My feeling is that blacks move is too slow, P6 is a bit faster and gives
a good chance to counter-pincer around J4. (variation)];W[pn]
;B[on]C[plim : I made a bad move here
R3 would be better I think and is Joseki];W[pm]
(;B[mn]C[A:
Maybe R3 is best, P7 seems ok also. I think the key here is that the three
black stones seem a little weak, so black tries to make them stronger with
n6. The problem is that this move makes white reinforce the m4 stone. Since
the three white stones on the right are stronger, black should contact those
stones to reinforce before attacking M4. (variations)];W[hq]
;B[jp]C[A: This may be a bit too early.  R3 is still good and E3 is also big and threatens white even more.]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[kq];B[kn];W[mr]C[A: E3 is better for white.]
;B[lo];W[oc]
(;B[pe]TR[qg]C[plim : maybe a bit slow?

A: R13 settles black in the area and also keeps white from having such a good extension along the right side. (variation)]
;W[qi]C[A: A good move, but I think c16 is better.];B[nd];W[mc]
;B[nc];W[nb];B[ob];W[lb];B[pb];W[kd]C[plim : i think know that it is a bad exchange
Now White is very strong in the upper board

A:
Black does get a big corner and sente though...];B[lq]C[A: This doesn't turn
out well for black because black loses sente. instead, c16 is a good point.]
;W[lr];B[mq];W[nq];B[mp];W[ep]C[A: A good move for white, although it does weaken the bottom a bit.]
;B[eq];W[co];B[dp];W[do];B[fp];W[eo];B[fq];W[dj]C[plim : after white D10 I was thinking that I was really in a bad position...

A:
The game does look a bit tough for black now. white has created a huge framework,
and black has to invade somewhere. If it were white's turn, what do you think
the perfect place to play would be?];B[dg]TR[cd]C[plim : so I invaded white potential territory

A: It will be though for black no matter where the invasion is made, but I feel C16 is the best spot .]
;W[ch];B[hd];W[cc]C[A:
I can't really pretend to know what to do now. The concept that I would try
as black is to use contact moves against the strong white stones to the left,
and then defend/attack using the white stones to the right.]

;B[fl];W[fi]C[A:
Honestly, the moves at C11 and C9 were interesting, but they just do not
work in this case. White is out into the center and black has two new groups.
The group at D8 is not really that weak, but the group at the top is.]
;B[qq]C[plim : i was aiming at J 11
and was also trying to build a moyo in the center

A: Black must defend the group at the top!
F13 makes a strong shape, but H14 could also be ok I think.]
;W[rq];B[fo];W[ge]C[A: A good move, makes things easier for white.]

Now that P2 is in place black has an interesting opportunity at the bottom.
Can you figure it out? (variation)]

;W[mf];B[ll];W[og];B[nf];W[ng];B[qg];W[ji]C[plim : now white has also territory in the center ... it's bad for me

A:
The game is fairly close,  but I think white secured territory at the top
and center more easily because the black group at the top was weak. This
is the end of my comments.];B[jh];W[kh];B[if];W[ie];B[kg];W[jf]
