Yes, but it would be even better if there is no weak side.]

This is a good move. You only play an pincer if it is an attack and an extension.]
;W[cn];B[eq]C[I don't like this, but I didn't know of a better one :/

e5 instead is the common answer. The idea is to create two
weak w groups.];W[cp];B[cq];W[bp];B[fp]C[I think the outcome was quite good there.

Yes, it is.];W[qq];B[pq];W[cf];B[ci]C[If you have no plan to continue play ordenary moves like 
f16 or f17. IMHO is a pincer not appropriate here. b controlls
the upper side its would be a good idea to reinforce it. 
It looks like you wount give w any territory. It suffice if you have more territory at the  end of the game. If you play inside every w moyo to forestall any w territory you will create to many weak groups. Stronger player will rip you apart and
make more territory in other areas while attacking you weak groups.]
;W[fc];B[ce]C[He did the same and again and didn't know what to do.

Same answer: e15 is standard, f16 is possible too.]

Endgame was good.

The bigest mistake in the game ws missing the cut.
It would be large territorily and would bring grief to the
w group.

Some points to improve your playing style:

1. Dont create to many weak groups of your own.
In particular dont answer every corner approach with a
pincer.

2. Study life and death to attack groups more specific.

3. If your in doubt where to play: think, make a plan
and dont continue untill you have one. If you cant find 
something better go for territory. Your perplexity
is a sign that this is a good point to work on your skills,
you can count territory, look for weak groups to hunt, invasiation points and so on. Im sure you will have a good idea if you think  through.

I hope this will help you. Good luck for your further games
