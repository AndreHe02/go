C[this is a game i thought i played well but i also really should have lost this probably. without the big kill at the end i could have resigned. so i would like to know how not to get myself into such dire straights in the first place.

****

This is my first time commenting a GTL game. I hope my comments are helpful.

Please keep in mind that I am only 3k* on IGS. Some of my suggestions may be incorrect, or not as strong as some other plays. Some of your questions are a bit hard for me to answer. I have tried to indicate when I was fairly unsure.

I felt more sure of my comments as the game went on as they related to more tactical issues.

Good luck with your Go playing!

_Dave];B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[dk];B[co]C[maybe just k4 instead? or any of the big points...
this move was mainly aimed at making his stones not work together, but i'm not sure if that is the most effective plan here.

********
K4 or j4 is better. Extension from the shimari is a big opening move. Better to make it or check it than make other big opening moves.

Your goal is laudible, but your stone is also not working with your stones. If white had attacked from on top, the rightward influence would have countered your shimari very well indeed.

See variation.]

(;B[kd]C[This extension is too small at this time. Help the bottom two stones at E3 (this results in a fight, but generally this formation is favorable to black) or make some other big opening move.]
;W[ic]C[This is big, but I think I would prefer to finish the joseki at the bottom at f3 or e4. This puts a lot of pressure on the two stones and avoids the pressure of E3. There is a reason this is Joseki...

White could make this big move here sometime soon after...]
;B[cl]C[i can't decide if this move is terribly urgent right now or not, i felt uncomfortable without a base though.

*****

You should play through E3 as mentioned before. This helps White too much in the living process]
;W[ck];B[bl];W[bk];B[gc]C[am i strong enough localy to get away with this?

****

I am not sure this is a good idea. This will help White secure the left territory, and will allow him to gut your upper right.  Its not clear what your goal is here (you cannot kill him, or you shouldn't be able too.)]

(;W[hd];B[gd];W[cg]C[These two moves are poor on white's part. The diagonal strengthens your  stones and c 13 is over cautious, leaving the two white stones in a bad situation.]
;B[he]C[Hane here a bit aggressive. probably would prefer one space jump. Remember you're not trying to kill, just gain power in sente.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[if];B[ig]C[*Way* too aggressive here. He could cut you to pieces at G15 or H13 once the white group is in a little less danger.]
;W[kf];B[nf]C[You are right to be concerned about the space between L16 and O16, but this is not correct. See variation.]

(;W[me];B[md]C[This garnered white nothing. Helped you.];W[ne]
;B[oe];W[of];B[le];W[mf];B[lf];W[mg];B[lg];W[jg];B[ih];W[kh]
;B[lh];W[ki];B[li];W[ni];B[jp]C[i finally take the huge point

****
Ironically, at this point you could have afforded to do L10 + perhaps more forcing moves in this area before garnering the big point.

Your Black wall to the left of the weak white group is also still dangerously vulnerable to cutting.]
;W[hp]C[Its good white made a move down here, but it needs to be at G3 or G4. This is too far.]
;B[mp];W[ql]C[This the wrong direction for white. He must help his troubled group. K10 would suffice.

White is too worried about Black's territory.];B[fq]C[:)

****

Right, see previous notes.];W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq]C[While this sequence does garner big profits for black, B must be careful his left stones do not get taken..

Also some Aji for white is left at J3.];W[ij];B[jh];W[kg];B[ji]
;W[kj];B[jj]
(;W[lj]C[White should have haned here. See variation.];B[ik]
;W[hj];B[gg];W[db]C[Good move by white];B[ec];W[dc];B[eb];W[fe]
;B[ge];W[om]C[Black cut at e4 more urgent];B[mm];W[pe];B[od]
;W[kb];B[mb];W[lc];B[ld];W[mc];B[nc];W[lb];B[nb]C[Moves 84 and 85 are both small]
;W[ml];B[rc];W[gm]C[White should connect at E4. This is still too vulnerable, the two stones in the corner especially.

White left some bad aji ignoring s17. That will be profitable in sente for black]
;B[ee];W[de];B[ef];W[eh];B[lm]C[so at this point i am behind by a bit but i couldn't think of anyway to make it up..

***

Perhaps I am miscounting but I don't see black as behind. I've got about 30 for the right hand side for w, 40 on the left.
The corner for white will not amount to much.


Black's bottom area is easily  45 points, the top right around 15. While that puts black behind a little, black has many possible big moves (like the cut at e4, R15, sente pushing at h9 leading to a potentially vicious attack on g4 group, etc.)]

;W[qp];B[pp];W[rq];B[qq];W[sp];B[rr];W[qp];B[mi]C[NIce move by black here]
;W[nh];B[mj];W[lk];B[nk];W[nl];B[ok]C[This is how the difference is made up.]
;W[nj];B[mk];W[pj];B[re]C[m8 of course...in my head he had played that...

****

This is still quite profitable for Black. Trying to kill a group that big is always risky. However, yes you probably could have killed by cutting at M8.]
;W[ll];B[rf];W[rg];B[ol];W[nm];B[mn]C[L7 works better than this.]
;W[sf];B[bp];W[bq];B[bo];W[dp];B[ep]C[Finally....but only after w strengthened his positition]
;W[eq];B[eo];W[iq];B[ip];W[go]C[This white move is such bad shape it pains me to see it. H6 is correct.]
;B[ir];W[fr];B[gn]C[This was a waste of a move. Peep at H6 instead works on building territory. This  just helps white.]
;W[hn];B[fn];W[im];B[hr];W[fm]C[You should attack the corner, and then deal with your group's problem, if it still exists. See variation.]

C[Nice play here by white];B[jo];W[il];B[fi];W[fh];B[gh];W[gi]
C[A costly, necessary sacrifice for Black];B[gj];W[hi];B[hh]
;W[fj];B[ei];W[di];B[pk];W[qk];B[qe];W[pf];B[gr]C[hane at A3 is bigger. Also could result in good attack on group.]
;W[es];B[cr]C[i'm pretty sure w is alive here, figgured i'd play here and see if he would make a mistake.

B2 is better.  Scarier.];W[br];B[dr];W[er];B[aq];W[ar];B[bs]
