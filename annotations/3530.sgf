C[I played this game on the Internet and felt Ireally lost in the opening



as a strong 2k, I cannot see much more than you, but I hope these comments help a bit.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[cn];W[fp];B[ci]SQ[fq]C[I have been trying the mini-chinese recently. I think it is usual for white to play at themarked point, but I don't understand to well what difference this makes.

Me either, I speculate that when W6 is on the 4th line  it emphasizes to develop the right side and is prepared to compromise for the corner. When on the 3d line, then it protects the corner and prepares for an invasion around c8.]

(;W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc]LB[pj:A]C[


I think W10 at A is bigger, and B11 makes W10 good. B could have chosen a pincer joseki instead of the R17 corner move.]
;W[qi];B[nq]SQ[hq][kq]LB[jc:B]C[Perhaps this move is a mistake, i hoped to establish a low but solid base on the lower side as shown. I think perhaps I should play at the miai point of these. It would also be possible to make a move like B. I am not sure which is the best idea.

Playing at B or one line higher at K17 should be good enough to keep your position in the upper side strong and the pace of the game. If W chooses to protect the lower side, e.g. at K3, then you still have room enough for an invasion around R6, R9, O3, R3, etc..]
;W[lq]LB[lp:A]C[my opponent pincers. Maybe I should attack to his]

(;B[qq]C[I chose to take the corner






your follow-up seems natural, but you should be prepared to deal against W's wall]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[nr];W[mo]
(;B[hq]SQ[jq]LB[ed:B][de:A][og:C][oi:D]C[I think this move was really bad, it destroys some of the aji at K3. HoweverI think I should be developing my own position, not invading. I have marked points A-D as alternatives I thought of.



The big point for B is still K16. Asides, the right side is more urgent to invade]
;W[gr]C[




but I think W22 answering from the corner side makes B21 a good move...]
;B[pl]C[I was still focused on invading





B21-23, that combination seems to me unreasonable. You are just asking for trouble.]
;W[de]LB[cd:B][fd:A][cg:C]C[I was not sure how to answer. Both A and C seemed  a little soft, maybe B is better.

 

After W24, black A is the popular move for the chinese fuseki. B is also possible.]

(;B[ce]C[I think I chose this because it would take territory,



this way you let W to keep your stronger position low and his wall will have an effect on the right corner...]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[ec];B[cf]LB[eb:A][cc:B]C[The small Nadare will not work. I considered also the variations A and B, but I felt that C14 is actually simpler here. It works well with the other stones.]
;W[db];B[cc];W[lc]C[I didn't like white's move here. It seems very jealous, perhaps I should pincer at oncebecause my corner surely cannot be killed



I think W32 is good, it relates the influence 4 stones on the left side and the threat of the slide at O18. On the other side, the 4 stones are not that strong either, as they can be cut at E16.]

(;B[ic]C[

so this move does not seem very effective to me. I think it could be better to attack one line closer, taking advanage of the weakness of W's 4 stones]
;W[nb]C[


this is painful];B[ob]C[


this makes bad shape, at least Q18 is better];W[oc];B[pb];W[nc]
;B[rc]C[



B35-39 are all bad, now W is  strong on both sides. B33 proved to be useless.]

you are pushing from behind,];W[oi]CR[pl][on]C[

this is severe because its attacking the marked stones at a large scale]
;B[ed];W[fd];B[ee];W[fe];B[ef]CR[pl][on]LB[nl:A]C[W could seal B's marked stones playing at A.]
;W[md]C[


this is small];B[nk]SQ[ic][hq]C[I have 2 wasted stones, so I think already I am behind a move





B55 is just in time..];W[mi];B[re]C[


small];W[rf];B[sd]LB[lk:A]C[if you choose to live small in the corner, you seal your defeat.
W's cap at A is severe];W[ie]LB[lk:A]C[this is big, although not as big as A]
;B[je]C[this is a bit desperate, but I felt I had try to get something




the chances are very difficult to come out playing there. I thing this attempt is unreasonable.]

huge];B[id];W[jc];B[if];W[he];B[ih]C[my plan to eat some stones is much too small. I neeed more points than this, but I think I am already lost here.




I leave the comments here too.

I believe the game turned into a big mess because you invaded too early in the game and left your stones too weak and without giving any chance to settle your position.

That way, you allowed W to keep easily the lead of the game. 
I wish you lots success in your next games.
