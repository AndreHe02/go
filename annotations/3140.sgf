C[alaric: Hello, i'm alaric, I'll be reviewing your game today.  All insites at a 16kyu level, so take it with a grain of salt.

alarics: Here's some things to keep in mind concerning this game:

1) Do not create weak groups, especially early.  Every time you leave a group unsettled you still owe a move in that area.  If your opponent gets there first you generally still owe that move (or more) but you don't get the benefit you would have had if you had settled earlier.   When looking for moves early you should first look to see if you have any weak groups, and if so, settle them.  Second look to see if your opponent has any weak groups, and if so attack them.  Third look for big points left on the board.  Note that you don't need to kill a group to gain from attacking it.  While black didn't do a great job of it watch how he can map out large moyo in the center of the board while cutting off your weak group in the lower right.

2) You played passively when black invaded deep.  It looks like at least three times black overplayed his invading stones, but you gave ground and played defensively.  You don't need to fear a single stone.  If he pushes to far cut him off from his base.  If not for the big mistake on the left, this probably would have been the 15 points or so that decided the game. 

3) Don't sacrifice the army for a single man.  Late in the game you connect to save a small group, but you let black break into your huge moyo, destroying all the territory you had.  A single stone there would have made a 60 point difference in the score.

4) Invade while there's still a chance for success.  You could have invaded blacks large bottom moyo midway through the game, but instead you waited until he had already sealed it up.  At that point it was too late and the game was nearly over.]
;B[dp]C[ATcHoUm [26k?\]: bonjour

PR  When this game finished i thought that the main reason for my loss was my inability to keep alive a ' live grp on the LHS. However, now that i have reviewed it myself i can see that this was just a contributory factor, it made the final score worse but was probably not the root cause of failure.
Indeed the seeds of my downfall could possibly be present at move 12, where i attacked as opposed to going for a guaranteed safe base around K3. So i think my strategy may have been wrong, as much as the many mistakes in tactics that the reviewer will find.   Ash.]
;W[pd]C[ATcHoUm [26k?\]: bonne partie];B[pp]C[Ash [24k\]: good morning from derby england
ATcHoUm [26k?\]: hi
ATcHoUm [26k?\]: good game];W[dd]C[alaric: Two stars (nirensei) opening from both sides.  This is a very common opening at this level.  If you haven't already studied the theory behind it I would suggest reading a beginners fuseki book.  This can help you solidify what you are attempting to accomplish in the opening stages of the game.]
;B[qf]C[Ash [24k\]: thnx et vous!];W[nd];B[rd];W[cn]LB[qc:A]
[qi:B]C[alaric: It would be better to not leave the weak white group in the top right, a common joseki here would be A,B, then you can play this without having to worry for your group as much (when you play O16 instead of O17 you leave your flank open so you may want to close that off with another move such as L17 or K16).]
;B[cp]C[alaric: Unorthodox and slow, poor play by black.];W[dj]
C[alaric: I'm not sure what the best response to C4 is, but this looks good.]
;B[qj]C[alaric: Black could have attacked the weak white group with good effect.]
;W[nq]C[i was tempted to play  k3 instead of this but have been told that i am not forcing enough, hence O3

alaric: I originally thought that this was a better move than k3 here, but the pincer works so well here that it isn't advisable.  So K3 or K16 seem the two best plays here.  While white is usually disadvantaged in an influence vs influence game, blacks slow play negates his advantage of going first.]
;B[lq];W[qn]LB[no:B][lp:C][qq:A]C[i must learn these 4,4 attacks better. With R10 being in place perhaps O5 or R3 would have been better

alaric: Yes, the 4-4 openings are not extremely complex, they are very common, and if you are going to open nirensei you need to learn them.  The popular joseki moves here are A and B.  A is often perfered, but that would give black a nice wall facing his strong group, which you don't want to give him, so B is probably the best move here.  C is also played, but i'm less familiar with it.]
;B[qq]C[alaric: Slow move by black, I like O4 here.];W[oo]C[i played this because i have seen it played against me..with success!

alaric: You've probably seen this before when white double approaches blacks corner because black tenuki'd after the original knights move, then it is more common.  In that case this would be exceptable, but with the pincher and the strong black groups to both sides all you are doing is asking yourself to get cut, and you are going to have to fight for either group to survive.  This corner is one of the reasons you lost, since black could lay out large moyo while sealing you in.]
;B[op];W[np]C[not sure here..q5 instead?

alaric: This begs to be cut at P5 and is therefore not good.  Q5 looks much better to me.]
;B[no];W[nn];B[mo];W[mn]C[the intent was to sacrifice O3grp for an outside wall but it did not really happen

alaric: This is probably better played at R5 to create eye space and connect.  If black was wanting a fight he could push at Q5 and this turns ugly.  Also, advancing on this line encourages black to gain 5th line territory.  You may have heard "Do not push down on the 4th line", well here you are pushing down on the 5th.]
;B[lo];W[om]C[alaric: Again, probably better played at Q5, because a black stone there would hurt.]
;B[nj]C[alaric: another slow move by black, better either to push at Q5, undercut the white base at R8, or attempt to close white in with M6 (roughly in my order of preference).  If black can force white to flee to the center, and take 5th line territory while doing it, then end in sente so he can play the loose invasion at J17 the game will be hard for white to win.]
;W[jd]C[alaric: This is big, but you must play the urgent play before the big play, your white group could be in serious trouble.]
;B[of]SQ[nd][pd]C[alaric: Slow again, maybe attempting to offset some of whites influence, but this doesn't seem to do much there, it could also be trying to put pressure on the marked stones, but it doesn't do that well either.]
;W[mf]C[i had visions of building a framework around top LHC

alaric: This is at the joint of two opposing moyo's, a good place to play.]
;B[kl]C[alaric: better if he would assault the white base position first, then cut it off.]
;W[jj]C[so loose framework in place but now must see to eye space for p7 grp. this i managed so a slight success

alaric: neither your opponent or yourself puts much urgency it the bottom right white group, and instead you concentrate on center influence.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[dm];W[cm];B[dn];W[fk]C[framework again tho i was concious of holes at g16 and d13

alaric: this better played at G10, here there is a hole at H9 that needs filled, although this does put greater pressure on black to respond.]
;B[kh]C[alaric: this looks like an overplay to me.  You could go M11 and aim to kill the invader.]
;W[jh]C[alaric: the passive response here puts you behind by 5-10 points, presuming the white group lives.]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[fl];W[gc]C[filling a hole but perhaps h9 instead?

alaric: poor timing, if the current lines hold you lose, better to try something a bit more aggressive, like pushing into blacks territory at G8 or H8.  Alternatively you may be able to pull off an invasion around J6 with the threat to connect to the white group on the right (of course that group isn't alive yet, so that might not be the best).]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[hk];W[gi]C[alaric: H10 looks better here.];B[ld]
;W[lc];B[me];W[md]C[at this stage i thought i was losing and wondered about invading h4 area..but how?

alaric: After H9, an invasion would be difficult.];B[le];W[po]
C[eye space building

alaric: You've needed this for awhile.];B[ro]C[alaric: Better at R8.]
;W[rn];B[qo];W[pm];B[kj];W[lm]C[i was still thinking of eye space need but h10 better? aiming to protect moyo

alaric: H10 doesn't give you alot here.  I think this is better at R8.]
;B[ln]C[ATcHoUm [26k?\]: sorry];W[ll]C[ATcHoUm [26k?\]: tks]
;B[km];W[lk];B[nl]C[which is where my last stone should have gone:-(

alaric: agreed.];W[mm]C[alaric: I would prefer you make life here with R8. If your group dies those three stones don't really help, and if black plays N7 in response you can play S10, which is worth as much as what you lose.]
;B[kk];W[ql]C[again looking to eye space to protect grp];B[ii]
C[this move resulted in the destruction of my area and was fundamental in meing losing..but i make many other mistakes as well

alaric: This move is not the vital one, that comes later.]
(;W[ji];B[lj];W[ih]C[i did consider j10 instead but i am always confused about attackin on inside or outside. J10 may have isolated his J11 stone

alaric: If you think you can kill the invader, play to the outside, otherwise, play to the inside.  J10 looks good here.]
;B[hi];W[hh];B[gj];W[fi];B[fj]
(;W[ek]C[mistake i think.   e10 may have been better

alaric: yes.  don't get preoccupied with saving a single stone.]
;B[ej];W[dk]C[another mistake, e11 instead?

alaric: this mistake is huge, and what allows black to decimate your top left territory.]
;B[ei];W[ij];B[hj];W[fh];B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[ch];B[df];W[dc]
C[i wanted to defend the corner so d17 i thought better than c16

alaric: I prefer C16 because it stops black from pushing in on that side.]
;B[cf];W[el]C[alaric: you really need to stop the bleeding in the upper left.  This is a sente move, but not worth much, better to play something like F14 that attempts to contain the damage of blacks attack.]
;B[fm];W[em];B[en];W[ki];B[li]C[i suspect that the game is now already lost as my shape has gone and his h6 area dominates

alaric: correct.];W[kg];B[lg];W[lh];B[mh];W[lf];B[kh];W[ke]
;B[mg];W[ne]C[made me happier for a moment

alaric: this is worth 8 points in gote, moves in the upper left may be worth more than that.  Maybe WE13, BD13, WE14?]
;B[ge]C[unsure how best to respond to this.i opted to protect upper side

alaric: this looks like an overplay, F14 to cut.];W[hd]C[alaric: too passive, when fighting off an invasion the key is to put pressure on the invading stones, which are usually very lonely.  Generally an invading stone is still much weaker than the surrounding enemy, regardess of the gaps and aji.]
;B[gg];W[he]C[i just missed g12 :-(

alaric: it happens.];B[gh];W[gd];B[fe];W[fd];B[bd];W[bc];B[cd]
;W[cc];B[bh];W[bi];B[bg];W[bo];B[bp];W[co];B[qb]C[alaric: R17 seems much better here.]
;W[pb];B[rk]C[alaric: Too late to attack white now, he is already alive.]
;W[rl];B[nm];W[on];B[sk];W[sl]C[the q7 grp was now alive and i felyt that b9 grp was safe BUT i keep missing the need to play at Critical Points, and hence lose big areas..just watch :-(]
;B[sn];W[sm];B[so];W[pl]C[possibly not necessary but it cemented eye space

alaric: R7 and S7 are maia, this stone is unnecessary.  Of course if you can't read out if a group is unconditionally alive, better to be safe.]
;B[ok];W[qk];B[rj];W[qc]C[alaric: good, black should not have ignored your contact play]
;B[rb];W[rc];B[sc];W[qd];B[re];W[qa];B[ra];W[pa]C[the last 50 moves have just firmed up boundaries..i have done nothing to change course of game

alaric: that's what you expect out of end game, the game is mostly finished by the time you start to solidify lines.]
;B[sb];W[nf];B[og];W[ng];B[nh];W[oe];B[pe];W[qe];B[pf];W[hg]
;B[gf]
(;W[hf]C[small scale space protection. i wondered about s14 but i did not think it worked

alaric: S14 looks inviting, but it doesn't work as far as I can tell, unless black makes a mistake.  This move, though, is unnecessary.  Put a black stone in it's place, does that look dangerous?  Not really, you can always play J14 if black plays H14.]
;B[ik];W[jk];B[jl];W[do];B[eo];W[hq]C[So, i made a desperate invasion with possible idea of using ajii of O3. I reasoned that worse could happen was that i would die, but it would not change total score. And if i lived, then ??
Matter of etiquette. In positions such as this is it more honourable to resign than play on?  I am new to this game

alaric: I'm not sure on honorableness and ettiquette, but this kind of invasion is quite common at this level of play.  You see it less as you advance ranks because 1) if there was an invasion possibility it would have been played earlier, and 2) If you need your opponent to make a mistake for it to succeed then it won't work once it becomes common for your opponent not to make those kind of mistakes.

From a matter of studying the game, it is often better simply to resign when you are losing poorly.  You simply don't learn much by trying wild invasions, or playing endgame when you are losing by 60.  Better to spend that time playing a second game, or reviewing why you lost this game.  There is a go proverb "Lose your first 100 games quickly".]
;B[fq];W[kq];B[kr];W[lr]C[alaric: You have a good sense of how to invade, this would be much more successful before black had closed off the territory.]
;B[kp];W[mq]C[alaric: You need to play K3 here, if black ponnuki's the invasion is over.]
;B[lp]
(;W[mr]C[i could not see a way to live];B[jq]C[alaric: Could have done this last move, but once done the invasion is dead.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[pr];B[or];W[os];B[qr];W[ps];B[ns];W[ap]C[so back to small point play

alaric: there are no big points left.];B[aq];W[ao];B[bq];W[ee]
;B[ef];W[de];B[ce];W[ad];B[ae];W[ac]TR[cg][gk][mk][pk]C[alaric: no reason to play small gote moves when there are sente moves remaining.]
;B[gk];W[cg];B[dg]C[At this stage i saw no threat to c7 grp but was wary of c9/10 cutting points. i also had views on b12/13]
;W[cj]C[alaric: probably better at C9, since that links your low liberty group with a more solid group with lots of liberties.]
;B[ai]C[alaric: alarm bells should be going off now, your white group is down to two liberties, you need to read this out fully before playing.]
;W[aj];B[ah];W[pk]C[alaric: B9 here and the group is alive.]
;B[bk]C[BANG!!!!!!!!!!!!  now lost at what to do. I spent about 3 minutes wondering and any help would be appreciated

alaric: this is really rough.  As far as I can tell you made the best move left.  The bottom group cannot live without more space, so you would need to kill the invading stone without losing any of your stones, which just doesn't seem possible.]

(;W[bf]C[my variation is the best i can see in hindsight];B[ck]
;W[ag];B[bl];W[bm]C[pointless as liberty count is against me]
;B[am];W[ak];B[an];W[be];B[bn]C[alaric: unnecessary at this time, better to play a sente move.]
;W[bj];B[al];W[lh]C[alaric: This ko is meaningless, there are playson the board worth more than the ko.  Best for black to ignore and simply take the remaining points.]

Ash [24k\]: well played!
ATcHoUm [26k?\]: thks

alaric: The only suggested areas of study I have for your are 4-4 point joseki, and studying life and death problems never hurts.  In general you see what you did wrong, so it's just a matter of applying that in your next game.  The thing I want to reiterate though is, don't make weak groups early.  Often in go the first person to make a weak group loses.  There is a reason joseki are joseki, because non-joseki moves generally leave a weakness, or fail to take advantage of a situation.  Learning joseki is important, but understanding why those moves have become joseki is even more important.  If black had aggresively attacked in the top right and middle right the situation could have actually been much worse.  Though in general you play very well, shore up a couple of weak points and you are easily a couple of stones better than your current rank.]
