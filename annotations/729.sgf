C[Hi, and thanks for for reviewing my game.   This game is against someone I've played several games against. We're generally pretty evenly matched, but with very different playing styles as well as different strengths and weaknesses. In most of our games, he gets a pretty huge lead in the opening/midgame and I find lots of places where he can be invaded, winning or at least making the game much closer in the last third of the game by winning more local battles.

I think that in some ways, this game shows that we're learning from each other. I say this because in this game, he never got as big a lead as he has in most of our earlier games and I found his territories better defended aginst the little invasions that I have usually been able to make in the past.

I've gone through the game and commented in spots that I can see I need help and advice, but I'm sure you'll see many more than I did.

If you have time to make comments for both sides, I will send a copy of the commented game to my opponent when I receive it. If you don't have time, that's ok too, he's not expecting anything at this point.

This will be my first time submitting a game to the Go Teaching Ladder, so I'm open to input on how I should better prepare my game for submission such as, how to better comment my game and whatever else I should do before sending in a game.

Thanks again,

Russ

Berni:
To answer the last question first (my oppinion):
* Put questions, where you were unsure how to play, or where you don't understand, what's going on.
* Add your thoughts at places, where you think, that the moves where important decissions. (This are normally the moves you thought long about, either while playing or while going over the game later.) This helps to correct your thoughts, when necessary.
* If not really important, don't add variations. It is very difficult, to distinguish between your an my variations. (e.g. widely branched variations, where I agree with some moves and would like to add some own moves)

There is a lot of material in this game, but the most important part is attack/defense in the middlegame where both of you made a lot of mistakes. Most of my comments will deal with this issue.

But I've also added a lot of comments on other moves, whenever I think, that it is easy to explain.

Normally, when reviewing a game, I try to figure out, what was the loosing move. But in this game, it was impossible to find. You two manage to make about equal number of mistakes ;-) So you reached the endgame with almost equal chances.

As this implies, that you lost in the endgame, I'll show you there, where the important spots are, and what kind of moves you should get rid of.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[cd];W[pp];B[ec];W[cj]LB[fq:A]MA[pp]C[Berni:
This move is not bad, but I prefer A(F3), because A and the marked stone(Q4) work together, while c10 is lonely.]
;B[cm]LB[nq:A][jp:B][cl:C][ch:D][cn:E]MA[dp]C[Russ:
I suspect that this was my first mistake. c12 looks much better to me now.

Berni:
When playing from below, C(C8) is the correct move, as this move attacks the white stone. Also, the large knights moves from a 4x4-stone is difficult to handle.

When playing D(12) white will respond with E(C6) which weekens the marked stone(D4).

As you can't tell now, which of those is better, you shouldn't play either of them. (This concept is called miai.)

I'd play at A(O3) or B(K4). These moves attack C10 on a large scale, and also strengthen the marked stone, so white will find it difficult too, which side to extend.]
;W[cg];B[nq]C[Berni:
Good move.];W[pn];B[kp]LB[jp:A][fq:B][lq:C][qq:D][pr:E][kq:F]
C[Berni:
Ooops. Should be A(K4). When white later invades at B(F3), A is already a pincer, while L4 is not. This means, that with A you can attack a white invasion at B much stronger.

You don't have to fear an invasion at C(M3), as D(R3) is still unoccupied and you can live there easily.

When you exchange E(Q2) for D(R3), F(L3) is the correct extension, because this time, you can't live in the corner.]
;W[jc]LB[jd:A]MA[pn][pd]C[Berni:
I'd prefere A(K16), because this stone works better with the marked stones (Q16, Q6) and also helps the two white stones at the left side.

The marked stones are "high" (4th line) which means, that they want to build up influence and to work together. K17 is "low" (3rd line) which means that it wants to build territory, which is contradictory to the meaning of the two marked stones.]
;B[qf];W[qh]C[Berni:
Correct choice. Works well with the two stones at the bottom.]
;B[of];W[nd]
(;B[mf]C[Berni:
No, no, no! Don't play such moves again!

See variation for the joseki. This joseki is worth remembering.]
;W[oh]C[Russ:
Here I started to feel like I was in trouble, that my 3 stones in the upper left needed help.

Berni:
(Probably you mean "right" instead of "left".)
This is, why your last move was so bad.

Now you have a week group on the board, while whites groups are all strong. This is something, that should never occur. Normally the number of week groups of every colour should be equal.

With this move, white stabilizes his position, while attacking black severely. It is now impossible, to get enough room for eyes at the edge, so you'll have to run out with those stones. But white will manage to keep you running and securing territory at the top and at the right side, while you only put stones on neutral spots.]

(;B[qc]C[Berni:
This isn't help for your three stones. Contrary, it helps white to attack them. (I'll explain later.)

See variation for an alternativ.];W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[rd];W[re]
;B[rc];W[qe]LB[rf:A]C[Berni:
A(S14) is better here, because white cannot force there. Also, A would weeken blacks stones.]
;B[rf];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[ra]LB[ob:A]C[Berni:
What about A(P18)? As far as I can see, black lives and get's some more points.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[sb]C[Berni:
It's natural, that one lives in gote, when invading. But this also means, that white can continue to attack the four stones. This is the reason, why the 3x3-invasion earlier is bad. The wall white get's also weekens the black stones. They can't get even one eye at the edge now.]

(;W[fq]C[Berni:
Strategically it is much better to attack the four black stones, to get more strength, and to invade after this attack. (You should be able to keep sente). The additional strength will support the invasion.

See variation.]
(;B[hp]LB[eq:A][hq:B][nh:C]C[Berni:
Now you can see, that L4 is missplaced. With L4 at K4 you could have played at A(E3) (see variation).

B(H3) makes the right stones stronger and makes it more difficult for white to get a base.

As the last white move was a mistake, you should start to think about how to punish him. My plan would be to get a wall on the outside in sente, and than to play the moves shown earlier, starting with C(O12).]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fr]MA[cm]LB[do:A]
C[Berni:
Here this move is not a good idea. The difference to the similar move at the upper right is, that the marked stone (C7) does not protect the cut at A(D5).

See variation of next move.

Also black is not yet connected to the right, because H4 is on the 4th line.]

(;W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[ap]C[Berni:
As far as I can see, this move is unnecessary. White is alive without it.]
;B[hd]LB[bh:A]C[Berni:
I don't understand this move. It does not attack anything, it does not take territory (h17 would be the place), it does not strengthen a weak group (the two stones at the top left are strong, the four stones at the right don't get help.)

Here white gives you a chance to turn the game arround: With the strong wall at the bottom your goal shouldbe to connect to the bottom with your four stones (while giving white some territory at the right side). After that you can start to attack the two white stones at the left (starting with A(B12)).]
;W[je]C[Berni:
As you can see, the black move helps white to attack the four stones at the right.]
;B[oe]C[Berni:
???];W[od];B[mh]MA[hd][je]C[Russ:
I suspect that in this little exchnge, I help my opponent more than myself.

Berni:
Yes, you help white, but you have to, to get this group out. The mistake was long ago, jumping out to N14. After the 51-52 exchange (marked stones) it is almost impossible to sacrifice those stones, so you have to.]
;W[ni];B[mi];W[nj];B[ih]LB[lk:A]C[Berni:
A(M9) is better.];W[me];B[nh];W[lf];B[mg];W[mj];B[kh]LB[lj:A]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[kk];B[nn]LB[il:A]C[Berni:
A(J8) connects and also white should start getting cold feet because of his two stones at the left.]

Getting a base with A(B15) is better.];B[fn]LB[em:A]C[Berni:

;W[ll];B[lm];W[km];B[jl];W[mm];B[ln];W[fg];B[hf]C[Berni:
This move is on neutral area. Both black groups are already alive, both white groups are already alive, so this move is almost like passing.

Maybe, this would have been the proper time to invade the bottom right corner.]
;W[hb];B[hc];W[ib];B[gb];W[pq]C[Russ:
I really wanted the r3 spot.   I probably should have played there last move instead of g18, right?

Berni:
Your last move is also very big.];B[fj];W[ei];B[ej];W[ck];B[fi]

I've marked the tree big points with A,B and C (P2, A10 and S12). You should get a feeling, that this are the areas, where big points are.

A: Even, when white can't play at O2, this situation is 6 points double sente. Here this move is still larger, because white can paly O2.

B: About 6 points in sente. This move is especially interesting, because a black stone at A7/A8 might lead to a ko/seki in the corner.

C: Here, the situation is difficult. (The monkey-jump at T11) does not work, because of the cut at D(Q14)). With C the cut still remains, but if white cuts, black can push through the hole at E(Q12). In this situation it is necessery to carefully read the situation out.

When counting territories, I got a lead of 16.5 points for white (incl. komi, without your last stone) but it is blacks turn, and black has a lot of good sente moves. At the end of the variation, which shows, how the game probably should continue I've counted again.]

This is a so called "flower viewing ko" for white:

If white wins this ko,  black can resign.
If white looses this ko, this means, that white get's a ko-thread somewhere else, or just two large gote endgame moves, which is enough, to compensate for the little local loss.

As a result: Black needs very large ko-threads while white simply can continue to play endgame moves (as ko-threads). (Of course, white can also play moves like Q13 and G11.)]
