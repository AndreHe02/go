C[Dear Reviewer,
I am white in this game and unfortunatly white lost the game. I added some questions to the sgf-file.

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt; I'm playing as 2 dan at the local club.  That means I'm not strong enough to tell you what the best moves are, but I hope I can give you ideas what to think about.
Please use an SGF editor that nicely displays variations - I recommend glGo, gGo, qgo, cgoban1 or Jago.  The KGS client, cgoban2, has some issues.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[pn]C[crux: Odd choice, the low approach is normal.]
;W[nq]LB[np:A]C[crux: A is a more typical response to the high approach.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[qo];W[rq];B[qk];W[cf]LB[nc:A]C[crux: I'd probably play A in this situation, although I'm finding it hard to explain why...]
;B[dh]
(;W[cc]TR[dp][pd]LB[dc:A][ef:C][mc:B]C[i jumped into the corner, because i thought playing twice on the second line already, like in the variation would be too early
and if he had blocked at A, I still could have jumped in at B
Was that alright or is there a better joseki to chose in this situation?

crux: I think both are probably fine.  C seems to be more common, and in the game Black gets a reasonable position on the left side.  It's not just the local context that's important, but also the relationship with the marked stones.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[fc];B[fd]C[crux: Could keep this forcing move in reserve.]
;W[gc]TR[be][dh]LB[df:A]C[he didn't play at A, so the connection of the triangled stones should not be given. Later on I wanted to use that weakness but I think i made a mistake. Maybe you could give me a point here.

crux: It's important to remember that while there's a small weakness, Black is relatively strong in this area, so a rash attempt to use the aji could backfire.  Look for indirect ways to use that stone.]
;B[dn];W[dl]LB[fp:A]C[wanted to disturb his left side

crux: I don't like this move.  Black is strong on the left side, so this stone is likely to come under attack.  Just A seems normal.]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[bq];B[fn];W[fp];B[go]LB[fl:A]C[crux: This move seems to be unnecessary at this point.  Maybe just playing at A would be alright.]
;W[gp];B[gl];W[ef]TR[cf]LB[di:A][fj:B]C[crux: This seems like an overplay.  Black is stronger here, and White already has one weak stone.  There are other ways to use the existence of the marked stone, rather than pulling it out immediately (e.g. it may help with an attachment at A or thereabouts).  Something like B may also be a plausible move.]
;B[bf]LB[cg:A]C[crux: I think A instead connects.];W[cg];B[ch]
;W[em]C[crux: Do you need this move now?];B[en];W[fj];B[fh]
;W[hj];B[bg];W[ei];B[eh]LB[ch:A][en:B][nc:C][qf:D]C[what is bigger now, cut A and B or play C?

crux: I don't really see an easy way for A and B to connect.  On the other hand, neither black group is in immediate danger, so they don't need to connect.  Your group is still a little weak; defending it may keep you out of trouble but a purely defensive move may be a little slow.  As for C, the upper side doesn't have much potential for growth, so you could consider a play at D as well.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jd];B[ck]
(;W[dk]LB[cl:A]C[crux: This is a little passive.  What's wrong with A?  See variations - I think White can either connect or live.]
;B[cl];W[cj];B[bj];W[gh]LB[ii:A][jj:B]C[crux: A bit crude to attach to a strong group like this.  I think A or B are better choices.]
;B[gg];W[hh];B[dm];W[qc]TR[qf]LB[ob:B][pc:C][qd:A]C[I now the sequence resulting from black A, but could you show me the continuation of black b or black c?

crux: I'm not very familiar with the possibilities in this situation either.  I think Black can kill if he really tries, but not without giving White moves on the outside, or Black can simply take the outside and let White live small.  I'm including a few variations I've found, which may or may not be appropriate in this situation.
Often, the 3-3 invasion in a situation such as this is used as a means of getting stones in place elsewhere, and not directly intended to live in the corner.]

(;B[ob]
(;W[od]C[crux: Helping Black to eliminate his weaknesses.]
(;B[pc];W[pe]C[crux: Again.];B[qe];W[nb];B[qd]LB[pe:A]C[didnt want to make him that solid, nor did i know what else i should do

crux: Don't play moves that you don't need, such as the marked stone.  An unnecessary move is a bad move.]
;W[qi]SQ[pn][qk][qo][qp]LB[qh:A]C[so i tried to put a bit pressure on the marked group

crux: You can't put pressure on a solid group with a weak stone.  Black is now enormously strong in the top right - before that, a move at A might have threatened something in the corner, but now it's a bit late.]
;B[pi];W[ph];B[qh]LB[pj:A]C[luckily he cut, i would not have known what to do if he simply had drawn back at A ^^']
;W[pj];B[oi];W[qj];B[pk];W[oj];B[pg]
(;W[ni]LB[qh:A]C[crux: There may be better ways of using the aji in the marked stone.  See variations.]
;B[oh];W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[om];W[nm];B[nn];W[oo]LB[mn:A]C[crux: Careful, you do not need this move and it helps your opponent - the hane at A is now less likely to be useful for you.]
;B[on];W[jq];B[mg];W[lh];B[hg]C[crux: This move doesn't do much for Black.  It just gives White a chance to reinforce.  Black is just adding a stone to an already strong group.]
;W[ig];B[le];W[lc];B[ih];W[if];B[ji];W[jj];B[jg];W[ii];B[jh]
C[i wanted to capture those 4 stones, but somehow i messed it up]

(;W[lg];B[mh];W[mi];B[jf];W[je];B[lf]
(;W[of]LB[li:A]C[crux: A seems forcing.  Even if you there wasn't a capture, rescuing your stones in sente is a good plan B.]
;B[li];W[lj];B[ki];W[kj];B[ng];W[gf]C[crux: Doesn't work...]
;B[hf];W[ie];B[ge];W[he];B[ff];W[mf]C[crux: Not clear what this is supposed to achieve.  This is not a cut.]
;B[nf];W[me];B[og]C[crux: Unnecessary?];W[ld];B[kg];W[mn]C[this too was a mistake i assume

crux: What was the sequence trying to achieve, and did it work?  It does seem to have hurt your corner without giving too much compensation.]
