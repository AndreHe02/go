C[Hello, I'd like to thank you, whoever you are, for reviewing my game. I'm White. I'm in doubt of my strength and I just got the 7k rank. I'm playing a few games to get my confidence up and this was the first. The game didn't feel like it went bad but I think I was out of it.


J: First of all a word of caution: Do not take my comments as "The correct way". I'm not much stronger than you, so regard them as suggestions as to where to pay attention.

All in all I think the main problem in this game was that you created weak shapes and/or extended too far and allowed black to cut your groups. Allways try to create strong shapes/groups and only invade enemy territory if you have a plan how to live there or how to get out to safety. If you lack one of these, you create cannon fodder. When you have strong groups, it is easy to mount attacks from them or relying on them, as you don't need to worry about your back. In this game your M8 group was weak from start to finish and prevented good attacks coming from that direction. Also on the top you needed to strengthen your M17 group by two stones right in the middle of an attack. This will hardly result in a successful attack as you give your opponent two free moves to get out. Moreover, an invasion on the left side would not have been possible (at the point when you ask about 'A'), as there would not have been any place to run to. To remedy these things, you need to be able to create strong shapes that can support an attack instead of being target of one.

I hope you find the comments helpful.

-Jaakko];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[cn];W[fq]C[Is responding this way okay or should I have pincered or attacked the upper left corner. Also, would you mind explaining the difference between a low and high pincer, and when and where to use them? This subject I've been lost on for a while.

J: This is a very standard answer to black's approach. Choosing between the 3rd and 4th line depends on the surrounding stones. In this case I would also have chosen the 3rd line as it combines better with Q4 (which is high). If there was a white stone at K3, I would play high (F4), as that would create nice balance between the stones and also put more pressure on black's C6. Another reason for choosing high (F4) instead of low (F3) would be to stress attack on the black stone, but since there is no attack and no other pressing circumstances, playing low here is good choice.

Attacking on the upper left corner seems premature. I think it is better to take care of this situation first and then move on. Usually this kind of situation ends in white's sente, so you will have chance to attack the corner immediately after this play if you like. If black goes elsewhere without strengthening C6, it will be very weak and open to a profitable attack.]
;B[bp]
(;W[cr]C[J: This is not good. Too slow, too low and not so secure as C3. Also not so sente as C3.]
)
(;W[cq];B[ck];W[ed]C[Is this attack premature?

J: I feel it is a bit premature, but I'm not sure. I would probably first approach upper right corner, as there's more room over there. R14 seems like a playable option, but there's always the danger of letting black strengthen the upper side too much and make it more difficult to invade later. At this moment there's no way black could secure the upper side with one stone, so invading immediately is not necessary. It seems an OK move, though.]
;B[df];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc];B[qn]C[J: I think black should have played E15 first. That is a big sente.]
;W[ql]C[Was this a right pincer? I was surprised to see her tenuki. Would q6 have been better?

J: Pincer here is good. Low pincer is always a serious attack on the approaching (R6) stone and since you already have backup in the lower left corner, this potentially gives you a big bottom territory. Q6 would most likely give you a big bottom area, but black would probably get a big right area as a compensation. As black already has a stone in Q16, that would not leave white in a good position.

Whether a pincer this near is good, is another matter. You could have tried a slightly more distant approach also. As you see later, your R8 group ends up in a bit tight place.]
;B[on]C[J: The run begins];W[np]C[J: Here you can compare to the situation with F3. In this situation playing high is the correct choice, as (1) it puts more pressure on black's weak group and (2) it combines better with F3 (and the other stones), which is low. Playing low here would not put much pressure on black and also would leave the bottom very uninteresting, as there would not be so good opportunities to develop to the middle. Putting less pressure on black's group would also make it stronger, which would in turn make your own R8 group (stone) weaker.]
;B[rp];W[qq];B[pj];W[pm];B[pn];W[nl]C[I peeped and made shape but was giving her the thickness nessecary or should I have just run out with p8?

J: This position is quite promising for white. Black's group is not alive and is squeezed between two white groups. If your upper group would be any stronger, it would look very good indeed, as you could force black to run while you make territory in the bottom and develop influence towards the center. Unfortunately, as it turns out, white group is weakened a lot by Q10 and Q16 and mounting a serious attack is difficult.]
;B[mn]
(;W[lp]C[J: M5 would have been better. Put more pressure on the runaway group without making the bottom (almost) any weaker. This gives black too easy ride. After this your O8 group does not feel so strong, though, so it would probably be a good idea to strengthen that first. Unfortunately there is no good move anywhere there, so perhaps it is indeed best to play M5 first. The downside is that this leaves O8 group very vulnerable, which might backfire in a bad way if black chooses to attack. Something like O10 could work, as it would threaten black's Q10. See the variations.]
;B[nj]C[J: Here you see black developing a very nice wall towards the corner in sente.]
;W[ll];B[kn];W[ee]C[I tenuki'd from the bottom corner. I felt I was okay with 4th line running and it was time, however, was it too late or early?

J: Even though this is big, it is dangerous to leave bottom as it is. See variations.]

(;B[cf]C[J: This is a wasted move. Does not secure almost any territory, does not attack white and does not help C9. Heavy and overconcentrated. Either play K8 or a move around K17 to further develop upper left and reduce white's wall.]
;W[nc]C[J: Good direction of play. There's just the problem that it seems to be too close to black's group and too far from your own. Black can cause lots of pain by playing M17 or the like. You should make a smaller jump to K17-L16 area I think. Black's corner is stll wide open for invasion, so it's better to extend from your own group than place a lone stone so close to a good black formation. You can invade the corner after you have increased your territory that way.]
;B[pf]C[J: Fortunately black lets you go easily];W[jd]C[Would L16 here be better as is doesn't leave an invasion point?

J: From shape point of view, K16 seems like the correct point, but as you pointed out it leaves a lot of room between the stones. This is especially pressing since there is a strong black formation on the right side. L16 would not combine so nicely with your stones on the left, so (returning to the comments earlier) I think the main problem is O17 being too near to a stronger black position.]
;B[ld]C[J: This move feels very strange.];W[qc]C[Was the san san correct here or should I have defended at M17?

J: This feels a bit strange, but I guess it is OK. Now you see the problem with O17. Just after 2 more moves, it seems like a badly placed stone and is abandoned.]

(;W[ge]C[J: Keep in mind that playing contact moves usually strengthens your opponent. Only later in an attack play contact moves.]
;B[hd]C[J: Here you can see that the exhange G15-H16 made black stronger. Your K16 and O17 have ended in between two stronger black formations. They cannot hope to make any territory anymore, only barely live.]
;W[he];B[id]C[J: This push made your position again sligthly worse, as now your K16 is really in trouble, while J16 group starts to have some momentum behind it.]
;W[kc]C[I wanted to make use of the aji, and possibly gain some height. I was under his j16 group with l17 and I hoped he sould M17 to let me kill. However, he did not but I was okay with this option too. Either way was fine for me.

Was this bad or should I have j15 to make a wall and use the O17 aji later?

J: This result is good for black. If you compare this situation to the one after you played K16, you can see that what was at that point potentially your big territory, is now all gone and your L17 group would have serious trouble living if black attacked it now. See variations earlier for some suggestions how to contain the invasion. The main problem here (once again) is that O17 was too close to a strong black formation. It left your upper side too open for invasion and consequently your potential territory was torn apart by black.]
;B[ie];W[je];B[if];W[lc]C[J: OK, not a disaster for white in the end, but not good either. M17 group is not alive and if black attacked it now, finding life could prove to be difficult, as the group is surrounded by black on every side. Moreover, you can see that your G15-H15 stones are quite useless. Whenever you choose to push, make sure that (1) you are not pushing the opponent somewhere where you will have to defend (as happened here with L17 and M17) and (2) that the pushing stones are useful in some way, like creating influence or territory. Here neither of these happened, as you had to go back to defend and the pushing stones are in a position where they an only provide a few endgame points. When you attack, try to strengthen your own positions while weakening opponent's. You had a strong shape in E17, so you should attack from the right, as your weak formation is there. That way you strengthen your own weak group and push your opponent against your already strong group, which would make it weaker. This can only be good.]
;B[jq];W[jo]C[I think this was my first mistake. Should I have drawn back at L2 or was this correct? Could there have been something better?

J: If you have a look at the whole board position at this point, you can see that white is in quite a bad position. O8 group is very vulnerable indeed, while M17 is not alive either. There is (was) lots of potential territory in the bottom, but black could still invade it to make a big reduction. The problem with attack from this side is again that your own weak group is behind there (M8), so anything you push there, would not help it. Also, If you don't take care of N3 and the like, your territory will be completely gone, see variations.]

(;B[hq]C[J: This move feels a bit strange. Should have first taken advantage of white's weakness on the right.]

(;W[ho]LB[ch:A]C[This... I wasn't sure but if he killed it, his influence would be superior.

Also... At point A and that area, there looks like I can invade there. Can you explain that sequence?

J: This move is not good. It does not really threaten any of black's groups and does not create territory or influece. This will only result in another weak group. After this you have three weak groups on the board. Surely at least one of them is going to die.

Invading at A would also result in a new weak group that would not have anywhere to run. Seems like the only feasible option is to reduce the left by a play around D10.

The best option by far would be to try to prevent K3 and L6 group from connecting. But unfortunately your M8 is too weak. A cut can be made, but that would put M8 in a very difficult position indeed. See variation.]
;B[gp];W[ko];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[mj]C[J: Here you see the problem of a weak group. You started an attack on K3 and M6 by cutting, but in the middle of the attack you had to come here to defend. Now your K5 and H5 stones are there to be taken.]
