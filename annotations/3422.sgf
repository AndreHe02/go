C[Dear reviewer,

after what I thought to be a good start in the opening, I became increasingly careless (or greedy?) during the game, and after a series of mistake, ended in disaster. I made some annotations myself, but I think you will be able to provide some more profound comment. Thank you for your efforts.



> Hello. I have inserted comments (preceded by >) and variations in the game. Some variations have comments, some speak for themselves, and some are just "might-have-beens". I have also commented on black's moves, perhaps those might be helpful too.

Some general comments here:

- you both made some smallish gote moves in fuseki, but as we all know, fuseki is hard.
- it is also hard, but important to have an idea whether one's ahead or behind. in the first case one should play conservatively, in the latter, aggressively.
- you finally lost the game by losing a big fight. these things happen, and I have no idea what general moral can be drawn from a particular case like this one 8-)
- well, maybe one moral: if it looks like that an invasion will succeed, stop trying to kill the opposing force and contain it. while you do that you gain strength outward that you can use elsewhere. if you hadn't let black out -- which would have been easy -- your outside influence would have been enough to win the game.

Feel free to contact me at gbohus@yahoo.com if you have any questions. Best,

Geza Bohus
