C[This is a game I played on KGS.

I eventually won, but I felt that it was only because of a mistake my opponent made, rather than anything *I* did to deserve it.  I would appreciate any advice you could give me on reducing moyos, et cetera.  As the game gets going, you will be able to see the places where I have problems.  :)]

(;W[rn]C[Was this a foolhardy move?

"Foolhardy" is a bit of a rough word.  A knight's move is very cuttable.  Check the variations: I've discussed a few alternatives (one good, one bad).]
;B[qo]C[Black cuts immediately: this is a good move for black.]
;W[qn]C[This is adding more dead stones :-(];B[pn];W[qp];B[ro]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[oq];B[qm]LB[qp:A]C[This move of black isn't necessary, but it's not such a big deal.

You noticed that your two stones are dead (though they still have aji (threat possibilities) for later).  So you decided to sacrifice them.  You managed to use a potential threat of those two stones when you played the move marked 'a'.  This was a good strategy.

So the result is: black has the corner and the side, and because of the last move, only a little bit of aji left.  White is stable and strong at the bottom, and has sente.  So this is an equal result.

Sacrificing the stones was very well played.];W[dd]C[Good move.]
;B[dj];W[ip]C[Yes, good move: this builds a moyo in the bottom side.]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[dm];W[co]LB[fq:A]TR[dj][dm]C[At the time, I was thinking of preventing him from playing in the corner, but now this move seems odd.

--> It's an okay move, though not brilliant.  Your corner isn't completely safe yet, but it's a bit of a threat against the marked stones.

For protection, it would've been better to play at 'a', for example.]
;B[jd]LB[hc:B][nc:A]TR[pd]C[At this point, I began to fall behind.  Very behind.

--> No, it's still okay.  His structure is very open.  It would be a very good move now to invade at 'a'.  If you don't live, then you definitely can split the two marked stones, making the left one weak.  Possibly, you can later split at 'b' (but that's too early now).]
;W[dh]TR[dj][dm]C[This move is slow.  The marked stones are not under a very strong attack, and black can therefore reinforce his top right corner structure.]
;B[fh]LB[qc:B][ei:A]TR[dj][dm]SQ[jd][pj]C[This is one way to start building.  It has one very big disadvantage: you can now cut at 'a', which weakens the (triangle) marked stones.

For your information: another very good way for black to reinforce, is 'b', which combines well with the stones that have the square markings.]
;W[ei]C[Yes !  :-)];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[ek]LB[nc:A]TR[dj][dm]
C[This seems like it's very good for black, but it's actually very good for white.  You are building a very strong structure, and nearly capturing the two marked stones.  On the other hand, black's structure is still very invadable at 'a'.  So you're gaining here.]
;B[dk]C[No problem: you can chase that group.  While chasing, black cannot both defend his group as well as defending his structure at the same time.]
;W[bm]LB[bi:A]C[Good move.  Another option was 'a', which is the same idea (protect your territory while taking away his base).]
;B[fn];W[el];B[em];W[dl];B[cl];W[cm]LB[fp:A]TR[dl]C[Okay, you've gained quite some profit on the left side now.  Disadvantage: your bottom is weakened.  Black can now play at 'a' and split the bottom.  But that's a fair tradeoff.  Suppose you would've played at 'a' instead of cutting with the marked stones, then black would've connected, and your left side would've been split.]
;B[bl];W[gq]C[Hm, this is inconsistent.  You must continue the attack on the left.  Except if you're really confident that black cannot live there :-)]

;B[ch];W[cg];B[bi];W[bh];B[ci];W[bg]
(;B[bj]LB[bk:A]C[Black makes a mistake here.  'a' instead of this move, and black lives.]
;W[al];B[ak];W[ck]LB[gq:A]C[Nice sequence.  Did you have this in mind when you played 'a' ?  ;-)]
;B[am];W[ai];B[cn];W[bn];B[kl]LB[nc:A]C[So black goes on and defends his structure again.  Time to invade.  'a' is still the best place.]
;W[fo]LB[jc:B][qc:A]C[I think this move was unnecessary, looking back on it.  i guess i'm just paranoid.

--> Yes.  The only thing it does, is possibly capture that stone, and increase your territory by 1 point.  If black now plays 'a', life becomes harder for you.  But even after that, you can invade ('b' ?)]
;B[gn]C[Chance of your life :-)]
(;W[nm]LB[nc:A]C[I decided to try the proverb, "erase large frameworks shallowly"

--> Proverbs are a dangerous thing.  For example: this framework is so big, that shallow reductions aren't sufficient.  Here's a better rule: if you're behind, invade.  If you're ahead, reduce.  You're currently *not* behind, if we count real territory.  But if the whole top right becomes territory, then you are.  So it's high time to invade.

Look at the variations to see some possibilities how the 'a' invasion would work.  There's a billion possibilities, I only treat a few variations of the main ideas.  I hope that, providing you with the ideas and showing a few ways of how it could work for you, is sufficient to give you new ways of looking at frameworks.  Particularly, frameworks that are as loose as this one.]
;B[nk];W[ol];B[pl];W[ok];B[oj];W[pk];B[qk]C[All fairly small.  Not only that, black is now very strong on the right side !]
;W[qj];B[rk]LB[nc:A][nd:B]C[Not the best place to invade: it violates the principle "play away from strength".  You must play so far away from blacks' strength (against which you're now attaching), that 'a' is still the best move !  Maybe, because of the strength, that 'b' is slightly better now, but the direction is similar.]
;W[qi];B[qg]C[White is in trouble :-S];W[nj];B[nl];W[om]LB[oi:A]
C[My opponent here said "It seems I have to lose two stones," but I couldn't for the life of me figure out what he meant.  The ladder on the left is bad, and the stones on top require two plays.

--> playing 'a' would require just one move, but it's black's turn now, of course.]
;B[oi]
(;W[mi]LB[ni:A]C[What would a better move here be?

see the variations for the move 'a'.];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk];W[mm]
C[I allowed an undo here out of the kindness of my heart ;) What did he gain from this?]

(;B[lk]LB[lj:B]C[--> He didn't gain too much, I'd say !];W[fg]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[gg];W[ff];B[gf];W[qc]C[This invasion is okay.  'a' earlier would've been much bigger, though.  After this sequence is played, black as an outside wall, so your reduction is completely over: no more potential for extra reduction moves, you can't extend into more territory from the invasion stones.  When you play on the side, there's much more possibilities to extend to all directions.

(of course, playing in the center, you have even more directions in which you can extend, but then it becomes very difficult to live, so the side is a nice trade-off in that respect)]

(;W[sa];B[fe];W[ef];B[ee];W[de]LB[oa:D][eb:A][nb:C][nc:E][im:B]
C[Okay, let's take a look at the current status:

black: top &right side: about 130 + 1 prisoner
white: top side: 2 points, left &bottom: about 95 + 2 prisoners (no komi)

So you're behind by about 30 points.

Probably the biggest point now is 'a', because it enlarges your territory while you stop him from enlarging his.  Next, there's B which doesn't enlarge your territory, but stops him from enlarging his.  It also threatens to cut off the marked stones.

A very good endgame move would be 'c': black can't play 'd' to stop you (calculate this !).  So he'd probably play 'e', and you can connect underneath at 'd'.

If you would be able to play all these moves, you might still have a chance.  I'd start with 'c' myself, hope to come out in sente and then play 'a'.

Unfortunately, it's black's turn, and of course he takes away your chance for 'c', in sente too :-(]
;B[oa];W[pa];B[mc]C[This is the move that let me win...];W[pe]
;B[qf];W[oc];B[od];W[nc]
(;B[nb]C[Very bad play by black !  *THIS* is the move that let you win :-D

See the variation.];W[nd]
(;B[md]LB[oe:A]C[Again a very bad play by black.  He should've run out with 'a'.]
;W[oe]LB[mb:A]C[The reason why both black's moves were so bad are:
1) you've expanded
2) you can expand more by capturing with 'a', so his marked stone is a complete waste of time :-D
3) most importantly: you're OUT !  You can now extend in any direction you like & massacre his territory.  Even if he would've played as in the last variation, he would've locked you in.  You would've had a very big reduction, but no more ways to reduce further.  Now, it's playtime for you !]
;B[mb]C[So he considers those 3 stones to be more important than stopping you from playing in the heart of his territory...  Bad move again !]
;W[ph]C[Yes !  Massacre time :-D];B[oh];W[pg];B[pf];W[og];B[nh]
C[Black is in very, very big trouble :-(((];W[of];B[ri];W[mh]
LB[il:A]TR[lk][mk][nk][kl][ll][nl]C[And all of a sudden, his marked stones can also be threatened by a move at 'a' for example...

His previously commented moves are responsible for giving you all these possibilities.]
;B[ng];W[mf];B[mg];W[lg];B[ni];W[mj]C[Play continued after this, but my opponent said he would resign, here, so I have cut that from the SGF.

--> short summary:
- You killed that group on the left side really well.  Good calculating !
- The main issue was that his moyo was growing.  Your advantage was that you had certain territory, whereas he only had a structure.  So you needed to invade that structure.
- But once he gave you the opportunity, you were right back there to abuse it in a very efficient way.

All in all, if you would've invaded black's moyo, this would've been a very good game.  Try to estimate if his structure is bigger than yours, and if it is, if you should reduce or invade.  In this case, because the structure was still very loose, it was a perfect case for an invasion.

I hope this helps,

Peter.])
