C[Mr. Dyer,

Thanks for the opportunity to review your game. Please understand that only a high ranking professional player knows the truth about go. All other opinions including mine should be viewed with polite suspicion. Nevertheless they're useful if such opinions stimulate your thinking and help increase your enjoyment of the game.

Regards,
John C. Stephenson
Apr 21, 2003];B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[po]C[W4: normally the last open corner is biggest.]
;B[np]C[B5: may tenuki and take the last open corner instead. Of course O4 is okay.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[B7: if cutting the white stones like this worked well, W6 would not be a joseki move. But white 6 is a joseki. See variation.]
;W[pp];B[qr]
(;W[rq]C[W10: P3 taking the outisde is better early in the game.]
;B[oq];W[rr];B[qs];W[rs];B[or];W[dd]C[W16: a fast move. W normally should complete the position on the right with R8.]
;B[qm];W[qn];B[rm]C[B19: Q7 is normal.]
(;W[rn]C[W20: submissive I think. Q7 is the vital shape point.]
;B[qj];W[qh]C[W22: a good checking extension. C6 is an alternative to play in the largest open area.]
;B[pf]C[B23: Black begins a fight in a unfavorable zone (his lower right stones are weak so it is hard to fight here).]
;W[oh]C[W24: moves the inside stone outside. Good.];B[qe]C[B25: wants to prevent wariuchi (connection underneath) at R14, but it makes the white corner stone much stronger, so Black paid something.]
;W[qd];B[nf];W[pm]C[W28: an important point locally; however, it is better to move the inside stones outside with O16 (make points and continue the running battle. The white stones on the bottom right are already out.)]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[ok]C[W32: when attacking do not neglect defense. W32 should be P7, solid connection. Now White will become thin during the fight.]
;B[oj]
(;W[pi]C[W34: afraid of black wedge at Q12? W34 helps strengthen Black, so its not right.]
;B[pj];W[nc]C[W36: of course this is important, but all the white moves on the right have accomplished little because of the white defect at P7. So instead of all that pushing (too early), just play O17 first. Since this is a running fight, O16 (4th line vs. 3rd line) puts more pressure on the black stones so is better.]
;B[ni]C[B37: severe];W[nh]C[W38: if you cannot read an escape, then squirming may help black even more. Best to leave the aji.]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[ng];W[mi];B[lh];W[nj];B[oi];W[mj]C[see variation starting with P7]

(;B[qi];W[ph];B[rh];W[rg];B[ri];W[re];B[qg];W[pe]C[W54:  White must fix P7 instead.

Is R15 an important stone? (A stone is important if it connects 2 groups, cuts off the opponent's weak group, or protect significant territory.) Since the R15 stone is not important, Black does not have to answer so white Q15 loses sente.]
;B[lf]C[B55: Black has recovered from his earlier mistake in the lower right corner. Cutting P7 would be much better than M14 defense.]
;W[qf];B[pg];W[jd]C[Assuming you did not realize p7 was urgent and were looking for the biggest point, is K16 the biggest open area? The left is the biggest open area. (Also, K16 plays too close to the strong black position.)]
;B[ld]C[B59: this move is slack, slow and small.];W[lc]C[W60: it is not necessary to answer B59 since bigger moves exist elsewhere; however the exchange of B59 for W60 is better for White.]

(;B[fc]C[B61: the left side remains the biggest open area. So B61 is too soon.]
;W[hc]C[W62: normal precedence is corner, side, center. Locally it is better to help D16.]

(;B[fe]C[B63: run? It just seems heavy. How about invade the corner and take some cash?]
;W[ec]C[W64: slack. Normal is moving the inside stone out. Should play C14 or D14, depending on your judgement of needing a defending (3rd line) or attacking (4th line) emphasis.]

(;B[eb]C[B65: slack. Helps White secure the corner without compensating gain.]
;W[db];B[ed];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cf];B[gb]C[B73: must continue with D13 sente to control the center.]

(;W[hb]C[W74: too small. D13 is huge in taking control of (not that same as owning) the largest open area.]
;B[jp]C[B75: D13 still urgent.];W[fq]C[W76: the left is larger than the bottom invasion.]
;B[iq]C[B77: are the points on the lower bottom around m3 the biggest? J3 is way slow.]

(;W[dr]C[W78: this bottom stone is a sabaki situation. Sabaki: how to manage a weak stone. F3 is weak since it is outnumbered locally. 3 choices exist in a sabaki situation; namely, run, live quick or sacrifice or gain elsewhere. 

Running is okay if you generate a counter attack; otherwise you will just be heavy so don't do it.

Living quick is okay if the opponent's area is large and valuable.

Otherwise, sacrifice for gain elsewhere.

So, in this case, K4 and J3 seem overconcentrated because it's two stones pincering where one stone pincering would have sufficed. The areas around F3 is not that big; therefore, C3 or D6 should be considered, using F3 as a sacrifice to help C3 or D6 gain a compensating position. C3 is normal locally.]

(;W[cb]C[W88: c19 is proper.];B[ca];W[ba];B[ea];W[bc];B[gc]
C[B93: this move is so slow it is embarassing.];W[cm]C[W94: still better at D13, but first force at G19.]
;B[cn]C[B95: this helps White get stronger.];W[dg]C[W96: finally!]
;B[hd];W[id]C[W98: force at G19 first.];B[ha];W[ib];B[ia];W[ja]
C[ddyer [?\]: gote sequence for black];B[ga];W[kb];B[he];W[eg]
C[W106: D7 seems larger.];B[bm]C[B107: Black should consider C8 or C9 in this shape.]
;W[cl];B[bl];W[bk];B[ck]C[B111: a move like this requires good reading before playing. If it does not work right away it should be left as aji.]
;W[dk];B[cj];W[bj];B[ci];W[bi];B[dl];W[dm]
(;B[el];W[ch];B[em];W[di];B[dn];W[ck]C[W124: Are the 3 whites stone important? Helping the bottom left white group seems urgent. C9 is an endgame move. This is still the middle game.]
;B[eo]C[B125: Slack.  Black must try hard with G2 first.];W[fo]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[gq]C[bobc [?\]: not more than 16...but not insignificant]
