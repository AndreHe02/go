C[this is a game I should have won and lost, but am not too sure where I went wrong. I played black.

K:  Hi, Jeromin.  I'm Kevin, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I've prefaced my comments with "K" so you can tell where I've chimed in.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[jp];W[dj];B[jj];W[jd];B[md]C[K: For starters-- while this opening sequence is not terrible, it's got too many holes overall.  Basically, you're trying to outline a large rectangular space along lines K and 16 (approximately), but you'll never manage to take all of it.

In short, there are a lot of places where White can waltz in and do as he pleases--and while this will be true of any opening, this one is especially overambitious.

As far as advice, I would suggest playing more along the third or fourth lines, not unlike White has done in this sequence.]
;W[pj];B[fq];W[dn];B[oj]C[K: Playing tsuke (attachment) here may or may not be the best plan.  The real problem is that in a space this large, it's hard to determine the best defense.

The pros to tsuke here are that it limits White's upward movement, though he may still come around the sides of your stone (P9 and 11); the cons are that he will be able to move freely down the side of the board.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qg];B[oh]C[K: While this is not an indefensible move, it's awfully submissive under the circumstances.  A hane at Q12 might have forced White down a row (whereas in this sequence he continues against your pieces.)]
;W[ph];B[pg]C[K:  This is a somewhat dangerous move, because White can put this stone in atari from either direction when he feels like it.]
;W[rg]C[K:  I'm a little surprised by White's response--it seems as though he could have gained more space and had a bigger threat by extending to R14.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[pn]C[K:  Again, you're leaving a stone hanging where White could potentially check it.  Though this is not always a bad thing, in this case Black 23 does not, I think, particularly reinforce the other stone enough--my instinct would have been to extend Q9 with Q8.]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[ql];B[pl];W[qj]C[I was looking for influnece and to separate white's groups into as many small goups as possible.

K:  But you're not really doing that.  All of White's stones on the right side are one large group.  If you're thinking in terms of cutting off the right-side group from White's stones on the left, that's true, but he no doubt expected that from the beginning.

Meanwhile, the influence you're gaining from this exchange is admittedly powerful, but is focused in a relatively small area.  As it stands, White probably has more (potential) territory than you do, and the single largest fertile battlefield is the space between White's stones on D10, D16, and K16.  While working your way into that space won't necessarily gain you a lot of territory, White's playing in there would make a lot of new space for him, so it should be something you're thinking about as the game progresses.]
;B[dg]C[K:  It's good that you're angling at White's territory now.  The problem is that you've played into a spot where your stone has no hope of making a base with a simple extension, and you'll have to resort to tactical acrobatics if you want to make one.  (Typically, the best way to ensure you'll have enough space for a base in many cases is to play a point where there are three free rows on each side.  Then you can jump two rows and play a stone on the third--subject to circumstance and board position, of course.)

I would suggest playing this stone one point to the left, on C13, which while still not totally ideal (White's D10 and D16 give him a lot of control over this area) gives you a much better chance of making a living group.]
;W[ce];B[mg]C[K: This move doesn't really advance your position very much in the face of White bearing down on your D13 stone.  It may be impossible to build a base in that area (I'm not sure either way), but you could still use it as a springboard to cut up the large, unclaimed upper-left area.

To do so I would suggest a move such as F 13 or even G13, helping your stone leap out of White's clutches to connect with your main force in the right-center.]
;W[lc];B[je];W[ie];B[if];W[he];B[ge];W[gd];B[fe]C[K: Remember that if White chooses to come down at H14, your three stones in his space will be cut off with a very rough situation for making life, and meanwhile your two-step hane K15 and J14 will also be in a fairly weak position.]
;W[fd];B[hd]C[did H16 make sense?

K:  Not really.  It's all right in that it's a sente move (i.e., it has iniative), because if White allowed you to extend  to H17 there's a chance of his H15/J15 stones being cut off.  So he'll probably respond to you, but because he must respond, and because this move currently serves no larger purpose, it's not really appropriate here.

Under the circumstances, you're just delaying the inevitable--I would have suggested saving a move like this for when you needed a threat as part of a grander strategy.  (E.g. during a ko fight.)]
;W[id];B[hc]C[K: A little surprised at the choice by White, since it seems to me that this extension, while by no means critically damaging, is all the same troublesome and could have been avoided if he'd simply trapped your stone with H17.]
;W[gc];B[ic];W[jc];B[jb];W[kb];B[ka];W[ib];B[hb];W[ja];B[gb]
;W[fb];B[ed];W[ee];B[fc]C[lucky...at this level I sometimes push a hopeless chain and am saved by a last minute mistake.

K:  It can be done--though as you've obviously recognized, it's not something to be relied upon.

This capture changes this area of the board, certainly in your favor.  But bear in mind that White's little snaking formation (from K17 to H15) is still alive and could still punch into your territory if you're not careful.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[db];B[gf];W[hf];B[gg];W[jf]C[K: This is where the weakness of these two stones which I mentioned earlier becomes apparent.  In this case, the problem was already aggravated enough that there wasn't much that could be done during White's couple of moves leading up to this situation--it's mostly just a matter of learning to see where problems like this could arise from and avoiding them in the first place.]
;B[ig]C[K:  The better choice, although if White chooses to come up to H13 you'll still be in a bit of a bind.]
;W[ke];B[hg];W[ld];B[me];W[mc];B[nd];W[nc];B[od]C[K:  This move could have been played at P16 to stop White.  It's not a huge difference, but it does save you points (or rather, keep points from him) in the long run.]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[og];W[qn];B[pf];W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[qq]
;W[rp];B[qh]C[K: This move is fruitless.  White doesn't even have to respond to it at this point.]
;W[rh];B[kg];W[jg];B[jh];W[kf];B[lf];W[le];B[lg]C[K:  M13 was protected by the arrangement of three stones on either side of it (White of course can't play a stone into it because it will immediately be captured).  If anything, I would suggest playing this stone at L12, which prevents the same cut as M13 and makes everything look slightly neater.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[qb];B[qc];W[rb];B[rc];W[oa];B[ej]C[at this point I took a look at the board and was satisfied.  had isolated white's stones and had a solid well connected structure reinforced by five well placed stones.

K:  Which five?  I'm supposing that F3, E10, K4, and K10 are four of them, but is the fifth one K12 or D13?

Regardless, the space between the four stones I mentioned above is by no means secure.  The two White stones D4 and D6 are in a prime position to leap up into the space and eradicate any profit for you; D10 could conceivably give rise to E9, with White trying to crawl up into your space.

Meanwhile, your space on the lower side (outlined chiefly by F3, K4, and R3) is also subject to a possible invasion by White.]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[ei]C[K: Here's a comment anticipating your question about how to handle the situation developing here:

I would be inclined to suggest playing F8 and allowing White to capture E10.  You have to sacrifice either way, but you might get off easier this way.  (I've included a variation with a possible outcome for this line of play.)]

(;B[fj];W[el];B[fl];W[fm];B[gm];W[fn];B[gn];W[go]C[what's the best way to fight off these two consecutive hanes without giving yielding like this and loosing territory?

K: Once the situation has advanced this far, I don't know a good way.  (It's possible that there is one and I am simply not high enough level yet, but going with what I know...)  Again, it probably comes down to an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure--see the variation I mentioned back at move 104.]
;B[gp]C[maybe this was a big mistake...? I wanted to limit w's development but thought H5 would let white take the whole corner diagonally.

K:  And it may well have.  However, it would be less of a loss than allowing White to play H5 and smash into your territory.]
;W[ho];B[fo];W[eo];B[fp];W[fi];B[gi]C[K:  Though White's G5 and H5 stones are now cut off from his main force, they're still not be to neglected--they, combined with a cut at G8, could make life rough for you.]
;W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[gj];W[hk]C[K:  At this point you've got White's pieces in a ladder, and the best thing you could do would probably be to finish them off.  While I understand that your next move (at H7) is to guard the cutting point, if you eliminate White's pieces there's no need to worry about it--see the variation.]

(;B[hm];W[eg];B[fh];W[eh];B[ef];W[de];B[df];W[fg];B[gh];W[dh]
;B[ff];W[cf];B[cg];W[ch];B[bg];W[bh];B[dk]C[was this move going anywhere? alternatives?

K:  While this move has its potential benefits, it will probably not come to much except as a threat, and you could probably be doing other things like securing your lower side from invasion or playing a point like K6 to make sure White's two stones don't cause any more trouble.  (Or for that matter, you could be launching an invasion at C3 or D2 and whittling away some of White's territory.)]
;W[dl];B[ck];W[cj];B[ah];W[ai];B[ag];W[bi]C[could I have killed the group with B9 A10 or otherwise?

K:  Yes, although even at that it would require some inaction on White's part to allow you enough moves to surround and capture this group.]
;B[em]C[maybe I should have focused on neutralising the two intruder groups G9 and G4...

K: It might indeed have been a better plan, especially as this move serves no practical purpose.]
;W[en];B[ep]C[K:  Again, a move that doesn't do much.  The shape you've made with this move is somewhat unpleasant, and the move would have been better used to come into White's corner area as I mentioned on move 141.]
;W[dq];B[hp];W[io];B[hj]C[K:  This is not your priority right now.  Although the chances of the three White stones in the lower area making life are slim, they're not negligable, especially if you let him extending into your center area and run roughshod over a very open space.  A better move would have been K6, which would have cut off White's advance from all directions and corraled him.]
;W[ik];B[il];W[jk];B[jl];W[kk];B[kl];W[kq]C[K:  White is beginning to split your groups just the way you'd meant to split his earlier in the game.]
;B[ip];W[oq]C[K:  This is the invasion of your lower side that I mentioned earlier.]
;B[op]C[K:  A fairly small move.  You should look at where White can make the most profit from going and try to prevent it--something like N4 might have been appropriate.  (Of course, White could then attempt to come up at P4.  But you would not lose that much stopping.)]
;W[pq];B[nq];W[qr];B[mp];W[nr];B[or];W[rq];B[mr]C[I was trying to close L4O4 while pretending to go after material. I was afraid L3 would break in.

K:  O4 doesn't need closing; it's protected by being a point surrounded by your pieces on three sides.  You're more correct to be concerned about the L3 stone.]
;W[pr];B[ns];W[ps];B[kp];W[er];B[fr];W[fs];B[gs];W[es];B[gr]
C[At this point it looked like a won game. was that realistic?

K:  It's a little hard to say.  Most of your territory is concentrated in the center, so it looks big (and bear in mind that with groups like White's string of stones along the ninth row, even that territory isn't totally solid yet).  But then I look at White's territory along the right side, and the left side, and a bit in the upper-left corner (even if you were to take advantage of the stones you've got in the area), and finally along the upper-right side, and it's really not that different from the amount of territory you have.  It may even be more--eyeballing something like that can be tough, but I wouldn't assume a won game in a situation like this.]
;W[kh];B[ih];W[kj];B[ki];W[jn];B[lh];W[ll];B[lk];W[lj];B[mk]
;W[lm];B[ij];W[lo];B[lp];W[no];B[np];W[nm];B[ml]C[K:  Here, as you noticed later, is more or less where your group from rows G to L is killed.  It came from above and below--the two groups that looked like they were struggling for life, but worked together to make a pincer attack.]
;W[mm];B[mo];W[mn];B[kn]C[Here MFOG estimates the score as b:101 W:98.5, the last time I had an advantage and only minimal. I overestimated my situation...]
;W[km]C[maybe with N10 and N11 I could save my group...

K:  Yep, that looks like it would have worked.];B[ko]C[Trying to stop w from making eyes, not sure how...

K:  Learning how to stop eyes can be tricky.  It's mostly a matter of learning where and how they form, and then preventing the shapes and arrangements that allow them.  In this case, it probably isn't possible to stop White, simply because you'll run out of liberties before you can (a situation known as damezumari).]
;W[re];B[rd];W[se];B[sd];W[sb];B[fa]C[K:  While this move will eventually be one worth making, there are arguably more important moves--for example, in your swiftly-fading center space, you could be working to cut off White's ability to push even farther in now that he's secured a base within the area.]
;W[eb];B[ea];W[da];B[ga];W[be];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bd];B[bf]
C[K:  223 is not a good move now.  It fills up a point that's no one's point (dame), it makes your shape rather unpleasantly dense, and it doesn't threaten White in the least.  Now, I suppose you could say that now C17 has some threat value for Black, but it's not nearly worth making such a minor play with the situations you've got elsewhere on the board.]
;W[ia];B[ha]C[K:  This move, too, is unnecessary.  White can't really threaten you with that triangle--if he moves into H19, he would have been immediately captured.  Granted, Black playing H19 forces White to fill (maybe), but at this point it's to no practical end.]
;W[os];B[nr];W[bk];B[cl];W[dm];B[cm]C[hopeless?

K:  Pretty much, unless White lets you run free for a couple more turns.]
;W[cn];B[eq];W[dr];B[sc]C[K:  This move serves no purpose at all.  There are much more important things to do with it.]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[im]C[I suddenly realised!];B[li];W[jm];B[mi]
;W[hn];B[nj];W[nn];B[nl];W[ln];B[om];W[tt];B[gc]C[K:  An unnecessary play, and it actually costs you a point.

Two things:

One, I see why you wanted to secure that group--White could threaten it by playing G17 or 16.  But if he did, you would capture him immediately and be connected, and the exchange of points (one of his prisoners for one of your points of territory) would mean no one takes a profit.  However, by playing one of the points without capturing a stone, you sacrifice a point instead of coming out even.

The other thing is that White just passed, meaning he's not going to attack that group.  When your opponent passes, you've got a free chance to get away without him harassing you anymore--that is, you may be looking at weak points in your formations and thinking "Hmm, what if he attacks those?", but if he's passed, and then you pass, it means he'll never get the chance.]
;W[la];B[jo]C[any points left over anywhere?

[hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms]C[K:  So, to conclude:

You started out fairly well (if a bit overambitious), but let yourself be pushed aside or invaded at a few key points that ended up giving White inroads into your territory that tipped things in his favor.

I'd say that right now you've got a solid grasp of the basics, and now it's time for slightly tougher concepts--things like more abstract eyeshapes (e.g. learning to recognize whether you could kill White's group in the middle) and just how much space you can put between two stones before they get split.  (To that end, I would suggest the excellent book "In the Beginning", by Ishigure Ikuro.)]
