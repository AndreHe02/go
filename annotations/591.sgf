;B[pd]C[Hello.  My name is Barry Willey.  I live in Galveston, Texas, US. and I play around the 12k level.

I have taken a look at the game and made a few comments and included some variations.  My overall impression of the game is that you played good moves, but not the right moves at the right time.  Many of your moves were passive and did not require your opponent to answer.   Look for moves that build territory or influence and require a response.  In the future try to make a few moves that require your opponent to respond before you play a passive /defensive move.

In future game records you send for review, please review the game first and make comments and ask questions about issues you would like instruction on.  It helps the reviewer to focus on thing in which you are interested.  Also please state your strength or experience, so the reviewer knows at level to address his instruction.  ALso please be aware that a stronger player than myself would proabably give you very different advice, but I do the best I can, :-)]
;W[cd];B[dq];W[pq];B[cn];W[cp]C[When using a large knight extension be prepared for your opponent to invade. See variation]

(;B[fp];W[cq];B[dp];W[bo];B[dl]MA[bn]C[ Move 11 should have shut whote off at b6.  You leave white too meaning openings.]
;W[bn];B[dn]C[I don't think this move accomplishes as much as it could have.  You are over concentrated, but not very solid.  Plus you have not sealed white in the corner.  The real problem was probably the move before.]
;W[dr];B[pj]CR[er]C[Move 15 should have been at e3.  This seals white in and you still have sente.  (The ability to make moves that require your opponent to respond.  This allows you some control over the course of the game)  A good set of rules to remember is start at the corners, and after the corners go for the sides.   You are probable aware that much commentary in modern go talks about the use of influence and trying to obtain a large area in the center of the board, but I believe that particluar style of go will be easier to play after you gain more experience.]
;W[pg];B[nc];W[lc]
(;B[pf]MA[qf]C[Move 19 should have been at the mark.  Your move will eventually allow white to make a base and live easily.  Generall y connections are made when]

(;B[ee];W[fd];B[fe];W[fc]C[Take a look at the variation coming up and decide if h15 needed to be mae at this point in the game.]

(;B[he];W[dj];B[dh];W[fj];B[fh];W[hj];B[fl];W[hl]CR[gk]C[Move 59 shoud have been at g9.]

(;B[gl]CR[gk];W[gk]C[Allowing your opponent to move at g 9  allowed him to make a strong shape.  One go saying is something like,"my opponents key move is my key move"]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[pn]C[I think a two point instead of a three point jump would have been better.  A three point jump leaves you open to invasion and two weak groups.  A three point shold be made from a group of two stones on the 3rd and 4th lines.]
;W[pl];B[nq];W[qo]C[The last sequence did not turn out well.   White controls the corner and you have two weak stones.  R5 is a critical spot with a stone on the 3,4 point.]

;B[ho];W[jm];B[lm];W[lp]C[White is in much better shape at this point.  It has threee corners and trails into the middle.  You have tried to create an influence game, but did not use your thickness to create territory.]
;B[lj]C[This was a nice move to give this group some shape.]
;W[jj];B[kh];W[ci]
(;B[cg]C[move 95 should have been at c12.];W[bh]
(;B[ei]C[Also, before each move try to assess the entire board.  You are behind on territory, so you need a more aggressive move.  See variation for example.]
;W[hn];B[gn];W[hm];B[gm];W[cl];B[ek];W[dk];B[cm];W[bm]C[The territories are pretty well outlined.  The groups are alive and the rest is endgame.  I didn't have any significant comments left at this point.  If you have any specifice question or issues I did not cover please send them to me and I will look back over the game.  Good luck and keep at it.
