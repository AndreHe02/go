Backofen [5k\]: hi

Hi , I fell behind here on this game, and I was wondering, when should I have resigned (I resigned late), and what led me to the path of a very low score.

MR: I feel that you had problems coping with the black moyo. If you are not sure whether you can deal with the moyo *without* having your own groups die in other parts of the board, I would recommend that you do something against your opponent's moyos *earlier*. Opportunities in this game were K4 instead of O3 (so do not allow a large moyo to begin with) and playing something around G10 after G13.

With respect to your question 'when to resign' I would recommend that you 'take a break' in the game every now and then and *count* your points and the points of your opponent. Good opportunities for this are situations when you have to think whether your group already lives in sente or when a joseki or fighting comes to a pause and you wish to launch your next action. 
When counting reveals that there are 20 plus points missing for you, then you should check whether there are any areas where you can make trouble and try to catch up. If you cannot find these areas - resign. If you tried making trouble and it did not work (e.g. counting afterwards reveals that there are still 20 plus points missing) - resign.]

;B[od];W[nb];B[me];W[nq]C[MR: If you do not like black playing a pincer at M3 and thereby getting a large moyo, you can consider only to extend to K4 on the lower side instead.]
;B[lq];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[np]C[I've seen this move before, the idea is it makes less of a moyo for black.

MR: Wrong idea. This joseki gives black even more thickness than the joseki that you chose in the upper right corner. S3 or O2 would be the 'normal' continuations here, I think. For details on the joseki that you chose look Ishida, volume 3.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[pr];W[qr];B[nr];W[ps]
(;B[no]C[MR: O5 and N2 are both possible continuations for black. In this game, it is certainly good for black to play O5. 
If you do want to fight here, you can consider N4 for white (but the shape is, of course, worse than in the variation that you had in mind).]

(;W[mr];B[mp];W[ns]C[this was not my desired reslut, i'm sure it's worst than the regular joseki]
;B[mn]C[MR: The joseki usually continues with the peep W M5 for B N5.]

(;W[di];B[gd];W[de];B[gg]
(;W[rd]C[MR: I think that you have to do something on the larger scale with respect to blacks moyo. A play on the border of black's and white's sphere of influence would be G10, for example. You could also direktly utilize the aji of the lower right corner joseki as shown.]
;B[re];W[rc];B[fj]C[MR: I think the game is starting to look good for black now.]
;W[rf]C[Is the invasion I do too small for now?

MR: No, I think that you have no other choice than to start 'something' on the right side now.]

MR: I am not sure on this myself. The move looks strange, but I can understand that you do not want to allow black to enclose even more points in the center.]

(;W[gb]C[I think this was early something helping both D4 and G9 would have been better, maybe F3

MR: I agree that this is not 'topic of the game' right now and that you should continue on the lower side.]
;B[fn];W[hn];B[gm];W[hm]C[MR: You should play more lightly when you are under attack, like K8, for example.]
;B[fp];W[kn]C[MR: I think that you have to play in the corner and hope for the best for the center white group. 

By the way, with respect to your initial question: In case that the center white group dies then, this is a good moment to resign :--)]
;B[cq]C[D4 dies, besides no playing G18 is there anything else I could have done?]
;W[cp]C[MR: If there is any chance for that white group then by blocking on the other side and cutting off the black stones F4, F6 and G7.]
;B[dq];W[bq]C[MR: Again wrong direction. If there is any aji, then this is on the outside.]

;B[bj];W[bi];B[jo];W[jn];B[io];W[ho]C[MR: Moves like this are aji keshi!

This is a point where you should
a) think whether your center group is alive or not when black resp. white is next to play there
b) count the territory of white (and find out that black has maybe 20 points more than white)
c) think about where there are chances to make up the missing points

If you find that for a) you have to play with the group again, this means of course that there are less chances for c) to make up for the missing territory.

(Anyway, H5 does not really help the center white group with respect to territory and black could also directly start to try to kill the group (although he is keeping the game simple for him with answering at H4 ...)]
;B[hp];W[ii];B[ih];W[hi];B[hc]C[MR: Unless you see some good chances to start trouble and make some extra points through this, now is probably a good time to resign ...

(;W[lo];B[mo];W[ip]C[MR: Maybe something like this, although it is not at all clear that black will now still answer the peep like this.]

(;W[lo]C[MR: Maybe I would have peeped earlier and try to build something on the lower side, but I am not really sure on a good strategy here.]

(;W[pf];B[qe];W[ph]C[MR: This looks more flexible to me and leaves the aji of W o16 once white has settled himself.]
))
(;W[qm]C[MR: As you indicated that you are not familiar with the joseki in the lower left corner, I would like to show you the 'standard aji' in this joseki. If white plays R7, black must be careful about answering on the upper side, because of the white continuation W S4, B S5, WR5. If black answers W R7 in the corner, you have an extra stone in place to do 'something' on the side (depending on the circumstances, starting with R10, O10, 09 etc.).]
