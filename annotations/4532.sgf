C[this is for white. I'm kinda new to this and i'm not sure
what my strength is. I've never sent in a game for
reviewing before. i need help on everything. Probably
attacking my apponent more than anything. thank you for
your time and energy.

Anton> Dear Daniel, thank you for submitting your game for review, this is one of the best ways to learn (apart from playing, of course). 

I will try to provide as much help as I can, please forgive me if some my comments sound too harsh - and do not hesitate to ask me more questions if you wish. My rank is around 14k, which means I am not ideal and am sometimes mistaken. If something seems strange or needs more explanations - just ask.

The main areas to improve, I think, are the following:
- Be careful in the beginning of the game not to give the opponent too much of the board. Try to play along with the opponent's moves, getting a chance to put at least a stone on each side, before getting into local fights (this depends on the situation, of course).
- Evaluate the moves. This is very difficult, I know, yet in some cases it seems that you almost didn't try to think whether you need to respond to the opponent's attack - or ignore it. Once you learn to ignore you will become significantly stronger. Then you'll need to learn to ignore only when it is wise to do so ;)
- Watch the opponent's groups closely for any chance to disconnect them. Splitting the groups is one of the best tactics - even if both groups survive the opponent will have to work for it, while you can make a profit.
- Think about the purpose of the stones - what your opponent wants to achieve with her stones, and what you want to achieve. You may be wrong in selecting the purposes and the method to pursue them, yet having a purpose behind every single move is already a great step towards better Go.]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[od]LB[eq:B][qk:A]C[Anton> Black is attempting to build a moyo (= territorial framework) on the left side - the stones in the top-left help this by providing influence on the whole of the left side, and the stone at the bottom is either inviting white's attack (around R5 or R9), or hopes to extend to around R6 itself, thus chasing two goals - a low and stable stone (on the third line) on the left side, accompanying the influence that comes from the top, and also some influence to the bottom side.

White's response may be built either on preventing black from achieving his goal, or by playing along and seeing what white could achieve by letting black pursuing his goals.

To prevent black from building a moyo, white could play A. To "play along" white could start working on their own moyo - at B, for instance.]
;W[fd]LB[ce:A][eq:C][qj:B]C[Anton> Unfortunatelly, this move does not seem to achieve much at this stage of the game - it is too loose to really secure anything on the left side, and it is too high (fourth line) on the top side to be of any danger to the two black stones in the top-right.

Locally, if you wanted to secure the top-left corner, move at A would be better - yet globally this is not the best move. Please see the previous comment for better strategies - I would prefer B or C.]
;B[po]LB[fq:B][jq:C][qm:A]C[Anton> This move is too high for black, seems to be undecided whether black wishes the right or the bottom side more - since it tries to build influence on the bottom side, while leaving a weakness in A. Later white could exploit it, yet now I would use the chance to counter this new influence, while enhancing the white moyo on the left side, by playing at B, for instance, or even at C.]
;W[hg]C[Anton> Way too loose, neigther helps the white position, nor threatens the black stones.]
;B[qj]C[Anton> I would say black is too preoccupied with this side of the board, this may allow white to secure much more (especially seeing how loose and overambitious the white's moves are).

Yet, comparing the strategies, black is making moves that are more solid. White's moves have lesser sense of purpose.]
;W[fq]TR[hg]LB[dl:B][lc:A]C[Anton> Good, counter black's influence, and build some influence towards the huge (though very unsecure) white moyo.

Another possibility, with the marked stone hanging high over both the left and the top side, it may be good to either attack the black enclosure at A, or make the moyo a bit more territory-oriented by playing around B (hard to say, though, I don't recall ever playing this ambitiously).]
;B[kc];W[ic]LB[dj:A][kq:B]C[Anton> Too small, compared to the rest of the board.

A, for instance, creates huge moyo for white.

B, on the other hand, negates influence of the black from the right side.

Both of these move look better to me than the one actually played.]
;B[kp];W[cj]TR[ic]LB[cj:A][kp:B]C[Anton> Ok, I guess it did work out the way I proposed - white encloses the moyo with A, black extends with B - yet because of the marked move it is black who has the initiative to make the next move.]
;B[hq]C[my defence really needs improvement

Anton> I don't see any problems with white's defense here - the move that black makes does not even require a response, it just grabs a bit of the territory, and white is free to play anywhere now.]
;W[gr]LB[fj:D][go:C][nj:B][qm:A]C[Anton> This move is very small for this stage of the game.

More important things to do are:
- start dealing with black's moyo, playing around A as invasion, or around B as reduction.
- expand white's moyo, playing around C, or secure it playing around D.]
;B[ir]C[Anton> This move by black is more important than white, but still too small at this stage.]
;W[hs]C[Anton> Sorry, but this move is a waste of initiative, it should be kept until the very end of the game.]
;B[ce]TR[dc][fd]LB[cc:F][cd:A][cg:E][ch:B][de:C][ei:D]C[what do i do about that peice in the top left? what's the
best way to defend and attack?

Anton> This black stone has only two ways to develop - either to try to settle in the corner, or extend along the left side.

You can attack it by preventing one of those possibilities - thus forcing your opponent taking the second possibility.

So, if you prevent it from settling in the corner (move A), it will most likely extend to B. Then you can keep pressure on this group by moves like C and D, and I actually think that you should be able to kill it.

If you prevent it from moving along the side with E (sorry if this is getting confusing), then black will have to start squeezing itself into small spaces like F, and survival is possible, yet difficult.

I would prefer A, though, since it both attacks and defends the corner really well - the marked stones with A form a good and reliable shape.]
;W[cd]TR[dc][fd]C[Anton> Good! The marked stones look really nice, and black stone now should try to find a way out of trouble.]
;B[cf]LB[bg:A][dh:B]C[Anton> This move is too slow, black risks staying within white territory.

Best way to reply would be to remove the base from black's stones - by A, for example.

Also possible to try to enclose this group (around B), yet removing the base is much higher priority.]
;W[bd]LB[bg:A]C[Anton> This also threatens to take out the base - yet it is good to actually take it (move A) instead of threatening.]
;B[cg];W[be]LB[bh:B][dh:A]C[Anton> No, now black is too close to escaping, so enclosing, after the base is taken (or threatened to be taken :)) would be better - around A.

If white allows black to play at the marked position it is not such a problem for white, since black cannot move into the corner anymore, and by playing B white leave black with only one eye on the side.]
;B[ci];W[bi]LB[di:A][dj:B]C[Anton> If white plans to allow black to live, then it is more profitable to build an outer influence, then to start crawling along the second line.

So, moves like A or B look better than the one that was actually played. They are very dangerous for black, because living on the side, being surrounded, looks very unlikely in this situation.]
;B[di];W[dj];B[fi];W[hi]LB[ej:A][gj:B]C[Anton> Too loose, this does not surround the black group, and, apart from that, does not bring white any visible profit.

As another possible course of events, A will threaten cutting black, and then B will enclose the black group. Black will still have a chance to break free, yet white will keep building a nice wall facing its own influence from the lower side.]
;B[ph]C[Anton> Black should not feel so safe on the left side, and, even if that was the case, move at Q12 is not too important at the moment, L15 or around O10 are bigger.]
;W[kj]LB[fk:A][md:C][mj:B]C[Anton> Yes, this does reduce potential black moyo - yet the black group on the left side can still be surrounded and, possibly, killed! White could try A for this.

If white's goal was to reduce the moyo, a deper and braver move is possible - around B, or you could invade at C.]
;B[pl];W[mk]C[Anton> Better to keep chasing the black group on the left side.]
;B[dm];W[dl]LB[fk:A]C[Anton> Move at A here threatens both the black group above it, and the black stone below.]
;B[gi]LB[gk:A]C[what should i do with that gap black's creating?

Anton> Keep chasing black's weak group! A is a good move for this.]
;W[fg]LB[eh:A][ei:B][ff:C]C[Anton> Move at A would be stonger - it threatens to cut the black group in half, and when black closes at B, white's can connect to the outside group by playing C.]
;B[eh]C[Anton> Black did not need to make this move, moving towards freedom is more important.]
;W[ej]C[Anton> Ok, a threat to cut at A, while white's stones are becoming stronger.]
;B[ef];W[ff]LB[gk:A]C[Anton> This move is okay, it prevents complications in this area - though I would prefer to get rid of a clear and present danger of black's escape by playing at A - and then deal with complications later, if they do arise.]
;B[gk];W[fj]LB[fk:A][gl:B]C[Anton> Playing at A here still forces black to connect, yet gives white a better position to continue with move at B ("hane").]
;B[gj];W[fl];B[en];W[do]LB[go:A]C[Anton> Too passive and purposeless, I would prevent black from connection more directly by playing at A.

Black may still connect, eventually, yet white's goal is to gain some profit while attacking the very weak group.]
;B[ik];W[ij];B[bh];W[bj]LB[go:A]C[Anton> If white has accepted black's escape as a fact - then this move is too small. Black already lives, so by playing the triangled stone it would only get a few points (around 5) - and loose initiative!

So, in white's position, it would be wise to ignore this small threat, and move to bigger threats of your own.

A is still a good move to attack black's weak group.];B[el]
;W[fm];B[fk];W[dk]LB[ek:A]C[Anton> Why not atari at A? This separates the two black groups, leaving one extemely weak.]
;B[ek]C[Anton> Now white is separated, and should fight for survival...]
;W[cm];B[fn];W[gm]C[Anton> Best to leave these two stones, they have no chance to connect to other white groups, and no real space to build two eyes.]
;B[hn];W[dn];B[em];W[jk];B[il];W[ei];B[fh];W[eg];B[dg];W[bf]
C[Anton> Previous moves were small - but sente (they kept initiative for white). This move is both small and gote - as the result of this move black loses one eye, yet it is already connected to a big outside group, so does not care about eyes here anymore.]
;B[ke]C[Anton> ...that's why black ignores white's move - it has more important things to do.

This was the last big point on the board, if one doesn't look at brave invasion plans.]
;W[hm];B[go]TR[fl][fm][gm][hm]C[Anton> Not sure what black is defending against here, white cannot cut. It should play at J7 to kill white's marked four stones finally.]
;W[im];B[jn]C[Anton> Hmm, K8 is, again, killing white stones.]
;W[jm]C[the whole right side of the board is all black's. I haven't a
clue how to defend much less than attack.

Anton> The right side of the board was more or less decided in the beginning of the game - when black was playing too tight, while white was playing too loose - and both on their sides of the board.

If you could prove white's ambitions by defending the initially loose territory - then there would be more points to harvest. Yet black's invasion succeeded - and there are no more good points to invade for white (at least, I cannot see any).

In the beginning of the game, please try to look out for what the opponent may be building, and try to prevent that while building something on your own. I am yet to master it myself, but in this game it seemed that white and black did not even see each other up to a certain point, after which is was all black attacking white.]
;B[ep];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[mn];W[in];B[io];W[eo];B[fo];W[fp]
;B[kn];W[jl];B[nk];W[lk]LB[nj:A]C[Anton> Too passive, move at A is both connecting the white stones (you can check it, it is a simple ladder!) and taking some territory away from black.]
;B[ml];W[mg]C[Anton> Good, this is a move on the edge of black's moyo, which is "erasing" it. Good timing for this move, as well.]
;B[nf];W[ng];B[og];W[hj]TR[ik][il]LB[hk:B][is:D][jb:C][mf:A]
C[Anton> Too small, it is more important to continue erasing black's moyo (at A etc).

Also, if you wanted to play here, B would actually capture two marked stones.

And, to move to endgame, there are some sente (which allow you to keep initiative) moves - C, D.]
;B[hk];W[jj]C[Anton> An unnecessary move, the white stones cannot be cut here.]
;B[mf];W[lf]LB[lg:A]C[Anton> Too risky, leaving the cut like the one at A is not a good idea when playing so close to your opponents influence.]
;B[le];W[kf]LB[lg:A]C[Anton> Still too risky - imagine what happens if black plays A now.

White should close this cutting place instead.];B[jb];W[ib]
;B[ni];W[mi];B[nj];W[mj];B[ia];W[ha];B[ja];W[hb];B[km];W[kl]
LB[is:B][jc:A]C[Anton> Too small, making a move to protect a single point.

It would be better to ignore this "threat" and take initiative in places like A and B.]
;B[jd];W[ie]LB[jc:A]C[at the top of the board in the center i was wondering how
i could have improved my defence.

Anton> There are no problems with defense here, as far as I can tell. Note that there is still one sente move at A for white to make.]
;B[is];W[mq]C[here i'm trying to get a foot hold in my apponent's territory.
I probably should have done it sooner

Anton> Yes, much sooner :) But, seeing how black defend, I guess even this was a good idea.]
;B[np];W[nq];B[qr];W[or];B[kr];W[lr];B[lq];W[mr];B[mp];W[oq]
;B[op]LB[ns:A]C[Anton> Here A would kill the white group.];W[pr]
;B[qq];W[ns]C[Anton> Nice :) Though it is based on black's mistake, as opposed to planning.]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[ll]C[black begins consolidating her territory. is there any way i
could have prevented the black segment from connecting
to the main group?

Anton> Long time ago, yes. See my comments around move #42.

Actually, black has completed consolidating her territory, now this is just small remaining moves.]
;W[nh];B[gh];W[kh];B[gq];W[fr];B[hr];W[gs];B[ah];W[ls]LB[jc:A]
C[Anton> This move is still too small - A is a sente, for instance.]
;B[id];W[hd];B[if];W[jf]LB[je:A]C[Anton> Here A is possible, one more point for white.]
;B[je];W[he];B[oh];W[hf]LB[gn:D][gp:C][jc:B][ks:E][qs:A]C[Anton> This move seems to be unnecessary.

Remaining sente moves on the board - A, B, C, D, E.];B[bg];W[dd]
;B[qs];W[ps]LB[de:E][gn:C][gp:B][jc:A][ks:D]C[Anton> If you ignore this move and allow black to play here it will only take one point - and it will not be necessary to respond, the white group is alive unconditionally.

So it would be better to make some sente moves - A, B, C, D, E.]
;B[ks];W[de]C[Anton> Good, sente :)];B[df];W[ed]LB[gn:C][gp:B]
[jc:A]C[Anton> Closing against a one-point move. Best to take initiative in the other areas, before switching to gote moves (i.e. before passing the initiative to your opponent).

Remaining sente moves - A, B, C.];B[gp];W[dp]C[Anton> Definitely unnecessary. Two sente moves left on the board, and then there is some territory closing to make in gote, too.]
;B[hh];W[ih];B[jc];W[gg]C[Anton> Ok, now there is no more choice then to close the territory whenever having the initiative.]
;B[ai];W[aj];B[gn];W[af];B[dh];W[ii]C[Anton> Unnecessary, and white looses one point on this.]
;B[gl]C[Anton> This one by black is also unnecessary :)

The difference is that black does not make a move in its own territory - so no points are lost.]
;W[ig]C[Anton> Another point lost without the need to do so.]
;B[ag];W[hl];B[tt];W[tt])
