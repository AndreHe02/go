C[White's major problems in this game were failing to attack the weak black groups, and investing too many stones to make a small center territory.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[cd]LB[ed:A]C[This move is unusual, since it gives black the move at A which is both an apprach and an extension.]
;B[qk];W[ed]LB[nc:B][gc:A]C[This move is also unusual since it leave black with a nice extension to A.  Usually white makes the extension to B if he plays on the upper side.]
;B[do];W[dl]C[Good pincer.]
(;B[cj]LB[do:A]C[Black should settle his stone at A first.]
;W[cl]C[good.];B[cg];W[ej];B[gc]C[Black needs to run away at E13 first.]
;W[eg]C[This is good for white.];B[be];W[bd];B[ce]
(;W[ch]C[Attaching to the enemy usually makes him stronger.  The placements are more interesting.]
;B[bh];W[dh];B[bf]
(;W[bi]TR[do][gc]C[Since black can't be killed, I prefer to make him live with gote and make strength on the outside, then attack one of the marked black stones.]
;B[ci];W[ah];B[bg];W[bk];B[bj];W[aj]
(;B[ai]C[There is no ko here.  Black should just capture two stones.]

(;W[co]C[This is too small to be a ko threat, and ther wrong way to attack this stone.  Since white is strong here, you should not touch the stone, but attack from the other side.]
;B[ak];W[cn]C[This is not so good, since you are trying to make a small territory on the left, and black can jump in at any time.]
;B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[dr];B[fp]C[Now the weak black stone has become strong, and in exchange you only have an incomplete territory.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc]
(;W[jc]C[This move doesn't look right.  The correct local extension is one closer.  The strongest attack is one longer.  This move does neither well.]
;B[dc];W[dd];B[ec]
(;W[kq]LB[lc:A]C[The attack in the upper left is not finished.  You need a sente move in that area to cover your weakness at A.]
;B[mq]
(;W[hq]C[I would extend one line further to put more pressure on the black group.]
;B[fn];W[ko];B[qo]C[Black got a lot of territory in the lower left, so you will need a good attack on the lower left black group to compensate.]

(;W[je]C[You need to make this move because you extended too far, but you need to make it in sente while attacking the black stones. There are two weak black groups on the board, so you need to attack.

Now you need to attack in the lower left.

If you play first in the upper left, you should attack, and try to chase the two weak groups together so you can split them.]
;B[ho]C[Now the black group is strong and your wall is wasted.]
;W[ge]C[Surrounding black is good now.];B[ib];W[ic];B[jb];W[hc]
;B[hb];W[hl]C[Good, attack and make territory.];B[jp];W[jq]
;B[ip];W[kp]C[Black's last two moves were not good since white is stronger now, and black gained very little.]
;B[fl]C[White should answer this move to take terriory while continuing the attack.  You don't want black to come in.]

(;W[nf];B[gk]
(;W[gj]C[Bad.  If you want to take territory here you needed to do it last move.  Now you need to attack the black stones, so you need to play on the side where your stone is weaker.]
;B[hk];W[hj];B[ik];W[ij]C[Now the black grou pis strong, and lives with territory.]
;B[fd];W[fe];B[jk];W[jj]
(;B[mg]C[This reducing move lets white break up the right side later, so I'd prefer one further away.]
;W[ng];B[mi];W[ni];B[mj];W[mh];B[lh];W[nh];B[ki]C[This is good for white, since the white wall means black won't get much territory on the right side.]
;W[qh]C[Good.];B[qb];W[qm]C[This invasion is dangerous, but good when it works, since black has little territory left.]
;B[pl];W[pm];B[om];W[po];B[pp];W[oo]

(;B[mn];W[mo]
(;B[nj]C[small.  black can reduce the center.];W[in]C[It looks like black can push to cut this stone, but if he does, white has a great squeeze.

Cutting across the knight's move is good though.]
(;B[kj]LB[jn:A]C[Too slow.  Black should cut at A.];W[ih];B[jg]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[if];B[ke]C[Small];W[nq];B[nr];W[oq];B[or];W[lr]
;B[mr];W[kb];B[pn]C[Doesn't work.];W[qn];B[on];W[qp];B[ro];W[rp]
;B[rq];W[rn];B[qq];W[so]C[Black lost a lot of points here.]

(;B[jo]C[Bad.  Cut across the knight's move is usually better, and here it is much better.  Until this move black was in the lead, because white used his thickness to make a small center territory rather than attacking the weak black groups.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[ln];B[km];W[lm];B[kl];W[ol]C[Nice cut.  Very big.]

(;B[nl]C[The side is too big.  Black should sacrifice these stones.]
;W[ok];B[ml];W[oj]C[This capture is huge, and puts white in the lead.]
;B[rh];W[ri];B[rg];W[qi];B[mf]C[Small.];W[hp];B[io];W[go];B[hn]
;W[gn];B[hm];W[gm];B[gl];W[iq]C[Save this move for a ko threat.]
;B[il]LB[gp:A]TR[eq][fp]C[Could I cut e3 group here?

Yes, but not here.  Just connect at A, and cut the two marked stones.]

(;W[fm]C[This move seems to help black.];B[em];W[gp];B[el];W[fo]
;B[dn];W[en];B[dm];W[al]LB[bm:A]C[This is small because of the weakness at A.]

;B[sh]LB[rk:A]C[Was it possible to kill?

No.  You need to defend at A];W[db];B[eb];W[da];B[ea];W[gb]

;W[rl];B[qj];W[fq];B[ep];W[fr];B[ds];W[cs]C[This move is a little dangerous.  Black can try to live in the corner, and if you make a mistake, he will.]

(;B[es];W[cr];B[ne];W[pj]C[Does this live?  It looks like black can kill the whole group if he saves his cutting stone.]

(;B[pg];W[ql];B[pi];W[oi];B[ph];W[pk]C[This is a big loss for white.  Still you are slightly ahead.]
