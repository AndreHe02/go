C[To the reviewer:

First of all many thanks for reviewing my game!

My 12k rank is a little inflated as I recently had a 3k resign in a 9-stone handi after capturing a 30 stone group.

I'm submitting this game (I played Black) even though it was a win because as far as I'm concerned it would have been a loss had White noticed before I did that a Black group of eight stones was almost captured.



I would be very grateful if you could let me know how to improve---from what you are able to tell about my playing from this game.

**Hi, I'm Charles and I play KGS at 5-6kyu.  I'll try to help where I can.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd]C[**I don't think this is good. It allows black to approach on E-16 which works nicely with his Q-16.  White should play D-17 if he's in this corner.]
;B[ed]C[I have found in the past playing this player that he somehow always outplays me in the fuseki if I don't challenge him as soon as possible.

**The question is what you mean by being outplayed in the fuseki.  This move is good since you're approaching that leads to a joseki with black in a better overall position.]
;W[ee];B[fd]C[I felt a little too insecure (because of being poor in joseki knowledge) to play F15 and decided on the nobi instead.

*F-15 is more common (that does not make it better, but for beginners it's a copy joseki anyway). F-16 works too if you're using it to build a strong wall to work with Q-16.  It seems you're just reacting to the next move though.]
;W[fe]TR[ge]MA[dd]C[**This looked odd. D-16 feels better.  F-15 begs black to tap the nail on the head (hane at the head of two).]
;B[dd]SQ[de]MA[cc][ge]C[C-17 or G-15.  D-16 makes it to where white plays D-15 an gets a hane at the head of three.  Plus, he's making a wall so make sure you end in sente to play D-10 next to stop a great white moyo.]
;W[de]C[Already the balance seems to be slipping, the left side looks ominous for White's territory.]
;B[ge]C[Definitely time for a hane I think.];W[dh]C[This seems like too close to White's thickness.

**It's way to close to his wall.  D-10 would be the move. but H-14 better than tenuki.]
;B[gf]C[This looks a bit dubious but I thought about how tremendous-looking it would be for White played here.

** Can't go wrong with playing near where you opponents wants to play (within reason).]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[be]MA[ce]C[Connecting solidly is better here. Prevents a peep later black can exploit.]
;B[eb]C[Not sure if this was the most efficient move.

**I won't fault it.];W[qm]C[**No joseki I've seen has this.  It demands a large knights move under q-4.  White should just Q-6 or O-3]
;B[pj]C[White so clearly wished to set up a base on the right-side that it seemed a good idea to pincer as well as set up a san-ren-sei.]
;W[po]C[**White need to goto the center P-4 or set up a base S-3.  Attaching means he's know's he's weak and want's to save the stones.]
;B[qp]C[Was this the wrong direction in which to stretch?

**Easier just to P-4.  R-4 is submissive.];W[mq]MA[nq][rn][oo]
C[Black's stones are looking a little heavy and vulnerable.

**Black is not heavy.  You seem to misunderstand the terms Heavy and Thick in your comments.  Heavy means a group of stones that are not easily sacrificed (too many) and not easy to live (no base or eye space.  Black has plenty of options. Just don't Tenuki yet.]
;B[oq]C[This seems wrong now, better simply O3?

*See previous.];W[no]C[Black is sealed in.

**Yes, but you can have a large corner while one of white's side faces you two stones and the whole has vunerabilities.  Trade offs are not bad.  It's not all or nothing in Go.]
;B[eo]SQ[hq]TR[ip][gp]C[I was aware of White's moyo potential and knew a reduction or invasion was required...I'm also almost certain this particular shoulder-hit move was not the best move at all.

**this is not a shoulder hit, it's a thank you move.  Shoulder hits are usually on the sides.  The  triangles shoulder hit the square for example.  When done on the 5th line like you did it makes for a fourth line crawl for white (the line of victory is the fourth line).

You need to play F-4 or D-6 if you want to break up his wide wing formation.  Another way is San-San invasion then play K-4 or D-10 right after to counteract the white wall that results.

O-16 is also a good move to make a big  moyo.];W[eq]C[Fortunately for Black White plays a less-than-good response ( better simply E4?).

**D-5 as it works with his upper left group];B[do]MA[cn]C[Black is able to have some effect on the left-side.

**C-6 is great as it can't be cut (the ladder is in black's favor at the moment).  Black has option to slide in corner or on the side after that.]
;W[ip]C[White consolidates the lower side.

**No, he has very big weakness that will cut down on territory.  G-4 is needed right now  but D-8 makes a great pincer against black also.]
;B[co]C[I played this hoping that White would be compelled to defend the corner thereby allowing Black to establish a base on the left-side.

**No, make a base with D-9.  When you're stable, your attacks are stronger from that area.]
;W[cp];B[dk]C[This seemed like the best extension.

** C-10 or D-10 now.  Rule of thumb is extend along the side one line plus one for every stone in the wall.]
;W[cj]C[See how black D-10 or C-10 would have worked to avoid this?]
;B[ck];W[dj];B[ek]C[Again I was nervous about playing the hane at E10.

**Jump out one space then to the center.];W[nc]C[White needs to invade the moyo.

**That was not a moyo.];B[lc]C[The pincer seemed best.];W[md]
C[This seemed like a strong response.

**Now this makes white heavy.(No eyespace, difficult to make a base. O-15 is best.]
;B[ld]C[**Good, this shows the folly of white's play.];W[mf]
C[Better the hane at M15?

**No, white needs to get to the center to friends.];B[pf]C[This seemed natural.]
;W[qh]C[This seemed like a damned good invasion to me!

**No, it's ends up making a wall for black that white is too near. Play Q-12 to force white to decide center or side.]
;B[oh]C[**Difficult to kill white but this move puts pressure on his center group.]
;W[qj]C[Like having the legs sliced off, horrible.

**It's a trade off is all.  White has major weakness on the bottom to exploit. Or just L-14]
;B[pk]C[It seemed better to disallow White Q9 than to consolidate the corner just yet.]
;W[qc]C[I was hoping for the invasion as I thought it might help me attack the O17 White group.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[pg]C[**pointless.  White corner is still weak also.  Even then, black get's a free play against N-14 group.]
;B[og];W[of]C[An overplay.];B[nf];W[oe];B[ne];W[mg]C[Allows the cut.

**I think giving up 10 pnts is good at the moment here. But this is too solid.  White must play lightly.]
;B[me]C[Black breathes a little easier, White has suffered a loss.]
;W[mi]C[White must make eyes in the centre as a matter of urgency?]
;B[pi]C[Black is allowed to connect.];W[qf];B[pe];W[oa];B[na]
;W[pa];B[nb];W[rd];B[qi]C[It seemed like a very good idea to push through here.]
;W[re];B[kf]C[Black builds territory while attacking the White group.]
;W[kh]TR[jh][mi][mg]C[White makes a good shape by capping Black.

** A cap is a 5th line play against a 3 rd line stone on the side.  It's meant to limit territory.  

This is a saki bottle.  The horsehead is considered better (made by k-12).  White has too many avenues of escape anyway ot the moment to kill.  You can still profit from annoying him.]
;B[lg]C[Better to have played something along the lines of O9?



I played this move in order to make this group heavy.];W[lh]
;B[nh]C[Again, I wanted to make the White group heavy and a better target for attack.]
;W[mh];B[gh]C[To help seal in the left-side White group and also to begin trying to isolate the central White group.]
;W[nk]C[White's central group beginning to look strong and resilient.

Black's group shut off from the centre.

**Center is very open with little profit thanks to black's facing groups on left side.  White has a heavy group in center that's not making territory although it should live.  Your right side can reduce much of white on the side.]
;B[ol]MA[gp][in][ho][rn][cf][ig]C[**Very weak.  Marked moves and others are better.  However, if played right, P-8 leads to capturing large piece of the side.]
;W[nl];B[fp]C[My plan was to lean on this side (this move made possible by White's less than optimal response of E3) and then eventually play H6.]
;W[fq];B[gp];W[hn]C[White gets there first.];B[hk]C[I wanted to puncture White's potential ca 40 points in the centre.

**there is no 40 points in the center.];W[fn]C[The price for my centre piercing.

**Again, trade offs are not bad.  Just play more into center or solidiify territory, reduce opponents.]
;B[gm];W[gn];B[dm]C[This seemed like a necessary, play-at-the-centre-of-symmetry move.

** Not necessary. Black's still connected.];W[fm];B[gl]MA[rn]
[gq][jl][ri]C[Bad. That's a two point stone.  All marked spaces and others are better as they are more points.]
;W[fl];B[fk];W[bk];B[bl];W[bj];B[im];W[in];B[jm];W[jn];B[km]
C[I think Black's thickness is more useful than White's K6 thickness.

The potentially large White centre has disappeared.

**Again, you misunderstand the term.  Thickness is wall of stones with little or no defects facing an open area on the side.  Neither of your groups (though no weakness) has potential to make territory.]
;W[kg];B[lf]MA[jf]C[**Again, you save one stone that has no real purpose.]
;W[om];B[kn]C[Wanted to reduce White's lower side as much as possible.]
;W[ko];B[hq];W[gq];B[hp];W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[es]MA[rn][ri][jg]
C[Too soon for the monkey jump?

Better L10 or K10?

**Marked spaces make for some point worthy plays.  By points I mean that territory you have versus what the opponent would have had.]
;W[er];B[fs];W[cr];B[bp]C[**Gote play];W[bq];B[bo];W[ds];B[gs]
;W[qo];B[rp]C[Better the hane at S5?];W[rh]
(;B[rj]C[Better R9?];W[rk];B[ql];W[ri];B[sj];W[rl];B[qk];W[rn]
C[Gote white.];B[jj]C[This seemed like an important point for both thicknesses.]
;W[kk];B[nr]C[I was suddenly unsure about the corner and wanted to ensure life.]
;W[mr];B[nq]C[I thought perhaps in this case the empty triangle was good.]
;W[np];B[mn]MA[jg][eg][ms]C[I'm trying to eat up as much potential White territory as possible by aiming at the cut of O7.]
;W[mm];B[lo];W[lp];B[nn]C[Again, aiming at the cut at O7];W[mo]
;B[ln];W[jk];B[ij]
(;W[if]MA[nm]C[White and Black miss something.

(See var.)

White and black miss the cut at O-7.];B[jf]C[I thought this was the strongest response.]
;W[ih];B[jg];W[jh];B[ig];W[hi];B[hm]C[By now I'd noticed the defect.]
;W[gj]C[It looked like my ideas of killing the central group were almost well and truly over.]
;B[gk];W[fg];B[gg];W[fi]C[Now I knew the chance had gone, all because of the defect at H7.

**As I said, there was no defect at H7.];B[gi]C[I played this as a probe, ie to see how White would play.

**That's not a probe.  It's a cut and not a good one.]
(;W[fj]C[I was expecting H 10 (see var).];B[hj]C[Black cuts and is now looking to gain in some way when White is forced to connect at O7.]
;W[kj]C[Unfortunately for White the cut threat is missed.];B[ll]
C[This seemed better than immediately making the cut as White would then be able to play M8 and have a larger space for making eyes.

**No, better to make him live small than let him connect.  He'll only have 2 points then.]
;W[lk]C[White has big mistake.];B[nm]C[Time for the cut.];W[ml]
;B[mj]C[The vital point I think.];W[nj];B[lj];W[ji];B[li];N[RESULT]
C[Result: B+Resign

**Not too bad.  You're doing what I did which was misunderstand terms (probe, thickness, caps, shoulder hits) which when you understand them will make your game better if implemented.

Don't be afraid to sacrifice stones for the greater good especially if  they have served their purpose.  Above all, keep playing.
