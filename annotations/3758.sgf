C[I played White.

White played some bad moves in the lower right and fell behind. The middle game fighting didn't change this, and black was far ahead going into the endgame.  But white found most of the big moves in the endgame and caught up for a close win.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[qe];B[dq];W[ed]
(;B[dc]C[This move is not good.  Playing one space to the right has a similar result, but black gets a bigger corner.]
;W[ec];B[cf];W[ic];B[mc]C[You could play the joseki, but then black would invade, so your move is fine.  You should be looking for a place to finish the joseki later.]

(;W[qj]
(;B[jq]C[This move is not the best.  Usually it is better to enclose the corner before extending down the side.  If you do play on the lower side you should go all the way to approach the lower right corner.  This move will probably end up on the wrong point after the opponent approaches the corner.]
;W[do]
(;B[fp]C[You would prefer to take a big corner by attaching at C5, but then your stone at K3 would be in a very bad spot.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[er]C[K3 is too close to the corner.];W[ck]
LB[cl:A]C[I would extend one space less, at A, because the upper left black stones are strong, but this move is ok.]
;B[nq]
(;W[no]C[This move is very bad.  It is too easy for black to come in behind it.  The normal move at Q6 is fine, and makes a nice shape on the right side.]
;B[pn]C[Good.]
(;W[op]C[This move seems to be questionable.

Yes, this move makes a bad shape.  You played first in the corner, but now you have three stones that are not enclosing any terriory. The black stone can easily escape.

I would make a bamboo joint at Q5 and attack.];B[pk];W[pj];B[ok]

(;W[qo]C[I wanted to keep on the pressure to the black group, but after move 33 I got nothing and Black got q2 and m4. Should I play on q2 myself?

I don't like this move either.  The black group is out (not surrounded) at P9, and your stone at R10 is already taking away the base, so there is no point in taking away the base a second time from the other side.

You could take the corner at P2, or invade at M3.];B[pr]
(;W[nm]TR[ni]C[I don't like this move.  When you attack, you should play moves that have some future benefit.  It's better to attack from O11 since that makes potential in the upper right.  This move can't make any territory to the left sicne black is strong there. 

If this move was to run with yor corner stone,s, it should be at m5 to flatten black's bottom.]
;B[oj]C[Good.  This is a very big point, to limit white's upper right.]
;W[ph];B[lp]TR[no]C[Now I feeled outwited.

Black did very well in the lower right, because of the bad move at O5.]

(;W[gp]SQ[fn]C[I think, I had to invade now, but is it the right point?

Black is pretty thick here, so the invasion is dangerous.  You need to worry about a double attack against your group in the lower right, which is not settled yet.

You could try to expand your left side instead, which leaves the game pretty close.

If you must invade, this is a good point.];B[go];W[ip]
(;B[jo]C[This is not the best attach since it leaves the good move at h5.]
;W[ho];B[hn];W[gn];B[fo];W[in];B[hm];W[io];B[fm];W[ml]
(;B[km]C[Nice splitting attack.];W[im];B[hl];W[il];B[kk];W[ij]

(;B[mj]TR[mk]C[Good.  Now white is enclosed.

I would look at the move one space lower first, since it is more likely to cut the other white group.]
;W[lk]
(;B[lj]C[If you peep first, you can stay connected to the outside.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[ll]
(;B[jk];W[jm];B[kn];W[ik]
(;B[ki]C[Playing one space to the left might be better,];W[ji]
;B[kj];W[rm]TR[fm]C[It seems, the white attack became successful. White is out of danger, because the black group in the center became weak.

Black has sente, and the center group has a nice wall, so it is not so weak.  

The stone at E7 threatens an invasion on the left.  You have forced black to make positions everywhere you had potential to expand your territory.  It's hard to see where you will make profit by attacking the black center group.]
;B[rd]
(;W[me]C[I wanted to play in this area, to keep pressure to the Black center stones. What´s your proposing?

I prefer O16 since it is sente.  Or you can just attack directly at L13 and make territory in the upper left.

This move is likely to be dame, and won't help you make any territory.]
;B[kg];W[ig];B[ke];W[re];B[qd];W[ie]C[I´m connected and so I`m happy.

You shouldn't be happy to run across the board on dame.  Your attacks should make some territory.]
;B[jh];W[ih];B[hi];W[ii];B[ci]C[Good move.  Black gets sente to take the last big point.

Black is ahead.];W[dl];B[br];W[aq];B[pe];W[qg];B[se];W[rf]C[Now n15 seems to be without function, but I think, the stone have done his work and there is still aji. What do you think?]

(;B[fg]C[Black b10 would be sente.

B10 is much bigger.  Black should take the sente moves first before reducing the white center.

And black should settle the center group.];W[bj]C[Good.  This double sente is huge.]
;B[bi];W[ld]C[Good.  The black group is stil not settled.  You save your stone with sente.]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[on];W[nn];B[nh];W[qq]C[I think, this is the biggest point now, what do you think?

Yes, good move.  J3/J2 is also very big.];B[db];W[eb];B[ea]
;W[fa];B[da];W[gb];B[qr];W[ql]C[Good.  Black should get this one, since it is big sente for him.]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[og]C[Is Black p13 necessary, or should he save his to stones?

If the black group was alive before, it is still alive, so saving the 2 stones is big.]
;W[pl];B[fe];W[gd];B[ej];W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[dg];W[iq]C[This move seems to be very big too.

Yes, it is huge.];B[ir];W[kc]C[Also huge.];B[rq]C[Small, and gote.  H2 is much bigger]
;W[rp];B[sr];W[jp];B[kq];W[lo]C[Black wanted to prevent White´s invasion to the lower edge, so I was able to catch 3 stones. This seems to be miai after Wj3.

This is big.  Black was quite a bit ahead going into the endgame, but white is getting all the big endgame points.]
;B[cm]C[An overplay. Press from the outside is still enough for Black, isn´t it.

This move loses a lot of points.  Black is still ahead so there is no need to invade now.]

TR[lg]C[This move, wasn´t the best choice. After 149 it seems to be one point to far.

I like this move.  You just need to continue at m13.  This reduces the eye space, and black might die, or give up something in the upper right corner.]
;B[mh]
(;W[pf]C[M13 instead];B[lg];W[eq]TR[cm]C[Big, and a direct result of black's bad invasion.]
;B[dr];W[fq];B[ar];W[fr]C[Now I got the stones around L6 and some points on the lower edge and I was happy. Now the game is very close.]
;B[es];W[ap]C[To attack the black group at f9 seems to be to risky. I hoped, I can win without this risk and I tought right.
