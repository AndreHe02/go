AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer.

This game I played a swedish 1 dan with 3 stones handicap. Quite early in the game white got the lead and of course he won quite comfortably in the end.

I have made some questions throughout the game, but appreciate comments wherever you find better moves.

My comments are prefixed with a TS:

Thx in advance.]PL[W];W[de];B[dc];W[fd];B[ce];W[dd];B[cd];W[cc]

(;B[pf]C[TS: Since white is strong in the upper left I did not want to play o16 here. May be p15 was better?

I believe o16 is the better move actually because white is strong in the upper left]

(;B[dj]C[TS: May be a peep at r12 and then around  q9 was better?

see variation];W[lq]
(;B[qq]C[TS: How should I respond here? Now white gets considerable territory  on the right.

the response at r3 is meaningless, you have no territory down there to defend anyway, since the space is open on both sides]

yes I think so, see variation];W[co];B[bq];W[do];B[ep];W[cl]

;B[je];W[ob];B[pb]C[q18 is meaningless because you can no longer kill white, and you have no territory in the upper right if white takes s16. a play at p11 or s2 is big]

;W[or];B[nr];W[qr];B[mb]C[TS: I feel those stones should be in trouble. May be there was a better way to attack?

I think this is a good way to attack, I do not see a way to kill this group and this ends off with the group only having 2 points, and you geting sente]
