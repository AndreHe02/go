C[X (all my comments will be prefixed by X, for Xopods):

Dear Reviewer,

I
felt I played well this game, and indeed, without komi, I came out three
points ahead.  Alas, there was 5.5 komi, so I lost by 2.5 points.  I noticed
two problems with my game; firstly, that I let myself get way too overconcentrated
in the top right, and secondly, that I was falling into the trap of "single
territory strategy."  So... how could I have played more lightly in the top
right, and at what point should I have started developing elsewhere instead
of improving my lower-side moyo?  Of course, miscellaneous comments are welcome
as well.  I'm sure I made some mistakes in the fuseki and endgame, but I'm
mostly interested in the middle game.  Of course, should you see any glaring
errors in fuseki or yose, feel free to correct those, too.

I'll try
to be as thorough as possible in commenting my own thoughts on the game.
 I hope you have fun reviewing this game; I had fun playing it.

pajaro:
Dear Xopods: I'll try to do my best with your game. Hopefully, your comments
will be of great help to do my job. My comments will be prefixed by pajao,
as you can see.];B[pd];W[dc];B[dq]C[X: I've heard that diagonal fuseki
usually favors black, as do opposed 3-4 points.  Since White gave me an opportuntiy
to arrange for both at the same time, I figured I'd take it.

pajaro:
Hmm... It's difficult to say, for me. Personally, I think that the best for
the first moves is to play where you feel most comfortable, according to
your experience and style.];W[pp];B[ce]C[X: I also heard that the reason
opposed 3-4 points favor Black is that Black gets the first chance to play
a kakari, which also serves as a (very distant) extension from his 3-4 point.
 So I did so.

pajaro: I think this is not right. Your C3 stone wants
to work along the bottom side, not the left side. So, a kakari in O3 would
be better now.];W[cd];B[de];W[fc];B[di]C[X: I was very happy with that
exchange.  It seems negative for White to play this way, correct? It already
looks to me like Black is winning, although at my level, anything can happen.

pajaro:
Right. White usually want to play this way when he already has a stone around
D10 and is develops along the 4th line, not 3rd.];W[nc];B[pf]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[jp]C[X:
This felt like a very good move to me.  White has the whole top side, but
there's an invasion to be made later at H17/J17, and all her stones are low.
 Black has an impressive moyo growing in the bottom left, and D11, D3, K4
sort of feel like a variation on the Chinese fuseki.  A White kakari in the
bottom left will be attacked strongly.

pajaro: Personally, I would
have played an extension along the right side. With K4, you are inducing
white to play the rght side, and can later attack your corner group.]
;W[qj]C[X: White takes the last big point.

pajaro: As expected. White can aim to take away black's base.]
;B[nq]C[X: Approach on the open side.]
(;W[np]C[pajaro: White defendes his position, but could also play S13 (see var).]
;B[mq];W[mp];B[lp];W[oq]
(;B[km]C[X:
This move might be a little bit mild.  I was trying to build up my bottom
left moyo, but this move is pretty much single-purpose.  Surely there's something
better.  Maybe R12, but then White answers at P10, and bottom right starts
looking big.  Would a boshi at P10 be any good?];W[rg]C[X: This White
move was extemely irksome.  Answering at e.g. S15 felt slow and heavy, but
to ignore this White move allows White to attack my eyespace.

pajaro:
At last!];B[re]C[X: I decide to play it safe, but I wasn't happy playing
this move.  I look very overconcentrated now, and I'll still have to add
moves to guarantee life later.

pajaro: OK. Now you see on your own what I've been talking about. See all my other comments.]
;W[co]C[pajaro:
white has invaded. Maybe first he should attack the UR group in order to
be stronger and get some cash. After that, he can invade without worries
and decide: must I invade, or a reduction is enough? He can know after securing
his territories a bit.];B[cl]C[X: Pincer the only option.  Is this the right pincer to play?

pajaro:
Seems right to me. Black is getting profit while attacking. A pincer on the
four line would allow white to get an easier life.];W[cq];B[dp]
;W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq]C[pajaro:
Good. You allowed an easy life for white, but got secure territory in exchange.
According that you can't get all what you'd like, I guess this is good enough.]
;W[or];B[cn]C[X:
Bottom and left side look nice for Black now, but this is the dangerous "single
territory" strategy I was talking about.  White is alive in the bottom left,
and has managed to develop in two regions of the board, while Black just
has one big moyo.

Pajaro: Don't forget that you can invade white's positions too. Why not H17? You can run to the center easily, for example.]
;W[pm]C[X:
White thinks that she's winning, I guess.  Seals off the right side.  There's
still the top side invasion for Black, but he'll have to start converting
his moyo into cash pretty soon if he's going to win.

pajaro: Yeah,
that's right.];B[fe]C[X: This move looked like a good, steady way to play.
 White F15 would be too good now; it would hinder the chances of a successful
invasion at H17/J17 while seriously reducing Black's moyo.

pajaro:
White F15... I think black would still be able to invade succesfully. I would
have played around K10, the bottom left seems to be the easiest way to get
territory.];W[jj]C[X: White decides that it's time to start reducing.
 At the time, I thought that this move was not deep enough, and that when
Black takes this opportunity to turn his moyo into cash, he'd end up ahead.
 Judging by the result of the game though, this must have been just the right
depth, reducing me just enough to win.

pajaro: It's hard for me to
say how deep you hace to reduce. It will depend on your skill to live, so
let's see how you deal with it.];B[il]C[pajaro: You seem to be trying to get territory right now.]
;W[gj]C[X:
White is playing lightly.  I could cut here, but that would complicate things
and I thought that defending my bottom territory would be enough to win.]

(;B[fl]C[pajaro:
Again...];W[if];B[gd]C[X: The idea here was that if White let me push along
the fourth line, I might be able to cut off the stones White is using to
erase my moyo.  Too optimistic, though.

pajaro: The idea must be:
you are strong, so attack. What you should have done was attacking the two
invading stones. For example, you can cut them as you tried in one of your
variations. Probably, you will end with a better result than white. Also,
after that fight, you will be even stronger, and will be able to eventually
invade H17/J17.];W[gc];B[hd];W[qb]C[X: Suddenly, my top right group is in a bit of danger.

pajaro: Again go back to the early comments.]
(;B[me]C[X:
Answering at S18 seemed too passive.   I thought about O15, because of O17,
but I've been told that the sake bottle/dog's head shape is negative, so
I decided to go one line futher.

pajaro: O15 bad? Not in my opinion. It is a safe jump, and will help you to get an eye. See var.]
;W[md];B[ne]C[X: That exchange seemed bad for White.

pajaro:
I don't agree. Black has played O15, which you didn't want to do. In exchange,
white has some more territory and black has less chances to invade. Suppose
that you play O15 first. Would you play N15 after N16? I guess no.]
;W[mj];B[rb]C[X: I still felt I didn't have enough room to live for sure if White got S17, so I decided to play carefully.

pajaro:
First, you can try to link up with H16. Probably you won't succeed. But while
you have a chance, white can't loose a move to play S17 and you you play
2 moves in a row. This way you will get stronger before securing life. Now,
white has sente.];W[ke]C[X: Seems small for White.  Surely the White
stones should be able to connect to either the right or the top without this
move.

pajaro: Maybe it's small in terms of territoy, but it supports the invading stones. Can you win as the game stands?]
;B[nd]TR[nd][pd][ne][pf]C[X: Making the table shape in sente seemed a good idea.

pajaro:
You are already pretty safe, and in this way you help white to connect his
stones even more. In the other hand, remember when you played N15. Well,
you have had to add two more stones to get good shape. Do you still think
N15 is better than O15?];W[ld];B[oj]C[X: At this point, I was starting
to have my doubts about whether I was really winning.  I decided to try this
somewhat risky move in the hopes that White would be scared for the life
of her center stones, and let me connect up to my top right, reducing her
right side in the process.  It worked reasonably well, I think.

pajaro:
Well, if you want to win, you must try something like that. But Cutting of
white's center stones seems impossible for me, after you forced such a strong
connection around L16.];W[ph]C[X: White tries to cut me off...

pajaro:
Of course. This is the kind of move you should have played when white invaded
you. Notice that he is also securing his side.];B[ni]C[X: But when I play this...]
;W[mm]C[X: She gets scared and decides to connect...

pajaro:
Hmm... I don't think white is scared. He can connect the upper and bottom
groups, so no danger yet. Rather, he seems to be getting more territory.]
;B[ng]C[X: ... and lets me connect.  Reasonable success, isn't it?

pajaro:
Your last three moves gave you no territry nor extra safety, while letting
white secure his positions. I don't think it's such a reasonable success
for black.];W[ef]C[X: Nice kikashi / reduction.  I have no choice but to answer, right?]
;B[ee]C[pajaro: White's invading stones are getting stronger ans stronger, and black isn't doing anything to avoid it.]
;W[eh];B[cg]C[X: Playing it safe.  After the reduction sequence on the right, I felt I was back in the lead.

pajaro: Rather, the last two white stones have reduced black's side.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[ae]C[X:
Seems too early for this, but whenever I'm in late middle game and say "Oh,
that's a big yose move, I'll ignore it and try to play something bigger,"
I end up losing more than I gain.  I really don't want to answer this, but
I end up doing so anyway.

pajaro: Yes, I know how you feel :) I know the theory too, but also can't help answering it.]
;B[bn]C[X: First, though, I decided to play this, since it's absolute sente.

pajaro: Good. That's the kind of thinking that let's you avoid being submissive to A15.]
;W[bo];B[af];W[ad];B[bg];W[an]
(;B[am]TR[rg][ph][qj]C[X:
Again, I'm answering when I know I probably shouldn't.  I just couldn't see
anything that was big enough to compensate for losing all the territory I
have on the left.  Maybe P9, since the three marked stones might die if White
ignored it.

pajaro: Yes, probably it would be the only alternative.];W[ao]
;B[bl];W[ll]C[X: This seemed like a fairly harmless move.  I decided to ignore it.]
;B[fi]C[X:
I was hoping that I might be able to kill something.  I didn't want White
getting any center territory around here anyway.

pajaro: Well, you
at last you are trying to attack. But now it is a little late. Attacking
the three white stones on the side could be bigger.];W[gg];B[gi]
;W[hj];B[fj];W[hi];B[hc];W[hb];B[ib];W[gb];B[jc]C[X:
Silly me... I thought this sequence was going to be sente... didn't realize
until after I'd played it that I'd have to defend at K17.

pajaro: You really musn't defend. You can take sente and play elsewhere, forgetting about your J18 stone.]
;W[jd]C[X: But White kindly decides to hand sente back to me.]
;B[kb];W[lb]
(;B[pk]C[X: And I get to play P9 after all.

pajaro:
Difficult, but perhaps I would have played R12 first in order to create some
aji. Maybe with some some sacrifice you can go deeper.];W[qk]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[om];W[pn];B[kh];W[on];B[nm];W[nn];B[lr]C[X: Gote, but seemed to be the biggest thing.

pajaro: What about R13? or S19?];W[nl];B[ol]
(;W[hl]C[X:
Strange, if White was going to play atari at O8, why not continue forcing
with Q10, then P11?  White seems inconsistent this game, starting one thing,
only to abandon it.

pajaro: Yes, in this case, white could force with
Q10 and reinforce in sente, but it is usual to play this way. Not always
right, of course.];B[hm];W[ik];B[jl];W[gl];B[gm];W[ki];B[lh]
;W[lo];B[ko];W[ln];B[nk];W[ml];B[pi];W[pj];B[ok];W[qi];B[oi]
;W[mi];B[mh];W[jh]C[X: Small gote, it seemed to me.

pajaro: Agree...];B[oc];W[ob]
(;B[la]C[pajaro: what about forcing first?];W[mb];B[qa];W[pc]
;B[qd];W[od];B[oe];W[kl];B[ds]C[X:
I tried to read out the corner.  I know Black can get ko or seki from a 4x2
box, but with a leg, it seemed impossible.  I decided that the hane was the
best I could do, since White would have to add a stone and it would be sente
for me.

pajaro: Hmm... I'm not sure.];W[cs];B[es];W[aq]C[X: Apparently, White knows her life and death too.]

but rather you should seek the way to make some damage to your opponent's

White might be happy, but black is safer. Also... Black can still invade
arounf H17, so the upper side is not white territory yet. And black can also
reduce around P7. On the other hand, black's moyo at the bottom left should
give black some cash. So black is not as bad as you think.]

For example. White is strong on the right. Hard to reduce now. Black has
a big moyo but it is quite open, and white can recuce/invade without worries,
as he is safe. Meanwhile, black will have to worry about the P12 cut. This
all was induced by black' boshi. Of course, other things could have happened,
but this only shows the need to secure the black corner group.]
