C[I was not sure if this was the correct move, but it did block the the side somewhat and expanded into the center so I saw nothing against it.
[Your reasoning is fair, but R11 may be better, since B can now play R14 and take all of right side.\]]
;B[od];W[oc]LB[qf:A]C[In retrospect, playing at A might have been a better move to try and create the Kite joseki considering he didn't have a lot of room on the side. [agree A seems better, and P17 is still a good move.\]]

C[I am sure as you are watching this you are thinking i need to work on my abilities at making territory in the center
[It's always hard to make territory in the centre. Try not to play so reactively though. B also has weaknesses that you can attack, rather than defending. The concept of collateral damage is that rather than letting your opponent keep playing first and you defending each move, you counter-attack. At some point the attacks will break and defences be put up, but you come out even rather than behind.\]]

C[Tengu04 [21k?\]: looks good to me
Ranxerox [22k\]: yes
Final score Black: 110; White 111.5

I think the score would have been a lot more pronounced with a larger gap between each of us, but i could not make my group in the south live, and that gave up quite a few dead stones.
[The two biggest suggestions I can make are:
1. If you have sente, play in an open area rather than make a contact play
2. If the opponent plays a reducing move, don't _automatically_ defend it. Look for a equally strong move elsewhere.\]]
