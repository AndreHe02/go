C[Thanks for reviewing my game. I play black and only just win.
Both of us make pretty bad mistakes and I dont think I deserved
to win really. A lot of my problems are lack of concentration
once the middle game starts + not starting well. Any ideas you
have to improve my game would be great.

Joachim: To me you made some mistakes in choossing the right direction.
And of course there are some problems with the correct shape,
as we all have them. :-)

The loss of the corner was big, but luckily for black white made
big endgame mistakes in the center and on the right side.

Personaly I had good experiences with looking at professionel games.
Maybe you can enjoy this too. If so, try to appreciate how solid they
sometimes play and see how they can attack even stronger later in the
game because of this.]PL[B];B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[pe];W[ed]
;B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[gd];B[cf];W[kc]C[Now I am unsure where to play. Is there a better place to play
now.

I think this is a typical situation were many moves are possible. It's just a matter of taste and a decision about for instance building up or destroing. P4, P3, C6, F3 or R10 are coming to my mind. I don't know if some of these is best.]
;B[oq];W[pn];B[kq];W[qg]C[Again I am uncertain where to play. My thinking is that r13 will
give white to much area if I don't do something so r11!!];B[qi]
;W[re];B[qd]C[R16 looks a little strange to me. The normal idea would be to shut white in with Q13.]
;W[ph];B[pj];W[ql]C[Now I want to attack s15 group .. but in hindsite I think I am
being overambitious. Is there a better way to attack or maybe
I should play somewhere else.];B[nh]C[I agree that it is not a good idea to attack directly. First black has to reinforce his stones at Q10 and R11. Maybe a jump to O10 is tha best black can think of. At least he is ahead in the run for influence in the center. After O12 white can seperate the black stones with a move at P11. The two black stones can come under severe attack, because white has a strong formation around R6.]
;W[ng];B[oh];W[og];B[qh];W[rg];B[pi]C[Q11 is very bad shape. O10 looks far better.]
;W[pg]C[I now think that q17 group is safe .. o17 s17 are mia. That q13
and q11 groups are balanced .. both weak. so play the next big
move which I see as c6 .. do you agree?];B[cn];W[fq];B[hq];W[cl]
;B[en];W[el]C[I just don't know whether c3 is right.];B[cq]
C[Instead of C3 the sequence black G6, white B4 and black C11 looks more natural.]

;W[ao]C[I dont realise that white can connect. I guess I should have
played d7 here];B[gn]C[You mean white has D6, D7, D5, E7 and C7 cut now? That is good for black. He can push through at D8 now and seperate the whit stone at E8. The white territory with the two captured stones looks rather small compared to the influence black gets towards the center.]
;W[hp];B[iq];W[hn];B[gm];W[ci];B[hm];W[in];B[im];W[fr];B[bs]
;W[jp]C[Now should I have played k3 here. I think so as the end reult
was not good for me.

I agree.];B[jn];W[jq];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir];W[lq];B[ip];W[kp];B[io]
;W[ho];B[jo];W[jm];B[km];W[jl];B[ln];W[il];B[gk];W[ll];B[kl]
C[Instead of L8 how about D5? Isn't black strong enough to kill the 13 white stones?]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[do];B[em];W[cm];B[kk];W[np];B[pp]C[Q4 is bad shape. R3 is the keypoint to settle the black stone.]
