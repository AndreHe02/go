C[This game is really fast to review 'cause i think i've done the wrong moves from the beginning.


**********

Hi, 

thanks for the chance to look at this game. I hope that you like the review. 

I think that the move you mention was a mistake, but not a game losing one. Rather than criicise individual moves, I think that you lost this game mainly because you seemed to lack a plan for what you were doing. Try to think how you are going to win the game - by settling a live group in the bottom/middle fast, then playing on the top so that white doesn't take too much territory.

I would also say:

1) (most important in this game): Try to be more flexible, and be prepared to sacrifice some of your stones. I think that the number one reason you lost this game is not the first 25 moves, but stubborn play in moves 25-80. You seem determined to save all your stones, even the unimportant ones. This let's white take a firm grip on the game, even if you save your stones. Better to let white capture some unimportant stones and take the initative elsewhere. 

2) Try to read a bit deeper. You play quite a few moves which look like they are good style, but which don't really work (e.g. moves 25, 71, 97). If you read a little deeper, perhaps you will find something more effective?]

(;W[qf];B[qd];W[qi];B[qk]C[So far so good. This is a nice extension, so I would not play R14 as white myself.]
;W[mq]C[This is an unusual move.

It feels too close to the enclosure.]
(;B[kq]LB[jq:A]C[Nice.

A is an alternative I like.];W[mo]
(;B[fq]C[This wanted to be an estention from L3 and an attack to D4.

-------

This move looks like you want to either:
make territory on the bottom, OR
start a fight. Neither is in you interests, I don't think. Better for you to make a safe group on the bottom and challenge white to make some territory.

However, it's not a game losing mistake at all.];W[hq];B[cq]
C[I don't like this move either. 

Your moves on the bottom seem confused - see the variation starting from move 11, for example.]

Yep, this is a wasted move.];W[gq];B[eo];W[dn];B[fo]C[I think answering the white threat to the corner is important.]

[fq]C[Why is the bottom side so important? 

you let white damage your bottom right corner AND get a ponnuki on the left because you keep playing on the bottom. 

Jump forward to about move 112 and take a look at the board. What happens is that you spend your next 35 moves (!) trying to save all your stones and taking no points of territory at all. 

On the other hand, white plays a lot of moves which surround the left side, capture some stones and win him the game. 

You are fighting in an area where white is stronger. Rather than trying to save ALL your stones, you should try to identify the important ones, and be prepared to sacrifice others to make the important ones safe. 

Here, the marked stones are not at all important in my view, so I would aim to sacrifice them here.
If you can save half of the stones here, you are probably ok, but you should try to make them safe as fast as possible, so you can play in other big areas.]

(;B[np]C[by splitting white's stones, you allow him to sacrifice some, and save some. I would not look to split them yet. 

Starting another fight when all your stones are still weak is dangerous. Better to settle your stones first, then play eslewhere.]

It ties up a liberty for your 3 stones, white's reply is automatic, and weakens the 2 other black stones.]

You would have preferred to take the o6 stone earlier.];B[nm]
