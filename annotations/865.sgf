   I'm asking for a review to a situation in the corner. This is actual
situation of my tournament game. I didn't find anything from FAQreferring
to sending problems, not whole games to you so I wished if there
was somebody who could tell me what is _really_ going on in this problem.

Why I wanted to send this was that that even the strongest players in the
tournament couldn't explicitely tell how will it end and these players are
3-5 dan. I'm myself 7 kyu and this problem is way beyond my reach.

   In the actual game, I played white and killed black's group. This was
extremely important because I would have been forced to resign if either
of my groups have died. I added few moves because they
were the moves that the strongest players in Finland suggested. So, I'll
hope that someone could tell me what is the best result for white in this
situation and that nobody will twist her brains off with this :)

Yours sincerely,
Mikael  Runonen]
(;W[cb]C[Suggested by Finnish players ...];B[bb];W[ea]C[Kurt: It seems to me the moves (C18 and E19) are very good.
The result should be a ko.  After E19, the sequence is as following ...]
;B[db];W[cd];B[dc];W[bc];B[ca];W[fa];B[da];W[ab];B[ac];W[ad]
;B[bf];W[bg];B[hc];W[ba])
(;W[bc]LB[cb:A][fa:B]C[Kurt: this line of play was suggested by nomad, 4d* IGS

W plays at B17 directly yields better results.

If B next plays 'a', he is killed.
If B chooses 'b', this leads to a ko, but it is a better ko for W.]
