;W[jc];B[mh];W[me];B[mc]LB[fq:A][cn:B][mp:C][ch:D]C[This move seems to be small and is no real threat for w. I would suggest a move in the lower left corner of the board, which is the last area where really big opening moves can be found. A might be better than B, because C is high and D is low.]
;W[jp];B[cn]C[Good, after w's last move this is the correct direction.]
;W[cl];B[en];W[fp];B[cj]TR[ch]LB[el:A]C[This move is too close to the marked stone and thus overconcentrated. Due to the marked stone w is not able to establish a base there. This is why I would suggest a capping move like A, which strengthens your two weak stones by attacking the lone w stone.]
;W[el];B[ej]TR[cn][en]LB[bk:A]C[Definitly wrong. The marked stones are weak and you have to add a move there. You thought that you can connect any time you want? Well, in that case A, which is really big, becomes w's absolute sente. Furthermore your move does not add much to the territory of this group. Thus, it is too small.]
;W[gl];B[hq]LB[gn:A][bp:B]C[You have already one weak group in that area, creating another one leads to a fight which cannot be in your favour. A is fine. If w protects his territory at the bottom that is no problem. It is not very big, because B is your sente, too.]

Let's do a rough count:
Black:
UL: 20
UR: 15
LR: 15
--> 50+ points

White:
UL: 15
LR: 12
LL: 15
--> 42 points

So you are leading by around 10 points. Playing a decent endgame should be enough.]

The worst thing w can do is playing B and getting 5 libberties too, but it is your move. Not to mention that you have a big eye with your group, which is a source of lots of additional libberties.]

[sb][sc]C[In conclusion I would say that this game showed one main weakness of your play: You are grasping much too eraly for small teritorrial moves, not addressing the balance of power or strategically big points. As examples I would name move #39, #45, and #47, which are all commented in the game.

One smaller thing: Sometimes it is necessary to have confidence in your reading. E.g. move #181, which is also commented.]
