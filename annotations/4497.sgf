C[Hi all, this is Ronald Wopereis from the Netherlands, woepwoep on both IGS and KGS. I will review for black.

RW> My comments preceded by RW my initials.];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp]
;W[co];B[jp];W[dk];B[jd]C[LB: Not sure if this is too ambitious, and whether I shouldn't be playing at the right side star point to start joining the top and bottom areas of influence.

RW> since black is a "raw beginner" as he states, there is nothing wrong with this opening.]
;W[qn]C[LB: "By the book" answer to knight's move approach by extending to the left.]
;B[np]C[LB: "By the book" answer to knight's move approach by extending to the left.

RW> excellent continuation for black.];W[qk]C[LB: It looks like I'm losing the chance to command the right side.

RW> no worries here. The game of GO is about making sure that each player gets an even share of the board. The one that ensures this gets the bigger share. So the goal is to make sure that your opponent is well taken care of, rather than depriving him of territory. So by letting white have the right side, while black gets the bottom side, black is still well underway to a great game.]
;B[pf]C[LB: Try to limit white's advance by extending downard.

RW> black is still ok here.];W[qh]C[LB: White has a pretty strong base. I'm just plain confused whether I should be defending the upper right corner or attacking White's base. Q12 looks like a way to assault white's R12 and also limit white's expansion into the middle.

RW> here black should feel safe with the moves he made, and expand along the unresolved territories. Good moves are here G17 and G3, perhaps even F3.

RW> with no white stone even NEAR the right upper corner, talking about defense is not much of use. It only means that black has no plan ; in which case white will win. Philosophically speaking, people most often learn by imitation, so as a beginner black should not be too worried about having no plan. The goal of playing then becomes to learn, and so losing the game is a consequence of this method of "learning by doing".]
;B[ph]C[RW> one of the ground rules in go is that one should never touch the opponent's stone, unless the situation requires it. In this case, there are many spaces wide open, e.g. F3 or G17. So there is no reason to touch the white R12 stone. 

RW> To "protect" the right upper corner, black Q14 is best placed at R15 or R14. 

RW> In this move however, a good protection is R17 , which effectively secures the corner area for black.]
;W[de]C[LB: Feeling slightly helpless, but realizing that I should be advancing on white. In retrospect perhaps I should have attacked near D4, where white is less solidly connected. I didn't like the sight of white's dominance in the upper left corner and wanted to box it in somewhat.

RW> white ignores the black Q12 move. Instead white creates a strong presence of the left upper corner. This is the expression of a choice to rather loose one stone (white R12) by gaining 20+ stones in the left upper corner.

RW> one of the lessons to learn here is that victory is in the unclaimed territories.]
;B[fd]C[RW> this is in fact a great move, from beginners perspective. Black seeks out to actively increase territory. Two problems here: one is that white can "dive" underneath the black territory by a move like G18 ; the other problem is where white can break the connection by placing a stone at H16. Nevertheless, in order to learn, one has to try all kinds of moves, so well done to black.]
;W[dq]C[LB: Now white has claimed the lower left corner. That might have been prevented if I had played D3 or E4.

RW> D3 or E4 perhaps possible, but far away from K4 stone. Best is to extend from K4, so maybe E3 or F4 better.]
;B[hd]C[LB: trying to make the best of a base in the top.

RW> EXCELLENT move !];W[nd]C[RW> this is an act of mental battle. If black responds by G3, the game is wide open.]
;B[ld]C[LB: Darn. O16 challenges my control of the top and top-right. Not sure how to attack this, but figure that expanding my base along the top can't hurt, and puts O16 in a pincer.

RW> black should just ignore the white move, and continue to play G3. This is where the real gain is, in those areas that are not yet settled.]
;W[pc];B[pe]C[LB: Perhaps this move was too timid? I want to cut between O16 and Q17, but playing P16 seems like begging to be surrounded. I'm afraid to play R17 because I usually end up boxed in when I play between white and the edge.

RW> yes , R17 required here. Being boxed in is a great way to learn the wrong way. Only when you are prepared to make mistakes, you might learn something. The problem with mistakes is not to make them, but rather to repeat them.]
;W[qc]C[RW> this move is really where white wins the game. This one move R17 means white lives. At any one time white can create two eyes and live in the corner.

RW> this sequence of black not playing R17 when required, and subsequently black playing R17, shows one more ground rule of go. This rule states that the move that white wants to do, is the best move that black can do, and vice versa.]
;B[oc]C[LB: Now I go for the cut between O16 and Q17.

RW> black is playing the beginner's game of defense. This is a well-known scenario for every one who entered the game of go as a beginner. But please do understand that reacting never wins a game. Initiative - nonreaction - does. In this case : G3.]
;W[hq]C[RW> this is a great move for white. It is true, even if the two stones Q17 and R17 are lost for white, about 10 or more moves are needed for black to settle this "conversation".]
;B[qi]C[LB: I probably shouldn't ignore the approach at H3, but white's encroachment near the upper right is bothering me. Here I try to assault the stone at R12 and also separate it from the stone at R9.

RW> a common beginner's error, one that happened to me and probably still does, is to start a fight, and then to get distracted instead of finishing what one started. So in this case, P17 was the beginning of a battle, and O17 should be the next move.

RW> R11 is not a bad move, it is just that attention is distracted. Playing on the defense is not going to win the game. Decision making is required here. What to do - and once decided : how to proceed?]
;W[eh]
(;B[ok]C[LB: Keep attacking white on the right side, and apply some influence toward the center.

RW> for black this one is important : as a rule of thumb, never to play beyond the fourth line unless all sides and corners have been settled. Black P9 is really an invitation for white to stay on the right side, and occupy the territory below.

RW> yet another rule (go proverb) says there is no territory in the center. So it makes no sense to try and claim the center as territory.]
;W[rp]C[LB: I have a bad feeling about this.

RW> white should have done this much earlier. Excellent move for white.]
;B[ql]C[LB: Separating R9 from R6, but I feel like I'm sticking my neck out.

RW> there is nothing wrong with throwing in one stone and accepting its loss.  The thing is , here , that there is no plan.]
;W[rl];B[pl]C[LB: Strengthen R8 before white can go for atari.

RW> great move for black !  this is what i meant earlier by following through one's plan, and to get nondistracted.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[LB: This feels like a mistake. I want to defend against white's group in the lower right corner, but I'm letting myself be boxed in and giving up the corner. Perhaps R5 or R6 would be more aggressive.

RW> this is the best black can do right now.];W[ho];B[jn]C[LB: Assuming my control of the right side is still strong, chasing white with one-point extensions seems like a good way to divy up the board.

RW> yes, true. But like i said before, there is no reason yet to play beyond the fourth line. White could easily play K2 now.]
;W[hm];B[jl];W[hk];B[jj]C[LB: Finished with the chase.];W[on]
;B[pn]C[LB: White seems to be making a play for the middle. Splitting the stones seems safe enough, since I can connect either above or below. I'm trying to kill white's groups in the lower left.

RW> ok great. let's see what happens next.];W[po];B[pm]C[LB: Q5 put Q6 in atari, so connecting up is madatory. This is what I expected.]
;W[oo]C[RW> it seems to me that the plan of isolating white P6 did not succeed ? If this is the conclusion, what can be said about the effectiveness of black Q6?]
;B[nl]C[LB: The white group surrounding Q7 seems strong--I must have screwed up. O8 seems like a way to prevent white from running for the middle.]
;W[qg];B[qf]C[LB: White wants to live in the middle right. I'm just not sure what to do about it. R14 feels necessary because my group in the upper right seems to be in danger.

RW> P16 and Q13 are two escapes for black, so there is no danger until one of the two points is occupied by white.]
;W[ri];B[rj]C[LB: Here I know I'm starting to get in over my head. I want to cut white's base in the middle, but it feels like the stone at S10 is walking into a trap.

RW> yes, Q11 seems much safer.];W[qj];B[pj]C[LB: I want to kill the pair of stones at R9-R10, but can't see how to do it.]
;W[rm]
(;B[oi]C[LB: Stone at R11 is in atari. Protect it while trying to keep motion toward the middle.]
;W[od];B[rk];W[ob];B[pk]C[LB: I've killed the two stones i wanted, although I've sacrificed the stone at P17. I think I can still kill white in the lower right now.

RW> while black kills two stones, white expands from the right upper corner. The last 10 moves did not lead to any gain for either side. Black regained control over the mid right side, while white expanded its presence in the upper right corner.]
;W[jr]C[LB: White tries to invade around my wall in the middle. I can't worry about that too much right now, because I'm too worried about killing white's forces already in my territory.]

(;B[rh]C[LB: Keep attacking white in the middle, and indirectly reinforce black in the upper corner.

RW> the three white stones were already dead. S12 not necessary.

RW> Still i can see why black wants to be sure. Such insight will increase by playing lots of games. So great move ! if you dont know for sure, make sure! yes.]
;W[hh];B[jh];W[fb]C[LB: Now white's invading on two fronts, at F18 and K2. I need to block one of these attacks, and I'm more worried about the top.]
;B[gb]C[RW> great move by black.];W[nf];B[ne]C[LB: White is becoming strong in the upper corner. I need to keep white from connecting up and making eyes.

RW> this is the same situation as the black Q6 move, earlier on in the game. The conclusion there was, that Q6 did not succeed in blocking the white entrance of P6. Same conclusion here : white can not be stopped by O15.]
;W[oe];B[me];W[of];B[pg]C[LB: If I don't play here, black is dead in the upper corner.

RW> black S13 also possible. When white Q13, then black kills with P13. Current black move Q13 is best.]
;W[qp];B[mg]C[LB: Now it feels like I can kill white in the upper corner.

RW> P17 still under attack. White O17 kills P17 instantly.]
;W[pr];B[mc]C[LB: Although I'm feeling scared about the bottom corner, I feel that I must press the attack in the upper corner.]
;W[nc];B[na]C[LB: From here, connecting to N17 should keep white from breaking out of the corner. It's starting to look like I'm in big trouble, though, because white has lots of room for eyes in the upper corner, and I have no idea what to do about it.

RW> yes. white lived from the moment R17 was in place.];W[mn]
C[RW> At this point in the game, white leads by 100+ points.]
;B[nn]C[LB: Again keep trying to prevent white from connecting forces.

RW> yes, same conclusion as with earlier moves R6 and O15. White can not be stopped by such sequence.]
;W[no];B[lp]C[RW> this move M4 from black is a great move, yet at the wrong time. Now that white breaks into black territory, it no longer serves its original purpose. White has crawled "behind enemy lines"]
;W[mb];B[nm];W[mo]C[LB: White's making a run for the middle, but I think I can contain it.

RW> The point is here that white has no interest in creating territory. His plan is to destroy the black territory.]
;B[mp];W[md]C[LB: This puts N17 in atari, but I didn't really notice it during game play. I'm feeling somewhat confident that I can still kill white in the upper corner.

RW> S19/T18 are two of the possible eyes for white. How would black prevent these two eyes from coming into existence ?]
;B[si]C[LB: Looking back this feels like a waste of time. I should have been much more defensive in the upper corner.]
;W[le];B[rg]C[LB: I can't resist taking more pieces. My original objective of getting white out of the right middle seems to be complete.

RW> yes. now that this mission is completed, the next step is to consider this right middle section as a firm base, and expand your territory from there. Also, with the firm base living, you can now safely enter enemy territory : all stones that are somehow connected to this firm base, they as alive as the firm base is alive.]
;W[kd];B[kc]C[LB: Definitely should have played M17; double atari there was devastating to black.

RW> if black M17, white L17 and black is dead. This move not bad at all. 

RW> instead of playing at the top, black might want to consider heading for the connection with the "firm base" at the right middle section. So instead of playing L17, black might play N14 or L15 instead. Another great move is J14 - saving the black stones on line 16.]
;W[lc];B[mf]C[LB: A desperate measure to escape downward.

RW> great move for black. well done.];W[kb];B[jc]C[RW> another great move for black. This shape of three stones (L17 , K17 , K16) is a very strong shape. Just count how many white stones it takes to kill such black group.]
;W[ll]C[LB: I probably shouldn't have ignored this!

RW> it is the consequence of playing N4. In go you can either destroy enemy territory ( black N4 ) or gain territory ( black M8 ). If you can do both with one move, then you are no longer a beginner :-)]
;B[ke]C[LB: Still trying to contain white.];W[lm];B[jf]C[LB: Have I lost the right half of the board yet? If so, I didn't yet realize it.

RW> no you did not. What you lost was not the stones, but the territory. 

RW> What matters is not if stones are on the board ; rather it is the space in between the stones, that which is called territory. By white's entrance into black territory, he effectively destroys all points that black made by occupying territory.

RW> by the way, great move ! this is both a defense and an offence move. Two purposes in one move - that is a sure sign of learning !]
;W[ld];B[sl]C[LB: This move feels pointless. White is way too powerful in the top, and I'm neither fancing her in nor killing her group.]
;W[op]
(;B[nq]C[LB: This was stupid. The two stones there are dead.

RW> yes also dead in the variation. So this move much better than black P3. See var.]
;W[oq]C[LB: Now white owns the lower right corner, but I don't seem to realize how hopeless it is.]

(;B[jb]C[LB: Still trying to contain white.

RW> more than this, black is also creating territory - the open space at H18 / J18 . So this is truly a great move.]
;W[ja];B[ia];W[ka];B[hb]C[RW> excellent series of moves by black !]
;W[lj]C[LB: At this point, I'm getting the punishment I deserve for letting white break into my center.

RW> dont worry about territory in the center. It is much more work to create territory in the center than at the sides, and much more work to create territory at the sides than in the corners. Go proverb says : there is no territory in the center.]
;B[lk]C[LB: Desperate attempt at a cut.

RW> fourth time, same sequence as R6 etc. It's not gonna work.]
;W[kk];B[mk]C[LB: This should at least slow white down.];W[lf]
C[LB: White is breaking toward the middle, but is also too close to owning the entire corner. I have no idea whether to try and contain white, or to try and prevent her getting two eyes.]
;B[rc];W[rd]C[LB: I'm dead. But I'm also lost. Probably should have tried to confine white to the corner by playing S16 or R16?

RW> yes. Better still is L10 , because that would make sense after M9 and N9 sequence. Also, white M13 puts black group N14 in danger. So by reciprocy, M13 should be a great move for black.]
;B[qb]C[LB: Hopeless waste of a move.];W[kj]
(;B[ra]C[LB: Now I'm throwing away the center by fighting a lost cause in the corner.

RW> now one more move is needed (black T18) and black lives with two eyes in the corner (S18 and T19).]
;W[sc]C[RW> unfortunately for black, white sees the danger of black T18 and acts upon it. Now black is dead.]

(;B[rb]C[LB: Worst possible move. Ridiculous.

RW> black could try an atari game by playing T18 instead of S18. If it works, then S18 and T19 are the two eyes.]
;W[qd];B[pb]C[LB: Beyond ridiculous. I've now wasted five moves.

RW> still two eyes possible if black plays Q19 and T18. The eyes are then on R19 and T19.]
;W[lh]C[LB: This is crippling. The group in the corner that I failed to kill is now joining the group in the center that I failed to kill.

RW> the point is, white O17 group lives. So any expansion from this group also lives.]
;B[re]C[LB: Way too late, I try to save my territory in the middle.

RW> now K9 is serious threat to black losing K8 et al stones.]
;W[nh]C[LB: White now has a lot of power in the middle.

RW> black N13 group now dead.]
(;B[qe]C[LB: Perhaps N12 would have been better?

RW> N14 group is dead because of the white stones M12 and O12, effectively preventing any black escape. 

RW> However, there is a gain here. See var on how to bring black S18 unsettled group to life. (black T18, then black Q19)]
;W[sb]C[RW> black T18 is good for black (see var on previous move) so this must be a great move for white too]
;B[se]C[LB: Now white is confined in the corner, at least.]
;W[sd]C[RW> now black group R18 is dead];B[sa]C[LB: What in the world was I thinking?!]
;W[oc]
(;B[og]C[LB: Desperate to keep white in the upper corner, but have no real idea how to accomplish that.]
;W[ng];B[mi];W[mh];B[li];W[ki];B[ni]C[LB: I think I've saved my control of the middle right, but lost all chances to keep white's upper corner from breaking out.

RW> for black, N11 can connect to the "firm base" two ways : via O11 and via N10. So unless one of these two points is occupied by white, there is no need to play O11 right now.

RW> urgent move needed for black : K11. See white's next move.]
;W[ji]C[RW> now the K-line is no longer black's.];B[ii]C[LB: My top priority is to finish a wall up the center.]
;W[ih];B[ik]C[LB: J13 would have been much smarter, I think.]
;W[jg];B[ig]C[LB: Too late now.];W[kg]
(;B[jk]C[LB: I think J15 would have been better.];W[ec];B[fc]
C[LB: White's putting the squeeze on me. I want to save some territory in the upper middle.]
;W[eb];B[kl];W[hg];B[if];W[ge];B[fe]C[RW> excellent move by black]
;W[ff];B[he];W[gf];B[hf];W[gd];B[gc]C[LB: I've been squeezed badly, but can defeinitly form two eyes here.

RW> yes, excellent !];W[sm];B[sk];W[hj];B[ij];W[hi];B[kf]C[LB: Now I have a false sense of confidence that I can still own the lower right corner. I just can't seem to assess where the biggest threats are.]
;W[lr]C[LB: My punishment for ignoring K2.];B[oh];W[im];B[jm]
;W[ee];B[ga]C[LB: My tiny bit of the upper middle is alive.]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[kh];B[ic]C[LB: Finish making eyes just to be safe.]
;W[qm];B[ln];W[mm];B[om];W[ml];B[nk]C[LB: Now my chunk of the middle right is secure, but it too has been squeezed badly. It looks like there's no way for me to make much more territory. The area around K5 looks like my last hope to complete  a live group.

RW> K5 group is dead.];W[ed];B[fa]C[LB: Waste of time, trying to reduce white's territory by a lousy one point.]
;W[ea];B[iq]C[LB: FINALLY I try to finish that last group.]
;W[hp]
(;B[ir];W[il];B[is]C[LB: Am I being too greedy here? Instead of locking up a little area, I've separated white and hopefully made a bid for the bottom middle.

RW> by all means ,   you did the right thing. nothing tried is nothing gained !]
;W[nr];B[lo]C[LB: Big mistake? O2 builds a large base for white, which I'd like to break up somehow. Maybe N2 would have been better?

RW> this move M5 is excellent !];W[dj];B[io]C[LB: Give myself as much room as possible for my last group.

RW> yes, two more black moves and the black group is back alive again. The eyes for this group would be K5 and L6]
;W[gs];B[hn]C[LB: Too bold, I think.

RW> yes. needed now is structure, like J6.];W[gn];B[in]C[LB: Defended myself successfully, I think, but lost a move.]
;W[kq];B[ip]C[LB: My outer wall is complete, but white may now have too strong a base inside my territory.]
;W[gl];B[kp]C[LB: I'm a chicken. This gives me four points, but probably gives up about 12 points down below.]
;W[hs];B[hr]C[LB: Another wasted move trying to harass white out of one point.]
;W[gr]
(;B[mr]C[LB: Finally I try to kill white's group.];W[ms];B[lq]
C[LB: I'm positive I can kill white here, but I really have no idea how.]
;W[kr];B[js];W[ls];B[mq]C[LB: I have no idea what I should have done here.]
;W[km]C[LB: Whoops! I thought I owned those four points?!];B[jq]
;W[kn];B[os]C[LB: Now I'm completely desperate.];W[ns]
