C[sjsi: hi

Todd:  I'll try to preface my comments with my name.  Hopefully these comments and variations are helpful for you.  I'll focus on black, but also make comments about white's play.]
;B[pd]C[Jernej: Hi, let's have a nice game!];W[pq];B[cd];W[cp]
;B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pm];W[qf]C[Todd: This is a poor move by white - it breaks the joseki.  The proper move for white is O3.  Generally, if an opponent doesn't follow joseki, you should take their spot.  However, I understand here the temptation to respond to the white stone first.]
;B[qh]C[Todd:  However, this is too far out.  Stick with the joseki for black, too - R10 is the proper move, I believe.  It's a good move - it attacks white, prevents him from making a two-space extension to R11, and creates a very solid foundation for you in the lower right, which would be very helpful in turning to attack the lower right with a move like O3.]
;W[qj];B[oh]C[Jernej: Still there?];W[oj]
(;B[nd]C[Todd: I'm not sure about this move.  Sure, it extends your upper right, but you're in a good spot now to attack white - instead, this move gives white a chance to help his stone escape.  A pinching move like R15, perhaps, or Q14.  A move like Q14 might still allow white to escape along the right edge (see the variation) but sets up, potentially, a large upper territory for black.]
;W[rd];B[of]C[Todd: I think you could close tighter against white at Q14, and this is generally a pretty slow move - O3 remains available, as well as attacking anywhere in the lower left, or extending along the top.  Don't feel that you have to keep responding to white.]
;W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[qi];W[rj];B[si]C[Todd: This move is wasted.  Take this opportunity, ignore what white is doing (white can easily live with R17, so you can't kill the white group in the upper right, and the middle one can escape to the middle) and go elsewhere.]
;W[qc];B[pj];W[pk];B[pi];W[ql];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk];W[pl];B[nn]
;W[om];B[on];W[qm];B[pn]C[Todd: If you want to continue to harass the white group here, I'd play down to S6 instead, and invite white to start a ko around Q6.  This move simply allows white to easily connect - if white is going to connect, make it difficult.]
;W[rn];B[ec];W[gc];B[ic]C[Todd: This attack is too far out, much like the attack you made at R12.  Right idea, but one thing I like to do it keep it far enough away to not invite white to attack it from the other side, but keep white from making a two-space jump.  L17 is ideal, here, or maybe K17.  I think J17 is too close.]
;W[ob];B[mc]C[Todd: M17 here - N17 is too overcrowded.  Let your stones breathe a little.  Plus, M17 invites L17 for white, which he does next.]
;W[kc];B[ie];W[oc];B[od];W[ge];B[ke];W[ee];B[cf];W[dd];B[dc]
;W[df];B[cg];W[eq];B[mq]C[Todd: O3 is the original extension of the joseki, but now that white's lower right is alive (since it connected to the right side), I'm not sure that O3 is the best.  I still think it is - N3, your move, is much more easily separated from your black "cross" formation in the lower right.]
;W[hq];B[jq]C[Todd: Good - solid, 2-space extension.];W[cj]
;B[cm]C[Todd: I think, rather than splitting the difference between white's two stones on the left, I'd play up at C8.  Stay away from the corner if possible - the lower left corner is more powerful than the single white stone at C10.  If you're going to approach white's C10 to attack it, move closer.  (Plus, if you move closer, at C8, you can at least get in C6 and have a one-space jump on the third line - still pretty narrow, but here you haven't left a lot of room for yourself to work.  In being indecisive, you've lost some opportunity.  If you want to attack C10, attack it.)]
;W[em];B[dl]C[Todd: This move is terribly slow - maybe my least favorite move of the game so far.  Black should work on establishing a base.  Attack C10 at C9, or play B9 and B5 and establish a low base.  Even D9, if you really want to escape to the middle, is probably better than D8, which just sort of sits there.]
;W[ej];B[el];W[fl];B[dj];W[di];B[dk];W[ch]C[Todd: I think, if I were white, I'd have been more inclined to play E9 and keep black out of the middle.  White ends up basically just /letting/ you get to the middle, which, a few moves ago, he seemed determined to stop.]

(;B[fk]C[Todd: I'm really not sure here, but I think I would play D13 instead.  D13 is powerful.  It cuts the middle left white group and the top white group from one another.  Separately, those are both really weak groups.  Together, they're unstoppable.  See the variation.]
;W[dg];B[fj];W[fi];B[fm];W[fn];B[gm]C[Todd: Why not capture here?  Leaving white's F8 is asking for trouble later.  Also, this move and the few that follow are simply allowing white to make a large lower left territory.]
;W[gn];B[hm];W[io]C[Todd: It I were white, I would have played this around D6 to keep black out of the corner.]
;B[jn];W[hh]C[Todd: Bad move by white - not sure what it accomplishes.  White should either:

a) play around K5 to break into black's lower middle,

b) play around O4 to do the same AND try to separate black's cross, or

c) Play around D6 to protect the corner.];B[ii];W[nj];B[mk]
;W[jj];B[hi]C[Todd:  Not sure where you're going here.  J10 is a relatively unimportant stone.  Remember that you don't have to save EVERY stone in the game.  Plus, J10 is reachable on all four sides, really.  If I were you, I'd worry about O10-P10.]
;W[gj];B[gi];W[gh];B[ih];W[mj];B[lh];W[lk]C[Todd: I think this is pretty bad for black BUT I can't complain about a move like M12 that creates a large space for black on the top.  So probably a good choice.]

(;B[cn]C[Todd: This move seems wasted.  Don't let white dictate where you play, and don't feel obligated to follow white around.  F16 is a good move.  See variation.]

;W[sc];B[rf];W[sf];B[qg];W[se];B[pe];W[pf];B[pg]C[Todd:  Even here, white O17 can kill your group, forcing you to fill in the fake eye at N16, and then eventually the fake eye at P15.]

(;W[jm];B[km];W[jo]
(;B[kn]C[Todd:  More valuable than this move is J2, which forces white to respond.  Don't, again, get stuck in the habit of responding to white.  Also, moves like B5 or P2 are good.]
;W[ir];B[gk];W[hl]C[Todd: Overall, apart from a couple obvious mistakes, you played decently.  However, keep in mind that against a marginally better player, your large black group in the upper right would be dead and game would be a total loss.  As it is, not a good resultfor black anyway.  You were far too passive in letting white dictate the flow of the game.  Before you click and respond to white, ask yourself if there's a better move.  If you choose to not respond to white but play elsewhere, if your move is somewhere that requires white's response, then you really haven't lost anything.  You can always go back later.  Keep the pressure on your opponent.

Also, note that you lost 3 of the 4 corners.  Not good.  I would guess 75% of the time, the winner of the game is the one that has 3 or 4 corners.  The corners should be your main concern.  Your upper right territory that you tried to form in the middle of the board was eaten away to nothing.  It's enormously hard to make much territory in the middle anywhere.

I hope this helped!  Keep playing!])

(;B[dg];W[eg];B[eh];W[dh];B[ei]C[Todd:  Here, white is stuck.  A ladder won't capture your E11-E12 group, since it will atari white at E13 or E10.  If white doesn't protect his triangle at C12, that will be trouble.  As soon as white protects his triangle, F10 makes for a good capture and connection for black.  There are a couple variations on the next move.]

;W[de];B[bd];W[ag];B[bf]C[Todd:  This is a really rough approximation, but you can see that white is divided into not two, but THREE weak groups.  Black's upper left is in good shape, the middle left is ok, and the center group is weak, but can escape and probably outlive the weaker white groups.]
