C[Played on the Kiseido Go Server.

Black won by 12.5 points.

I played white.

-----------

Alex: This was an interesting game to review: both players had many chances to win.  You seem to be very good at saving your weak groups.  What would be even better would be not to make so many weak groups in the first place!  Also, I think you have reached a stage where you can learn a lot from studying joseki: not by memorising the moves, but by thinking about the ideas behind pincers, extensions, etc.  That way you will find it easier to form a clear plan in the opening.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]
(;W[ce]C[Alex: You asked about the choice of joseki here.  This move is good: it's the simplest and most natural way to play.  The alternative is to play a pincer (see variations), but it's only a matter of style.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc];B[ck]C[Here i feel that i chose the wrong joseki for the situation.

Black stones seem to have more influence around the board while white corner stones are isolated.

----

Alex: This joseki is fine.  It's true that black has more influence.  However, white has about 15 points of secure territory at the top left, whereas black has _no_ territory yet.  This should be a fair trade.

It's important to realise that black's position on the left is not as strong as it looks, because C12 is a serious weak point.

If you search at gobase.org you will find 33 professional games with this exact position.  In the variations to the next move, I've given examples from four of those games showing how to exploit the weakness at C12.]

(;W[nq]
(;B[lq]C[Alex: What is the plan behind black's pincer?  See the variation.  In fact, M3 is a mistake here.]

(;W[no]C[Alex: Because there is no stone near Q10, white can do better by invading the corner: see variation.]
;B[pn]C[Alex: Now, an important general principle of pincer joseki is that, if black can't connect his stones, then white has the opportunity to attack on one side or the other.  Black's weak points are R8 and L4.]

(;W[nm];B[fq]
(;W[ip]C[I thought that it would be a mistake to let black settle himself too easily, but after the game it seems that J4 might have been a mistake. White ends up with weak groups.

Having said that, I still have no idea what would have been better than J4 in this situation.

My three stones on the O line seem to be doing nothing useful.

---------

Alex: Yes, it is clear now that O7 was a mistake.  Even so, if you strengthen your own position first, you can prepare to attack later.]
;B[fo];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ir]
(;W[ql]C[Alex: This lets black separate your stones.];B[pl]

(;W[qo]C[Alex: Invading this way strengthens black and hurts your stones on the outside.]

(;B[qp]C[Alex: Black was kind to you here.];W[pq];B[qm];W[np]
;B[qk];W[rp]
(;B[po];W[nc]C[Alex: So, both players made mistakes in the lower right.  The game is still close: white has more territory, black more influence.  It's important now to play solidly, not leave weak groups for black to attack.]
;B[lc]C[Alex: This time, the pincer is exactly the right move by black.]

(;W[ne]C[Alex: Because you have a strong position at top left, there is another joseki you might like to try (although this one is OK too).]
;B[pf]
(;W[qc]TR[ne][pf]C[Alex: If you want to invade the corner, then the exchange of the triangled stones is bad for you: it's better to play R17 first (without O15).  But even better here is to press at L16.]

(;W[qe]
(;B[nb]
(;W[mc]C[Alex: This is where things started to go bad for you.  You've taken all four corners and have a territorial lead now.  You should treat the O17 stone lightly, sacrifice it, and concentrate on making sure that you have no weaknesses for black to attack.]
;B[mb];W[pe];B[qd];W[rd];B[re]
(;W[sc]C[Alex: It might be better to sacrifice the corner (a difficult decision!)--see variation.]
;B[qf]
(;W[se]C[Alex: This move is dubious for two reasons:
1.  It's aji-keshi: you might find later in the game that it would have been better to play P15 instead;
2.  It's sente for white, but gote for black, which means that the opportunity to play here is not going to go away.]
;B[oe];W[rb];B[me];W[nf];B[nk]C[Alex: Now black has seized the initiative.]

(;W[rf]C[Alex: This is too small, and gote.  The most important thing now is to look after your weak stones.  There are a few possibilities here.]
;B[rg];W[qe];B[mf];W[ng];B[mg];W[nh]

(;B[lk]C[Alex: Another mistake.];W[nl];B[mk];W[kh];B[nd]
(;W[oi]C[Alex:  What does this move achieve?  You're just making your own stones heavier.]

;W[nn];B[fe];W[if];B[ge];W[ie];B[gh];W[hc]C[Alex: Now your stones are safe, and the game is close again.  Well done.]
;B[ih];W[jh];B[hk]LB[in:a][cj:b][bg:c]C[H9 was a difficult play to answer. Black threatens to take territory on the left and bottom.

Alex: This is a good time to count the score.
For white--bottom left, approx 6 points; top left, 18, top right 8, bottom right 10, komi 6.5, total approx 48
For black-- top, approx 10; right side approx 20, left and bottom hard to estimate.

Your task now is to make sure that black takes no more than 18 points at the left and bottom.  This isn't going to be easy!  I see two possibilities.  Either try and rescue the J4 stone, in which case the bottom is reduced to almost nothing.  Or invade on the left.  I would play at one of a, b, or c.]

After connecting at K7, you have to sacrifice your M2 stones to make the centre group live: this is a big concession.]
