C[I'm white. Thanks in advance for reviewing! Please don't hold back, criticise everything you can see. :)

A: Hello, My name is Avi and I am about a 3K Israeli player on IGS. Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting game.

Please do not take my comments for granted - I am not that strong...

My comments are prefixed with "A:".
I think that at your level you should work on the basics, namely:
- Basics of attack and defence
- Life and death problems.

See detailed comments inside.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[qf]
;W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[qd];W[qc];B[qg]C[A: Severe mistake by Black - White should not be allowed to play R15 - this is a vital point. Possible plays: S16, S15 or R15.]
;W[qe];B[nc]C[A: Another mistake of Black. Now that White effectively captured R16, his group is strong - so Black should stay awy from it. Possible play: Q9, in the direction of the star point.]
;W[me]C[A: I would prefer here M17, pushing Black towards White thickness. If Black runs away, White would chase him and secures territory.]
;B[kd]C[A: This way Black nulifies the territory White could make on the top.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[dk];B[cf];W[ch];B[ef]C[A: Black should have played C17, taking the corner. WHite cannot make a lot of territory on the top, due to the L16 Black stone.This of course will let White strengthen his position on the left, But this was White's area in any case. Then Black should play around Q9 and start building his territory. The way Black plays he creates another weak group (in addition to L16), which lets White take a big corner.]
;W[fd];B[cc]C[A: Well, now at least Black does the right thing. The question is whether the exchange Black E14 - White F16 benefits Black. I think the contrary...]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[ba]C[A: The usual sequence is Black E18-White F18-Black D19. This play of Black lets White minimize Black's corner in sente by E18.]
;W[ab]C[This was too aggressive of me. I see now that I would have had the same result if the sequence D18 C18 E18 A18 been played. That would have been sente, still, and I wouldn't have had to lose a stone.

A: Simply E18 is much better, because it will leave some aji for A18 later as a Ko threat. In that respect, this move is aji-keshi (waste of potential).]
;B[db];W[eb];B[bb];W[ic];B[kc];W[kq];B[iq];W[nq];B[pq];W[no]
;B[qk]C[A: Q6 is much better, because it keeps the pressure on the White group and prepares to take much bigger territory on the Right.]
;W[qn]C[A: This is an overplay by White. The O3 group is not fully settled, so why create another weak group nearby? It is clear that Black will cut, since this is his strong area!]
;B[on];W[pm];B[nn];W[rp]C[A: White probably plays this in order to create some base for this weak group, but then the other group suffers. N5 whould be a better response for White, even at the risk of letting Black capture Q7. If Black attacks Q7, White qould use the sente to attack E14 and get much bigger territory.]
;B[mp]C[This move always takes me off guard. What can I do to stop something like this?

A: Now really nothing - see previous comment...];W[mq];B[np]
;W[lp];B[mo];W[lo];B[ln];W[kn];B[rq];W[qp];B[qq];W[rl];B[ol]
;W[om];B[nm]C[A: Black could afford to play O8, which then save him the need to play O8 later and give him an important move.]
;W[pl];B[pk];W[rk];B[rj];W[ql];B[ok]C[A: This is the move that Black could have saved if he played O8 before. Than he could play here T4 and kill White.]
;W[nh]C[A: Lets Black attack the White S4 group very severely by T4... See variant]

(;B[rn];W[rm]C[A: Bad attack, let White live easily];B[ro];W[qo]
;B[sp];W[so];B[sq];W[sn];B[kf];W[fh];B[gf];W[ie]C[A: Good move, threatening both G14 group as well as L17 group.]
;B[bf];W[fn]C[A: Why? Incosistent with previous play. White should have keep pressing Black. For example: W D13 - B D14 - W A15.]
;B[dh];W[di];B[eh];W[ei];B[fi];W[ig]C[A: G12 is a must. White lets Black get away too easily. Note that the G14 cannot be connected to the L14 group, because White peep at K15.]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[hh]C[A: Mistake by Black. G12 captures F12, and I do not see a folow up for White attack.]

A: Yes...];W[ap];B[cs]C[Here, I was let live. I think A5 would have killed it. The best result I can see is a ko. This and the big centre group was very nice of black.

A: Wrong. After A5, White simply plays A2 and lives.];W[ao]
