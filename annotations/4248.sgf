;B[pd];W[dc];B[oq]TR[po][op][pp][qp][pq][qq]C[krinid:
I'm no joseki expert, but p3 seems a bit odd.  Usually, one plays P4, Q3, Q4, Q5, R3, R4, R5.  Which isn't to say that P3 is bad - I'm just sure what your intent is when playing P3.]
;W[dq]
(;B[dj]TR[cj]C[krinid:
D10 is good.  It breaks up the 2 white stones.  However, perhaps C10 is better.

Remember that the 4th line is used primarily for influence, and the 3rd line is used primarily for making territory. 

Since you are splitting up the white stones, you are in a sense invading white's side.  Currently white has no side, yet, but he has potential for a strong side because of the 2 hoshi stones.  So you want to invade and live, and make some territory.

Playing D10 leaves your stone weak because white can try to play under it, forcing you to respond, and white will gain territory in doing so, and even more so if you continue to play on the 4th line.

So, if you want to invade, perhaps C10, followed by C7 or C12 is better.]

(;W[ce];B[jd];W[co];B[dm]TR[cj][cm]C[krinid:
As mentioned earlier, this is a bit odd.  A 2 space jump on the 4th line doesn't gain much territory.  Especially with the white C5 stone so close, it can slide under.]

(;W[pk];B[pn];W[qf];B[nd];W[qi]
(;B[lq]C[krinid:
A 2 space 3rd line jump - which means the N2 territory is safe, which is good, BUT... there are bigger moves still.]
;W[ch]TR[dj][dm]C[DC:  This move is a huge loss for black.  Now the fight on the side if going to be difficult at best.

krinid:
Yes, it is.  Because the marked stones are played high (4th line), white is now threatening to play underneath them.  White effectively has just played the squared stone (c12) making about 10-12 points of territory in sente, because now you have to respond to avoid losing more in the c8 area.]

(;B[hq];W[hd];B[qe];W[pf]
(;B[ne]C[DC: I think 21 is too small.  It helps build a wall from the top center star point, but is not aggresive enough at claiming territory this early in the game.

krinid:
O15 is very weak.  M17 is still open for invasion, and O15 doesn't really accomplish anything.  It concentrates too many stones in the same area.]
;W[ng];B[jf];W[hf]
(;B[mf]C[DC:  21 should have been played here?  And 25 where white played 26?

krinid:
N14 is bad, but it isn't necessary, it's kind of small and of course there are bigger moves.]
;W[fq];B[hp]TR[ic][re][bi][jj][ql][bn][hn][ln][qp]C[DC:  Another small move.  1-step jump instead of a bamboo joint? Or maybe played at 30 (white 6-5)?

krinid:
This is way too small.  The marked triangle points are all much bigger plays.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[go]
(;B[hn];W[ho];B[io]C[krinid:
This leaves the J6 cutting point.  This is fine at this point, but may come back to haunt you later.  If the center turns out to be white, then a white cut at J6 may kill H6, D7 and D10 with it.]
;W[fn];B[em]TR[jf][hn][pn][io]C[DC:  This group has been ignored, and is very weak.  A third stone earlier in the game would have helped immensely, and this move is a weak attempt to save them.  White-34 would have been a good move, if the 6-5 mantioned earlier had been played (27)?

krinid:
Yes, these stones need help.  The best would be to break out to the center and connect to any of the triangle stones.]
;W[fm];B[ci];W[bh];B[bi];W[eo];B[cm]C[DC:  Too passive.  Should have been 1 lower.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[dh];B[ck];W[ej]

(;B[rp]TR[ro]C[DC:  This feels like a good move in the sense of foresight, but maybe played a little too passively (2-5 instead of 2-4)?

krinid:
Yes, the triangle play is much better.  Because there's so many supporting black stones, you can go with a contact play.]
;W[hh];B[ih];W[mh]C[DC:  Another big loss for black.  What little central teritory I had is going to be eaten away now.

krinid:
Central territory will almost always get eaten away.  To even plan on making central territory is a mistake, because it's so hard to make and harder to keep as the game progresses.  There's so many ways to press into the center, that you have to protect it on too many sides, and it takes too many stones to secure.  These same stones could be spent making bigger territory in the corner and on the sides.]

(;B[lh];W[li]
(;B[ki]C[DC:  I wanted to play this move 2 to the right, but I didn't feel I had enough backup, and connecting to the lower right corner would have been difficult?  Should I have taken the fight upward?

krinid:
It seems it doesn't have enough backup at first... but take a look through the variations.   I left a whole bunch of variations as I played them out just to show you the vast range of possibilities.  There's a lot of complicated fights in there that could work out very well for black.  They're tough fights, though, so you have to decide if you want to risk it on a fight you may not win.  You may prefer to play it safe with M13.]
;W[lj];B[mg];W[ni];B[kh];W[no]C[krinid:

(;B[jj];W[ic]C[krinid:
This is unfortunate.  You could have played the same.  See the variation off of move 90.]
;B[jc];W[ib]
(;B[hg]TR[la]C[DC:  I played here because I didn't want to be 'pushing a wall', but in retrospect, would it have been better to continue my last move upward, and close off the corner?

krinid:
Yes, you should block it off, because it leaves the monkey jump open (look it up on sensei's library if you're not familiar with it - it's way too important to not know).  Because there nothing on the 2nd or 3rd line in the n18 area, there's a lot of points to lose with white m19.]

(;W[gg];B[ig];W[fd]
(;B[gf]C[DC:  Should have been palyed at white-100, if I was serious about the invasion.

krinid:
White 100 = H15?  I can't see what you would gain by that.  I've explored a couple variations of the black H15 move, but can't find anything good from it.

Instead, simply block off K18 to protect from the monkey jump or 1 space jump.]

;B[of];W[og];B[rf];W[rg];B[lk]C[DC:  This feels like a weak move.  Is there a better place to push against territory?

krinid:
1) You should seal off the L18 area.
2) You can play black A12 in sente.
3) Other than that, the small M9-like plays are all that's left (black A7, H1, T5, H8, H10, S15, etc)]
;W[re];B[rd]C[DC:  The next few moves are an poorly fought battle, where I was really floundering.]
;W[sf]
(;B[sd]TR[mk]C[krinid:
You may have been better off pushing at the triangle. The point of the M9 move is to threaten to reduce his territory, so if he doesn't answer it, reduce it.  T16 is small and easily blockable if white pushes.  However, more importantly, L17 is still left open.

Take a look at the variations, the bottom most variation in particular.  I played through the end-game in a different manner and it ends up a black 3.5 moku victory.]

krinid:
There were a few key places you missed, which could have turned the game around.  Some were because you misread the biggest moves available, some were because you didn't read (or misread) the fight.  On the plus side, none of your groups died, which oftens happens in 20k games, so that's a good sign.  As you stated, your play is a bit passive, which leaves room for improvement.

The purpose of O14 is to keep sente or make white pay.  The attack is on the O11 group - black should not expect to take it, because it's easily blocked, but it requires white to make a defensive move, thus getting sente again for black.  In GO, sente is very important, because it lets you play in the biggest move available on the board.  If you can take these initiative moves to play in the biggest areas left more than your opponent, you should win.

In the end game, you have to choose double sente moves, black only sente moves, reverse sente moves, and double gote moves in that order.  If you do this, you can maximize your end game play.  If you're not familiar with these terms, look them up on Sensei's library.  This is far too valuable to miss out on.]

This solidifies some good territory.  This is very 'safe', because it keeps the top side and corner closed more tightly.  However, it doesn't expand on the territory much.]

This starts a good wall and also partially protects from an m17 invasion (it might still live if a stronger play was playing white, but it'd be smaller, and you'd have some compensation by having a big envoy out into the center).

M15 is a bit bolder than M17 because it leaves a potential invasion open in exchange for expanding your top-side territory a bit.]

So this invasion failed.  As I said, if a dan player  was playing white, there may be a way to make it live, but it'd be small, and you'd gain a lot of influence in return to make territory with elsewhere.]

If white invades, you still have room to make a 2 space jump closer to the white corner.]
;B[fq]C[krinid:
Now this leaves the white M3 stone weak and in need of breaking out.  And of course, you let it break out - you can't expect to kill it, but white will need to play the move and you can gain elsewhere.  If white doesn't play to connect the M3 stone to something, you can gain from that, too.]

White plays to save the M3 stone by extending it.]

C[krinid:
White's spending a lot of stones trying to connect, while not getting any territory for it, and still leaving a long trail of stones he'll have to worry about keeping connected later, while black is building good influence with the triangle-marked stones and both good influence and territory with the square marked stones.

Remember, in a case like this, you don't want to kill white - don't even try.  Instead, just push white so he has to run and then gain from it.]

White approaches the white stone, threatening to play underneath it, approach from the other side as well, and make a lot of territory on the side.]

(;B[ci];W[ce];B[cm];W[co]C[krinid:
This play gives white two strong corners are some good upper left side territory, while black takes some side territory as well.  This isn't necessarily bad, as the black stones have some center influence as well as left side territory.  This is possible because the stones came down to the 3rd line.]

(;B[cj]C[krinid:
Remember that a 2 space jump on the 3rd line is safe - you should be able to make it live, especially when it's in open territory.  When it's among lots of stones, you need to read the plays out, but when it's this open, it's definitely alive and making territory and still has good potential for expand on either side and out to the center as well.]
;W[cm];B[cg];W[ce];B[pj]C[krinid:
This is a good result.  Black has made left side territory and then come back to start some right side territory.]
