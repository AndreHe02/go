C[I am white.

Thank you very much for reviewing this game!

> I'll sum up the fundamentals mentioned in this review:

> Thickness:
* attack by driving toward your thickness
* don't approach thickness

> Contact play:
* contact and sacrifice for defense
* avoid touching weak stones

> Strive to apply them consciously until they become a second nature.

> Also, cultivate a strong habit of spotting good ladders to win fights (move 36) or save moves (ladder at H5).]
