C[Dear reviewer,
I played black this game. You may wonder about the game because my opponent resigned in a very late stadium but in my opinion he missed a move to save his group.
Otherwise it was a very hard game for me. After the first 50 moves I felt I had a little advantage but then my opponent cought up and step by step I lost more and more terrain.
Please give me some hints where I made the biggest mistakes.
Thank you in advance.
Thomas];B[pc]C[Hi Thomas - crazyd here.  Not a bad game, but some odd features.  Are you playing black against a weaker person (6k vs 7k)?  Black seemed better by move 50, but by move 100 White seemed better.  At the end Black had clearly lost, but did not resign.  White made a silly mistake and lost, which probably reinforces Black's bad habit of not resigning when appropriate.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[jc];B[cc];W[qe];B[qd];W[pe];B[nc]C[Maybe too solid.  O16 or P16 or a pincer near R10 seem better.]
;W[ed];B[ce]C[Because this is third line (solid), an invasion around G17-H17 should be your goal.  Instead you later try to get up to 4th line.  Doing it now (D15) is better, I think, than later.  The closer to the lower right, the more impact a third line move by white has.]
;W[ef];B[ne];W[pi];B[qn];W[jq];B[dg];W[ck];B[ci]C[Not very big.  C3 or F3, maybe preceeded by M3 would make the game easy for Black.]

;W[hg];B[ni]C[I can't see much value here.  Locally S16 would be better, but reducing either the lower or upper left white areas is more important.]

(;B[mn]C[Should I have been more couragious, maybe g9

Yes, I think G9 would be a larger reduction of white than N6 gains for black.]
;W[hk];B[kn];W[io]C[J6 seems possible, and bigger for white.]
;B[jk];W[il];B[jl]C[I was satisfied with this.
My plan was to reduce whites moyo at the upper side with helb of the both corner groups.
But in the next moves white got an advantage.];W[oo];B[no];W[op]

Maybe E18 would have been safer for you.  Tactics seem to be your weakest part, but they are not that bad.  Your sense of direction and size estimates seemed okay.  Your timing of moves struck me as very odd, but not very bad, although you sometimes lost points with tenuki (rather than finish local sequence).]
