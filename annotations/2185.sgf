C[Vorkosigan: Hi, my name is Jun (Vorkosigan on igs) and i would generally like to know how to improve my game. I just about won with 1.5 points. I would like to know on which part of my play I should try to improve next. Thank you kindly for your efforts.

(;W[dd]LB[fd:X]C[Vorkosigan:
I knew it was too early for an attack. But i feared a keima (shimari) at X. Would it still be better to wait in this situation?

Its definitely better to play in the fourth corner than here. Even if you want to attack the black stone, D 17 would be a better move.]

(;W[gd]LB[gc:X]TR[ce]C[Vorkosigan: I didn't play the hane at X because i was told that would be a bad fuseki mistake, since there is the marked black stone which still has aji. Should i have taken the risk?

Connecting is a good move here. Using a hane would be leaving more cutting points for Black. You already have a cutting point at E16. No point in giving Black more cutting points to exploit.]
;B[gc];W[qp]TR[cd][dd][fd][gd]C[Vorkosigan: Did i leave the marked stones too early?

Its still early in the game. Feel free to place your stones at the biggest empty spot.]

;B[dg];W[jd]LB[id:X]SQ[fd][gd]C[Vorkosigan: I first thought about an ikken-tobi to X. Instead i jumped two spaces. Too wide?

Its still ok at this stage of the game. An ikkentobi would be easier to control but this move, although harder to control, is still acceptable since there are no black stones close by.]

I should think so. You're almost surrounded by black stones. Connecting is the way to go.]

The whole time i felt bad about this. I gave black too much possibilities to secure is moyo. On the other hand i didn't knew when to ignore my worm and to go somewhere else. Since black still had much moyo, i continued destroying it.]

No. In this case, your worm won't be alive if you don't connect. If black plays correctly, he can destroy your worm if you place at X.]

The stone you connected is in no danger. An atari is possible at both C14 and B15.]
