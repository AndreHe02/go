Hi, my name is Fernando Grant, Kokorini in KGS 7K.
Lets see the game];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cj];W[pj];B[cf]
C[========== my comment ==========BEG
i suppose black should put black stone at C14 in order for more concrete compund than put it at C14. however, i also suppose it's not strong enough to attack white (D16) if simply put the stone on C14, to which white can have its stone on C15 to make defence easily. or should i attack white at Q10? in my opinion, if i attack Q10, i'll fall into white's pitfall by reason of that place should be black originally. so if i attack to early, white not only survive easily (not strong enough black surrounding) but also reduce black area. would reviewer please give some advice?
========== my comment ==========BEG

Kokorini: Well, first I like your move. Becouse for example if white play at C15 thing are bad for him (see var). Probably the best answer is W17,
now about attacking Q10: is true, it is not the time is better to make force somewhere else first facing to it, for example at top. Then you will have "weapons".]

(;W[ch]C[========== my comment ==========BEG
here is another move i suppose that's the defact that black put the stone on C14 (but i don't know how to deal with it ) because white can attack/ invade easily, which become black hard choose to tend to both side (C14 and C10)
========== my comment ==========END

Kokorini: this have no sense. white should not get proffit of it.
If black simple invade at 3-3 point... (see var)]
(;B[ef]C[Kokorini: ok.... not bad anyway.];W[fd];B[bd]C[Kokorini: I think is better to play at E12, then wD11, bC7 or D8 chasing the weak group]
;W[eh];B[cc]C[Kokorini: now you may have a weak group at C10.]
;W[dc];B[de]C[Kokorini: if you want make stronger your position play at D12.
Maybe you think: "but if play there I will make C10 stone weak!"
well, first that stone is allready weak. So.. probably not good to make it weaker, but at least white have to answer and you can make stronger C10 later, for example at E10 or C7 (depending of W move)]
;W[ic]C[K: this move is a gift from black.
Anyway, better at C7];B[cn]C[K:GOOD!];W[co];B[dn];W[dk];B[dj]
C[K: Better at C9, after that you get sente];W[ej];B[ck]C[K: see? finally you did it.]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[di];B[ek]C[K: maybe too agressive, it is better to make force around F6 before.]

(;B[qd];W[qn]C[========== my comment ========== BEG
here is another move i suppose it's black's mistake due to fall behind white to stick the R16. but if black do not protect the corner, it must face the problem of survive latter on. or to face the 'ko', which is not my good at. would you like to have an explain? thank you; )
========== my comment ========== END

K: Ok, first you see Q10 was the move, now... even if white play at R16, win the ko and destroy the corner black can scape! so it is not very bad for black.
Black corner is too heavy, too many stone making the job of a few. see var on move B51]
;B[ql]C[K: ok, I can see you are now worry about white's land. He looks ahead.
But you need to get stronger the down part of the board
maybe attacking his lower left corner.];W[on];B[ol];W[np]C[K: Difficult for Black]

too close. but I understand, with white's stones in the other corner is difficult. That's why you need to do something like this before.]

(;W[kp]C[K: OPS!];B[mq]C[Kokorini:
OK.... I think you need to practice those thinks where you feel you aren't good. You say Ko... well, I'm not saying: "Go ther in your life making Ko everywhere, at the supermartek, in job/class, in the bathroom" no.... but dont avoid things only becouse you are not good on them, face them, challenge them, and if you misstake much better! next time you know one more thing that is bad.

One more thing:
Try to play more indirect. dont go ever just where you want, try to think allways: "if I do this, when the next secuence finnish, where may I need stones?"
hope you understund me.

ok... I suppose the variation of move 151 is a "what if white play dont make THAT big miss take.]
