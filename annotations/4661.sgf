C[In this game, I am looking to understand how some of the major battles I lost could have been won more handily.  This was a very pitched feeling fight for me with some places that definitely could have greatly changed the outcome.  The group in the lower left died when it should have lived, and the group in the upper right of his that lived was close to death but ultimately prevails.  Would I have won this game if I'd just solidified those two areas better?

H: Hello
my name is Holger and I am an 8k player. I will mark all my comments with 'H:'
After reviewing the game I have the following suggestions for your gameplay. Both players played very defensively and sometimes timidly. You defended against cuts that were not dangerous. This wastes moves, which could have better been played elsewhere.
In the end, black lost because an invasion of white deep inside blacks territory succeeded. Black could have prevented white from making eyeshape and the invasion would have failed. The negative outcome for black was mostly due to mistakes in tackling the invasion. Without komi, black would ave won by 3 points.]

C[H: Too slow. You are securing the corner at the cost of outside influence. To attack the white stone better play at Q6.]
;W[pn]TR[qj]C[H: White Q6 doesn't establish anything here. R10 would build a base]
;B[qk]TR[mp]C[H: R9 is ok to put pressure on white. I would  have played N4 to gain influence on the lower side, but that is probably a matter of taste.]
;W[pl];B[pk]C[I realize here my opponent is trying to seperate my corner group and the stones at the middle, but I am expecting to build influence towards the top and solidify territory along the side.

H: White is helping you to solidify your territory.];W[ol];B[ok]
;W[nk];B[nj];W[mk];B[ni];W[jp];B[lq]C[H: A bit too far. White can now attack at O4]

(;W[lo]C[H: White plays passive here.];B[mp]C[H: After N4 the corner is secure and you should consider playing elsewhere.]
;W[mo];B[lp]TR[fc][ki]C[H: This move is not necessary. There is no danger to the corner anymore and white N5 is not an attack on your territory. You could now play at the top side or at the center to extend your moyo.]
;W[kp];B[ko]TR[fc][ki]C[ I am attempting to throw this stone as a sacrifice in order to take more territory at the bottom.

H: The stone does not achieve anything. 
At this point black shouldn't worry about the bottom right corner anymore. It is reasonably safe and the points black gains by extending along the bottom side are small. 
Again, there is more territory at the top or in the center of the board.]
;W[kn];B[kr]C[H: Too slow];W[jo]C[H: White doesn't need to take the black stone.It was never a real threat.]
;B[np]C[H: Not needed. The corner is secure.];W[jj]C[H: This is a big move by white considerably extending the white moyo.]
;B[ji]TR[jh][ki]C[at this point, he has thrown down a stone at the center, and I think perhaps I can use this opportunity to build a box-like moyo

H: Black should not attach to the white stone. That will make it stronger. L11 or K12 are better choices]

(;W[hj]TR[ii][ki]C[H: There is a proverb saying "respond to attachment with hane". White J11 or L11 are better here]
;B[ii];W[ij]
(;B[ki]C[H: Too slow. There is no danger of white invading into blacks territory here]
;W[kk];B[lj];W[lk];B[mi];W[hi];B[hh];W[gh];B[ig];W[gg]C[at this point I leave the group in the center because I think it is safe enough for now from the white group facing it.

H: The group was safe a long time ago];B[cc]TR[dg]C[so i try to invade

H: Now you can only invade the corner. If you had taken initiative earlier, the invasion at D13 would have been open to you. Now it is made impossible through the white stones at G12]
;W[cd];B[dc]
(;W[ed]C[H: White can play at E17 here. See variation.];B[ec]
C[i know this is too slow, but I dont want him to wrap around me.  What can I do in a position like this where I want to secure a corner, but quickly?

H: White is playing rather defensively here. The corner is already yours.]
;W[fd]C[H: Very passive by white];B[hd]TR[hc]C[H: H17 is better for black (see following variation)]

(;W[hg];B[if]C[H: Good! No need to try to save H12];W[ih];B[jh]
;W[hh]C[H: No need for white to waste a move for a single point at this stage in the game]

(;B[jg]C[H: This move is not necessary. The cut at K13 is not dangerous because the ladder works for you.]
;W[cq];B[cg]C[now I try to throw a few different attacks at him, experimenting to see what might work.

H: This move comes too late. The black stone is isolated and has no chance of making two eyes.]
;W[ch];B[gq];W[fq]TR[iq][ir]C[H: Very passive by white. White J2 or J3 would have seperated the black stone]
;B[hq];W[gp];B[hp];W[ho];B[go]C[I cut here attempting to buy more stability for the lower three stones]
;W[fp];B[iq];W[ip];B[jq];W[kq];B[jr];W[gn];B[fr];W[er];B[gr]
;W[cm]C[at this point, it is becoming clear to me the final shape that is emerging, but it looks like I have more territory if I can hold what I've staked out and pick at some of his...

H: You are ahead by now. But white G17 would be dangerous for you.]
;B[gc]C[H: Good! Now the upper side is safe.];W[ge];B[gd];W[he]
;B[ie];W[fc];B[fb];W[eb];B[ea];W[db];B[cb];W[gb];B[da];W[id]
C[i realize when he cuts here ive lost the three stones at g16.

H: The stones are not lost! The ladder doesn't work for white! See variations.]

(;B[ib]C[so i decide the group on the upper left looks to be alive, and I decide to start solidifying a wall on the right]
;W[hc];B[jd];W[ic];B[jb];W[hb];B[bd];W[be];B[gd]C[this might be silly, but it looked like a potential fight could possibly kill his group at h-17

H: The problem with this move is that white does not need to respond immediately. It only threatens to start a fight. Whatever your next move, white has the choice of H16 and G17 to connect the white group at H17.]
;W[hd]C[H: White responds, so you haven't lost anything.];B[ac]
;W[ae];B[ad];W[ga];B[bb]C[H: Why not play F19? Your corner is safe.]
;W[fa];B[eb];W[dg]C[H: Not needed, the black stone poses no threat.]
;B[dh];W[eh];B[rm]TR[rl][rn]C[try to link up the upper and lower groups.  i realize that it was likely too late, a few moves earlier i might have been able to complete the linkage and hold a line or two along the right

H: Both groups are alive, so you shouldn't woory about linking them. A move like S6 or S8 will give you a few points of extra territory.]
;W[ql]C[H: Again white plays passive. S6 or S8 would attack the black stone.]
;B[rl];W[rn]C[looks like im split, so run and cover

H: No! Just cut the white stone at R6. You have one liberty more than white]

(;B[rk];W[qn];B[ro];W[po];B[sn]C[wait, did I connect them after all?]
;W[oo]
(;B[sp]C[H: There is no weakness at T4. You can always play T7 to connect to the larger group.
Why not play at P4. Or maybe O5 first.];W[op];B[oq];W[pq]C[H: The white attack cannot succeed.]
;B[qp];W[or];B[nq];W[no];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[lr]
;B[ls];W[mr];B[nr];W[ns];B[os];W[rp];B[sq]C[im not sure if I'm being tricked, but it looked like he was making some counting mistakes, so i did what i could with them

H: White's attack could never succeed.];W[cf]C[H: Not necessary!]
;B[ms]C[H: Not necessary!];W[fs];B[gs];W[es];B[dq]C[another experiment, just to see what i can do with an extra move]
;W[dp];B[ks]C[H: Not necessary! What are you afraid of?]
(;W[gl]C[H: There is no danger of invasion here. The game is almost finished. I will play the finishing moves in the variation]
;B[lh];W[kj];B[im];W[in];B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cr]
;B[cs];W[dr]C[i feel this exchange could definitely have gone better, if the stone at d3 hadn't been surrounded and killed this might have given me another block of territory.]
;B[br];W[eq];B[bs]C[at this point, im just trying to find a way for the lower right group to live.]
;W[ap];B[do];W[dn];B[ao];W[an];B[eo];W[en];B[bn];W[bm];B[le]
C[this is a poor attempt to solidify before the pending invasion]
;W[mj];B[aq];W[cn]C[lower right looks dead for sure now];B[ao]
;W[li];B[mh];W[lj];B[eg];W[di];B[oi];W[nc]C[i've been expecting this, but how to defend such an open area?]
;B[oc];W[lc];B[nb]C[try to choke it out?];W[nd];B[ne];W[ld]
;B[mb];W[od];B[oe];W[pd];B[qd]C[im thinking this is going okay so far, he doesn't have life yet for that group at O-16]
;W[qc];B[md];W[ob];B[pb];W[oa]C[i count my liberties and think, i'm good.  I can kill the two stones at the very top]
;B[pa];W[pe];B[pf];W[qf];B[na]C[i realize this was silly, i should have taken the 5 stones in the middle, but it was the heat of the moment and I think we both missed it at first

H: Yes taking the five stones would have been a lot better. But white still can't win the fight.]
;W[rd];B[mc];W[re]C[and then it all goes wrong.  He invades and lives, and ultimately wins a much larger victory.]
;B[rc];W[qb];B[rb];W[rf]
(;B[sd]C[H: Try to restrict him to a smaller space, where he cannot get two eyes (see variation)]
;W[rg];B[pg];W[rh];B[qh];W[ri];B[se];W[sf];B[sc];W[qi];B[si]
C[H: Good move!];W[qg]
(;B[sj]C[H: Just connect here. White will never get two eyes.]
;W[ph]TR[sh][pi]C[H: Try to make reduce his eyes. T12 takes away the eye at the side and Q11 makes R12 a false eye.]
;B[oh];W[pi]C[H: You still have the chance to play T12]
