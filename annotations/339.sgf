;B[pp]C[This game is very balance in the result.    I'm black and I'd like to know opportunities I've missed when I was working on white    2 weaks groups(right side and top-right).  All the action starts at stone 32 from my  point of view.    Also I'd like to have some comments on  the way I've used my K4 stone.

Hello,

General comment: Usually there is no need to kill opponent큦 weak groups, it is enough to make area or gain influence by chasing them. Not utilizing K4 stone properly was the key point in this game. Please let me know if you have any questions.   Have fun,

C[Comnent: Here white did exactly what black wanted. Correct move would have been for example K17 or K16.]
;B[kc]C[Pincer is correct.];W[ne]
(;B[ph]C[Comment I think it is better first support your pincering stone. This way you wont have low position. See the variation.]
;W[pd]
(;B[qc]C[Comment:I think correct move is R16. See the variation.]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[pe];B[qf];W[pf];B[qg];W[ke];B[hc]
C[Comment: Black has low position and white큦 group should not be weak anymore because of the central influence.]
;W[fc];B[kd];W[le];B[md]C[Comment: See variation. K15 is the natural move here. M18 is important point also, it gives and takes base.]

(;B[ng]C[Comment: Instead of this move, now it is time to put your K4 stone into action. See Variation.]

(;B[ni]C[Comment: P7 would make you a mojo. And put pressure on white큦 stones. See variation.]

C[spaciane:L12 would have been better,    I think.

Comment: This move is no good because there is no black stone at K15. White has to answer L12 by playing L13, but he still can make eye there.]
