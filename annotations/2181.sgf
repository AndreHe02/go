;B[pd]C[MM: Hi, I'm Mike, and it is my pleasure to review your game today.  I'm AGA 7k, so I will make some mistakes, but I will try my best to keep them to a minimum.

I think a little paranoia is a good thing. I often lose my games by not making my stones safe. A 6-dan at the Seattle club often says 'Make your stones strong, then you can do anything.' And there is a proverb - 'Don't make weak groups.' And sometimes 'passive' is the right posture: 'Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water. Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better...' But if you want to try some riskier, more agressive play, I'll see what I can suggest.]
;W[qp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[op];B[cn]TR[pj][qj]C[MM: This is ok, but I think I'd take a big point on the right instead, near Q10. The area in front of Whites two stone looks more valuable to me, and whoever plays in that area first will have an advantage. But you don't want to get too close to the stones, or they will swallow you up.]
;W[gp]C[MM: This looks weird, and I don't find it in my copy of Kogo's Joseki Dicationary (http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm)
Maybe Black will be able to punish this slack move, and gain an advantage here.]

(;B[dk]TR[cq]C[MM: Ok, you asked about opportunities for aggressive plays. This might be one. You could take the lower left corner with C3, and probably also get a big framework on the top (var.).
On the other hand, I like this move. Black looks limber and ready, but White looks bunched up.]
;W[qj]C[MM: Huge! Good for White.];B[qg]TR[qf][ed]C[MM: Looks greedy, and inconsistent with the earlier plays. R14 is safer. E16 would give an excellent framework, after which you could play either R14 or invade the LL corner.]
;W[ed]C[MM: Something like this is necessary for White. Black probably wishes he had played there instead of R13.]
;B[ee]TR[ic]C[MM: Odd.  Considering your J17 stone, I would expect E17 instead.]
;W[dd];B[de];W[fd];B[fe];W[cc];B[ce]TR[ic]LB[he:a][ie:b][dc:c]
[kc:d][lc:e]C[So far nothing unusual (I think ;-) )

MM: No, not *too* unusual. I think I would omit this C15 move, and take sente to seal White in with H15(a) or J15(b). Since you are letting White live in the corner anyway, this C15 move is only worth, what, about 8 pts.  On the other hand, this is thick, and means you may have a useful cutting point at D17 (c).
So you have traded the UL corner for south-facing influence. That's fine, but now your J17 (tri.) stone looks out of place. On the other hand, it undercuts White's UL corner, so this may not be bad. But I'd watch out for a pincer next. Something like J15 (b) looks good for either White or Black. Something near L17(d) would be good for White, but Black would rather play something more efficient like H15(a) or M17(e).]
;W[hc]LB[hd:a][ie:b]C[MM: This seems too soft on Black. H16 (a) or J15 (b) looks better.]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[gd]TR[oj][id]C[may be H15? may be tenuki ?

MM: I think tenuki. White can't cut so easily, I don't think. Something like P10 looks juicy, if you prefer aggression. Something like J16 looks impregnable, if you prefer caution.]
;W[kc]C[MM: The right idea, but maybe a few moves late.]
(;B[jd]TR[ce]LB[id:b][fc:b][dc:d][mc:a]C[probably better to pincher N16 or N17 ?

MM: N16 (a)? No, the threat is White connecting underneath, which is huge. If the opponent is going to live anyway, make him live small and scattered while you live large and connected. If he has to spend the stones to make two eyes, while you just connect your groups, then you are using your stones more efficiently. Therefore, I think J16 (b) is the simplest move, though this K15 also prevents White from linking up, thanks to White's weakness at F17(c)-D17(d) and your solidity at C15 (tri.).]
;W[jc]C[still beter to play N17 I think];B[ib]C[MM: Good!];W[nc]
;B[oc]LB[ne:a][md:b]C[MM: The general advice is not to touch weak stones. Because the natural follow-ups will tend to make both sides stronger in the area. If you're already strong and your opponent is locally weak, then you will become overconcentrated while he becomes strong.
Here, Black already has a huge advantage because White is cut into two groups. I think the thing to do is let White live small on the side while you make a huge wall facing the center, with something like O15 (a) or maybe N16 (b). Later, you can collect your monkey-jumps along the top; or else White will have to take time to defend against them.]
;W[ne];B[nd];W[md];B[od];W[nb];B[kd]LB[me:a][ob:b]C[MM: Not sure what this is trying to do.  Either the aggressive cut at N15 (a) or the passive block at P18 (b) looks better.]
;W[le]TR[lc]C[MM: Risky. Black at M17 would undo all White's gains.]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[of]TR[oj][kq][en][ob][jj][ko]C[too small ?

MM: Yes, too small.];W[jb]
(;B[pi]C[MM: Right idea. I think you can stretch a little further though.  After the White wall gets built, it will be very tough to invade -- you ask about this. (vars.)]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[oj]C[MM: White is happy with this wall -- about 40 pts. of territory just about secured.]
;B[bp]C[MM: Good! Though I think the 3-3 may be better.];W[cq]
;B[dh]TR[en][fk][kq][ko][jj][mq]C[MM: Too close to your thickness.
It looks like you may have to invade the lower side.];W[nf]
;B[ng];W[lg];B[jf];W[kf];B[jg]LB[mi:a][kq:b]C[MM: Small, unnecessary. How about N11 (a), or the invasion at L3 (b)?]
;W[mi]C[MM: Looks good for White.];B[jj]C[MM: Good!];W[en];B[fl]
C[better to invade at L3 or L4 ?

MM: Yes.];W[jp];B[jm]C[MM: By my estimation, B: 86, W: 100. Corner territory is more efficient than center territory, and White has 3 corners. Plus White ran through the center and is about to link up to the LR. Black has to catch up.]
;W[ll]C[MM: Ouch, that hurts Black.];B[ln];W[nn]TR[km]C[MM: ?? I would go for the cut, if I were White.]
;B[mo];W[mp];B[no];W[oo];B[np];W[nq];B[lp]C[MM: Good sequence!]
;W[mq];B[kp];W[jq];B[mm];W[nm];B[ml];W[nl];B[mk];W[nk]C[MM: Well, that all helped some.  Let's count again.  B: 100, W:86.  Well done!]
;B[lj];W[mj]
(;B[lk]C[unnecessary ?

MM: It depends.  You may lose a couple stones, but if you play elsewhere, you may gain more. But then you have to remember to cover your weak spots later. All in all, this M9 is probably correct. (var.)]
;W[mh]C[MM: Ok, I have no idea what that's for.];B[li]C[MM: Way way too small.]
;W[qc]TR[ob]C[MM: This is why P18 would have been a good move long ago.]
;B[qd];W[ob];B[pb]TR[qb]C[MM: This does not work. White can gain in the corner with R18.]

(;W[pc]C[MM: See var. for White's better play.];B[qb];W[rc]
;B[rb];W[re];B[rd];W[ci]C[white's attempt to invade

;W[em];B[el]TR[bo]C[MM: Seems unnecessary. This must be the excessive paranoia you mentioned. But, one of the harder things to do as you gain strength, is to remember to play safely enough.  When you're way ahead like this, it is really no fun to lose because you didn't make a simple play for safety. So if you're not sure about something, the correct thing is to just play ultra-safe like this.
But... what are you going to do if White next goes at B5?];W[co]
;B[bo];W[an];B[bn];W[bq];B[al];W[ap]
(;B[aj]TR[ao]LB[eo:a]C[MM: "Eyes win capturing races" says the proverb. I think A5 is a couple pts better, since you have the liberties at D5 and C4; and the clump of Whites can't get away.
Actually, the best thing now is probably capturing 5 with E5 (a, see var.)]
;W[ad];B[be]C[MM: Ok; but I'd just go ahead and capture the clump. You're going to have to do it sooner or later anyway, and the sooner you remove those stones from the board, the fewer forcing moves White will have.]
;W[bc]C[effectively dealt with ?

MM: Yes, this corner is pretty much settled. Now is a good time to collect your monkey-jump.]
;B[ah]TR[eo][fa][kr][lr][qi][oe]C[probably unnecessary...

MM: LOL... It will be necessary eventually, but since you connected at B15 already, you might as well use this move more profitably.]
;W[hm]C[MM: Too bad; that makes E5 less profitable for you...]

(;B[hl]C[MM: ...but you should still play it, since it's still a nice reduction of White's area (var).]

TR[gn][go][ho][hn][fn][fo]SQ[qh][qi][ri][rh]C[MM: Watch out for White at P15 (a). It can create some nastiness at P13-Q13-O12 (b-c-d) if you're not careful.

White made a decent chunk of territory around G7 (tri.), and reduced you effectively around S11 (sq.)  Let's count again now. 
B: 86, W: 100.  Black has fallen behind.];W[qi];B[do]LB[fa:a]
[kr:b][lr:b][oe:c][eo:d]C[Better move ?

MM: This is ok; but bigger are F19 (a) or L2-M2 (b), or the defensive move at P15 (c).  You might even still be able to do something tricky with E5 (d).]

;B[kg];W[qq]C[MM: Ok, now *that's* paranoia. With White's huge thickness, I don't think Black can live in the LR corner anymore.]
;B[ke];W[mc]C[MM: ??? This is completely unnecessary. Next both players passed, and made a small error in counting (did not remove the A6 stone; I think I fixed it in this file). 
Black wins by 8.5, if my software is correct.

You said:
"well I won but I feel that I didnt attack white's moyo enough. Basically I didn't play aggressive enough. I have less territory but captured more stones the white becuase white had some failed attempts. especially White's right side is too big not te be invaded at some point. Please advice.

Many thanks,
Lothar."

MM: I don't quite agree with your assessment. You did miss the chance to reduce White on the right early in the game, around move 42.  That sense of the big point in the early game will come by playing more and by watching stronger players.
Your play was in some cases hasty, but the way you attacked around F17 shows plenty of native aggression.  In fact, I would say that you show a nice balance of aggression and caution.  What you should work on is your intuitive sense of good shape.  Do this by working on life-and-death problems, by watching high-level games, and of course (best of all), by playing more.
Thanks for the chance to review your game!
Best wishes,
Mike Malveaux
