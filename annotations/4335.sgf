C[buckyyowza: Hello! Comments by Mark Fyffe, prefixed with 'buckyyowza'.  I hope you enjoy reading my commentary and find it to be of use.

Hello reviewer,

I play black in this game and thanks for the review

Most of my question is on opening.  I think my opening is still has many problems.

Please also comment my bad move];B[pd]C[Suzan007: Hello~!];W[pp]

[nq:D]C[buckyowza: This isn't a good choice for black for two reasons:
a) Black doesn't have sente yet since R14 shouldn't be ignored.  Whatever black will gain in the lower right will not equal his loss in the upper right after white's double approach (see var).
b) This is the wrong direction.  With all the open space on the board, it makes little sense to invade white's sphere so early.  It is better to build your own thickness at this point, I'd suggest that black make a joseki play at O16, O17, or R12 - these joseki should end up with black getting sente in exchange for slightly smaller thickness in the upper right.  To approach the lower right it is better to start from the other side, at D3, because then you will have the thickness of F3 and C16 to play from.]

(;W[ql];B[on]SQ[qf]C[buckyyowza: yes, 3-3 is better because of the R14 stone. The P6 jump helps white too much in this situation. see var on #21

How about 3-3?
I am not very sure if this joseki is good in this situation.]
;W[np]
(;B[rp]C[buckyyowza: This timing is wrong - Q9 should be played first. S4 commits too much to the corner, but this particular joseki leaves black either a cutting point at Q7 or gote (after black covers Q7).  Playing S4 now could therefore be considered a gote play.  Since the main advantage for black of playing a light joseki like this is to gain some thickness in sente, ending in gote is no good.]

;W[qg];B[pm];W[jq]LB[of:A]C[buckyyowza: white should play P14 to fully exploit black's position.  K3 is OK, but a little slow in this game.  Therefore black's mistakes so far will not haunt him, at least not for a while ;-)]
;B[nc]LB[ec:A][of:B]C[buckyyowza: O17 is perfect, E17 is also good.  After O17, white will want to play P14 to prevent becoming sealed in by black thickness.

I go O17 but should I go E17, E16, F17?
Which corner is better?
Or I should start reduce at K4?];W[ed]
(;B[ec]LB[gc:A]TR[ph][pi][pj][pk][ol][pm][on][qn][rp]C[buckyyowza: This joseki is large, but fails to make use of the thickness you gained with the marked stones.  I'd prefer the G17 pincer joseki.  Always remember when selecting your plays to consider the effect your choices will have on the whole board, not just the local situation.  Take a look at the way this game ends, then tell yourself "all of this trouble started on move #37" ;-)]
;W[fc];B[dc];W[gd];B[cf];W[kc];B[cj]LB[dj:A]C[buckyyowza: C10 is very nice, since it puts pressure on white's weak group on the left side.  However I would slightly prefer D10 since the 4th line is slightly more aggressive.  The upper right also needs attention but black can still run with the Q16 stones so protecting the corner with S16 is not urgent.

I'd consider this to be the first play in the middle game, so lets take stock of the situation on the board:  White's plays around G16 have neutralized the center, white has three big strong groups (upper side, right side, and lower right) while black only has two (upper left and lower right) though black's dragon is pretty big as well.  There fore the game is pretty much even at this point with some very interesting situations developing around the upper right and left side.  As far as the opening - I'd say black made a few minor mistakes that I've tried to point out, but in all has made some well thought out decisions and has laid out an interesting game that could go to either player at this point.  In that light, I think your opening is not too bad.

What about S16? should black take s16 first? I was worried about white go C12.]
;W[rd];B[dl]LB[ld:A][ke:B][ej:C]SQ[dn]C[buckyyowza: The left is interesting, yes, but S16 should not be ignored.  Instead of playing D8 right away, you'll want to try and follow up S16 in a way that ensures black gets sente - then you can play something in this area leaving white a stone behind on the left.  I'd suggest somthing around L15/M16 for black instead of D8 here.  Another point about D8: typically in this poistion, D6 has a lot of good aji for black, but since D8 is so close to white's group this aji is erased and white gets easy life.  A better local play on the left would be E10.  This way you could strengthen the center while casually limiting the space white's left side group needs to run;  once white is sufficiently enclosed, the shape of the C5 stones requires a gote play like D6 to make life.]
;W[dm];B[el];W[ck];B[dj];W[em];B[fp];W[fl];B[fj]LB[cm:B][fm:A]
C[buckyyowza: Black's shape is strong here, so I'd prefer the cut at F7,which keeps the C7 aji in the game.]
;W[qc];B[of]LB[ld:B][ke:A]SQ[ph][pi][fj][pj][pk][ol]C[buckyyowza: this doesn't create a connection.  it is better to run toward F10 first than to try to connect here immediately.  A play like M16 or L15 will get this group into the center, where it can connect to F10 or the right center group more readily.]
;W[og];B[pg]
(;W[pf]C[buckyyowza: white can play P15 instead to cause greater damage, see var.]
;B[nf];W[fk];B[fe];W[fd]
(;B[ee]C[buckyyowza: should be E14];W[de];B[dd];W[df]C[buckyyowza: yes.  E15 should have been E14 to prevent this development.

I Miscalculate here];B[ce];W[eg];B[fg]C[buckyyowza: this shape almost always leads to snapback (as happens in the game) so it should generally be avoided, but this time may be more interesting and therefore a good idea... see var.]

(;W[eh];B[fh];W[ei];B[ej];W[ff];B[gf];W[ge];B[fi]LB[cg:A]TR[cj]
[dj][ej][fj][dl][el]C[buckyyowza: C13 is much more important; with the F15 stones gone, F11 only protects about 6-8 points.  C13 retains the entire left side and secures life for the D10 stones.]

;W[jc];B[id];W[ic];B[hd];W[hc];B[ig];W[hf];B[if]LB[hh:A]TR[hd]
[id][jd][gf]C[buckyyowza: G14 and the J16 stones are relatively unimportant.  Play at H12 instead now to maintain a larger presence in the center.  Remember that your huge dragon still lacks any developed eye space, so maintaining control of the center is critical.]
;W[hg];B[ii];W[bg]C[Suzan007: addtime 1];B[ik];W[jj]
(;B[jk]LB[ij:A][mo:B]C[buckyyowza: in nearly all cases, this sort of peep should be filled.  Playing J10 would prevent quite a bit of trouble later on.  In fact, N5 is a cutting point for black, so is urgent for white to protect.  Without  a base for the L6/O7 stones, K10 has no basis so J10 is also sente for black. See var.]

;W[db];B[ba];W[ob]LB[mh:A]TR[og]C[buckyyowza: P18 steals your eyespace - now is the time to trap P13.  Black should play N12 now.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[nb];W[nk];B[ok];W[ng]TR[mg][mi][mn]C[buckyyowza: now black is in serious trouble!  All of the marked points cut black off from nearly all hope of getting life for the big dragon.  It is worth a shot trying to save it, but this is where at least half of black's stones on the right center are dead.  Therefore I will end my commentary here.  In general, I think this game was evenly matched - However it seems that both players were so busy trying to find a place to attack each other that neither truly remembered to defend themselves.  In  the end it seems that white got lucky and was able to exploit black first ;-)  I like to think of a good Go strategy as being one where you lead your opponent into a trap.  In order to do this, you have to respond to your opponent's moves until all of his choices become bad.  If you are always ignoring his plays and making attacks of your own, then you will invariably find yourself weak and end up struggling for life.  Of course, if your opponent is also guilty of ignoring his weak points then the game can be quite exciting ;-)

Thank you for the opportunity to review your game!  I hope that my comments have been of use.  If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me via email or look for 'bucky' on IGS.]

(;B[pk];W[pl];B[ol];W[qk];B[pj];W[qj];B[pi];W[qh]LB[og:A][pm:B]
C[buckyyowza: here is where the joseki normally ends, leaving big points at P13 and Q7.  In this case, however, P13 is huge for white because of the R14 stone - it gives white a strong group extending into the center, which is something black does not have at this point. The R14 stone also makes P13 a smaller play for black since it would no longer put any pressure on white's side group.  Q7 is a cutting point of equal value for both players, but since P13 is bigger for white than for black the game still becomes unbalanced no matter which is played.]
