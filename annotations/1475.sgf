(;B[cj];W[bb]C[This is a bad move I think...
I should extend to C12 instead

No, this is a good move. Black himself should have played b18. (See variation at move 11)]
;B[cg]C[Black catched this chance...]
(;W[fe]C[I think i made a bad move again...
I should go D18 to catch the black stone then the black group will be weak.

This time you are right. (See variation)];B[ed];W[ee];B[eb]

(;W[ch];B[bh];W[dh];B[ci];W[dg];B[cf];W[fg]C[This combination was too tight and unnecessarily strengthens black. Its better just to jump to e12 on move 18.]
;B[dd];W[ce]C[Very bad exchange for black. Aji keshi and vasting a valuable ko threat.]
;B[qf]
(;W[oc]C[Thisis aquestion of shape. The black stones at p16 and r14 have a weak point at q15. White should play there.]

(;W[cm]C[this move is to attack the black group at left side but probably this is not the right time to do this

Difficult decision. White is behind and black has very strong groups. Maybe a possible strategy is to play calmly and waiting for a chance. c7 feels too slow.
How about q5 shimari? Like this white tries to grab some territory and maybe later he can attack the left black stones.
Or black feels like strengthening his stones with a move. Its not so easy for black either. If he plays too calm because he is ahead white narrows the gap.]
;B[qo]
(;W[qp];B[po];W[nq];B[op];W[oq];B[mo]C[This is not good for white. His stones on the right are seperated and he is sealed in on the lower left.

White looks for a chance to attack the left group. For this aim it is important to have stones on the outside.

Look at the alternative at move 64 for a possible variation.]
;W[pi];B[qh];W[mk];B[ni];W[nl]C[I personally like this move]
;B[ll];W[mp]C[the focus for white is to rescue the stones around o8 and to attack the black group around c11.

A very difficult task to achieve both.

The play after n4 makes it even more difficult because white engages himself with other stones in this region.]
