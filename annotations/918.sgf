RE[B+Resign]

C[Hello

I'm joe (wysi), currently playing at 19k on the Dragon.  This is a game that I lost recently because of losing a very large group in the lower middle of the board, but I'm requesting the review for some other aspects of the game.  My comments are marked throughout.

---

Hello Joe,

I've tried to do my best here.  If any of my comments seem odd to you, feel free to ask me to clarify, or even get a second opinion, as I'm nowhere near infallible.  :-)  Overall I'd say you need to be a little more agressive when threatened, as well as try to take the whole board into consideration when playing locally, as in joseki, but then, this is hard and does take time to develop, and I'm sure you are trying your best.  :-)

-Thor];B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[qp];B[do];W[dl]C[joe:  I have to admit reading this joseki out of a book, because I wasn't really certain what to do here.  My opponent is very aggressive, and I think that much of the time I wasn't finding the correct refutation to his moves (ie punishing his overagressiveness).  In any case this joseki was chosen to allow me access to the left side of the board as I feared he would make a double-wing formation with his d16 stone (I generally do not like to allow my opponent to make that much territory, as I am not confident of being able to play inside it and live).
---
Two points: One, the pincer you chose is perfectly acceptable.  I often play it in this sort of situation.  Two, do not fear your opponent.  I just thought I'd throw that out there.  It's perfectly alright to show concern for what your opponent might do, but fear is an emotion that will suddenly put you at a disadvantage.]
;B[eq];W[er]LB[ep:a][dp:b]C[This may not be the best response given that it allows black to take up a more influential position.   Any influence he has will work well with his two hoshi stones on top.  Consider studying the joseki variations at 'a' and 'b'.  I haven't included them, but if you can't find them anywhere, I'd be happy to send them.]
;B[ep];W[fr];B[cq];W[dr];B[gp]C[joe:  here my opponent departs from joseki.  I'm not sure whether I handled this appropriately.]

(;W[cp]TR[gp]C[I do not think that this is a particularly good response on your part.  There are several things to keep in mind here.  The first is that it is far to early to be playing territorially like this.  I am not great at counting, but I estimate the value to be about 11 points.  Given that you will probably end in gote after this move, and given that grabbing this territory does very little for you positionally, Black comes out at an advantage in this exchange.  The second thing to keep in mind is that there is still the potential for this move, or 'aji' in the position if oyu do not play there.  Keep in mind that you can play there later when it might be more appropriate, and that also, if your opponent decides to stop you, he has to waste a move and hand you over sente.  Thus this is not an urgent point to play.  Thirdly, when someone departs from joseki, it is important to consider why they did so.  In this situation it seems that Black wants to get a foothold on the lower side so he can play there later.  If you look at the marked stone, it is in a decent position to help out an approach on your lower right stone.  Consider the variation which I have included.]
;B[co];W[bp];B[jd];W[cf]TR[dd][co][do][ep][eq][gp]SQ[dl]LB[pj:a]
C[joe:  I'm not happy with this kakari, but I felt as though I had no other choice.  I fully expected the pincer, and was aware that if I extended to e14 he would play f16, gaining a great deal of strength at the top.
---
I'd say this approach is a little dubious right now.  To play in this way you need to be very confident in your ability to save stones.  Onec your opponent pincers, you will have two stones in between the stong marked positions.  Having two weak split groups is not something that is good to have.  There will still be other opportunities to break into the territory on top.  I'd first stabalize your marked stone before trying anything on this side of the board.  Instead, I think playign at 'a' is a fine point.  It sets up action in the upper right and gives you the beginnings of a moyo on the right side.]
;B[cj]C[To be expected.];W[fc]C[joe:  I now felt that I could give up c14 in exchange for being able to break into his top territory.
---
Don't think this is such a great tradeoff.  Now you have THREE weak groups to worry about, and Black can attack them fairly handily.]
;B[df];W[fe]C[This seems like a bad idea.  You are pushing black down the side of the board, right into your weak groups, and you still don't have a base with any of your stones except for those on the lower left.]
;B[ce];W[eg];B[dc]LB[ej:a]TR[cf]SQ[cj]C[Personally, I'd consider playing at 'a' next in attempt to link up your stones.  Don't worry about your marked stone, it still has a little bit of aji left which you might be able to exploit later, but right now, I think you should concentrate on strengthening your weak stones.   If you look at the board now, Black doesn't have any really weak positions.  Black's  marked stone probably won't have too much trouble connecting on either side.  You on the other hand have a bunch of disconnected stones with little or no eyespace.  Black should be able to attack them with relative ease.]
;W[dg];B[ej];W[qf]C[joe:  I thought I might leave d8 for aji and again try to keep him from expanding on this side.  Is there a play in sente that would have done something more with the d8 stone?
----
I think leaving it alone is perfectly acceptable for the time being.  Your stones in the upper left seem fairly stable, and your D8 stone is not worth attacking right now.]
;B[qj];W[nc];B[oe];W[kc]TR[jd]LB[qc:a]C[joe:  a mistake?  getting hemmed in here.
---
It's not terrible, however it is a contact play, and while you will strengthen your stones uptop, it will also strengthen his marked stone which will spell bad news for your stones in the upper left.  Consider playing this move at 'a', forcing Black to pick a side, then you can worry about what  to do with the other side later.  You will have options on either side.]
;B[me]LB[ib:a][pb:b]TR[qf]C[Black didn't exploit  your contact play, so you are a bit lucky.  Next I would play either 'a' or 'b'. preferably 'a' because it connects to the left side.  Sooner or later though, you are gonna have to worry about your marked stone because Black is starting to get a worrysome framework on the right side.]
;W[kd]C[I think connecting under would ave been better, now Black may be able to keep you seperated.]
;B[jc];W[je];B[qd]
(;W[pl]LB[ie:a]C[joe:  this I have come to see as one of the worst moves of the game.  It should have been l15, cutting off the k16 group and keeping a connection alive to the 017 stone.
---
Actually, 'a' would have been the best move I think.  See the variations.]
;B[ke]C[joe:  Now whole top right is black's.  Or is there a better way than the next move?  k18?]
;W[jf]TR[jd][jc]C[This is a perfectly acceptable move.  Don't give up, Black's marked stones are in a difficult position.  Counterattack!]
;B[og]
(;W[pj]C[joe:  Attempting to keep r10 isolated.
---
Contact plays like this are generally not the best way to go abou this.  Try the variation.]
;B[ld]LB[kb:a][jb:b]TR[jc][jd]C[I think you still might have a chance here if you first decend to 'a', drawing 'b', then 'c', and try to make enough space on this side so that you can attack Black's marked stones effectively.  Perhaps you could even make two eyes.]
;W[jp];B[kb];W[qi];B[gr]C[This is not actually a threat to the corner, so you don't need to respond to it there.]
;W[br];B[gq];W[jn]TR[dl]SQ[gp][gq][gr]C[joe:  Also bad I think.  Perhaps somewhere like o3?  I already have access to the center.
----
Actually this is not so bad.  It threatens to rescue the marked stone while increasing your territorial framework.  Because of Black's marked wall, pulling the stone out before you set it up would most likely lead to black invading the lower right and attacking the marked stone.  Anyways, not a bad move here.]
;B[fl];W[jj];B[fi];W[gg];B[en];W[bo];B[bn];W[oq];B[rh];W[ri]
;B[lq]C[It seems to me that the complications resulting from this invasion could have been avoided much earlier on then when you seem to think it was the beginning of the end.  I'll point out the mistakes I think you made in handling this invasion.]
;W[jr]LB[mp:a]C[This is not a bad move, but it seems to me that you are committing yourself to killing the invader.  Otherwise it doesn't seem to me that you will be have enough points to win, as you will be driving your opponent up into your main territory.  If you don't kill this stone, I'd put you behind about 20 points.  One other move oyu could consider at this point is a shoulder hit at 'a', forcing the invader down where he has to escape under, probably in gote, after which you can fix your territory up top.]
;B[lo];W[no]TR[jn][jp][jr]LB[km:a][lm:b]C[This is a bad move.    First of all, because of your shimari in the lower right, your opponent will have a hard time making eyes as it is, so this is unnessissary.  Secondly, if you are driving his stones up, which doesn't sound so bad in theory until you realize that your marked stones are going to have to fight for thier life as well.  And he has a thicker position on the left side then you do on the right.

Consider playin something like 'a' or 'b' instead, although 'b' will introduce defects into your position which may make the fight more difficult.]
;B[lm];W[jl];B[lk];W[li]TR[jr][jp][jn][jl][jj]LB[jh:a][ki:b]
C[At this point you neen do accept the fact that your marked stones are in danger as well, and play 'a' or 'b'.  One mistake a lot of people make is to forget that one point jumps can in fact be cut.]
;B[kj];W[ji]C[joe:  the beginning of the end.  Too many weak points in the group, and it dies.  I ignore a couple of chances to fix it here or there (overconfident).  Still though, even if I had saved it I was well behind in territory at this point.
---
I think the end is a while ago.  :-)  You are right about the territory thing.  The invasion took a huge chunk out of your potential territory.    Actually I lied, it's not entirely over.  You just have to put up a collasal offensive effort on Black's invasion stones rather then worry about defending your own.]
;B[ki];W[jh];B[kh];W[kg];B[lh];W[nj];B[nh];W[nl];B[kn];W[jm]
;B[hn];W[io];B[hj];W[qg]LB[jk:a]C[Ouch, when you are in a fight like this you really should keep an eye on all of your cutting points, like 'a'.]
;B[jk];W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[mq];W[hr];B[gs];W[hq];B[ik];W[hh]
LB[is:a]C[All territory aside, if you are looking to save yourself, I would let the top fight later, it has a lot more eye making space and potential.  You need to secure two eyes on the bottom with a move like 'a']

;B[ls];W[kp];B[mo];W[ko];B[in];W[km];B[ln];W[ll];B[ml];W[kl]
;B[mk]C[It was a valiant effort in the end.  One other thing that might be useful is to learn to count territory in the middle of the game, it is very helpful, and can guide your judgement of which area's to play in.  It would be very useful to practice such techniques on the Dragon Go Server, where you have a lot of time to consider the position.  Other then that, I'd work on being more aggressive under pressure and as always, working on your whole board sense.  Good luck!]

(;W[ph]TR[qj]C[Threatens to break out AND isolate Black's marked stone.  At  the very least Q12 will probably escape.]
;B[oh];W[pi]C[This could prove to be more troublesome for Black.]
))
(;W[ie];B[ke];W[le];B[kf];W[lf];B[kg];W[md]TR[jd][jc]C[Black marked stones are in serious trouble.  Clearly cutting would be bad.  Consider plays that discourage the cut rather then outright black it.]
))
(;W[hq]C[Coming out on the side like this helps block Blacks access to the lower side.]
;B[hp]C[Black would probably play here, because it would be bad for him if you did first.]
;W[iq]LB[oq:a][lq:b][lp:c][cp:d]TR[dl][ep][gp][hp][eq][do]C[You crawl a little farther on the bottom.  Now you are ahead of Black on the bottom, and if he were to try and approach at 'a', you would have a strong pincer at 'b' or 'c'.  The wall of influence Black has gained is greatly diminished by your marked stone.  Also, the aji at 'd' is still in place, and Black would have to waste a move to fix it.]
