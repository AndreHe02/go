AB[pd][dp]SQ[km]C[Presently I'm playing a 14kyu game in even games.  In high handicap games (4 or more stones) I seem to play a 10 kyu game.  I have no idea what accounts for this difference other than practice.  So I've been trying to play a lot of even games.

I think that it's a general perception problem with Influence and Direction of Play.  These are the things I'm generally curious about.  There's something critically wrong with my even game.

Bernard - Hi Paul

 Looking @ your game it is clear that you prefer territory over influence. This is fine during high handi games but can otherwise cause problems. Playing even games should help.

 It is difficult to comment on direction of play. Firstly it is an advanced subject and secondly during handi games white mostly decides the direction of play.
 
 There is however some advice i can give you regarding timing and aji. During the fuseki if a move is not urgent rather play a big move elsewhere. Playing gote endgame moves during the middle game is very bad. I've commented during the game when this happens...]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[pi];B[dj];W[cn];B[fp];W[ck];B[co]C[Bernard - good move]
;W[cf];B[fd]CR[ch][ci][cj]C[Bernard - Better for black to cut white.]

;B[ce]C[Here, I'm thrilled to get a ponnuki.  From my perspective, white is now squished between my top strong group and my bottom strongish group.  I'm hoping he's undercut and I'm confident that he won't be building a huge center moyo.  How does this setup look to stronger eyes?

Bernard - Resist! This ponnuki is small. Its influence is reduced by its placement adjacent to 2 strong groups and the corner. C15 is middle game.]
;W[mc];B[ic]CR[jc][kc]C[Bernard - A more severe pincer would help later on.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb]CR[od]C[Bernard - P16 feels natural. Making territory here will give white a lot of influence.]
;W[od];B[pe];W[oe];B[pg]CR[qg]C[Bernard - It is difficult to find a good move for black. Q13 seems a bit weak though. Maybe just slide to S13.]

(;W[ni];B[of]TR[me][mf][mg]C[I rather wish this move had been at the bottom.  I like this move because I'm under the (mistaken?) impression that it squishes white's group and gives him bad aji.  False?

Bernard - This is good shape for black. It also allows you to attack 2 groups @ once by playing around N14.]

(;W[kp];B[bo]C[Bernard - Way to small!!! This move is endgame.]

(;B[oc]C[Bernard - This sequence destoyed your aji.];W[ob];B[nc]
;W[nd];B[nq]CR[qn]C[I'm not sure how else to break up the huge moyo white built.  I actually use a trick move that the high kyu at my club used to use on me until I got the hang of it.  I end up pretty small in here.   I live, but I don't think it had the effect I was really hoping for.  In fact, white later uses the super-bad aji of my dumpling-group to grab 15 points or so ...

Bernard - A good idea to invade. White mojo is to large and thin currently to reduce. Your move is as good as any other. This move has nothing to do with the fight later on.]

Bernard - Aye.];B[or];W[pn];B[pq];W[op];B[mq]CR[nr]TR[kr]C[Bernard - This move allows white to play around L2 and keep sente. Giving white a base and focussing on reducing the side seems to be a good strategy in this position.]

;B[hb];W[ja];B[fc]CR[gb]C[I realize how silly this move is.

What I can't figure out is why this wall didn't help me more than it did.  There must be some way to utilize it to do something good to white.  That UL is super strong with a great big wall attached.  It should be worth more.  I clearly don't know what to do with it.

Bernard - Influence only helps if there are weak groups close by or big mojo's that can be invaded resulting in former.]
;W[gb];B[fb];W[ha]C[Bernard - purely endgame];B[mo]C[Bernard - Good move. Time to reduce the white mojo. An invasion will be difficult with the wall on the left.]

;W[gj];B[gg]C[There, this is my attempt to do something useful with this great big wall.  I don't think it does very much.

At this point, I think black STILL has the advantage and I don't understand how white gets so many points.  He crushes my center dumpling-group (as previously mentioned).  Is it better here to try to help out my dumpling-group? or to try to undercut the left side?  Try to rescue those poor L-shape stones?   Is it already too late?

Bernard - Umm, where to begin. G13 is the right idea. Stop white from making territory. Your centre group is connected out. Just let it be. L-shape group is screwed. Still some big endgame to play elsewhere. One move here is enough for now.]
;W[if];B[hf];W[fr]C[Bernard - This is big. White has no satisfactory answer if you play here first.]
