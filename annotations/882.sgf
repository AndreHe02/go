C[Here, I play Black. I am particulary interested in the analysis of
the fuseki and the aproach to breaking W's moyo.

For clarity, * indicates post game thoughts, while those comments without
try ot give an idea of my thoughts during the game.

Thank you much for your time (and patience).

My pleasure.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[id];W[jp]
(;B[pj]C[That's a bit too slow. Don't give away your advantage of the first
move so easy. The move isn' t really bad, but it doesn't put any pressure
onto the opponent. Try to attack while making the moves you would like to.n
 See variation.];W[cj]C[Too slow also.];B[ch]LB[qn:A][np:B]
[pn:X][qo:X][pl:X][ql:X]C[I am floundering a bit here already, but I want to stop an
extension/approach from W. * E16 and C6 or thereabouts deserve more
consideration.

Partly right. E16 is too cautious. W did the same move like you before. So
use sente to attack and build up pressure. First there is A, which uses your
already played stone. If W defends with B, consider C6, if not, attack the
lower right corner. Even if W answers at one of the X's, you're able to keep
sente and attack the left side.n
But 9 isn't that bad at all. It threats a pincer and if you like playing
moyo-games, it's ok. Only play A before, please.];W[ed];B[ef]
LB[de:A]C[Must be on A. That gives you a much better shape on the left while

(;B[md]LB[pc:A]C[Ok, but this is no secure territory. There is still the 3-3
invasion. To take territory, better play A and invite W to invade. If he
does, it would be your pleasure to push W around until you kill him or get
magnificent influence and territory.n
On the other hand you already have influence and now is the time to use it.n
If you want to prevent a W moyo, do it now.n

C[The same problem as in move 7. Too slow. You already have influence
in the middle so it's unnecessary to play there. Put W under pressure]

;B[ra];W[nf];B[sc]C[That's it. Nice game.n
You were a bit lucky in getting the upper right corner and to be allowed to
live on the left side, but that's weighted out by the upper left and the
lower right.

Most of the game  looked good to me. Your style is polite and calm, what I
really do like. But sometimes you should play a bit more forcing. That
doesn't mean to play aggressive and look for fights in every situation. It's
more like playing calm while keeping the control. Don't rely on the opponent
to give you back the control like in move 7 and 8.

Try to get a feeling for your timing. This time you were fairly late with
your invasion. Another point is: Estimate the score before invading to get
an idea, how risky you have to play.

Think about these points and I'm sure you will improve your game soon.

Best wishes,

Peter])
