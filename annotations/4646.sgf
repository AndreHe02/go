C[Hi,

I played an interesting game against a 9k, a game which I think deserves a little analysis, as it sometimes highlights some typical poor or good play by my side. If anyone is willing to share some of his knowledge with me, I'll be glad.

There are a number of direction of play errors by both players.  I think this is the most helopful area to comment on.  I also added some other comments and variations.

Tom];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[dj];B[qo]C[I have always tought that letting black play two corner enclosures gives him an easy game. This white san-ren-sei does not look too threatening to me.

Agreed.];W[qf]C[This looks strange to me, a bit too close. As white, I would have rather played R11 or K3, both big points for black.

Yes plays at K3 or R11 seem bigger]
(;B[qj]LB[qh:A][qi:B]C[Trying to pincer his lonely stone. I'm wondering if I should have played it at R11 instead. Anyway, this right side now looks a bit low to me.

The low pincer is better I think.  At this point it is not a moyo game so 3rd line takes territory.  I would pincer at A or B.  The shimari is very strong so press severely against it.  With A white has no chance for an eye on the edge and must eventually run or give it up.

See the variations from A];W[qm]C[Yet another invasion. I think the timing is bad, as white now has to take care of two weak groups.

Absolutely!]

Yes as w I would extend further]
(;W[kq];B[iq];W[nq];B[jr];W[kr];B[fr];W[cs]C[?

But I tought there was some place left for an invasion, but this did not turn too well. I really wonder what a good player will do in this situation, as this left moyo is getting too big for my taste.

Well black is way ahead anfd w still has 2 weak groups]
