C[Hello.

I have added my coments where it says A:.

I would like to know if they are correct, if i have missed anything major and what area i could improve on.

Thanks in advance.

Andy

RickMott: Hi, Andy.  I'll do my best.... :)

Aside from a lot of tactical reading issues which will come clear with practice, I think the strategic flaw in your play which is easiest to fix is a tendency to follow your opponent around the board.  You often respond locally to small or gote moves by your opponent, instead of stopping to evaluate the whole-board situation.

Learn to pay more attention to whether your opponent's move is really sente, and always check the big picture before responding.  If you do that, you will gain 2 or 3 stones in strength very quickly.

Good luck!];B[qd];W[pp]C[RickMott: When White doesn't take the opposite diagonal corner, and you have started on the 4-3, one reasonable choice right away is to make it a territory game.  If you grab the D4 point, then two things are likely, both of which are favorable for you.

If White plays in the upper left, you get the shimari at P17.  If White approaches your corner, you are likely to end in sente and get the move in the upper left.  Either way, you get the last valuable corner move.

This will, of course, result in a game of small territories and many fights; no big moyo.]
;B[dd];W[dp];B[cn]C[RickMott: This is OK, but the upper side is bigger (either making the shimari or playing a Chinese opening with L16 or L17).]
;W[pc]C[RickMott: Too close an approach by White here.  I might pincer on the outside.]
;B[pd];W[oc];B[od]C[RickMott: I would definitely prefer R17 (3-3 point) here.  Why give up the corner?  White has to make a base on the top and you get a very strong position and a big extension down the right side.]
;W[lc];B[qi]C[RickMott: It's an ideal extension, true, but I still don't like giving up the corner.  Now your 3 stones are so strong you could jump to R18 for a bigger corner plus undermining White's base.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[md];B[qn]C[RickMott: Not the biggest area of the board now.  Yi-lun Yang 7P once taught me a useful rule of thumb for deciding the order of play: urgent defense first, urgent offense second, and then play in the biggest open area.  This move doesn't fit any of those criteria.  Your groups are reasonably secure from attack, and you have no obvious targets for attack.   The bottom is the biggest open area (11 lines between 4th-line stones).  Second biggest would be the left side (9 lines between your 3rd and 4th line stones), third biggest at the top, and the.... ermm.... smallest open area is where you actually played.]
;W[me];B[nf];W[ic];B[gc]C[RickMott: White is making small, tight moves, but you are following his lead.   Better to sketch a connection between your stones on the left, with something around D10, or make a double approach to his lower left stone.]
;W[hc];B[gd]C[RickMott: Bad move by White.  He strengthens you and gains almost nothing.  Your response is fine.]
;W[hd]C[RickMott: Terrible move by White, making an empty triangle.  You should play elsewhere.]
;B[cj]C[RickMott: This is fine.  I might be tempted to play higher (4th line), but this is the right general area.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[qq];B[op]C[A: I think this move was a mistake but i can't think of a better place. I was trying to confine white to the corner.

RickMott: It's not a "mistake", but it leads to complicated fighting.  White's move was a mistake (overconcentrated) and this is a reasonable attempt to punish it.  A more normal move for white would be to extend on the bottom.

However, you are comfortably ahead in potential territory; you can take a simpler path.  Just play K3 and prevent White from getting any kind of moyo.  You can defend this easily, and if you just keep life simple you should win in a walk.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[nq];B[po]C[RickMott: No, you should continue to extend on the 4th line.  White cannot hope to cut you and succeed.  You don't need to defend.]
;W[ro];B[fq]C[RickMott: I would defend your territory first with S6.]
;W[mp]C[RickMott: But this is a mistake for White.  After a double approach, he should play out at E5.  When he fails to do that, you should seal him into the corner by playing there yourself immediately.]
;B[nn]C[RickMott: Small move.  E5 is huge by comparison.];W[mo]
;B[mn]C[RickMott: You don't need to respond to White here; what can he do for a follow-up?  If he pushes in, you make a tiger's-mouth connection.  You would be better to play either E5 or J3 to make a base for your F3 stone.  Now that he's declared he wants bottom territory by standing up at N5, I like the J3 extension better.  You have two great follow-ups at M3 and D2.  He can't take both away.]
;W[gq];B[gp]C[RickMott: Good!  He should not have played a contact move and given you the hane.]
;W[hq];B[eo]C[RickMott: Good again!  This gives you a chance to seal in his corner stone, and gives you big outside influence.]
;W[cq]C[A: Should i have invaded the corner here?

RickMott: No, what you did was better.  You're doing fine here.  The balance of territory is way in your favor.]
;B[he]C[RickMott: This is OK, but I might prefer a move on the bottom to keep White's groups separated: connect at E4 or descend to F2.  As it is, White can connect underneath at F2.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[if];B[hg]C[RickMott: This is a fine sequence for Black.  You are building a big moyo and White is making very few points.]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[qc];B[lg]C[RickMott: I think you are a little too weak not to respond to R17.  You're way ahead, just descend at S16.  It threatens to jump into White's corner at S18, too.]
;W[ng]C[RickMott: This could get tricky, because of your cuttting points and potential for shortages of liberties.]
;B[og];W[nh];B[mi]C[A: I think i should have played P-12 here.

RickMott: Possibly just a simple connection at P14.  Your worry is the potential for cutting points, so maybe you should connect and let White worry about how to make his inside stones live.]
;W[oh];B[pg]C[RIckMott: but White forces you to fix up your weakness, so it turned out OK. :)]
;W[ph];B[qg];W[qh]
(;B[oi]C[RickMott: Ouch.  Your position looks like Swiss cheese.  You should block at S12 instead.  See variations on previous move.]
;W[rg]C[RickMott: Now you have a shortage-of-liberties problem.   Not sure you can avoid losing something, and letting White escape.]
;B[pf]
(;W[rf]C[RickMott: Not White's best play.  See variation.  You could have been in much worse trouble... :)]

(;B[rd];W[re];B[rb];W[rc];B[sc];W[oe]C[RickMott: I was wrong.  White's line of play is fine, you can't make two eyes.]
;B[of];W[pe];B[qe];W[se];B[ri];W[rh];B[sd]
(;W[pi]C[RickMott: You were just given a reprieve.  White R18 would have killed your group.  See variation.  You need to play R19 immediately to make your second eye.]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[ni];W[qj];B[pk];W[rj];B[nk];W[qk]C[RickMott: The suspense is killing me.    It's like watching Penelope tied up on the railroad track...  Which of you will realize first that Black's upper right group can be either saved or killed with one move??? (cue horror movie theme music in background...)]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[qm]C[RickMott: Ok, even if we ignore the 40-point move of R19, this move is very small.  The single most concrete tip I can give you is, "Stop following your opponent around the board".  If you learn to evaluate the whole-board position consistently before making a local move, you'll be two or three stones stronger in a week.

You need to either (a) solidify your giant moyo on the left, or (b) prevent white from building a big territory on the bottom.  Preferably, you need to find a move that helps with both.  K5, maybe?]
;W[rm]C[RickMott: Fortunately for you, White is just as prone to making small local responses... :)]
;B[rn];W[rl];B[ig]C[RickMott: Good, this is a big move.  Working on the gap in the bottom would be a little better, because it has dual purposes; it's on the border between black and white territory.]
;W[lf];B[kg];W[jf]C[RickMott: Small move, you should ignore this and play elsewhere.]
;B[hp]C[RickMott: Good.];W[ip];B[iq]C[RickMott: Risky to provoke a complicated fight which, if you lose it, will drive white into your moyo.  I would rather hane on top at J5 here.  Your potential in the center right is huge.  All you have to do is enclose it and White cannot win.]
;W[ir];B[io]C[A: I should extend from J-3?];W[jp];B[jo];W[kp]
;B[kn]C[RickMott: No need to back up a line here.  L5 is fine.]
;W[fr];B[cd]C[A: i think C 15 would have been better.

RickMott: Well, you don't have to give White his corner connection so easily.  I would consider E3 as a sente move first.

And, of course, there's always the 40-point R18... :)

But from the point of view of preserving your moyo, C16 is fine.   White should have a hard time invading.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[ep];B[go]C[RickMott: Now we're into the endgame.  All major territories have been defined, so it's time to pay very close attention to sente.  Many games are won or lost over control of sente in the endgame.

This move is worth one point in gote.  There are many, many more important moves on the board now.  G18 is big, and White must respond to avoid the monkey jump to K19 as a follow-up, for example.  B5 is big for the same reason.  Both should be played before this move.  Find a copy of Janice Kim's 5th volume in the "Learn To Play Go" series, subtitled "The Palace of Memory", for a nice clear introduction to endgame strategy.  Mastering that will add another couple of stones to your strength.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[co];B[nc]C[RickMott: Interesting sacrifice.  This prevents White R18 from working (at least right away).  But playing R18 yourself works, too, and keeps sente.]
;W[nb];B[qb]C[RickMott: Phew!  It's alive!  Congrats, you just won the game.]
;W[ob];B[kf];W[ke];B[jg]C[This move was unneccesary.

RickMott: Right, B6 and G18 are both bigger.];W[ch]C[I don't know what to do here the way i anwsered did not work i think maybe C-14 would be better but i don't know.

RickMott: White is trying to make two eyes in the middle of Black's territory.  It shouldn't work. Playing a contact move right away is the wrong answer; just strengthen yourself around him.   C14 would be OK, although I think B14 would be better because it takes away White's base.   D10, strengthening the single stone, would be OK too.]
;B[dh];W[cf];B[df]C[RickMott: This should be at C11, taking one more liberty from the white stone and threatening atari at B12.]
;W[bd]
(;B[ce]C[This was awfull B-17 would have the same effect.

RickMott: You have to decide whether you can kill the whole thing with B17.  If so, that would be better; if not, playing to separate White and kill the bigger remnant is OK.  But if you're playing to separate, B15 is much better than this move.  See variation.]
;W[be]
(;B[bf]C[RickMott: This is the real mistake.  White can capture this stone.  You need to atari from the other side at C13 to separate white.  See variation.]
;W[cg];B[dg]
(;W[bg]C[RIckMott: This was a mistake by White.  He should have expanded into the corner with C17.  This was only a 5-point game; if he'd played this correctly, he might have won.]
;B[bc]C[RickMott: Good, very big move.];W[ci];B[ad]C[RIckMott: Good use of sente!  This was a "double sente" move, preventing the White sente play of A17.  Compare this position to what you would have if White had played C17.  You get 10 more points, while White gets at least 6 fewer; a 16-point swing!]
;W[af];B[di];W[bj]
(;B[bi]C[RickMott: This sacrifice won't work, because you have no credible threat to follow it up with.  Better to just extend to C9.]
;W[ck];B[dj];W[bk];B[dk]C[RickMott: See?  This would have been several points better if you had taken C9 before.]
;W[dl];B[aj]
(;W[bh]C[RickMott: White gave you a break here.  This move was unnecessary.  If he plays C7 instead, he might win.  See variation.]
;B[cl];W[bl];B[cm];W[el]C[RickMott: Another wasted move by White.  He should take one of the big endgame points like G18, B6.  Actually, he should play H18 first (threaten monkey jump), then B6.]
;B[bm]C[RickMott: Ok, but by the same token G18 (threaten monkey jump) first.  Then maybe B5 is better because White has to answer and you get B7 anyway.]
;W[en]
(;B[fn]C[RickMott:  Uh oh.  This is risky.  Better to atari from the other side...]
;W[em];B[fl];W[ek];B[fj]
(;W[fk]C[RickMott: This may be a mistake by White.  He is up 4-3 in the liberty race.

Ok, I went through all the variations I could think of, and you still win.  but I think that was more luck than reading; separating White with the other atari back on move 153 is more straightforward.]

;B[al];W[ai];B[an]C[ RickMott: Congrats on your reading or good fortune, whichever it was... ;)]
;W[bo];B[ei];W[hn];B[fl]C[RickMott: You don't have to fight the ko.  Take white's liberty from the other side at D7.

White has some big ko threats; R19 and C17,  for example.  You have some too, so I don't know how it will go but there's no need to risk a ko at all.]
;W[ao];B[dm]C[RIckMott: This way you have to spend an extra move to capture, in gote.  If you atari from the other side, you don't.  White got to close off the corner and still has sente.]
;W[ak]C[RickMott: This is 3 points in gote.  G18 would be bigger for White.  T6 is bigger in "reverse sente", i.e. preventing your sente hane at T5.]
;B[am]C[RickMott: you definitely should not answer here. 1/2 point in gote.  Start with T5 in sente, then H18.]
;W[ln];B[lo];W[lm];B[ko];W[lp];B[no];W[sn]C[RickMott: This is big for White.  You should have gotten here first, because it would have ended in sente for you.]
;B[hb]C[RickMott: This is the last big play on the board.];W[ib]
;B[gb];W[ha];B[ga];W[ia];B[jd]C[RickMott: No hope if White answers correctly.]

;W[pb];B[pa]C[RickMott: No, this is wrong; you have to make sure you keep your eye.  Descend to R19.  Otherwise White can kill your whole group.  See variations.]
