C[I've been tending to shy away from pincers.

Letting B get a move near here seems too
good for him

reid: Everything seems reasonable so far.  I guess I don't
understand when you say you "shy away from pincers".
This pincer (k4) looks OK.

If you find yourself avoiding certain kinds of moves because
you don't like he consequences, you're going to have a hard
time learning how to properly deal with those moves.  For
example, many people avoid kos because they're afraid of
the consequences.  But then they miss out on some of the  most interesting moves,]
;B[no]C[At the time struck me as odd. Interested to know
if this is good.

reid: Well, the proverb says "the one point jump is never
bad" :-).  It seems OK here.  You were probably expecting
black to take the three-three (r3)?  Locally, black could
also q6 or r6.  But o5 seems to work well with black's large
shimari in the lower left.];W[qn]LB[qn:a][ql:b]C[Feels passive but I don't expect any real leverage
against the two stones and didn't want to give
B a nice move at B

reid: White r6 is very steady.];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq]C[Feel like this is slow for B

reid: Yes, I agree.  I think around h4 might be more dynamic.]
;W[dq]C[Wonder whether 3-3 would be better?

reid: It might be, but if we start from the idea that
black l3 is too slow, then perhaps black shouldn't play
on this side at all?  If black wants a large territory on
the bottom, he's going to need to take d3 himself.
But black d3 doesn't attack k4, so it's not really sente.
White k4 is does a good job of limiting black's
potential.

Perhaps white should play on the upper side instead?];B[cq]
;W[eq];B[cr];W[ep];B[do];W[jq]C[Chris nicely exploits this later]
;B[kp];W[dr]C[This is horrible. What was right?

reid: Yes, this is why black is able to invade later.
White still needs some move here, so what are the choices
besides d2?

White can either continue pressing on the black group on
the right, or he can play the simple kiema at f6.

F6 is gote, so let's see if pressing on the right works better?

White can hane at l5, for example.  If black counter-hanes with
m5, white double hanes with m6, and he should be able to settle
his k4 stones pretty nicely.

But perhaps black will cut at k5 instead of hane at m5?  In
this case, white extends at l6, b extends to j5, and white
joins up with h4.  Again, white can settle, and he'll have
some interesting aji later around n4 an m2.

Since black has already committed himself to the o3 group,
I think white should use pressure on that group to settle his
k3 group.];B[nc];W[pf];B[jd];W[ee]C[Felt that B pressing near here was too
good to permit

reid: The timing seems good.];B[gc]C[reid: This seems a bit passive.  I think black would normally
play high at g16.];W[pj]C[I was counting territory at the bottom left
so thought this kept the game even

reid: Yes.];B[ph]C[Plan was now to drive this stone out and make a  matching invasion at the top.]
;W[nf]C[reid: This seems a bit slow, but it's not easy to find a better
attack.  The invasion at q12 is very painful.

Perhaps white could try o12 or p12 instead?  It's hard to
say what might happen with these fights, but white has
to gamble a bit, I think];B[nh]C[reid: Black o12 is natural and easy.  It makes things
very difficult for white.];W[kd]C[Expected to get a nice reduction or some more thickness to keep pressing to 31 and 33]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[ld];W[ke];B[mc];W[jc];B[kb];W[id];B[hq]C[Ouch]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[gq];B[gp];W[fq];B[ir];W[hp];B[iq];W[ip];B[jr]
;W[go];B[qg];W[le];B[lb];W[qf];B[hd]C[I thought that B would patch up his group
on the right];W[qi];B[rg];W[rf]C[reid: White s14 is slow.  If we consider that black has q18,
or possibly even some ko aji at r17, we can see that the
white corner can never be big (actually, if white wants
corner territory, q17 might work a bit better).

White is behind in territory after the exchange at the bottom,
so he needs to win by using his power, not on territory.
How about attacking black on a large scale with something
like n10?  White wants to make his thickness at m15 and
g5 come into play.];B[je];W[lg]C[I thought I was now going to solidify some territory
either to left or right

reid: It's hard to get territory in the middle.  And
looking at corner and side territory, black is ahead.
This move might work because it attacks black's
weak group, but I'm not sure the direction is right.];B[mi]
C[reid: Running out is OK, but it's often faster to settle
by playing contact moves.  In this case, black p10
looks like good shape.  White hanes at p9, black extends
o10, and he's getting near to his first eye already.];W[ie]
C[reid: This is a pretty dangerous move!  If black pulls out
with j14, it's going to be a messy fight.  White's corner might
even come under attack.  Black probably can't afford to start
a fight like this right away (because he already has one
weak group), but it's a threat that black can aim at and that
white has to worry about.];B[he];W[jf]C[reid: White gets lucky :-)  Now white has a lot of power
in an important area of the board.];B[hf]C[reid: Black h14 is slow.  If black is worried about white
getting territory around f13, he can play pre-emptive
reducing moves at l11 and c9.  It's very hard for white
to simply grab center territory.  He needs at least two
moves in a row to get anything,];W[nj];B[mj];W[nn]C[Feeble attempt to play at distance from "weak"
group.

reid: Why do you want to play at a distance from the weak
group?  The proverb says "play away from strength" :-)

Yeah, this is clearly the wrong direction.];B[oo];W[pn]C[10 points behind but B is not yet settled

reid: I agree.  That's why white has to take the
initiative!  Clearly, the black group at n11 is worth
more than q6.  The essence of go is to play the most
important move at any given time.  Q6 is big, no
doubt, but attacking the black n11 group is even
bigger!];B[nk]C[reid: Ahhh, black gets the critical move first.]
;W[oi]C[reid: This leads to bad shape.  Better to answer honestly
with p9.];B[oh];W[mk]C[I still think that I should be able to make something of
this];B[ok]C[reid: Ouch.];W[ni]C[Oh dear

reid: Classic empty triangle :-(];B[lh];W[pk]C[Soon after the empty triangle dropped off
and I resigned.

reid: Hmm, it seems like they should be salvagable,
which means white should still have some chance.,
But it's certainly difficult for white now.

I almost feel that white was defeated psychologically  in this game.  After the exchange on the bottom,
white seems a bit desperate and doesn't really make the
most of his position.  Remember that in go we trade
territory and power.  If white had used the power he
gained in the bottom, he would still be in this game.

Black played a few slow moves here and there, but his
positions were all coordinated, and he got to a few
critical moves before white did.  In the final result,
that gave him the edge.])
