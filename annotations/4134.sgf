C[Note from submitter (krinid):
I'm playing black in this game.

I'm interested in moves I could have played better to improve my shape, style, territory, misplays, overplays, missed opportunities, played an ooba instead of a kyuuba, played in the wrong ooba, order of play, sente/gote, joseki/tesuji misplays or completely missing the potential to play them, etc, in general, irregardless as to whether they would change the outcome of the game or not.  I'm interested in the flow of the game and patterns or ideas I may have missed.  eg: if there was some way to get more territory in the center, some way to invade the bottom side or to better invade the top side, etc.

Thanks in advance for the review.

krinid];B[pp];W[cc];B[dp];W[qd];B[od]C[krinid:
How is this for a kakari?  Does it's worth depend on whether the upper left is a white or black stone?  What's a good follow up to it?

D:  Hi, I'm Darrell.  I'm about 5kyu, and I'll be reviewing your game.

This kakari is fine.  P17 is also good.  One kakari or the other are the only moves I would even consider on this board.]

(;B[qm]C[In response to white's approach at O4, Q6 is almost always right.  The tighter move let's your attack white much more severely.  See variation.]

(;B[dd]LB[ic:A]TR[kd][nd][np][jq]C[this move says you want to control the center.  I think that will be difficult with all of the marked white stones.  It's hard to find a good move here.  I think I would start at 'a']

(;B[cd]C[when in a pushing situation like this, you *must* "walk ahead."  Make white push from behind.  If you're not willing to do that, then the move at D16 has to be wrong.]

(;B[eq];W[fp]TR[fq][jq]SQ[co][do][cq]C[notice that K3 is an ideal distance from the two stone wall you just forced white to make.  When you force your opponent to make ideal shape, you probably made a mistake.

Furthermore, your corner is still quite open.  This corner shape is not very strong, with weaknesses at the marks.]

Perhaps D14 is better here?

Yes, I think so.];W[df];B[cf];W[og];B[ik]LB[kg:A]C[this doesn't do anything useful.  How about something like 'a'?]
;W[lp];B[ic]C[krinid:
I figured there was enough room to invade here, but I wonder if white couldn't have stopped it?

Hard to say for sure, but I think so.  White is quite strong around this now.]

;B[ie];W[jf];B[if];W[jg];B[ig];W[jh];B[ih]C[krinid:
It doesn't seem to be to white's advantage to continue running.  Or maybe the territory around M14 is worth the exchange?]
;W[li];B[ho];W[hp];B[io];W[go]C[krinid:
At this point, I want to maximize my center territory, but am not sure what the best way is - any advice?

Not really.  White has too much of a solid presence in the middle.  I would work the endgame now.  There is almost always more territory at the sides than in the middle.

Look at the moves in this variation for examples.]

krinid:
Thanks for the review.

You're welcome.  You played quite a few good moves.   In the future, remember that the sides are usually bigger endgame plays than the center.  It is very hard to secure much territory in the middle.]
