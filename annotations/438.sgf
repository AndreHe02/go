AB[dp][pd]C[

I played black in this H2 game and I was left puzzled   bz the way I lost the game. I added questions and   comments on the parts I do not understand and need   most help with. Pls. feel free to make comments on   other moves that were mistakes but which I did not see   as mistakes at the time.

Thank you!

(;B[fe]C[I felt this was a natural choice of joseki considering the   two hoshi stones. Is this correct?

HK: Black 6.  A reasonable move. But the latest trend joseki is also atractive for black. Let's try a variation.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ec];B[fc];W[fb]
(;B[gc]C[HK:  Black 12. D18 instead is the basic joseki move. See the joseki variation.]

(;W[dg]LB[dg:a][db:b][eg:c][df:d]C[Joseki move is white a but I couldn't find a good   counter. Black b came to mind but I'm not sure   it is better. I think black c directly would be best (in the   game I played a bit differently) any ideas?

HK:  White 13. D18 instead is very good for white. Refer to the variation.]
;B[eb];W[db];B[df]C[HK:  Black 14 and 16. Fabulous!];W[cf];B[ef]
;W[ce];B[cg];W[np];B[eg]LB[eg:a]C[This result seems o.k. to me (especially the   marked stones) although i feel w got the marked move   for free. Any thoughts?

HK: Black's influence on the left and upper side is overwhelming. Black's advantage is obvious now.]
;W[pg];B[pi]C[Keeping the attack seemed natural. Should I have   defended the top?

HK:  Black 24. O16 instead is better,simple and enough to keep black's advantage.]

C[HK:  Black 34.  Black should atari first at R17.]

;B[qc];W[pb]C[HK: This situation is a little difficult for black.]
;B[pl]LB[pl:a]C[With 38 I wanted to weaken whites marked stone   without making a move to cover it directly and also   this opens-up some options in the lower-right.

HK:  Black 38.  good.];W[fq]C[HK:  White 39.  C6 is better. Left side is big.]
;B[hq]C[What follows is a natural sequence of moves but i   have a feeling black looses a bit. I just can't put my   finger on it...

(;B[el]C[HK:  Black 56.  D2 instead is simple and maybe enough. See the variation.]

(;B[dj]C[HK:  Black 68.  G9 atari instead to avoid ladder is recommended.  Refer to the variation.]
;W[co];B[eq]LB[eq:a][bp:b]C[This aims at black a but with the marked stone in place   white can permit the connection in return for a corner.]

[po:c][pp:d]C[I was quite happy with the result. Next I wanted to play   a or around b. Since I couldn't deicide I went for the   option that seemed to promise an attack (c). What   would you play here?

HK:  R3 is largest.
And G6 is better for white 81.];B[pp];W[po]C[HK:  White 83. R4 is better.]

HK: Yes.  This bad shape is caused by M9 and O9.];B[jk]
(;W[qk]LB[qk:a][kl:b]C[With the cut protected white had to play out and I went   on another attack.

HK:  White 116.  White should secure the life of center white group as shown in the variation.]

I'm not in a hurry to get this done so take all the time   you need. I hope you find the game interesting enough   to invest your time into reviewing it.

Thank you again...

HK:  A point to Goran at the end of my review.  If you learn a little more life and death, your Go will be improved a lot.

Thank you.])
