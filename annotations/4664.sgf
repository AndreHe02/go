Hello Marcin,

Your game was interesting and you showed a very positive attitude by not being afraid to fight. Not being afraid of fights is one of the best and quickest ways to improve your go.

I reviewed your game by focusing on your opening and I gave you suggestions on how to best start a fight by trying to create a framework (moyo) for your stones.

I added P: before all my comments.

Philippe];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]C[P: black playing at these points is a slower opening, see following comments.]
;B[oc];W[df]
(;B[pj]C[too slow?

P: No the extension from your enclosure is not slow.

Extending from a corner enclosure is very good. This sets-up a nice beginning for a framework (moyo) in the top right for black.

Please note that R10 on the third line is also possible and goes more for territory. Q10 on the 4th line is played more for fighting and influence.

However, this extension does not work very well with your other corner stone at Q3.

Please see variation at Q5.

See comments later on why Q10 does not work well with Q3.];W[qo]
C[P: White takes this point quickly.

The reason I said Q10 did not work well with Q3 is that Q10 is too far to be a pincer on a white approach at R5. White can make a base for his stones by extending to Q8 or going in the corner.

This is also why I mentioned before that black will often play at Q5 or R5 before extending to Q10 or R10. (see previous variation added)]
;B[qp];W[ro]
(;B[oo]C[small?

P: not small but unusual. Black at P5 is high and vulnerable to counter attack from white on the bottom. 

Typically black plays at P4 or O4 and is a little more patient before attacking white. 

K3 is a bit far but it could work.];W[ql]C[P: white stabilises, black can make profit by extending from the bottom right.

The move at Q10 works well for the upper right for black but does not bother white too much on the bottom right.]

(;B[jp]C[too high, not closing white..?

P: it is not too high but playing on the fourth line does not really secure territory but goes more for power for fighting.

This is a matter of preference and is ok. J3 goes more for territory.

P8 does try to seal white in but it is better to play on the bottom first. Further white can still take black territory at S10. Not as easy if black at R10]
;W[lp]
(;B[gp]C[looks bad :(

P: 2 stones on the 4th line make more difficult to stabilise your group. 

It is good to try to maintain a balance between 3rd and 4th line in the opening. It is not too bad in this case as you can move-out to the center. 

The variation you showed at M3 is a possibility but white could try to move out in the center from M4.]
;W[op]
(;B[pp]C[empty triangle.. is P3 better?

P: not great but necessary, to protect the corner];W[np];B[po]
C[P: black is connected and white does not have much of a base.

black also has split the 2 white groups and this is very good.]
;W[mo];B[nr];W[lr];B[mq];W[lq]
(;B[cn]TR[gp][jp]C[2 stones already weak....
bad direction...?

P: hard to say which is best.

the stones are weak but being on the 4th line they can move out easily in the center. 

You are inviting a fight in condtions that are about equal for both sides, this is ok.

Playing at E3 is not bad but gives white too much of an easy time on the left.]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[cp];B[ck]C[P: black is more stable now and this is good.

Black did relatively well here as he is on the left side in a stable postion. There is one black and one white weak group without solid bases on the bottom. So for now it is ok for black.]
;W[ch]
(;B[jd]C[too high?

P: this is big for black

It is not too high, it is a matter of style and the strategy you want to use. Again this is more for fighting as territoy is less secure.

K17 would be also be possible but I have a preference for K16 as it works well with the stones in the upper right corner and the extension at Q10.]
;W[lc]
(;B[fc]C[asking for invasion...

P: Sorry but this is very bad. 

It is good to ask for invasions but were you have the advantage.

With F17 there are 3 white stones on the left close to f17. This will lead to hard fighting for black. 

N15 would be working better with K16 and Q10 and would help you form a large framework in the upper right. 

With black at N15 why not invite white to invade the upper right where there would be 5 black stones.

F17 allows you to be easily split and I do not like it as much.]
;W[hc]
(;B[gd]C[weak, but what is better?

P: actually G16 is usually the most forcefull reply black has. However, with the 3 white stones in the upper left, it is vulnerable to cuts and as such is less forceful.

Your variation in h16 is also hard for black because you are at a disadvantage locally in the upper left.]
;W[hd];B[he];W[jb];B[gf];W[ie]
(;B[id]C[not read :/

P: Both moves are hard on black since he is split in two close to white stones on the upper left.

This all comes from F17 instead of N15...];W[if];B[ic]C[P: I would leave this for later because it gives you bad shape.

I have not added much more comments since the fighting that comes after has many possible variations.

I answered your question later were I could.];W[hb];B[ld];W[mc]

(;B[gm]C[not read :/

P: yes trying to connect all the black stones with K7 is more important than the 2 black stones.

(;B[po]LB[po:A][qo:B]C[P: alternative

Often black can make a second enclosure at A (Q5) or B (R5). This is why I commented earlier that your opening moves were more suited for a slower opening when compared with Q16 and Q4 for example. 

See next moves for a possible continuation.];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg]
;B[jp]LB[po:A]C[P: When black plays at A yes White can stop black from extending to Q10, but black can extend to K10 and this reduces the influence of white at D4.

In your opening you extended at Q10 but white still managed to get on the right side with the approach at R5. See other comments in game]
