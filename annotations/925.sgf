C[Let me begin by saying that I played tournament level Chess for
some years but was completely burnt out from all the studying,
memorizing, and general craziness.  I still can't bring myself
to play a casual game to this day.  I love GO and I wish to improve
but not at the cost of my passion for the game.  In this light,
please help me to better understand the nature of the game and
my weaknesses.   I wish to play naturally, not by memorization and intense study.
It's OK if I'm never 1dan.  I would rather lose every game I
play by 5 stones than win some and get killed in others.  I only
wish to play elegantly and to be a respectable player.

I have been playing for almost two years.  However, in all that
time I have played once a week against my mother whom I taught
and who is much weaker than I.  I give her 9 stones.  She is
72 and playing well enough now that I have to beat those 9 stones
each week.  I have recently started studying a bit and playing
on IGS, WING, NNGS, KGS, etc.  IGS has me at 24k and I was once
10k on KGS but I don't know how that happened.  I have purchased
The Many Faces of GO software and have played it 20 times at
level 1 (the weakest, 20k I'm told?).  Playing black and giving
5.5 komi I have won twice and some of the losses were very close
games while others were blowouts.

This is a recent game on WING.  I tried some different things
than usual and I felt the game was going well, except for the
lower left,  but then, well, you know the story.  Thank you in
advance for your help.


Review by John Rae 6kyu UK];B[pd];W[dq];B[pq]C[I have always played on the star points but I tried the 4-3 today.

J: Its always nice to try different things to expand your knowledge and interest.   There are some very nice articles by Charles Matthews which can be found at this site.  http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/learn/golearn.html

The articles on openings do become more advanced but you might find its still fun to look through and get a feel even if you can't read out the variations. (I can't either) The sections for beginners are well worth reading through.]
;W[cd];B[pj];W[jp];B[jd];W[co];B[qo]C[Normally I would go for the last side star point but I tried
to secure the corner.

j:   This is perfectly playable.

So far your opening strategy has been to create a large framework. The plan is that white will eventually invade, around Q5 and by attacking the invasion black will develop some solid territories. securing the corner is changing horses mid-stream.

N4 would be a nice point to sit and wait for white to invade. When the invasion comes you're likely to get a nice territory at the bottom and be able to build up from the Q10 stone to make a really nice framework above while white escapes into the middle,

The general priorities are corner , approach opponents corner, side.  Since you're waiting for white to approach your corner it seems a good idea to approach his in the meantime. E16 or E17 seem good. White will probably respond.

I'd not take the star point yet. It does not actually threaten white very much and even if white gets it there is room for you to invade later.]
;W[ec];B[nc]C[That side star point was calling me but I was trying to play
different/better?

j: O17 does not quite secure the corner but its a fair enough move. I'd expect white to take the star point next though so I think thats where I'd have played.   Possibly k10 if I was thinknig about a large scale framework. With k10 in place I'd feel happier about playing m3. I'd like to play m3 since it looks under the white stone at k4. But if I play it now I'd expect white to cap it at m5 sometime and aim for his own large central framework]
;W[dj];B[lp];W[jc]
(;B[kc]C[

j: I think I'd have been tempted with j17 and a bit of a fight.

I'd like to see some reasonably secure black stones looking across to C13 to help an invasion. In exchange I'd accept white running out long the M/N lines. I'd hope I could make some plays at the top to take territory while chasing these white stones]
;W[ic];B[kf]C[I did this to protect the cutting point.  This can lead to a
ladder if white plays l16 followed by black m16 right?

j: Yes. It also expands your framework at the top. White should invade fairly soon before you can stabalise things.]
;W[lq];B[kq];W[kr];B[mq];W[lr];B[jq]C[Was n4 better?]
(;W[ir];B[jr]C[Was l4 better?

j: Well I'd have played it but I can't say for sure that white should have made your move into a mistake.]
;W[js];B[kp];W[iq];B[mr];W[is]C[j: things have turned out well for black with this last exchange.

White didn't really get very much at all. black is solid in the corner and has a wall facing up the side. I'd not be too worried about the cutting point but would probably simply protect it since that also expands the side for me.]
;B[jo];W[kb]
(;B[lc]C[j: see the alternative - this does not give you that much on the top so was it worth a move?

Its  painful when white gets j4];W[ip];B[km]C[Another knight move to prevent the cut with a ladder, right?]
;W[lb];B[mb]
(;W[hg]C[J:  I think white is leaving too much of a gap for you here. Its well past time for an invasion. Black is getting far too solid while white's position is less solid on the side but has territory top and bottom.]
;B[if]
(;W[he];B[ie]
(;W[id];B[hf];W[ge];B[gf];W[ih];B[jh];W[kk]C[This is one of those moves that gets me and I don't know how
to respond to it.

j: well a start is to consider the likely score and then decide what strategy is needed.

Its a bit tough to estimate that closely in this position. Lets start by noting that black is breaking into the white side with G14. Also the stones around L7 are in a position to jump in a bit and reduce white.

Secondly lets consider that there are three white stones hanging in the middle which could potentially get cut off and captured. Thirdly lets think about white jumping further into the black area and managing to live.

So there are two alternatives.   1) Simply pull back and defend your area intending to reduce white in revenge later.
2) Try to capture these impudent stones that are jumping into your territory.

Lets look at the possibly shape of territory if you pull back (Variation 1)

Now the alternative (variation 2)

I confess I've no idea which is going to work out better. However it feels to me that pushing in to white's area and exchanging severe reductions is the best strategy. My feeling is that black has less that white can actually threaten to capture so while white reduces black black might threaten to capture something of white's.]

(;B[jj]C[j: this contact play is not really doing either of the alternative strategies. Whitre may well end up pushing deeper in and also getting a solid defensive shape.]
;W[jl];B[kl];W[jk];B[kj];W[lk];B[ij]C[Should I have responded to m9 directly and if so how?  I played
j10 to divert my opponents attention.

j:  White is through your wall now so you're going to lose a fair bit. Thgreatening to cut the group off is as good a strategy as anything. use it to push deep into white's area rather than expect to kill the group.]

(;B[jg]C[Perhaps k14 was better so as to prevent whites next move?

J: Yes. Bear in mond the stones round white's back are connected so as long as he doesn't get out any extra stone added to this group gains him nothing]

(;B[gj]C[j: This is not necessary, you may as well have passed your move. If white plays atari here you will simply connect so there was no threat]
;W[mi];B[ef];W[fe];B[ee];W[dd];B[de]C[j: Its not an efficient use of your stones.   Here you're pushing in to reduce white's territory. Turning at right angles reduces by one point. If you want to continue here jump to c14, it reduces more and threatens to make as much territory as D15. (The territory gain is minimal so thats not the main purpose of your moves.)]

SQ[ie][ke][gf][hf][if][jf][kf][jg][jh]C[j: Sorry I think your question here has gone missing. I'm assuming you're asking about the life situation in the marked stones.

The black group has 4 liberties and the ko. The white group has 3. If white pushes at k11 black simple blocks at L11

Therefore the stone marked 5 was not needed as an escape for the black group and would have been better played at Q13, where white has just played.]

Ok 113 squares for black

Lets put in some triangles for white. I've left the middle since its not really white's yet

About 122.

Therefore unless theres a capture of some of the white central stones the passive defense does not look an ideal strategy]

If white pulls back then black can switch to the defnsive strategy but is better placed to attack the 2 stones.

If white jumps further in black protects as much of the top as possible. (The bottom is nice and safe) and jumps into white in revenge.]

White is playing deep insode black's shpere of influence so should expect to have to sacrifice a few stones in order to achieve anything.

The point is if white waits it becomes too late an its all black territory anyway. On that basis white may as well give it a go becasue the net efect is zero - black's playing a stone for every one white's potentially sacrificing.]
