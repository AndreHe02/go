C[cjmichael [6k\]: hello
bahzfaz [6k\]: hi
--
cj: Hello, thanks in advance for the review.  I'm cjmichael, playing as black in this game.  Please let me know what I'm doing wrong.  I've asked some questions within.

Hi; I will mark my comments with [ZD\].  Although the review is requested for black, I have commented on both sides, since I think it would be difficult to understand what I mean otherwise.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[ec];W[cp];B[cd];W[ep];B[jq]LB[dj:A]C[[ZD\] Playing around A would be bigger now (it is an ideal extension for both black and white).]
;W[hq];B[mq];W[cj]C[[ZD\] Now white has ideal formation in lower left.]
;B[pj]LB[jd:B][qn:A]C[--
cj: I played this move to try and get a double wing like he did in SW.  I think it was a bad move though.  Would an approach to Q4 be better?

[ZD\] I think this is OK, A and B are now miai.];W[oq]LB[qn:A]
C[[ZD\] This is slow, A would be more natural.];B[qn];W[qo]
;B[pn]C[[ZD\] White lost his advantage; in exchange for a small territory in corner, he strengthened your right side a lot.]
;W[no];B[jo]LB[jd:A]C[[ZD\] You might consider ignoring white and finishing your moyo at A, but this is also OK (maybe even better).]
;W[ho]LB[kc:D][nc:C][jd:A][ho:B]C[[ZD\] If black moves at A, his moyo becomes much larger than whites, and the defence at B is not too urgent.  White should play at C or D.]
;B[kc]C[[ZD\] This move should be on 4th line, to make it more difficult to reduce the moyo.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[rc];W[rb];B[np]
LB[rd:A]C[[ZD\] A is quite big, and more or less double-sente, so I would play it now.]
;W[oo];B[op];W[po]
(;B[qq];W[pq]C[--
cj: My next move was an obvious mistake.  Is there a good move or is this a bad situation in the first place?

[ZD\] I do not think anything interesting can be done here.  This sequence strengthens white and weakens your positions.]
;B[ro];W[rp];B[rn];W[rq]
(;B[mo]C[[ZD\] This looks a bit small, and forces white to jump in into your moyo. It strengthens your bottom group, though, so I do not dare to claim it is wrong.]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[om];B[pl]LB[ql:A]C[[ZD\] A is a better shape.]
;W[mc];B[md]LB[kc:B][ne:A]C[[ZD\] A would be a better shape, not forcing white to damage B.]
;W[nd];B[od];W[ld]
(;B[me]LB[le:B][ne:A][nf:C][of:D]C[[ZD\] It would be probably better to capture at A, now the white stone still has some potential (B is a forcing move, C and D may be useful sente moves if white needs to reduce your right-side territory).]
;W[lc];B[kd]C[[ZD\] This is definitely wrong, you are forcing white to go out, which is exactly what he would like to do anyway.]
;W[le];B[ke];W[mf];B[ne];W[kf];B[lg];W[lf]TR[kc][kd][ke]C[[ZD\] Allowing your opponent to get a shape like this (cleanly separating your positions) is a disaster.

Time for score estimation:
Black has 12 (ul) + about 20 (right) + 10 (bottom), total 42 pts.  The triangled stones are weak, making it difficult to make many points on upper side.

White has 10 (bottom right)+ 8 (upper right) + say 18 in bottom left + 6.5 komi, in total about 42 pts.

White also has more potential in his bottom left moyo, so he seems to be a bit ahead at this point.

Given this, playing the invasion with your next move is probably necessary, more conservative variations keep you behind on teritory.]

(;B[cl];W[cg];B[el];W[ej];B[gl];W[nf]LB[og:A]C[[ZD\] A bit slow, white can certainly jump at least to  A.]
;B[of]LB[pg:A]C[[ZD\] It would be better to defend around A.]
;W[og];B[pg];W[pf];B[oe];W[ph];B[qg];W[oh];B[qh];W[mi]LB[ng:A]
TR[og][oh][ph]C[[ZD\] Slow.  The cut at A works, but the triangled stones are not important.]
;B[gp]
(;W[gq];B[hp];W[ip];B[go]
(;W[io]C[[ZD\] White seeks out unnecessary complications.];B[iq]
;W[gn];B[fo];W[fn];B[eo]C[[ZD\] White damages his position.]
;W[fp];B[en];W[im]LB[em:C][hm:A][hn:B]C[[ZD\] Black attacks too tightly, reducing his liberties.  A-B exchange seems wrong, making the cut at C possible.]

(;B[hm];W[hn]
(;B[jn]
(;W[hl];B[gm]C[[ZD\] White should not reduce his liberties this way.]
;W[in]
(;B[il]
(;W[jl]C[[ZD\] This unnecessarily forces the capture, taking gote and losing some possibilities.]
;B[hk];W[jm];B[fm];W[ll];B[nr]C[--
cj: I knew this group was weak, which is why I did this move.  I realize though that I could have done a much better fixing move here.]
;W[nq];B[mp];W[or];B[di];W[ci];B[dj];W[dh];B[dk];W[eg];B[bf]
;W[ei]LB[ie:A][bg:B]C[[ZD\] Small. A play around A looks more interesting.  Or just defending at B.]

cj: I think this was a bad move.  What would you say is a good move at this point?

[ZD\] This move looks a bit small (white cannot get more than two or three points around A, anyway.
B, C and D are definitely bigger.];W[ml];B[nl];W[nk];B[ol];W[jj]

cj: I think I could have done a better job of reducing the middle, but I'm not sure how.  This is my last comment.  Thanks!

[ZD\] There are almost no points in the middle (about 15). Your last move is about 5 points gote. A is 11 points gote. B is 3 points sente if you cannot win a ko, or C is 5 points sente.]
