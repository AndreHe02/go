C[Hi, I'm Jason. I will try to make some suggestion. .Let's go!



Hi, this is my second recorded game, I play white , and I need a comment on my moves and black move so that I can improve my skill.
I added my comments on my moves and my opponent's moves.

Thanks a lot for the commentator !];B[cp]C[Black is taking lower left]
;W[qd]C[So I take the upper right];B[dc]C[I think black is trying to take the left side]
;W[pq]C[So I take the right side then];B[qo]CR[po][qn]C[It's a way to attack a 3-4 stone.  There are some others ways like q5 or r6.

:I don't know what black's plan but I think he's attacking W4]
;W[kq]C[Too far. Try r7 to attack his stone.


:So I defend with W6 and extending, is it to far ? or to close ? or should I play another move ?]
;B[oc]C[I see black is doing the same to my W2];W[pi]C[The same as L3. Before extending to the center, enclosure your corner first.




:I defend again but this time W8 is higher than W6 because I'm :planning to extend to the center later.
:again, is this move is correct?];B[ce]MA[aa][ba][ca][cb][bb]
[ab][ac][bc][cc][bd][ad]C[Black get about 11 points by this move. It's good.



:I see black is making territory in upper right];W[eq]C[so, I decide to attack the lower left]
;B[qk]C[I think black is trying to make territory here];W[qj]
C[I stop the possibility for black to reduce my territory];B[pe]
C[black is further attacking W2];W[qe]C[I defend W2];B[kc]C[Good move! But R17 is better.
It's hard for White to attack the up side.

:black strengthens upper side];W[cn]C[I continue attacking the lower left]
;B[co]C[I don't know the purpose of B17 but I think he tried to defend B1]

(;W[cj]CR[eo]C[Not bad. You can try E5 to connect your stone, too. Or see the variation


:but I defend W16 with W18  while making territory in case :something happend.
:is this move too long, too short or wrong move ?];B[bn];W[bm]
C[Yes.

:I guess this is a bad move isn't it ?
:black could play at C7 and destroy my group ?];B[on]C[but he played here]
;W[bo];B[ep];W[kn]C[Strengthen E3 first.


:I'm going to seperate black group and surround black group in the :lower left]
;B[dr];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[ip];W[iq];B[gm];W[fj];B[em];W[kj]
C[Black groups can easily make alive. It is difficult to kill him.



:Until this move, I still trying to surround and kill black group in the :lower left
:but it seems that black group is trying to make life there ??]
;B[dn];W[cm];B[gq];W[gr];B[nq]C[Not yet. See the variation.

:Black capture W4]
(;W[go]C[Black can make alive on the corner or attack G5 by J6. It's hard to kill him.

:I guess this is the vital point for black....and I guess I could kill black :group with this move
:is this correct ?];B[bp]C[This move make black group almost impossible to kill]
;W[ao];B[in];W[mr]TR[gd]MA[ja][jb][ia][ib][hb][ha][ga][gb][gc]
[fb][fa][ea][eb]LB[ch:a][cg:b]C[G17 or g16 is bigger than this move. a and b are also big.

:so I decided to get some points and reducing black territory]

;B[pk];W[rk];B[rl];W[ql];B[rj];W[rm];B[sl];W[ri];B[sj];W[nk]
;B[oj];W[nj];B[ll];W[oi]C[Good job!

:at least I can get some prisoners and good territory];B[jm]
;W[kl]C[But still I'm trying to seperate black groups];B[fo]
;W[hp];B[jg]C[Maybe he made a fault.

Why didn't black answer my W72 ?];W[mi];B[ch]LB[cg:a]MA[ag]
[bg][bf][af]SQ[bh][ah][ai][bi]C[Black could increas about 4 points(cross) and reduced you 4 points (square)by C12. but you got only 1 or 2 stone with W74.

:Again, he didnt answer my W74 ? he make territory instead...]
;W[fg]C[well, then all I have to do is reduce black territory then]
;B[ci];W[bj];B[fd]TR[gd]C[G16 is better];W[hf];B[je];W[jf];B[di]
;W[dj];B[dl];W[cl];B[ej];W[ek];B[ik];W[hi]C[I'm connecting all of my group]
;B[mg];W[og];B[if];W[kf];B[ei];W[gk]C[This is a good move.

:is this move too defensive ? or not necessary ?];B[dk];W[ji]
;B[jj];W[ki];B[ii];W[ig];B[ie];W[kg];B[hl]C[I think it's not necessary.

:I should have played here, should I ?];W[hj];B[km];W[jk];B[ij]

:Why black play this ?
:he could kill my white group (marked with triangle) with F11 ?]
