C[Hello!

I think the game started out pretty even (although I usually have trouble in the beginning). I think my first major mistake occurs when I try to begin claiming territory in the middle.

EmTom: Hi I'll review this game for you. I hope my comments and variations will help you somehow :-) Enjoy the review. 

If you have any questions about this game (or some other maybe) ask me on KGS. My nick there is EmTom.]

(;B[lg]LB[kg:B][lg:A]C[A big mistake, I think. I wanted to start claiming territory in the middle, but I wasn't sure where to go.

EmTom: This is a good idea. If you  take the center you cant lose this game. Guess you started to worry too much here. Good advice to avoid that: count points. You were leading here by a safe margin but you played as if you were losing. :)]
