;B[pd]C[Hi!
Glad to see you!
I just play the game.I think it is special one for me.
Hope you can give me some comments.
thanks a lot

T: Hello, this is Tilo from Germany (1k on KGS). 
You played an impressive moyo strategy in this game. But when you do so, it is important to be consequent. Moves that enlargen the moyo have priority to most other moves. You made some questionable moves form this point of view but your opponent did not always take profit from it.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[Chinese style opening--
I almost use it];W[nc];B[kd]TR[qk]LB[pf:A]C[high pincer

T: As the marked stone is far away, you should rather try to stay connected by playing A. I did a database search which showed that A is almost the only move played by pros in this position.]

(;W[qf]C[T: See var.];B[oe];W[qc];B[qd]TR[qf]C[T: The marked stone has much breathing space so it is not that weak.]
;W[pc]TR[kd]C[T: Now it is important for B to ensure his connection with the marked stone (see var.).]

(;B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mb];B[ph]LB[md:B][pg:A]C[T: A bad move.
1. Locally, A is the right point.
2. I think it is more important now to connect your pincer stone at B.]
;W[pg]LB[me:A]C[T: Probably too early. B gets much strength by attacking the w group. Better wait a little or play A.]

C[sacrifice the two
stones and create moyo

T: A good idea.];B[qo]LB[fq:B][md:A]C[T: But this is inconsequent. It's not a moyo-creating move, it goes for territory. When you play a moyo strategy, you have to be consequent. A is better, B is a big point too.]
;W[me];B[jj]C[T: A good point.];W[mg];B[mi];W[ic];B[fp];W[er]
LB[dn:A]C[T: Doubtful. B has a good continuation (see var.). Better A.]

(;B[cf];W[ce]LB[ck:C][df:B][fd:A]C[T: This strengthens B unnessecarily. Better is A or B. The diagonal attachment is usually only played if there is a w stone around C that limits B's possibilities of expansion.]
;B[df];W[fd];B[ed]LB[cc:A]C[T: Aji keshi. Without this move, A is possible.]
;W[ec];B[ee];W[cc];B[kh];W[ie]LB[dk:A][hp:B]C[T: This is a move that induces B to do something he wants to do anyway, i.e. to save his stone on the upper side. So it is locally a bad exchange for W. 
Globally the most important thing is now B's moyo, not the upper side. It is absolutely necessary now to reduce it. But it's difficult for me to say where. Perhaps A or B?]
;B[lf]LB[do:A]C[T: Saving this stone is relatively small. Better enlargen the b moyo. A is an excellent point.]
;W[mf];B[lg];W[jf]C[T: Bad mistake.];B[le]LB[do:A]C[T: Still a move at A is bigger.]
;W[md];B[fe];W[gd];B[dn]C[T: Finally B comes to enlargen the moyo.]

(;W[cl];B[dj]
(;W[bj]TR[dn]LB[el:A]C[T: Too low. Don't seek only life on the side but jump to the center. This is especially important if the opponent has a moyo. A is the decisive point which also attacks the marked stone.]

;B[en];W[bo];B[el]C[T: A splendid result for B. W is very low, B has a magnificent moyo now.]
;W[dh]C[T: Good. This is B's weak point.];B[eh];W[ei];B[di]
