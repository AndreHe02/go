C[R5 better ?

No, B[Q9\] is the only correct move in response to W[R9\].

W[R9\] is in fact a bad move.];W[pl];B[qm];W[qg]C[Here, W is well settled, and that is the fault of B[R6\]]

;B[lq];W[ps];B[qr];W[no];B[mn];W[nn];B[mm]C[I wondered a lot here :

I wanted those 2 stones to get a grip on the centre.

Now, if I cut white, I may let white into the centre, and I was unsure this was okay.

White connected in gote, so I felt no really bad.
Also, I have still a couple of ways to attack this white formation later.

1) is the appreciation correct ?

2) what would you have played ?



First, the two moves you plaed are not bad , since you gain some
control of the center. However, at the same time you lost other options that might be more benifical. For example B[p8\] to cut the connection of white and attack the group might be more of fun.
The present way is like cashing your potential a bit too early.]

(;B[cl]MA[cf][dr]C[any better idea ?

This is good move, and probaby the best move in the current situation.]

TR[mm][mn]C[I  played this because the centre was not so vital because of th marked stones.

However, I did not realise this was gote.


B[C13\] seems better.];W[be]
(;B[dh]C[Maybe I should have given up the two stones in exchange for a play at F17 ?


Agree, but B[C12\] better];W[hc];B[jc];W[fd];B[ld];W[fr];B[ri]
TR[ld]C[I was happy here, because W gave me a good way to use M16

;B[li];W[kj];B[bm]MA[co]C[The idea was :
I could not see any advantages to continue attacking the right shape, so I turned to territorial points.

Any other important point on the board here ?

As a side question, I did not see a good sequence with C5.

Is it possible to play it ?



First all, B should have been more successful in attacking the white group. There were several questionable moves .

C5 is a good move, should play that first, when W[D5\], then B[B7\]]
;W[bn];B[dm];W[cn]C[This is a bad move, should reserve the right to play moves like B[B5\] and invade the corner. This move help w solidate his corner.]

Also, I was afraid of some cutting aji around H14.

Should I have started with N2 - or else ?

I think N2 is sento, W probably have to eat at L12, your worry is
not necessary];W[mr];B[lr]C[Now the yose has started.

I'm not sure I played it very well.

I count :
White
27 upper left
17 bottom left, plus 4 miai of F4/B8
4 centre
with komi : 57

Black :
22 left
5 bottom
28 upper righ
10 right

So I though this was winable if I don't blunder in the yose ...]

C[I wondered long with B8.
should I have played it earlier ?

It's reverse sente, but I'not sure I know how to appreciate the value.


It is obvious to me that B8 is bigger.];W[bl];B[bk];W[am];B[ep]

(238) W 68.5 B 72.0
(238) B+3.5

Overall, This game is close and very well played. White was behind at the begining, but managed to catch up finally. Black, on the other hand, probably should have gained more in attacking the white group.]
