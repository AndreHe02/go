C[white : reborn
black : Sunny
request by white.];B[pc];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qe];W[jd];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[dj]C[JH : The fuseki is quite good for both. This way of play for white seems good and high speed development.]
;B[cq]LB[pk:a]C[JH : possible but may be playing at "a" would be quicker]
;W[po]C[JH : Good];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[ql];B[lc]
;W[le];B[nc];W[kc];B[ld];W[ke]C[JH : till now both are playing well but White is more concerned by influence and black by territory. I think white is better.]
;B[ch]C[I don't know how to treat this move.
JH : this seems a good point but your answer is good];W[cf]
;B[eh];W[fj]LB[cj:a]C[This is the first strange move in my opinion. I think it is better at "a"]
;B[bj]C[JH : good as White stones look strange.];W[ed]LB[ec:a]
[ck:b]C[I am not sure about this move.
JH : the usual move for the corner is at "a" but you must not let Black get eye space so easily : white must play at "b"]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[dm]C[JH : this Black move is not good as White can cut]
;W[cm];B[dk];W[el];B[ck];W[en]LB[ek:a][em:b]C[JH : too timid. You must simply play at "a" or taking at "b" is better.]
;B[ek];W[fl]C[It is painfull not to be able to block];B[fk]
;W[iq]LB[qg:a]C[JH : Black is leading now. I would prefer to go first on the right side at "a" as the lower side is only a place where you put a stone which will be attacked.]
;B[kq];W[gp]C[JH : Looks good];B[fp];W[go];B[gq];W[ip]LB[io:a]
C[The shape is not good. Why not the 2 space jump at "a" ?]
;B[gl];W[gm];B[hm];W[gn];B[qj]LB[gk:a]C[JH : My feeling would be to connect my stones in the center at "a" in order to try an invasion in the top left.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qf];B[rf];W[rg];B[se];W[qi]LB[pi:a]C[JH : You must not try to stabilize by attaching but attack at "a"]
;B[pi]C[JH : Good];W[rj]C[JH : Do not try to connect if you can't]
;B[pj];W[ri];B[ph];W[qg];B[pm];W[qm];B[pl]C[JH : In this sequence, White is too low.]
;W[mq]LB[fg:a][ic:b]C[JH : I don't think this is the bigger place. I think White should try to protect is upper side with a move like "a". Black should try an invasion at "b" but hze must take sente for it.]
;B[mr];W[lq];B[lr];W[kp];B[jq];W[lo];B[nq]LB[ic:a]C[JH : this is too small. Time to go at "a" even if white is weak in the bottom after Black move.]
;W[kb]C[JH : Good];B[hl];W[na];B[ir];W[hr]LB[in:a]C[My mistake.
JH : Yes ; it seems as Black can cut. So you must simply play at "a"]
;B[hq];W[jr];B[kr];W[is];B[jp];W[jo]LB[io:a]C[What about playing at "a as connecting the five white stones is big.]
;B[io];W[in];B[ho];W[hp];B[hn];W[kn]LB[ki:a]C[White must play more lightly but it is difficult to find a good point. May be at "a"]
;B[lp]LB[kl:a]C[JH : This is too small. Black must attack on a large scale : "a" for example]
;W[nn];B[pn];W[qn];B[oo];W[jl];B[mo]LB[ij:a]C[JH : Black move are too cautious. White cannot save his 2 stones. Black can play at "a" to attack]
;W[jj]C[JH : White move is good. Now it is difficult to fight for Black]
;B[ik];W[jk]LB[lj:a]C[JH : better at "a"];B[ih];W[kh]C[JH : Good]
;B[kg]C[JH : Black is too weak to play like this.];W[lg];B[lh]
;W[ki];B[jg];W[mh]LB[hi:a]C[White could have test Black by playing "a"]
;B[lf];W[mg];B[mi];W[ni];B[mj];W[nj]C[JH : better to take simply]
;B[mk];W[nl]LB[li:a]C[JH : better to play at "a"];B[nk];W[ok]
;B[ol];W[li];B[nh];W[ng];B[oh];W[kf];B[pp];W[qo];B[ie];W[id]
;B[ge];W[gc];B[bf];W[be];B[bg];W[ce]LB[hi:a][pa:b]C[JH : Smaller than "a" or "b"]
;B[mb];W[ma];B[la];W[lb];B[oa];W[ka];B[nb];W[la];B[oc];W[qk]
LB[ml:a]C[JH : this move is bad as it was sente to play shibori at "a". One losing move.]
;B[pk];W[cp]LB[mn:a]C[JH : playing at "a" looks bigger];B[lm]
;W[km];B[ln];W[ko];B[bq];W[hj];B[ij];W[ii];B[hi];W[ji];B[hh]
LB[gi:a]C[JH a big mistake for black who should play at "a"]
;W[gk];B[ej];W[il];B[fi];W[gj];B[bp];W[bo];B[gr];W[ll];B[ml]
;W[lk]C[Black should had a move in the center];B[rq];W[rp]C[I think this is my big mistake.
JH :  This move is big too but taking the 2 stones in the center was bigger. In fact it is black you go wrong.]
;B[mm];W[rr];B[rs];W[sq]C[JH : small but white may loose half-point here. just descend.]
;B[me];W[mf]LB[ne:a]C[Better at "a"];B[ne];W[gi]LB[bl:a]C[JH : very small. "a" is bigger]
;B[gh];W[hk];B[ef];W[pe];B[pd];W[oe];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bd]
;B[fo];W[fn];B[eo];W[do];B[bm];W[cg];B[bh];W[fs]C[Jh : looks like a good tesuji.]
;B[er];W[gs];B[bn];W[an];B[bl];W[ap];B[aq];W[ao];B[hd];W[hc]
;B[fd];W[fc];B[gd];W[bs];B[cs]C[JH : Black strong reply.];W[br]
LB[es:a]C[JH : it doesn't work for white. So playing at "a" is better (at least 2 points)]
;B[es];W[cr];B[dq];W[ep];B[ar];W[ds];B[am];W[co];B[as];W[sg]
LB[dg:a]C[JH : playing at "a" is bigger. may be the losing move. I think "a" is five points in gote and white move is 1,5 points.]
;B[dg];W[jf];B[if];W[jh];B[ig];W[sf];B[re];W[od];B[nd];W[ee]
;B[fe];W[lj];B[of];W[pf];B[qh];W[rh];B[df];W[ks];B[ls];W[js]
;B[cs];W[ir];B[qs];W[sr];B[eq];W[dn];B[fr];W[hs]C[Without the komi of 5,5, White is losing by 1,5 points : too bad. he had a chance till the very last move.]
