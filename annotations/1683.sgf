C[Hallo!
This terrible game had me as white.
The game is short because, I think, I made each sort of positional misjudgement.
I'd like one review focused on the opening and the start of the middle game.
However each comment is welcome.
Thanks in advance,
Ronin.];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[qp]C[q: Is this a feasible starting scheme?

a: It is not unreasonable.  As white, I would wajnt to play Q3 instead of Q4.  The reason is the 3-4 points have a direction, and both of your 3-4 moves point towards the black stone on D4.  Maybe Q3 would give your opening some balance.]
;B[cf]
(;W[fd]C[q: Is this a good answer?

a: No complaints here.  C16 is another idea, to prevent black attaching in the corner, but in this game I think F16 is better.  G17 and G16 are also plausible, as is tenuki.]

C[I think those two stones can take care of themselves at this point.  Playing H16 now seems to only make black stronger on the top side.]

(;W[hd];B[id];W[he];B[gc];W[fc];B[ie];W[cd]C[q: I feel that this sequence left white unsatisfied. What could I have done?

a: Locally, the problem is the H15 attachment.  If you had this sequence (or a similar one) in mind, it might be better to just play C16 directly instead of messing with the attachments.  If you played C16 before the other moves, you would still be able to think about reducing black's top-side moyo with moves around J16.

Also, see the previous variation for what I think is the globally best move.]
;B[op];W[lp];B[qq]C[Here start the sequence that threw me into confusion.
I'm used to know that this black move is wrong, say, a bad move to punish.
I tryed to do that... but then things went mess..]

;W[rr];B[pm]C[Well, this seems to me a good result for white... but I didn't think this move was sente.
q: Should I have played around N3?

a: Yes, absolutely.  The aji of the N3 cut is just unbearable for white.]
;W[pf];B[mq]C[Ouch!

Yes :)];W[mp];B[mr];W[pr];B[kq]C[q: Well... what is white supposed to do now?
Try to save the two stones in the earth of black formation? How?
Or is better to tenuki and wait for a chance to put them in action? Where to play if tenuki?

a: O14 is a very big point right now, threatening to ruin black's top side and also giving the M4 group some hope of escape.  But even if the two stones escape, black will make big territory in the lower left.

One plan could be to split the left side up and try to gain power by attacking the D11 group.]

(;W[kp]C[Pushing like this will doom white, though.  Black just gets stronger and his moyo becomes harder to invade later on.  Even if these stones live, white is behind on territory, so you need to find a strategy which gives you points *and* helps these stones.]

;B[gm];W[in]C[I feel white getting deeper and deeper into  the grave...

G7 maybe is black coming to measure white's coffin.  At this point, black has occupied all the critical areas shown in the previous variation, so white is doomed.]

I thank you for reviewing this mess.
See you,
Ronin.

mattn: I hope my comments helped you somewhat.  You might want to read a book called "The Direction of Play" (or re-read it!).  It helps give a conceptual framework for fuseki and early mid-game in terms of the natural motion of stones.  The main problem was you did not move to build structure between your stones on different parts of the board.  Because of this, the game was split into several local battles which each were to black's advantage.  Understanding the direction in which stones try to "move" is the key to whole-board thinking to prevent games like this.  Good luck!]

(;W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[pn];W[qm]C[This is all I can think of.. black still needs eyes, so white will get powerful on the bottom side and make territory on the right side.  Locally your variation from the game seems better, but this one takes the R14 stone into account.  You want to make all your stones happy if you can.]

(;W[ne];B[pf];W[ng];B[ph];W[jc]C[You could take some control over the opening by setting up a counter-pincer like this.  It works well with F16 and black can't make so much side territory because of your low R4 stone.]

(;W[fq]C[Tenuki is often an option in fuseki.  It is especially useful for white as a way of taking control.]
