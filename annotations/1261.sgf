C[In this game I played white and my opponent was black. I thought that my opening went fairly well, but then black leapt into the middle and I felt that the game seemed a bit out of control.

I think that there are 2 things that lead to my loss: (1) several groups on the left were cut off without any chance of creating eyes. This left a large space for black. (2) The bottom right corner was inadequately defended, leading to another loss.]
;B[cp]C[Hi, I'm Darrell.

Interesting game.  You played many good moves.

FYI, I turn move numbers on so that I can refer to stones by their move number in places.]

[lb:b]C[I would have moved at 'a' as it puts considerably more pressure on 9.  You will then be attacking 9 and taking considerable profit along the top.  When placed at 10, you leave the door open to a black extension to 'b' which will help him settle his stone and destroy your potential territory at the same time.]
;B[gc];W[fc];B[gd];W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[qj]LB[qk:a]C['a' is more usual, but it's not necessarily a bad move.  It just leaves a weakness to worry about later.    As a general comment (having looked at the whole game quickly), you tended to underestimate the importance of keeping your groups strong.]
;B[eq];W[do]LB[kc:a][lq:b][kq:c]C[This move was meant to be a part of a reduction of blacks influence and also to lend support to development into the bottom side.

D:  I understand.  At times, a reducing move like this is correct.  However, at this point I think it's too soon.  You could pressure black at 'a' or make a move around 'b' and hurt black's lower right.  Both of these black groups are rather unsettled and you can profit from pressuring them.

To complete black's bottom right corner, he would like to get a move at 'c' or 'b', so if you go there, you hurt his corner quite a bit.]
;B[dp];W[fp];B[eo];W[fq];B[en];W[jp]LB[jq:a]C[Again, I would have put this on the third line, at 'a'.

Your shape is good, and the extension is the right distance.  But now black gets to complete his bottom right corner and, at the same time, put great pressure on 22,24,26.]
;B[lq]C[Although I managed to get into the bottom side, the first stone has been cut and black has a large space behind it. I think this was the beginning of some problems for me.

D:  yes.  You have settled both of blacks lower corners and threatened none of black's groups.    Rather than looking at empty spaces on the board, spend a bit more time looking at the strengths and weaknesses of the groups.]
;W[lo]LB[on:a]C[Reducing black and preparing to advance into the centre from the middle-right.

D:  28 doesn't seem to do anything.  Similar idea would be 'a', but this would do quite a bit on the right side of the board, creating an impressive moyo.]
;B[ef];W[dl]LB[dj:A]TR[do]CR[em][el][ek][ej][ei][eh][eg]C[Became a little concerned about black influence on the left. This stone was meanted to threaten connection with the markedstone and an extension to A.

D:  Well, it's an invasion and will lead to a fight, but that's ok.  Notice you are behind enemy lines.  Means a hard fight.  I tend to avoid this unless I am behind in a game.]
;B[el];W[dk];B[ek];W[kq]C[Wanted to reinforce my base, but now I think this
was too small.

D:  Ouch.  You've started something on the left.  You sacrifice the left side of the board.   This was probably really the turning point in the game.]
;B[bd]C[Black fixes his weak group by attacking your weak group.  Very impressive.]
;W[cc];B[fe];W[ee]LB[ge:a]C[Here instead would have been more interesting I think.  Cut off 9,11,13.]

;B[jj]CR[le][mh][lf][lg][mi][mj][nl][nk]C[This is the move that confused me - it seemed so wild and desperate. However, It does have a great deal of support from the black wall on the top-left and the wall on the bottom left.

D:  This is a very good move for black.  You have played many moves aimed at the center rather than the edges (most notably 10,26,28,54).  Black has built walls as you point out and can very easily support a move to here.  Furthermore, his choice of locations is quite conservative.  It is simply reducing your potential territory.  If he had moved on the right side of the red dots, it would have been an invasion and a fight.  Here, however, it is a reduction as there's no good way for you to attack it, but must just try to limit it's incursion.]
;W[mp]C[Small, silly move.];B[mq];W[lj]C[Decided that I had to be in the centre if black was there, otherwise I could be completely shut down. However, I am unsure if this was the best place...

D:  Looks exactly right to me.];B[ph]C[Now this is an invasion.]

(;W[qh]LB[qg:a]C['a' would probably be a better attack.  When you make direct contact with a stone like this, you often help settle it.  Whereas, if you just take away it's ability to make a base while keeping your stones strong, it is harder to live.

C[A two space jump from a two stone wall usually works, but in this case, black 9 is only one space away and the jump will probably not stay connected.

But more important -- black has a very weak group you should be attacking.   How about a move at 'a'?  If this black group dies, it's huge.]
;B[ie]C[The jump to h15 was too big, perhaps j15 or j14 would have been better]
;W[ge];B[id];W[hg];B[hf];W[gf];B[if];W[gh];B[gj];W[ei]LB[kf:a]
C[Where are you going?  You are making a huge dead group and at the same time letting black's weak group walk away with a move at 'a']

;B[hm];W[jn]C[This long fight enabled me to save that central group, but has also strengthened the black group that cuts off my two groups on the left. I think they are certainly dead now. However, I have managed to isolate the black groups near o12.]

Those are dead.  Keep your stones alive with 'a'  See variation 2 for example]
;B[ng];W[of];B[rl]C[14,16 and 156 die.  This is worth about 40 points.]
;W[pi];B[mo];W[mn];B[lp];W[kp];B[pk];W[oi]C[If black had connected that group I would have gained nothing from the earlier fight, I needed to remove its potential to connect.

D:  Agreed.  Good move.  You did need to capture at that point.]

;B[ln];W[mm];B[ko]C[Interesting.  It looks like you can probably live or kill black's group before he kills yours.  See variation 2.]
