C[P: Hi, my name is Peter. I play as InExtremis on KGS (though I haven't had much time to play online in the last few months), and I am about AGA 1d. My comments begin with "P:"]
;B[pd]C[Brock2574 [13k\]: yo
iinaya [13k\]: hi];W[dp];B[cd];W[qq];B[id];W[cj]C[P: Usually this is at D10, though there are a few examples of professionals playing this move.]
;B[pp]
(;W[qp]LB[qp:A][pq:B]C[P:  Check out Kitani Toshimi vs. Matsumoto Nayoko on www.gobase.org for this.

In that game, white played q3 instead of r4, and a different joseki resulted where the white stones looked underneath both sides of the black thickness. (note: in that game, c10 was at d10). Afterwards, white approached q16 from o17.]
;B[po];W[or];B[qo];W[np];B[nn]TR[pj][pk][qk][no]C[P: With a black stone at q16, professionals have not played this move. Usual moves are marked. Why not o6? Black should either play an extension or expect an invasion. In the pro game where B played o5 white soon invaded at r11. Note: In the pro game where B played o5, there was a black stone at d4, which changes things somewhat. (Liu Xiaoguang vs. Wang Yuan).]
;W[jp]C[P: I would probably invade to prevent a huge black framework from developing. In a "battle of the moyos" black would win simply by surrounding more space.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[cm]C[P: In my opinion, D6 would be better.
1) Threaten to surround more space
2) Greater connection between d4-d6 than d4-c7 gives B less aji to play with
3) White gets a stronger attack on the black stones.

Your goal should be to stay on the attack. Locally there are four white stones and two black stones. White should be in control.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[br];B[fm];W[eq]C[P: This exchange hurts you... watch how weak h3 becomes.]
;B[er];W[fp];B[gp];W[ep];B[gq]C[P: Black still has eye potential on the edge, white gets nothing. Also h3 is now attached to some strong black stones. Black can now consider a deeper invasion/reduction of the j3-n3 area.

Avoid exchanges like this! Make sure you get something valuable when you strengthen your opponent, and consider the stones on the board when you make these exchanges.]
;W[go]
(;B[ho]LB[ho:A][hp:B];W[gn]
(;B[fn]LB[fn:A][hp:B];W[gm];B[fl];W[hp]C[P: Good. Very important point.]

(;B[in]LB[in:A][hr:B]C[P: This should be h2 to live.]
(;W[gr]LB[gr:A][hr:B]C[P: Your instinct to kill was right, but you have to be careful in how you do it. This ends in gote, whereas h2 ends in sente and an extremely good result.]
;B[fr];W[hr]C[P: Gah, gote! :(];B[hl]C[P: Now black gets your stone, rescues his group, and takes a substantial lead in the game.]
;W[gl];B[gk];W[io];B[hm]C[I thought this invasion was too soon at first, yet somehow he managed to pull it off and i don't know how

P: It was probably a little early (he should just keep building the moyo!). If your stones were still intact you would have reduced his potential to make a center moyo. The strength of the black stones dominates the entire board and affects the rest of the game. The game is already very difficult for white.]
;W[jn];B[jm];W[ed];B[cg]C[P: Black thinks he's ahead (and he's right) so he plays conservatively...]
;W[cc];B[dd];W[dc]C[P: Odd... I don't think this is joseki. c13 feels misplaced.]
;B[ee];W[ec]C[P: It's tough to make territory around here without giving him too much thickness.]
;B[fe];W[ic]C[P: If you want this stone to be connected play h17. That would make j17 a great move for black, though.]
;B[hc];W[jc];B[hb]C[my stones always seem to get seperated too easily, but i don't know how

P: Play a little tighter if you don't want to be separated, especially around your opponent's strength (though in certain cases, being separated is perfectly fine). Black seems to be trying too hard here... h16 would probably be better.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[fb];W[eb]C[P: Good, you are alive in the corner now.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[ge];B[he]C[P: The following sequence seems natural, but it is not a good exhcange for white. White gets two weak stones and hurts his j17-k17 stones (because of h15) and black strengthens both of his groups.]
;W[gf]C[P: I'm not sure where these stones are going... :)]
;B[df];W[nc]C[P: Play n17 if you do not want to be cut. j17-k17 are attached to a strong black group, so you have to be careful if you want them to live.

On the other hand, playing as you did gives you alternatives: if black invades at m17 you get the corner. If black defends the corner, you get an extra-wide extnsion. I think o17 is okay, under the circumstances.]

(;B[lc]LB[lc:A][ne:B];W[qf]C[P: Great! When you are behind it is good to complicate thing, and it seems like you must get something good out of this fight. Now black is still winning, but it becomes more difficult to find the right moves.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[mc];W[od];B[ne];W[pc];B[oe];W[oc];B[pe];W[qd]
;B[qe];W[rd];B[re];W[se];B[sf];W[sd];B[rf];W[qj]C[P:  This is your best shot, but if there is any justice in the world, this should die. :)]

(;B[qg]C[P: This move is terrible. If black had lost, this would have been the losing move. Black may as well have passed. Black has stones with no real weaknesses, and he defends them against a dead stone? Black MUST attack the white stone vigorously, beginning with r8. The white stones here cannot live. If black really wants to concede the right side to white, at least make the r17 cut.]
;W[qm]C[i get stuck inbetween two wall like this all the time.  I feel like i have to make some kind of invasion to prevent a huge center territory which has already been built up

P: Part of the problem is the death of your g5 group. After that you had to make several frantic invasions. The result of those invasions was black thickness EVERYWHERE. Fortunately for you, black played r13, which accomplished nothing. r7 is a nice point for you, actually. This puts a little pressure on the only weakish black group, and it doesn't hurt your corner at all.]
;B[rn];W[rm];B[sm]C[P: ??? This move practically forces white to make two eyes.]
;W[sl];B[sn];W[rk]C[P: White is pretty much alive.];B[rp];W[rq]
;B[sq];W[pq]
(;B[qn];W[om];B[on];W[rh]C[P: Oops. This move really takes the wind out of your sails. Your invasion was a glorious success, but this move is gote and small. All the groups are fairly settled, so this is the endgame. The last weak group seems to be black's p6 group, so you could try L6, n5, etc. Also, you want to protect the r17 cut. You need to push into that great black expanse in the center--black's only significant source of points. Don't worry too much about eyes; s8 and t9 are about 99% eyes already, and you could also make them as you run into the center. Focus on where you can do the most damage.

You asked why your oppoents get such big center territories--this is an example of a move that leads to such results.]
;B[kn];W[jo];B[nm]C[P: Black takes care of his last weakness; now the endgame is really here.]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[oj];B[qh]TR[ni][di][qc]C[P: Small potatos. Black is quite strong, white is pretty much alive...]
;W[qi]C[P: Argh. You don't need four eyes! Reduce the center!]
;B[nh];W[bh]C[P: There are about ten points at stake here. There are over fifty points at stake in the center. Perhaps threaten to rescue the g14 stones. Also, does black have to respond here? What woud such a response get black? Two points? Black should ignore your move and find the real points.]
;B[ch];W[ci];B[di];W[dj];B[ei];W[ej];B[fj];W[mj]C[P: Yes! Good work ending in sente on the left side. Too bad black already has o12 in place.]
;B[li];W[lj];B[ki];W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[jb];W[mb]C[P: Good, this covers the r17 cut.]
;B[kb];W[ph]
(;B[pg];W[oh];B[og];W[ni];B[mi];W[kj];B[jj];W[ko]C[P: Good, this is big.]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[mn];W[bg];B[bf]C[P: Odd gote.]
(;W[ba]C[P: Not needed unless black has f19 or a15. Consider the "Long L + 1" alive. If you want to play around here, do the two point gote move at f19.

You lose by only a couple points... playing a different move here might make a difference.]

iinaya [13k\]: thx
i've been told that the endgame is often my biggest problem, but I dont' know for sure.  If in this game you see a particular aspect of the game that is holding me down let me know so I can read more up on the subject in general.  I've read some books on go already, but only books on the opening and joeseki.  Thank you for helping.

P: Getting to 1d, the most important things are life & death and tesuji. I am a huge fan of the Elementary Go Series books: Attack & Defense, Life & Death, Tesuji, and Endgame are the best (skip 38 Basic Tesuji). I strongly recommend finding those books--I remember going from 15k to 11k just by reading Tesuji twice on a car trip.

In this game, tesuji and life & death were an issue. Finding the moves to save your g5 stones was critical. The game was almost resignable after that local loss. Also, did you need to play b19? You played safety moves on the right side even after your group was safe. Finally, black had opportunities in the upper right corner. 

You lost points in the early endgame by focusing too much on the side. When you are deciding which endgame point to play determine how many points are at stake in that area. Remember: in the endgame destroying the other guy's points is just as valuable as building your own points. You did better than your opponent at keeping sente, but always consider the whole board during an endgame sequence--sometimes you have a move that is stronger sente than what your opponent threatens.

In general, though, good work climbing from that early setback to a mere 1.5 point loss. In the middlegame you outplayed your opponent in almost every battle and made it a very close game.

I hope the review helps!])
