I am Guy, I play white againt a 6k Kgs];B[pd]C[gengis [5k\]: have a nice game]

Right?

It is urgent that you establish a base.]
(;W[nc];B[ec]
(;W[cb]TR[fc]C[right answer?
was afraid of black c18...

Bad.  When you play F16, you shouldn't be concerned about making territory, but rather development.  If you were worried about moves like E17, you should have just played at F17 instead of F16.]

my kakari is poorly exploited now
no territory

gengis [5k\]: nice game

The biggest thing you should be concerned about is finding vital and urgent moves, and prioritizing it before big moves.  It seems there were many life-and-death situations in this game, so I advise tsumego and brush up on tesujis and L&D.
