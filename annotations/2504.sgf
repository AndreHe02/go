C[Hi,
On this game, i was playing as black (my nick on KGS is carioca). My rank on KGS at this moment was 13k and my opponent had a 12k.
The game was close, B getting a huge territory in the center and W getting points on the sides. It seems that B could have done much better getting some points on the sides too. Some possibilities that came to my mind after some analysis are indicated.
Biggest mistakes from B seems to be at moves: 53, 63, 79 and 87. B seems to have won the game on the yose
Thanks for your help.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[ed];B[dp];W[cc]
(;B[df]C[have seen in GoGoD the possibilities indicated here. D14 doesnÂ´t appear on this database.]
;W[dd];B[ce];W[id]LB[bc:1][pj:B][jp:A]C[I wouldn't  leave the corner quite yet, and I think I would continue on the same side, leaving A and B as miai]

(;B[dl]LB[cl:A][cp:B]C[Wrong place I think.  Either play low A, or B from the other side.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dr]C[This is not joseki, but it doesn´t seem that my answer was good enough.
Don´t know if any of the moves here indicated would be better.]

(;B[eh]C[seems bad. alternatives seem much better.
I agree.  Separating the white stone from it's support is a freebie.]

(;B[gd]LB[bc:A][kc:B]C[This doesn't seem like the  best move to me.  I would think about A followed by B, forcing white into a compact shape.]

(;W[pf]LB[ne:A]C[White is leaving too many  weak groups.  GIven the danger of a big center, I would just run out. at A, there's plenty of space to make a live group.]

(;W[ne]C[this cut is not well advised, as you're not going to break into the center with it.
I would look to the bottom. See variation];B[md];W[pc];B[nf]

(;B[kc]C[this was, i guess, very bad. the alternative indicated seems much better.]

(;B[me]C[not sure about this either.];W[qf];B[qd];W[qi];B[oh]
C[now, it seems that B may get lots of points in the center, but this seems risky to me, so, i decided to get also some points on the sides. this leads to some indecision and to lose some good moves.]

B: 89,0   W: 76,5
Huge center is deluding ... Besides some tactical mistakes, B should have tried to get more points on the sides.
I found this game hard to review because I found little to complain about in your moves.  I think you are both substantially under rated at 12-13 K.  More like 6-7K in my opinion.]
