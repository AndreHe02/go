black is introducing an interesting opening];W[pd]C[yao kai----

D4 is an alternative];B[nc];W[oe];B[qc];W[dp];B[pc]LB[qd:a]
C[Maybe this move can be critisised, but i  want to defend it saying that now black  threatens "a" after which the two marked  white stones become almost useless.

yao kai----

i think that in the very beginning, "a" is slow and should be conducted at a later time; but if you do want to play there, i recommend s15.]
;W[qp];B[qq]C[yao kai----

i prefer R6, for black's 1 and 3 intended to a fighting mode and the moves in the upper-right coner put more emphasis on the right side than the bottom.]

(;B[rr]LB[lq:a]C[In this joseki there is usually a stone  at "a". It's absense makes me think that  the result cannot be bad for black. (DR)

yao kai----

there is another joseki when white has no stone at "a". after black's 19, white O4, black Q7, white L4.

and white has choice after black's 11. see variation please.]

(;W[oo]C[yao kai----

bad move. it is a kind of aji keshi, damaging the potential. i would like to recommend two alternatives, if better solutions can not come up.

see variation please.]
;B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[nl]LB[pk:a][ok:b][jp:c]C[at this point my thoughts where about the  following: I considered white's last 3  moves as bad because he is pushing black  along the 4th line (the line of victory, as we  know). Thereford i answered his moves  gladly considering that he is giving me  advantage. My fist thought was to answer  this move at "a" or "b", but i looked at the  white wall that is being built and felt  uneasy about it. In fact i asked myself  "what did i do wrong?".
Now after the game i think that the wall  would be most effective if there was white  stone at around "c". Of course there is the  other white stone at the star point but  maybe it is too far. My questions are:  1."should i worry about the white wall and  do something about it or should i play at  "b" and stop worrying about it?"
2. "is there a way to reduse the  effectivness of the white wall?"
3. "where should i play now?"(DR)

yaokai----

my point of view regarding your questions follows:

1. i agree with you when you say "the white wall  would be most effective if there was white  stone at around 'c' ", therefore it has not to be worried about. only one move at j3 or j4 will surely make the white wall unproductive. but i think it is not the proper way now to play at "b" to continue enclosing the right side, otherwise white would make its moyo successfully at j4.

2. j3 or j4(i prefer the latter) is good enough to reduce the white's thickness.

3. j3 or j4(preferred)];B[qd]C[This move looks funny after the thought i  just did, but this is what happens with me  when i start worrying too much! (DR)

yaokai----

you bestow white the gold opportunity.

and s15 is the better shape than 25.];W[jp]C[Now white got the chance to make use of  his wall! (DR)

yaokai----

white's inclination of 20, 22 and 24 was not effective, but you missed it.]
;B[fc]C[yaokai----

i think c6 is the largest move now.];W[fe];B[cf];W[ci];B[eg]
;W[he];B[db];W[cc];B[hc];W[ei];B[gg];W[ff]C[Tell me please: is this move good? It  strengthes white i agree but it strengthens  black too! (DR)

yaokai----

i will never play like that unless it must. you know, peep from the inside is always give your rival more benefit.]
;B[fg];W[gi];B[ig];W[je];B[jc];W[le];B[ii];W[dm];B[cq];W[cp]
C[I am sure this is the wrong direction. I was  almost happy to see it. (DR)

yes];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]

;B[jl];W[in];B[hk];W[gk];B[hi];W[gj];B[og];W[mg];B[oj]C[yaokai----

i am glad to see black's 71 and 73. after that black would lose only if its big group in the center died.

but it would be better if the 73 stone were at q10, which was safer. now white has the choice of q8.]

;W[lb]
(;B[kd]C[this has to be wrong. maybe the  variation was better? (DR)

yaokai----

yes, what black should do now is to make sure that each group is alive, and then win the game. too much territory is not welcomed, for it will bring risk at the same time.

you know,there is no difference between winning by 0.5 point and by 100 points.]
;W[lc];B[ld];W[jd];B[md];W[ic];B[cb]C[yaokai----   black's upper group is in danger, and the cutting stones of 43 and 83 are captured, which makes the stones of 85, 87 and 89 meaningless.

black suffered a loss.];W[bb];B[dc];W[cd];B[ed];W[df];B[dg]
;W[de];B[ba];W[hb]C[yaokai----

no, a18 is big in this situation, because the corner is the base for both black and white to make alive.]
;B[bc];W[ab];B[ac];W[gb];B[fb];W[pl]C[yaokai----

because the big white group in the upper side has captured several black stones, making itself alive and strong, white has its courge to invade into black's territory at the expense of black's flying out of white's enclosure at p7.]

(;B[ql]C[yaokai----

bad, white's q9 will make black's shape collapsed.   since black's 73 has given white the possibility of 106, black must have prepared for the exchange of white's 106 and black's p7.

r10 sente, and then g2.];B[qi]C[yaokai----

black can not connect from the right side. for 123, white has r10.

g2 is big.];W[nf]C[yaokai----

small, shoud r10 (not mentioned hereafter).];B[gr];W[hq];B[hr]
