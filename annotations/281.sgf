C[First off, thanks for reviewing the  game. As you already know, it's a  great help.   Since both Black and White have never  been members of a go club or played  online, it's difficult to know our rank but  we've been told it's around 15k. Black had  only 2 questions at 86 and 90. White's 4  are scattered about. Any general  comments would be helpful, too.]

;B[qj];W[gq]LB[fq:a]C[mattn: The opening is pretty good so far, but white G3 at (a) is a thought, since it has a similar purpose but also is a real approach on the corner.]
;B[eq];W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[dg]
(;B[cj]C[I have been familiarizing myself with basic  joseki. Though it's not difficult to memorize  joseki, I have no idea what to do when  Black deviates from it as in this case here.  What should I have done?

mattn: You shouldn't think of joseki in terms of punishing deviations, most of the time.  In this case, black's move is pretty good, and makes more sense in the whole-board situation.  See the variation for some reasoning..

Actually, memorizing joseki can be bad for your game.  Many people get stuck in them and are hard-pressed to find unique moves for the situation at hand.  Don't let this happen!]
;W[dj]C[mattn: Not really the right idea here.  Getting into a fight like this will let black throw away a stone or two in exchange for influence facing the corner, which is worth quite a few points in this position.]

;B[fc]C[mattn: Sure enough.  Not only that, but black even got to finish his joseki move.. :)]
;W[mc];B[jc];W[pm]C[mattn: The timing on this move feels strange, but it's probably playable.  The upper-right of the board seems bigger, though.]
;B[om];W[pk];B[ql];W[qn];B[pl];W[ol];B[qm];W[on];B[pn];W[oo]
;B[pp]LB[nm:a]C[mattn: Black should play at (a) instead of Q4.  White has walls forming on the bottom side, the beginning of walls on the right along P, and a high group on the left, so there is real potential for a moyo (territorial framework) to develop in the low-center.  (a) will make this much harder for white, because black will be able to fearlessly run in.]
;W[op]
(;B[qe]LB[qc:a][qf:b]C[mattn: I like (a) or (b) better here.  (b) is typical, and a likely situation is in variation 2.  (a) might also be playable, if you have a plan to deal with white's influence.]
;W[qd];B[qg]TR[qd][pd]C[mattn: Now black has a weak stone pressed against white's strong marked wall.  In effect, black's R15 play only served to make white strong in the corner.]
;W[nm]LB[fl:a][go:b]C[mattn: White is building a pretty big moyo along the bottom now, so a black reducing play around (a) or (b) is in order.]
;B[ok];W[nl];B[pj]C[mattn: These moves only help white again.  Black gains about 3 points along the side for capture and territory, white white completes a very strong wall, worth at least 10 or 15 points (and probably more).]
;W[fo]C[mattn: Black should be feeling very nervous about the situation along the bottom and in the center by now.]
;B[dn];W[em];B[dm];W[ek];B[fe]LB[ji:a][jk:b]C[mattn: Now that white has built a very large framework around the bottom, a deep and scary invasion is required by black.  F15 doesn't help black a lot (consider if white were to play in the same general area -- not a big difference in score either way).    (a) is a pretty exciting move, but even so, white will make a lot of territory now.

(b) even appears playable, if you have nerves of steel and want to hone your fighting skills.. ;)]

(;W[en]C[I played here believing that Black could  easily reduce my moyo, and I needed it or  else I would loose. Is this correct?

mattn: White's moyo is in wonderful shape at this point, and this move can be omitted.  See variation.]

[cr][cs][br][bs][as][ar]C[Black would like to know what he should  generally do now.

mattn: When in doubt, try estimating the score and see if that helps.

White (dots): ~115 points (120 with komi)
Black (squares): ~95 points

So black needs roughly 25 points to have a chance at the game.  White's big center moyo is solid, so the only possibility is to capture the upper-right, but this is also quite solid.  Black could make about 5-10 points by playing the endgame more skillfully than white, so this position should be a win for white by 15-20 points.  Black's fate was sealed with the big moyo.]
;B[oe];W[od];B[pe];W[md]C[After 90, how is it best for Black to invade  White's center-bottom territory?

mattn: Too late, unfortunately.  White should be able to kill any invasion black makes.  Of course, after estimating the score, black is desperate for points and should probably try an invasion anyhow.]
;B[ir];W[gr];B[gp];W[fp];B[rd];W[qc];B[rc];W[rb];B[nf];W[ds]

;W[fs];B[ip];W[iq];B[go];W[gn];B[me];W[cq]LB[oh:a][cr:b][sd:c]
C[mattn: Good play for white.  Black gained about 15 points in the area around (a), lost about 10 around (b), and gained a few around (c), so now the score difference should be between 15 and 20.]
;B[cr];W[dr];B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[kb]C[mattn: An important area.]
;B[pb]LB[jb:a][ha:b]C[mattn: White is alive here, so black should just play the expected response at (a) (before white gets to monkey-jump to (b)!)]

;W[ah];B[aj];W[rq];B[io];W[hn];B[fl];W[el];B[fi];W[eh];B[kq]
;W[jp]C[mattn: Black is scrounging, but it's just too late.  T3 would be a good sente play for black, followed by A3 and K19 and then perhaps B15 or some other large gote move.]
;B[jr];W[lr];B[kp];W[kr];B[hq]C[I, White, didn't see this ladder coming. Am  I correct that Black gained 14 points with  the ladder up to 158?

mattn: Yeah.. not sure exactly, but it's more than ten and somewhere around 15.  But black has also thrown some stones into your moyo that you did not respond to (or responded without filling your own territory), so the net gain for all these inside plays is something more like 10 points for black.  Running score estimate: white up by 10.

Also see the variation for a stubborn way to respond.]

;W[sr];B[sp];W[rr];B[be]C[mattn: Good!  Black got almost all of the important sente plays.. should have snuck A3 in before B15, though.

A3/A4 area is worth the same as the T3/T2 area, so if white gets this then there is no gain for these areas, and black gets one point for the K19 play and we already counted the B16 area, so black is still down by roughly 10..]
;W[sc];B[se];W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[bo];W[dl];B[cl]C[mattn: White gets a few sente plays, maybe +12 now.]

;B[hs];W[gs];B[ae];W[ka];B[ia];W[sb];B[sd];W[nd]C[Is it correct the W+17.5?

Once again thank you for reviewing the  game.

mattn: Wow, our running estimate was really close, especially considering the last time we actually tried rough counting was over 125 moves ago!  My SGF editor counts W+19.5 as the final score, so you may want to double check that.

Counting areas of the board is a very useful habit to get into.  You don't need actual numbers.. during a game, I usually think along the lines of "This area is about equal to that, these captures about fill that area" and so on, and only count if things are really close.  If black had been estimating areas earlier in the game, he may have realized the importance of poking into white's developing moyo in time.

Quite an interesting game!  I wish you both luck in the future.

Anyhow, hope you enjoyed the review, and let me know if you have any more questions or comments!

(;W[ho];B[jo];W[jq]C[mattn: If white really wants the kill, this sequence might work.  It will still be hard for black to get a second eye, but if white misreads or misplays, that's the end of the line..

But heart-pounding moments like these make go so *fun*.. :)]

))
(;B[en]C[mattn: (hopefully the sgf looks ok, if not, there should be a black stone on E6)]
;W[fm]C[mattn: White's moyo is quite secure without the extra move (E6 defense).]
))
(;B[qf];W[qe];B[pf];W[gn];B[dn];W[nm]TR[pf][qf]C[mattn: White builds a moyo and black takes the sides.  This is a pretty good exchange..
(black poking through at O7 instead of D6 is good, too)

Notice how the two marked black stones are strong, then compare with the main sequence of play again.

Still, black getting through at O7 is better.]))
(;B[fc]C[mattn: I'm assuming you were expecting a sequence something like this..]
;W[ck];B[qf];W[nc];B[rd];W[qc];B[cn];W[kc];B[nn]C[mattn: This seems like a calm and fairly equal sequence from there.  But notice that white easily settled along the side, and black was essentially forced to let white take the top in order to get the necessary C6 move in.  This will lead to a slow and balanced game.    On the other hand, black's original move at C10 squeezed white's group and worked to protect his bottom corner at the same time -- an excellent move for the situation.]
