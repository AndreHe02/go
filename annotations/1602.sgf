C[Note from the reviewer:
As usual, I have tried to make my best during this review. Hope it will be useful for the players and may be to some other readers.

However, please don't take my comment for the only truth as it should be full of mistakes for the truth of a dan player, and worst for the truth of a pro player.

As asked by the requestor (Black), the review is more focused on the fuseki.

Denis, 5k];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[de];B[qf];W[nd];B[rd];W[qc];B[pj]
;W[og];B[ph]C[Denis: this sequence seems OK for me.  I think it's even good for black.]
;W[jq];B[lq]C[Denis: OK];W[gq];B[eq]LB[dq:A]C[Denis: If you want to keep white from making a base, A is better, because it secures a little bit more the corner.]
;W[qq]C[Denis: too early in the game. It's a big point but there are big point elsewhere. It's better not to settle the position in this corner (and make black stronger) at this moment.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[nr]
;B[mr]C[Denis:See what I mean? White has the corner but Black influence on the outside is VERY good. This exchange is clearly not good for white.]
;W[cn];B[co]C[Denis: I don't like this shape. Moreover, playing contact will make white stronger.]
;W[dn];B[ck]LB[dj:A][dc:B]C[Denis: good idea. But what about A? After a second thought, I think black can play directly in the upper corner at B, before white become too strong.]
;W[ch];B[ek];W[fn];B[fp]C[Denis: not bad. (if the idea is to split white).]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[gn];B[go];W[ho];B[hn];W[io];B[hm]LB[dc:A]C[Denis: good. White is split. Black has to take care about his group now. Black should still consider a move on the upper corner at A.]
;W[bo];B[bp];W[do];B[cp];W[dl];B[dk];W[fl];B[em]LB[eh:A][gj:B]
[hk:C]C[Denis: ? White has still space to run into the center and you'll have your 2 groups to care about. It's better to play from the outside, making a pressure on white and making your black stones stronger.
What about A, B or C?];W[gl];B[en];W[el];B[dm];W[cl];B[cm];W[bm]
;B[bn];W[an];B[eo]MA[ck][dk][ek][hn][hm]C[Denis: Bad sequence for black. You gain nothing (3 points?), white is stronger and thus your 2 marked groups are weaker.]
;W[il];B[bk];W[bl];B[eh];W[ff]C[Denis: ?];B[ic]LB[dc:A]C[Denis: Yes, it's important to play on the upper side. But I think that the corner is wide open. So A is more appropriate.]
;W[kc];B[fc];W[dc]C[Denis: Good for white. He extends his moyo and black has one more weak group to care about.]
;B[ed];W[dd]C[Denis: Too good for white.];B[ee];W[ef];B[dg]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[cg];B[df];W[cf];B[ie];W[ei];B[fh];W[fi];B[fk]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[dh];B[fj];W[ij];B[gi];W[ci];B[hh];W[gg];B[gh]
;W[eg];B[hf];W[ge];B[gd];W[ol];B[pl];W[pm];B[ok]LB[ql:A]C[Denis: Bad. "A" is better.]
;W[ql];B[pk];W[om];B[qm];W[ko];B[mo]MA[hm][hn]LB[mk:A][hg:C]
[jm:B]C[Denis: Not very effective. It think the extension at A is better. I have checked the move at B to "use" the 2 marked stones.

It's also important to connect at C (connect the 2 groups and remove a big cutting point).

Black is behind by about 10 points so he must fight hard if he wants to get back in the game.]
;W[lm];B[ln];W[km];B[mm];W[ml];B[kn];W[jn];B[nm];W[nl];B[ll]
;W[mj];B[kl];W[jm];B[kj];W[lo];B[mn]MA[kn][ln]LB[no:A]C[Denis: Black should have sacrificed the 2 marked stones and play at A.]
;W[mp]C[Denis: Good reading for white. Black has too many cut points. White is sure to take profit, and have an easy win.]
;B[no];W[np];B[oo];W[op];B[mq];W[lp];B[pn];W[mh];B[jr]C[Denis: black cannot hope to live there.]
;W[ir];B[iq];W[kr];B[jp];W[kq];B[kp];W[jo];B[on];W[nj];B[kh]
;W[lf];B[rc];W[rb]
(;B[oc]C[Denis: this is the second big mistake. As it turned out, it didn't worked. See the variation for a simple and more peacefull option. Thought not enough for black to get back in the game.]

LB[hl:A][qe:B]C[Denis: Too small. Black still has some big threats. Surely A. B might be possible. Anyway, black is running out of threats and White has still many. So black cannot win the KO. The game is over. Black should give up here.]
