C[Reviewer xxc
Review from both sides.

After a quick look at this game, i notice the same problem for both players ... "fear of space"

Now let's go on the game ...

(follow the game and come back one or more moves to see exemples)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp]C[OK until here]
(;B[cf]LB[dd:A][jd:1][pd:B][dj:2][pj:3][cn:4][qn:7][fq:5][nq:6]
TR[cf]C[This one is small.
The main goal of go is to divide the whole board in two parts ... and try to make yours a little bigger to win. At this stage (fuseki or opening) it is really important to develop as far as possible on the whole board ...

Perfect extension form A might be on 1 and 2 ... and from B on 1 and 3

The black marked stone (C14) is classical approach of 4x4 stone (D4 or Q4) 4,5,6 or 7 ... or an answer to opponent approach ... 6 for 7 for exemple.

Look at variations from precedent move.

1 is a strong move as an perfect extension from both corner stones for black]

(;W[mq]LB[nc:4][jd:1][qf:3][dj:5][jp:2]C[Also small

1 to prevent black from making a huge moyo on the upper side
2 ... see precedent variations
3 or 4 for corner approach
or 5 to prevent black extension from D16-C14];B[md];W[qm];B[qg]
;W[hq];B[dk];W[cm];B[ie]C[OK ... both players build his own moyo.

This one let to much space arround H17-J17 ... white can invade and find a way to make a living group.]
;W[pj]C[Ok
The board is divide in 2 now ... what to do now ?

1 reduce opponent moyo while extending ...
2 invide]
(;B[pi]C[First contact move ... a contact move purpose is ... defense. Black do no need defense here.

Better to play on the center.]

(;B[qi]C[Same comment as precedent move ... too small]
(;W[ri]C[wrong way ...];B[rh]C[19 and 18 are "yose" moves (end game) their value are small in comparison with a move in the center]

What about 1 ?];B[qe]
(;W[sd]LB[re:1]C[Why not 1 ?];B[ma]C[Black have to make eyes]

(;W[qa]C[Not necesary];B[rf];W[ph]C[This is a wrong "sente" move. White lose initiative here]
;B[qh];W[ob];B[sg];W[rj];B[re];W[rd];B[se];W[ck]C[Both groups are alive ... time to play elsewhere.

But maybe it could have be done before ?

(;W[em]LB[fk:1]C[This is not necessary same purpose with 1]

Over all comment

Don't be affraid of space !
Both players have to study :
- a little about "fuseki", just to have ideas of extension possible in the begining,  - basic shapes, like "tobi" (one space jump), "keima" (knight move) ... to extend from a stone,
- basic "life & death" to know where there is enough room to live, how to extend and reduce eye space.
