C[Hello, well for the most part I felt that I was playing fairly good this game.  Perhaps a little over aggressive at times and because of that some of my formations ended up being a little weak.  Anyways, tell me what you think, and thanks for reviewing my game.  ^_^


(I played black stones)

S> This is Eric S. Piotrowski, aka scartol on KGS. All of my comments will feature the S> symbol. 

Obviously, the mistakes on the left side were critical for white's victory, but your fuseki structures could also be stronger. Let's see if we can't figure out how to evolve a little.]
;B[cd];W[pp];B[dp];W[od];B[nq];W[kq];B[lp]LB[no:C][gq:A][qq:B]
TR[kq]C[S> This is really close, really early -- and that is to white's advantage. Before black plays here, white's marked stone is all by itself. The best way to respond is to play another pincer, say around A, and put pressure on that white soldier. Then you can develop O3 by jumping to B or C. All this move does is tell white: "I'm paranoid about making a base!"]
;W[kp];B[lo]C[S> Of course, there's nothing wrong with getting out into the center, so long as you keep white's resulting wall in mind.]
;W[ko];B[qn]C[S> The problem with playing here now is that white has already split black up (assuming she runs into the center, which she does not, here). When that happens, black ends up with two weak groups, which he must then spend time caring for. It's better to play the double approach earlier, and treat one or the other approaching stones as expendable.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[no]LB[qe:B][lm:A]C[S> Very small. Play on a larger scale -- A or B. This move seems to say "I'm trying to keep you from making eyes," a very risky thing to do so early in the game.]
;W[qo];B[qm]LB[qf:A]C[Good move or should i have played s7 or r8?
--
S> Both of those moves would allow white to put the R6 stone into atari. There's nothing wrong with this move, provided it's followed up with a move around A.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qi]C[S> Timid. R14 is better. Riskier, but more threatening. See variation.]
;W[qd]LB[lc:A]C[S> Notice that white now has a big, safe corner. Realize, however, that a move around A is still troubling to white.]
;B[pr]LB[ec:A][jc:B][cj:C][gp:D]TR[ko][kp][kq]C[S> Very small. A, B and C are much bigger. Also, don't forget about white's wall! A move around D would attack its power white helping black to stabilize on the bottom.]
;W[qr];B[oo]C[S> More eyes-stealing moves. Much too early.]
;W[po];B[jd]C[S> Good!];W[ed];B[df]C[S> Good, calm response. No need for alarm.]
;W[hd];B[nd]LB[mc:A][jf:B]C[o17 or n16 better in your opinion?
--
S> Well, attaching is a sign of anxiety. Save your attach moves for very close fighting. In this case, N16 is too small and O17 is still a form of attachment. I'd say A or B are best,]
;W[ne];B[nc];W[oc];B[fq]C[S> Good, but timid. This still lets white use that wall. You don't want to play too closely to it, of course, so perhaps this isn't so bad after all.]
;W[dk]
(;B[ci]C[Hum should I have played c6 instead here?  Didnt really seem that it mattered seeing as how both groups are about equal in strength.
--
S> Yes they are -- but white is weak on top and has that thick wall on the bottom. Furthermore, the black top group is set up with a decent base -- and to secure the corner, D17 is all he needs. So I would push white toward the top. See variation.]
;W[cn];B[bo]LB[cp:A]C[S> Again, this feels desperate and spread-out. There's nothing wrong with the demure A.]
;W[eo];B[bl]LB[go:A]C[S> Now the moves are getting a bit odd. Ask yourself: What is white trying to do? In this case, I'd say white is trying to close black into the corner. Ergo, a move at A is quite appropriate. Besides, it helps to keep white separated.]
;W[cl];B[bk];W[bn];B[do]LB[en:A][co:B]C[S> You know where white is going to play next before it's played. So unless you mean to cut immediately at A, this move doesn't accomplish much. I'd be more inclined to play at B.]
;W[dn];B[co];W[go]C[S> Now black is sealed in. Never a good thing.]
;B[iq];W[hq];B[hp];W[ep];B[eq];W[ip];B[gq];W[hr];B[ir];W[ho]
;B[gp];W[kl]C[S> Notice how large white's middle-left-bottom moyo is becoming. Now white will reap the rewards of the splitting-up she's sown around the board.]
;B[en];W[fn];B[em];W[fo];B[io]LB[eh:A][ki:B]TR[em][en]C[S> Rather a small-scale approach. The marked black stones are in danger -- just keep those cutting stones alive and white will have plenty to worry about. (Actually, a better way to deal with this is to attack it from above and the right, instead of trying to break it apart from within its very solid foundation -- moves at A and B would do this nicely.)]
;W[jp];B[in];W[fm];B[lq]C[S> Does not compute. Save those cutting stones!]
;W[kn];B[jj]LB[dc:A][ei:B]C[Couldnt decide what to do so i played here.  Any key points (besides R14) that would be better?
--
S> As I said before, this isn't bad! It gets right in the way -- but I hope you're prepared for a big fight. Helping to stabilize the left side with a move at either A or B (or both, since A is sente) first is a good idea. And you're right -- R14 is a good spot too.]
;W[il];B[ck];W[ek];B[an];W[dm];B[dc]C[S> Yes!];W[ec];B[rf]C[Wonder why i decided to play here instead of R14...  O_o
--
S> Yes, it is curious.];W[qg];B[rg];W[qh];B[rh];W[qf];B[pi]
C[S> Good move.];W[hj];B[ih]C[S> How important is this? White is moving toward a honeypot on the left -- protect it! The tengen stone has plenty of options when the time comes to run away.]
;W[hh];B[kh]C[S> Small, small, small.];W[ef];B[eg]LB[ie:C][hf:B]
[dg:A]C[S> D'oh! Yes, the proverb says to hane, but in this case strength and being solid are much more important than getting out into the middle. A is much better. And if white follows up with E13, there's nothing wrong with a play at B (except that it of course invites C, which threatens black's top group -- so maybe it's best to just let white have the corridor in the middle and settle for expanding the top black group).]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[eh]LB[cf:A][ch:B]C[Hum, doesnt seem like a good move.  Maybe F13 instead?
--
S> No, definitely not a good move. The whole reason white played the crosscut was to seize this one black stone. Instead, she got lucky: black wobbled and gave her two stones, and let down the defenses on the left side too! Jackpot! (A or B is much better.)]
;W[di];B[ch]C[S> Good. All is not lost!];W[fg];B[ff]C[S> Oooh. More of the same. Never mind that -- protect the left!]
;W[ee];B[gg];W[fh];B[hf];W[md];B[mc];W[ld];B[lc];W[mf];B[ml]
LB[nl:B][mm:A]C[S> I'm not sure what this move is trying to accomplish. If black seeks to run into the middle, this move is too late. A is better now. If it seeks to expand the right side, it's too far. B is better.]
;W[om];B[ol];W[nl];B[nk];W[nm];B[mk]LB[ok:A]C[S> Why leave that stone there, just **asking** to be put into atari? Connect at A and let the N8 stone go.]
;W[ok];B[pl];W[oj];B[ni]C[S> Good answer!];W[mm];B[hg];W[gh]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[ge];W[ie];B[id];W[he]
(;B[if]C[S> This feels timid. Try the variation and see what happens.]
;W[je];B[hc];W[ic];B[hb];W[jc];B[kd];W[ke];B[kc];W[fc];B[le]
C[S> Good move, but there's a killer follow-up to watch for.]
;W[lf];B[me];W[jg]C[S> White thinks you're a punk! Move in for the kill! (See variation.)]

(;B[jf];W[kf];B[kg];W[db];B[cb];W[eb];B[fa]C[S> Small. Black is weak on the left -- reinforce!]
;W[cf]LB[bf:A]C[I misread this whole part and really screwed up bad!!!
--
S> It happens to the best of us. (Not me, of course. Just kidding.) Anyway, don't sweat it. A of course is the proper response here.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[dd];W[bd];B[cc];W[bc]LB[bf:A][bm:B]C[S> These black stones are more or less dead. Let them go and save the bottom left group by playing at A or B.]

(;B[dj]C[Can I kill that corner???
--
S> No. See variation.];W[ei];B[bf];W[be];B[da];W[ea];B[bb];W[bg]
;B[bh];W[af];B[ac];W[ad];B[aa]LB[bm:A]C[I wasnt going for eyes here thinking of some sort of ko battle i guess.
--
S> But white has two eyes. Play at A or lose the bottom as well.]
;W[am]C[S> D'oh! Things look pretty bad for black.];B[ao];W[bm]
;B[ai];W[ag]C[He has to go and do that *sigh*
--
S> Well, it's naive to think she wouldn't see it.];B[bj]C[S> Good move! Black can live now.]
;W[of]C[S> Good move, white. (O14 was an interesting attack move for a while, and I didn't even see it.)]
;B[rc];W[rd];B[qc];W[pb];B[ng];W[nf];B[pe];W[pf];B[re];W[qe]
;B[sd];W[nb];B[pc];W[pd];B[mb];W[oa]LB[qb:A][oh:B]C[S> Play at A and white only has one eye. (But the area around B will probably yield another.)]
;B[la];W[mg];B[mh];W[rb]LB[qb:A]C[S> Odd move for white. A gets two eyes.]
;B[qb];W[qa];B[sc];W[og]
(;B[oi]LB[ph:A]C[S> Now white has a second eye at A. See variation for a more adventurous option.]

;B[ij]C[Yeah lets go and ignor his move and lose the whole side.
--
S> Danger, Will Robinson!];W[dj];B[hi]LB[ah:A]C[S> You could still live with A...]
