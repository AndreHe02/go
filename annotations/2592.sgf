C[buckyyowza: Hello. Comments by Mark Fyffe, all prefixed with "buckyyowza".  I hope you find my comments to be of use.  General comments may be found on the last move, please enjoy this review :-)

Dear reviewer -

This was a game played on a real board.  The game was close and without serious errors (from our points of view) so we tried to reproduce it as best as we could for review.  Comments by black will be preceeded by B, and white with W.

Both players ~ 4-5k, and W + 1.5

Any comments you can give would be much appreciated.

Thanks!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df]

TR[pj][dp]C[buckyyowza: This play at C8 is too slow for now.  It does not put enough pressure on white's group to cause him any concern; so although it is fairly large, this play is gote. a play at H4 or J3 would be joseki and would also provide the correct amount of pressure on white to counter the thickness from the marked stones.]
;W[cr];B[jp]LB[hq:A]TR[fq]C[W: This whole sequence seemed bad for white, but I don't see any alternatives for any of the moves.  Anything that I could have done differently?

buckyyowza: well lets see... white has two settled corners with fairly thick extensions.  he also has a very thick star point at Q10.  black's only settled group is the overplayed shape on the left side and his last play (K4) is too far leaving a weakness around H3 that white can exploit as the center develops a little further.  I think white is playing quite well so far.  although it may seem that black covers more area of the board this is only because he is over extended.  there are certainly other ways white could play, but I wouldn't suggest any of them ;-)]

(;W[qf]LB[nc:A]C[buckyyowza: this is a poor use of white's presence on the board.  since Q10 is inside black's sphere of influence, it needs only to survive.  although this approach provides a base for Q10, accomplishing that goal, it also forces black into the top side, which reduces white's sphere so this play is counter productive. I would prefer an approach from the other side (i.e. O17, see variation).]
;B[mc];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[hq]
(;B[fo]LB[fp:A]C[B: K3/K2 better?

buckyyowza:  white is too early to invade H3: it has no center aji to back it up, O3 is too far to run to, and it is too good for black to sacrifice a stone there, so F5 is a perfect follow up.  K3/K2 would allow H3 to play off of D4 (see var).  If black plays this well, he should have no trouble dominating the lower half of the board.]
;W[jr]
(;B[kr]LB[kq:A]C[buckyyowza: should be L3.  this allows black to form eyes too easily.]

;B[lr];W[or]
(;B[lp]LB[pr:A]C[buckyyowza: M4 is overplay.  white cannot create trouble for black by escaping the L3 stone.  black should play Q2 here instead to ensure white does not get eye space. see variations.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[mr];B[lq];W[qm]
(;B[rq]LB[mo:A]C[buckyyowza: it would be more beneficial for black to run to the center now since he has such a strong presence there. I would play at N5 (see var), although there are several other variations.]
;W[pq];B[qr];W[pr];B[qs];W[ro]LB[om:B][nn:A]C[buckyyowza: this peep helps solidify black's shape.  it is better to attack from the outside, such as O6 or P7. Once the outside is secure and escape is no longer possible, then it is time to look for reduction in eye space.]
;B[rp];W[nn];B[rn];W[qn];B[qo];W[rm]
(;B[so]LB[gp:A]C[buckyyowza: this is not urgent now because black is already alive. A play at G4 now instead would eliminate white's aji from the H3 group and give black a considerable lead with few trouble spots.]

LB[ld:B][of:A][ll:C]C[buckyyowza: black's play is too timid.  It is better to maintain a strong presence in the center than to save a few points in this corner. Some ideas to follow up this play are M16, P14, or M8.  All of these will increase the pressure on white's right side.]
;W[of];B[ne];W[id];B[ho];W[dm];B[nf];W[ng];B[nm];W[nl];B[mm]
;W[ml];B[lm];W[mg];B[ll];W[fm]LB[hi:B][lk:A]C[W: I play these vague kind of moves pretty often.  In this case I am trying to negate black influence from all sides and maybe set myself up for some reducing moves later.  I've been told though that moves like this seem much bigger than they are.  Do you think this move is playable, or are there much bigger points around?

buckyyowza: black's thickness here only faces itself and there are many opportunities to erase this moyo, so this play is not the biggest at this point.  I would prefer M9 to accomplish the same purpose (of negating black influence) while also building white's right side moyo.  another option to reduce black's influence is a indirect invasion such as H11.]
;B[ge];W[fj];B[ek];W[dl];B[fk]C[B: Is this (F9) bigger or D9?

buckyyowza: D9 is better here.  Both players have an equal hold on the center, so there are few points there.  The areas along the sides are the most interesting.]

(;B[lb]LB[gc:A][kh:C][mk:B]C[buckyyowza: M18 is a small endgame gote play - the game is not late enough for this sort of play. Why not play on a larger scale, such as G17, N9, or L12.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[gd];B[he];W[kb]LB[jg:B][bi:A][hm:C]C[buckyyowza: this also is gote, and too small for this stage of the game.  A better endgame play would be B11 since it is sente.  White also has big points at K13 and H7 that efficiently erase black's moyo.]

;B[gq];W[hm];B[sm];W[sl]C[buckyyowza: this ko is bad for white.  it only costs 1 point to play S8 here and avoid the ko.]
;B[rl];W[sn]
(;B[ms]LB[jf:A][ki:B]C[buckyyowza: this threat is bad because it sacrifices a stone while improving white's shape.  with much of the board still unplayed it would be better to use this ko to build moyo in two steps.]

C[buckyyowza: black gets 4 points out of the ko, but lost 4 and sente in the process.  so a ko that should have been bad for white has actually turned to his advantage.]

buckyyowza: Thanks for the opportunity to look over this game.  This game was quite challenging to review, as both players have quite a similar style and things were fairly even throughout.  In fact, in general I'd say that the evenness is the problem - both white and black are too polite ;-)  Some points to help you to think bigger:

1) early in the game when you have decided on a play stop and ask yourself "is there an equivalent play that gives me more thickness?"  To maximize thickness in the opening is like putting money in the bank, it will always come in handy later on. Just do not sacrifice too much solid ground.  White's first few moves were ideal, but his follow up (such as the approach at R14) helped black to negate the thickness he had earned.

2) when invading or reducing, timing is critical.  use thickness to your advantage: always build up enough support for your attack.  it seems in this game that the few attacks (H3 and E9 for example) that were played involved too much sacrifice and did not come off very well.  This is because they did not have the right shape to follow through; if you build the right shape and read it out ahead of time the attack will not fail.

3) always take the time to find the biggest move on the board.  it is too tempting to play a small endgame play without much thought toward the late middle game.  before playing any endgame play always convince yourself that not only are you playing the largest possible play on the board, but that you are also keeping sente.  if there is no way to get more than 10 points or keep sente, then the game is in a very late stage.

I have tried to focus on these things in my comments and provide some variations to illustrate these points.  Though I am certainly not a strong player (about 1 dan AGA), I hope that you enjoy reading through them and find something in them to learn from.  Please feel free to let me know if you have any further questions about this game.]
