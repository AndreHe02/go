C[Hi. Thank you for taking time to review my game. I thought I played it pretty well even though I lost. I appreciate your thoughts on where I could have made a better move or where I made an error.]

A small tip about this - if you can steal the space under a group, it makes it harder for that group to live. This is providing that your stones are able to connect out, however.]

I would move black's stone up to c5, simply because it gives black more of the corner.]

Keep playing and enjoying go!])
