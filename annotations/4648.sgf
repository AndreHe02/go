C[I was black in this game and lost by 5 points. There wasn't any particularly vicious fighting but I lost despite a fortunate corner invasion late in the game, and I can't see how I fell so far behind. Thanks for your help!

Hi,

This game should have been an easy win for black; white doesn't deserve most of what he got in the middle.  Black's moyo strategy was well-conceived with a few mistakes, the biggest one letting white break into your wall on top.  Once you have the lead you should play more solidly-- letting white take your h11 j12 stones, for example, was painful.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq];W[dn];B[iq];W[eq]C[A friend always plays this move against me, claiming that black is overconcentrated after F4. I still play F4, because white's corner isn't secure and black is much stronger. Is this right?


W is correct here.  B is strong but after he stands he has three stones very close to each other in an early, wide-open board.]
;B[fp];W[ck]C[W too conservative, especially considering the 3-3 point at c3 is still open -- he should c10, making a better relationship with the d17 stone.]
;B[de]C[This move is not necessarily bad, but better to take q10 or q9 to make an impressive moyo for yourself working well with your q16 stone and your lower-side strength.  Here you place a stone in a weak position, giving white the initiative.  If you don't and white gets d15, c9 is too far to make a safe enclosure anyway.  But even if c9 were at c10, q9/10 is better because it keeps you on the initiative and forces white to enter your larger moyo first.]

;B[if];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[qo]C[With as much nearby strength as you have, q5 better.  If w comes in at r7, you can give up a little in the corner and make two perfect walls enclosing territory between your prexisting strength on the top right and bottom left.]
;W[oo];B[np];W[op];B[oq];W[no];B[mp];W[qn];B[po]C[This move doesn't get you much, but asks white to strengthen.  you could have replied with a simple descent to r5 to keep w from having any good sente moves, or q6 for complicated variations that are sure to be good for you since you have all the strength in the area.]
;W[pn];B[om]C[This move only helps white!  white clearly has a weakness at p6 -- why let him fix it and render your own stone almost useless all in one move?   

Better to use this weakness to get free sente -- the turn at n5 is enormous, and w will have to respond defensively, and then you can _still_ run him out and make territory in the process.]

;W[ol];B[mj];W[nm];B[fn]C[Good idea, but better to come in from your weaker group at f12 -- once that group has more strength, you are in great hands.]

;W[go]C[your several gote moves on the extreme left, and your missing the possibility of g12, are what let white get enough to win in the middle.  He should have almost nothing there.  

 If white doesn't have the center strength, then the "fortunate" invasion in the lower left corner which became more difficult after white e3 becomes an easier play.]
