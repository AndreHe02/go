C[Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game and lost by a big margin. I chose this game for review because it is typical of my style recently: I start well and lead, and then lose my advantage in the middle game. Could you help me understand my major mistakes?
Thanks, Avi

Lop: I think you lost many points in the endgame. The reduction of the left side led to a terrible result for black which put white a little ahead. But in the endgame you really lost the game.]

(;B[cm]C[Lop: I think here it's better to run out immediately.  Playing this move means that you made an invasion out of your reduction (reversed move order).]

(;B[fo]C[Now I think I should have let off the two stones and play G8 - do you agree?

Lop: Yes, you should sacrifice the two stones and try to jump out lightly. Saving these two stones lead to the terrible result on this side. You should keep in mind that if you invade you should play lightly and flexible. I can't make a clear judgement from a single game but maybe this is the main problem of your midgame?]
