AB[dd][dp][pd]C[ajility: hello
fushiki:
Hi!];W[op]C[Hello. This is a game I played against a stronger player in
which I lost by a small margin but got repeatedly destroyed in tactical
situations. I would appreciate any comments or suggestions.

Anton> Hello Adam, I am 13k on DGS, and will definitely try to comment on the situations you highlight. Also, I will mention other things which are obvious to me, and will mark some of white's mistakes as well - you could have used them to gain advantage. Sorry if my comments sound too harsh - I only wish to help you become stronger.

From my point of view, the main areas to improve are the following:
1. Be a little bit more confident in saving your own and chasing the opponent's groups. In this game there were a few significant cases where an extra move would save or kill.
2. Try to think what the opponent's move is achieving, and what will happen if you ignore it. Some say that "sente" is only in our heads, you never _have_ to respond, only when you decide to. This will allow you to gain initiative.
3. Same about your moves, especially closer to end game, try to think what this move achieves, whether it brings any points etc. Efficiency of stones is a very important part of the game.]
;B[qp];W[qn]LB[po:A]C[Anton> This move by white is not good - it invites black to split white into two weak groups by hitting the weak spot at A (Q5).]

(;B[oq]C[Anton> Too bad black has not used the chance to cut, and white starts to connect the two stones.

Generally, if it is possible to create weak groups of opposite colour at the beginning of the game, you could call it a great success - as you chase the weak groups later in the game, you can force opponent while building some good power for yourself.]
;W[pp];B[pq];W[rp];B[rq];W[qo];B[qq]LB[mp:A][pj:B]C[Anton> The result looks okayish to me, corner for black and influence on the right side for white. 

Both sides really need to make at least one more move to complete the local situation - get out of the lock at A for black, and extend from thickness at B for white.]
;W[cf];B[fd];W[dj];B[cm];W[nc];B[kc]LB[jc:A]C[Anton> This stone could be placed a little more efficiently - at A, it makes the top-left corner enslosure more stable, and still does attack the white stone at O17.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe]LB[qe:A]C[Anton> Playing at A is more traditional for black, this has two goals - push white closer to the border, and also start gaining at least some influence on the right side.]

(;W[qe]
(;B[qf];W[pf]C[Anton> White wishes to complicate the situation, probably feeling tactical advantage over black. Black, in response, should play as reliably as possible, not to give in to psycological pressure.]
;B[of];W[pg]
(;B[qi]LB[qg:A]C[Anton> A (R13, see variation) for black would be saving the cutting stone. It is not a good idea to give up a cutting stone this easily.]
;W[qg]C[Anton> White is correct to urgently capture the cutting stone - keeping one's groups connected is of highest importance.]
;B[ql]LB[me:A]C[Anton> This is a good idea, making base for your own stones. Yet there is a larger group - Q17,16,15, P14 - which may need strengthtening before doing this.

I would have played A - this strengthtens the black group, attacks the white stone at O17, and, if white cuts at M16, there will be further chance to strengthten black stone at L17 - by connecting it to the upper-left, while still attacking white.

When (if) white gets into the open - this will be good time to make the base at R8.]
;W[ne]C[Anton> Good move by white, getting free while attacking black.]
;B[oe];W[nf]C[Here
I panicked and gave up my group for dead. I figured I would get some
outside moves in pretending to save it, but in retrospect that didn't
work too well.];B[md];W[nd];B[oh]LB[og:A]C[Anton> I think the black group is too heavy to surrender it like that, so I would play A.

If white start making a kind of a "ladder" while chasing this black group, this will lead to lots of cutting opportunities (and this is not a ladder, because black still has three dame on the other end, which gives it some manoeuvrability).]
;W[og];B[ol];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[jq]SQ[fp][fq]LB[iq:A]C[Anton> A is the ideal extension for white's two marked stones - so it would put more pressure on them if black played A. The group in the lower-right is safe enough to afford such a distant attack.]
;W[er];B[dr];W[ep];B[dq];W[gr]
(;B[hq]LB[mp:A]C[this was too close, obviously.

Anton> Indeed, this move does not seem to achieve much, as white can still easily escape to the centre, it would be difficult to contain it with a single move, so I would not call this move sente (though, I could be wrong here).

I would play around A - to both connect the lone stone to the group in the lower-right, and also to apply (moderate) pressure on white. 

The alternative you propose is more aggressive, and, seeing how white likes to cut everywhere, may lead to some complicated fighting.

Also, don't forget about the insecure space we have left in the upper left - by playing L17 too far. White will later come back to attack there.]
;W[ir];B[hr]LB[iq:A][jr:B]C[Anton> I would either connect at A, hoping to jump into the centre while white crawls along the second line, or would stop white at B, though this would be too greedy.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[hs];B[jr]SQ[hr][ip]LB[hp:A][jp:B]C[Anton> The marked moves don't seem to achieve much, and the resulting shape is not reliable - there are two cutting points at A and B.]
;W[is];B[np];W[hp];B[ho];W[gq];B[oo]LB[io:A][jp:B]C[Anton> To be honest, I would worry about the cutting points at A and B - and would close this by playing A. This would justify the previously made moves.

Yet, the move at P5 seems to kill the white group, so it is a really good move, and if worth the risk of those cutting points :)]
;W[hc]C[I
touched thinking this white group wouldn't have space to live, but
never got a chance to actually attack it.];B[gc];W[hd];B[jd]
SQ[hc][hd]LB[bd:B][je:A]C[Anton> Too passive. White has cut black in two attackable groups, so black cannot afford to lose initiative.

If black decides to attach from the right (and, I think, this is the correct direction, as the group on the left, while attackable, still should be able to survive), a move at A would be taking the group faster towards the centre, and would also keep pressure on the two marked white stones.

Another option is to secure the left group with B, yet this will most likely mean surrendering the group on the right.]
;W[db];B[cc];W[cb]
(;B[eb]LB[bb:A]C[Anton> I would play A, see the variation. Generally, narrowing the base of a group is the first option to look into when trying to kill. It doesn't always work, yet quite often it does, and it is useful to start the thought process there.

E18 is way too risky - the black stone is already endangered by white's move at E17, etc.]
;W[bc];B[bd];W[dc];B[cd];W[ac];B[ec];W[ba]
(;B[gf]SQ[hc][hd]LB[ab:A][da:B]C[Back to the tsumego for me...

Anton> I disagree, white's group lives unconditionally (A and B are miai for life), so black is correct to jump out and put more pressure on the marked stones.]
;W[da]C[Anton> This move by white is not needed.];B[ro];W[rn]
;B[sp];W[lq]
(;B[js]C[Anton> Of course, the cutting points above should stop you from making this move, yet in general, you should think many times before playing on the first line before end-game - the only time when you need to do it is when it saves your group's life, or kills the opponent's group.

Neither is true in this case.];W[jp]
(;B[io]SQ[ho][ip]LB[kp:A]C[Anton> Sacrificing the marked stones while playing A seems to be the only reasonable option at this point.]
;W[kp]C[I
was of the opinion these black stones are now dead, but white later
played another move to enclose them. Was there an escape?

Anton> I don't think so. The best I can do is in variation of response for black, yet that doesn't gain anything either.]

(;B[eo]LB[if:A][rl:B]C[Anton> I would play this to either complete the capture around A, or to secure the kill around B.

(B is probably an overplay, yet it is my personal style to be sure in such matters - if you can't count all the variations and tell whether leaving the group as is keeps it dead - though you should still try to count, - it is best to play the extra move, rather than later discover it is far from dead).]
;W[lr]LB[nr:A]C[Anton> This seems to be a wasted move by white. If this was an attack of the black group in lower-right, it would be more obviously attacking at A.]
;B[nq]LB[nn:C][nq:B][po:A]C[Anton> This move is premature - points A and B are miai for keeping black connected, so you don't have to play B before white plays A.

And, since we hope white is dead, even if they do play A, black will try to contain white with something like C, instead of worrying about connecting two alive groups together.]
;W[po];B[on];W[pm];B[om];W[pl];B[qk]LB[pk:A]C[Anton> The move here is A, to keep the eyeless white group locked.]
;W[pk];B[pj]LB[oj:A]C[Anton> Still possible to attempt to kill the group at A instead of Q10.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[mi];W[no]C[Ouch.

Anton> True.];B[nn];W[mo];B[ch]SQ[nn][ol][om][on][oo]TR[nk]
[ok][op][pk][pl][pm][po][pp][qn][qo][rn]LB[if:B][mn:A]C[I'm losing over there, so I thought I would try over here.

Anton> It was actually possible to try one more thing - by threatening to escape with the marked black group at around A, try to surround the marked white group. Either results (black escaping or white surrendering the group) are good, in this situation.

Please remember that white's group still has no eyes, so chasing it is a good strategy.

Though, if you do decide to tenuki, C12 is the best choice, in my opinion. Second best is completing the capture around B.]

;W[kf]LB[ld:A]C[Anton> White could escape with the cutting stone by playing at A, the ladder favours them on either side.]
;B[ld];W[le];B[id]C[Anton> This move does not seem to achieve anything, though it is a forcing more - it is best to leave those for later, as ko-threats.]
;W[he];B[ic]LB[bg:C][il:A][mb:D][rh:B]C[Anton> One point of territory in gote in middle game... not a good idea.

There seem to be more important points on the board - like A, or even B, C and D.]
;W[jg];B[if]C[Anton> Again, no gain from this move.];W[jf];B[ih]
;W[me];B[mh];W[ng];B[ki];W[mm];B[dl];W[ek];B[fk]C[Here
I start a long sequence trying to reduce white's outside territory, but
most of my stones die.];W[el]
(;B[fi]SQ[ho][io][ip]LB[hk:A][il:B]C[Anton> Here either your suggested alternative works better, or escaping into the centre with A, or, bolder, B.

Generally, if you start this far away from your own stones, it is important to keep lightness and speed in escaping. It is okay to leave some (not too many) stones behind, as long as you sufficiently succeed in decreasing the opponent's territory.

I like B better - it sacrifices the stone at F9 (if the white accept the sacrifice), while saving the marked group, and reducing white's potential for territory.]
;W[ej];B[fh];W[fg];B[gi];W[eh];B[go]LB[hi:A]C[Anton> This is too close to white stones, jumping into the centre would provide more flexibility and, therefore, higher chance of survival.

Also, this leaves a cutting point at A from the previous sequence - so all those moves could become wasted.]

SQ[ms]LB[bg:D][cg:B][rh:A][rm:C][sk:E]C[Anton> This exchange is premature, it only gains 1 point for each side, and could easily be ignored by either until 1-point moves are exchanged.

Bigger moves are at A, B, C.
