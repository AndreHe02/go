AB[pd][dp]C[Hello Im Fatih (aphelion) from Turkey. This was a close game but we both made mistakes. I need advices about my general game style, I know I have a "game reading" problem how should I improve this?

I think one of the best ways to help improve your "reading" is to practice life and death problems and middle game problems.  Goproblems.com is an excellent site for this (you can also submit your own problems).  Other website's (usgo.org, gobase.org) have new problems every day.]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[fq];B[cn]C[Ben: Here I would probably play d6.  This low move is apart of defensive strategy that I am not really sure meshes well in a handicap game.  On the other hand your oppoenent is probably taking white for a reason and playing defensively might be a good idea.]
;W[dr]
(;B[cq]C[Ben:  Sometimes after white plays a move on the second line like this I just tenuki but c3 is perfectly playable.]
;W[iq]
(;B[nq]CR[ce][de][cf][df][pj]C[Ben: This is not such a good idea in my opinion.  Your too worried about him getting territory as opposed to building up your own potential.  Make him worried about your territory instead.  This is just going to leave you with an attackable group which will help him in other parts of the board later.

I marked other locations I might consider playing in addition to the variation.  If your going to attack this stone then It's better to attack from the other side.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[pn];B[kq];W[lr];B[kr];W[nr];B[lq];W[mr]C[Ben: Maybe l5 next is a little better.]
;B[jo];W[jp];B[ko]MA[kp]C[Ben: Probably it is better to just play at x here.  Since you can't avoid getting split in some way.]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[lo];B[mo];W[ln];B[mn]C[my opponent looks a little aggressive and I dont know if I responded well?

Ben: Here if I were him I probably would have played m7 that way black has 2 weak groups to whites 1.  Weak groups can have an interesting effect on the game.]

(;W[qf];B[lm]C[Ben: Very good.  It is worth it to make this play now.]

(;W[qj]C[Ben: Unusual.  Better would have been to make a double approach.]
;B[df];W[rd]C[Ben: Again unusual.]
(;B[qc]C[Ben: It's difficult to say what the best plan is here.  I might have tried k16.]
;W[jc]
(;B[mc];W[fc]
(;B[hc]C[Ben: double edged.];W[fe];B[ie];W[fg]C[Ben: Having the possibilty of a ladder breaker allows white some extra moves.]
;B[kn];W[je];B[ic];W[if];B[kc]CR[df][dc]C[Ben: Im not suggesting a lot of alternatives here because it is very complicated.  It might take someone of a professional level to obtain an accurate assessment of the complications here.  Mostly I am worried about the two marked stones as they are very weak.  Since in the next couple of moves you switch back to over there I think you ended up satisfactorily.]
;W[id];B[jb];W[jd]
(;B[ed];W[fd]
(;B[ci]C[Ben: I think the way you played in the game is fine.  Playing the j-18 move means ending in gote for white and the moves are probably about the same amount of points.]

(;W[ig];B[li];W[kf];B[fo]MA[dl]C[trying to attack lower white and make a territory upper side

Ben: I think you will find it easier to just play something like X.  You attack white yes but it has little chance of actually dying.  And this move doesn't do enough to actually make territory on the left.  You should always strive to make dual purpose moves it is true but there is a distinction to be made between a move that has two purposes and a move that only seems to have two purposes.]
;W[dj]C[Ben: A good move from white.  Notice how he attacks lightly to preserve making points in the middle of the board.]
;B[ir]C[Ben: There is no reason not to play c-10.  I believe you are ahead at this point but you have to play c-10.  If you feel you are behind then maybe you can play this move j-2 and see if he makes and mistake and if he doesn't simply resign.  But I don't think this is the situation.  In short tenuki when you have to.  I know it difficult when your opponent has sente but sente and gote represent the natural flow of the game.]
;W[hr];B[ip]C[Ben: As I express later c-2 is bigger.  You should get c-2 in first before trying this.  You kind of got sucked into attacking white and you earned points in doing so but he also earned points while defending.  The better strategy is to make it so that he cannot earn points while defending, not have the option to push at c-2.

But of course firstly you should play c-10 and then think about these plays on the bottom.]
;W[hp];B[jq]C[Ben:  There is really no turning back now.  If black doesn't do this his previous plays are just wasted.]
;W[hq];B[ho];W[cr]C[Ben: This move here is important.  If you have the choice between capturing 2 stones for 4 points and this, play this instead.  I think the person who plays here first has the potential to make a point swing of about 15 points.]
;B[di];W[ej];B[ok];W[oj]C[Ben: This was probably a useful kikashi but white is too strong here for you to do much more.  It is time for b-9 or c-10.]

[sq][sr][ss]C[Ben: So the game turned out to be very close even up to the end.  I think you should work on your reading but realize why it will help you.  The way I see it in most kyu's minds there are only two possibilities, the group looks weak therefore I will attack it and the group looks strong so I wont attack it.  If you are aiming for more sophistication in your play then doing tsumego (go problems) will help you with that.  Then you will see more possibilites such as, the group looks weak but really isn't so I should be careful how I attack it so I don't do more harm than good.  And a group looks strong but I see a way it can be cut and made weak so I should be careful how I defend.  I saw both of these scenario's played out in this game (the wrong way) and they are common ways amatuers think about the game.]
