C[I'm the white pieces.

RW> Hi this is Ronald Wopereis, woepwoep on KGS. My comment is preceded by my initials. I have commented with 30k in mind, as to maximum serve you and think along with you. I hope this is ok?]

C[Here, i think was a terrible game, but in this pice i try to invade black by there, but the best way it's b14?
In this sequence (10 - 25) I lost a lot of pieces. What could do to save then?

RW> I can imagine black J9 made it look like he owns a great deal of the board. But really you can ignore such moves because a simple move like white O17 makes the board look totally different. So no harm done here.]
;B[dd];W[cc];B[ec];W[bd];B[bc];W[bb];B[ac]
(;W[be]C[RW> this is where you go wrong. Play A16 instead of B15 and you are safe. See var.]
;B[cb]

;W[aa];B[ba];W[ad];B[da];W[cf];B[de];W[df];B[ce];W[qc]C[RW> what happened to you in the corner (3 stones lost) may happen again if black now plays B14 and then A15. Lets see what happens next.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pb];W[qb];B[pa];W[pe]C[Here to, i think this could be better..

RW> no this is excellent play by white.];B[qe];W[qf];B[re]
(;W[rd]C[RW> here you need to strengthen S14. then black dies. See var.]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[pf]C[RW> this is called double attack, because black attacks two groups at the same time using one stone.]

;W[lf];B[ld];W[lc];B[nd];W[mc];B[od]C[I dont know what I try to do here ^^
But,, is a valid moves?

RW> the white N17 group is dead, unless white manages to make two eyes. but it wont be easy.]
;W[kb];B[kc];W[lb];B[jb]
(;W[nc]C[RW> see var for two eyes - but there are three vital points that white must move into before black does. These points are L19 and N19 and O18. If black manages to enter any of these three points, then white cannot make a second eye and he is dead.]
;B[nb]C[RW> now white is dead. So this was the vital point for white. See if you can make two eyes if the last white move O17 had been O18.]
;W[ma];B[oc];W[hd];B[mb];W[ql]C[He start to captre that pieces, so a get my chance and begun to influnce the botton.
But, was good stones?

RW> yes excellent move R8. In higher ranks you will learn just how far from Q4 is best. Do not worry about it at this point.]
;B[na];W[fe];B[la];W[dm]C[RW> this is a great move. while black is concentrated on the top 6 lines, white is nicely spread out. Any go player would prefer the white position at this point in the game. With this one move you have compensated for the loss of maybe 20 stones.]

;B[ok]
(;W[nk]C[This 94? Could be O8?

RW> with O8, black could sneak into your area with P8. Rule of thumb says: play where your opponent would play if it were his move. So better play P8. See var.]

;B[ii];W[hk];B[hh];W[hj];B[ih];W[gj];B[cn]C[How to prevent the two eyes, that will be formed here?

RW> just stop black like you stopped him at the bottom group N1. You are clearly winning this game.]
;W[bo];B[co];W[cp];B[bn];W[ap];B[an];W[bl];B[ao]
(;W[dn]C[RW> here you must connect white B4. It is essential. After that, black is dead. See var.]
;B[bp];W[bq];B[aq];W[ar];B[ap]
(;W[bm]C[RW> here you should play C2. then black is dead. See var.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[cq]
(;W[br]C[Yes i know, i GIVE the eyes to him...

RW> seeing that you do, what would you rather play? A good play would be white D3, because then you lock out black from the F4 area. See var.]

;W[bg];B[ae];W[ag];B[af];W[cg];B[gr];W[gq];B[eq];W[ep];B[rc]
;W[rb];B[sb];W[sc]C[RW> again white lives. great move. As you can see, S18 plus T17 are the eye that makes white live.
Go back a few moves and see for yourself what would happen if black had moved there first with black S18. Go on, just try it.]

;B[ek];W[fk];B[ej];W[ei];B[fj];W[fi]C[RW> great sequence. This sequence is called a ladder.]
;B[tt]C[So? ^^

RW> so white played a very good game. The only advice i have for you is to play a lot of games. Then you will learn about eyes, ladders etc. It is much more important to enjoy the game than to study. The joy will bring you a "feeling" for the game. By joy i do not mean winning, because then only one of you has joy. Joy is when you start "seeing" these patterns inside the game. En-joy!
