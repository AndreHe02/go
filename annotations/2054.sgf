C[emk: hi NathanA.

i hope my review can help u a little. dont take my comments toooo serious... im not a high dan player.]

(;W[pl]LB[qq:A]C[emk: nothing wrong with this move. another possibility is the joseki starting with r2 (A).]
;B[hq];W[dm]LB[cj:A]TR[hq]C[emk: right direction. maybe better to play at c10(A). with the black shimari on the top black wants to extend to arround (A). also if u play at /or arround (A) it is a good extension from your corner stone. h3 (marked stone) is not so close to your corner stone. so a wide extension looks good.]
;B[qh]LB[nc:A][cj:B]C[emk: this move by black is not very good. there is a lot of empty space arround the board. better to play at the marked spots.

this move also lacks meaning. it does not attack anything. there is not much territory to expect. it can become weak very quickly.]

(;W[qi]C[emk: attaching a stone makes both sides stronger. so if u want to attack the stone its better not to touch it.]
;B[pi];W[qj];B[qe]
(;W[ph]TR[pi]C[emk: black can sacrifice the marked stone. better to play from the other side. your q16 corner stone is lonely. not excactly weak... but weaker than the stones below. this cut only helps black.]
;B[pg];W[oh];B[qc];W[qd];B[rd]
(;W[qg]TR[pd][qd]C[emk: again... black can give u the stone without much loss. and  u make your strong stones stronger. not your weak ones (marked).

also: u can capture r12 or q11 later. so nothing to fear.];B[qf]
;W[rg];B[od]LB[pc:A]C[emk: here maybe u can fight with q16 stones. q17(a) looks like a possibility. but this is unimportend detail ^^]

(;W[pf];B[pe];W[of];B[kc]LB[cj:A]TR[ec]C[emk: the sequence starting with the attachment at r11 is a big success for black? i think so.

this move by black is small:
the black corner is alive. the marked stones are low ( this is the reson why the primary direction for followups of the shimari is the left side). so black will not get very much territory there. would play arround c10(A). but black is ahead after the sequence on the right top.]

;W[mr];B[kr];W[mp];B[or];W[no];B[eq];W[dq];B[er]C[emk: maybe try to force black in the right bottom corner a little. if u can get some big forcing moves for free... why not playing them? ^^  (variation corner)]

(;W[dj]LB[ci:A]C[emk: here c11(A) looks better for me.  (making territory).]

(;B[dh]LB[bd:B][jd:D][ee:A][ke:E][ch:C][qp:F]C[emk: here are many moves available. i cant say where to play. i just mark some spots i think about. 
i would play (D) i think =)  
(A) and (B) are probes.
(D) and (E) reducing moves.]
(;W[ef]LB[ee:A]C[emk: i think this is too mild. the vital point of the shimari on the top is e15 (A).]

;B[bc];W[ig]C[This sequence was careless of me.  I read it but not thoroughly enough and ended up investing moves and stones in a wasted effort.  Perhaps this is the turning point in the game which up till now I felt I was solidly in control of.  Perhaps H19 would have been better.

emk: yes after losing the j13 stones the game is over i think.]
