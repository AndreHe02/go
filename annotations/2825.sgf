C[Hello Matthias.  Thank you for the opportunity to review your game.  My name on KGS is Sirkut.  I 
will start all my comments with Sirkut>.

I hope you find this review helpful.  Feel free to email me or contact me through KGS if you have any questions.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dd];B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc]C[Sirkut> Good standard joseki (corner sequence) up to this point.]
;B[bc];W[bb]C[Sirkut> The last moves by both white and black were over-plays.]
;B[ci];W[co]C[Sirkut> Good exchange.];B[jd];W[jq]TR[gq][mq]
C[K3 or K4, what's the difference, and is one better than the other here?

Sirkut> K4 would get you no real teritory, just influence.  From K3 you can attach at N3 or G3 and gain solid territory.]
;B[pj];W[jn]TR[ic][cl][mq]SQ[mc][qc][qf][qn][qq]C[I wanted to build a moyo, but looking back this move seems weak.  Was there a better move here?

Sirkut> This move is not weak, but it is too fast.  It is much too early to be pushing into the center.  Unfortunately this move is what made it so hard for you for the rest of the game.  Black has claimed atleast half the board without being challenged.  Another way to think about it is that it is much easier to gain territory and the corners and sides than it is in the center.  So the marked moves would have kept you closer in score with black.  Now would also be a good time to start invading (see square moves).]
;B[gc];W[fc];B[fb];W[eb];B[gb];W[fa]C[Sirkut> This is an end-game move.  You are only saving 3 points.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[ge];W[ck]TR[ek]C[Sirkut> Good move!  From there you can run to your corner, or over the top to your wall on K.  A great follow-up move would be E9.]
;B[ep]TR[ek]C[Is there a way to kill this stone?

Sirkut> Just don't let it kill you, don't let it make eyes, and don't let it connect to a living group.  Black is being very aggressive here by hoping you won't realize how strong you are here.  E9 would make it hard for that stone to escape and make you stronger.]
;W[dm];B[eq]
(;W[dp]C[Sirkut> See variation for another idea.];B[dr];W[cr]
;B[er];W[gq]C[Sirkut> Good.];B[en];W[eo]C[Is this a bad move?

Sirkut> Yes.  I doesn't do much for you and forces black to become stronger.]
;B[fo];W[do];B[gp]TR[jn][gq][jq]C[Sirkut> Now black has good shape and white's marked stones are looking in danger.]

(;W[np]LB[hq:A][mq:B]C[Sirkut> Too weak.  A or B would have been better.  See variations.]
;B[lp]
(;W[qo]CR[np]TR[qq]C[Sirkut> Invading at R3 would be better because it could live on its own so it gives some support to O4.  Instead right now both R5 and O4 are weak and on their own.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[ro];W[oo];B[nq];W[mp];B[mq];W[lo]C[Was it poor strategy to walk along with black like this?  Is there a better way to deal with Black 41?

Sirkut> Yes, this was not a good idea.  You gave black a very large and strong corner and didn't get much yourself because the wall you are building is not facing anything you can build territory with, and you are forcing black into your territory around K3.]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[jp];W[ip];B[lq];W[hp];B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[jo]
;B[op];W[fq]C[I didn't like this.  Where's a better place to play?

Sirkut> That wasn't really a bad move because it does steal an eye.]
;B[fp];W[gm]LB[rn:1]SQ[qc][oe][jf][qh][qk][pl]C[Is this good if I played differently, or was this just a bad move altogether?

Sirkut> This move has potential, but you must be ready for a big fight.  You should be worrying about bigger things though, like putting your wall around Q5 to use or invading black's undeveloped moyo before you lose the chance.]
;B[fm];W[hm];B[gn];W[ok]C[My only chance was to wall up some center territory, but solidify Black along the edges and eventually fail getting much territory of my own.

Sirkut> You are right, with that strategy you have no hope.  Black's R2 corner is
huge and the area around B13 is big too.  But it is not true that everything from Q16 to Q10 and K16 is black's.  After all he has hardly any stones there!]
;B[pk]C[Sirkut> Remembering that it's easier to get territory on the side, take a look at the variation on the next move.]

(;W[ol];B[pm];W[om];B[qn];W[pn]C[Giving O-5 to Black to destroy my position with double atari.  I was lucky.]

(;W[hq]LB[il:B][hq:A]C[If 84. J8 atari, 85. J6, 86. F8 can Black live?  If so, I don't see how.]
;B[il]
(;W[ll]C[Sacrificing G7 and H7 to prevent Black from playing double atari at L8.

Sirkut> L8 is stronger.];B[gl];W[lr];B[mr];W[jr]TR[kr]C[Sirkut> L2 is stronger.]
;B[or];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd]TR[kc]C[Sirkut> No time to push out, you need to jump right away to L17 instead.]
;B[lc];W[nf];B[pf];W[nh]C[Sirkut> Do you see how running like this is helping black build a strong wall next to you giving him huge territory while not getting you any?]
;B[oj];W[nj];B[jk];W[kl]SQ[ke][qe][pg][dh][bi]C[Sirkut> It is not worth saving that stone.  Use any chance you can get to safely not play what black wants you to play and instead stake a claim somewhere else on the board.]
;B[ji];W[li];B[lf];W[oi];B[pi];W[bj]C[Sirkut> This is generally a good move, but you should be seeing that you are far behind in score. You need to be more aggressive to make up the points..]
;B[bi];W[ef];B[cd];W[db]C[Sirkut> Wasted move.];B[de];W[ee]
;B[df];W[gf];B[hf];W[fj];B[fk];W[hj];B[ij];W[kj];B[kk];W[lk]
;B[ki];W[mh]C[Sirkut> The last few moves for white were good because you took control of the game again.]
;B[oh]
(;W[ni]C[Sirkut> Maybe it would have been better if you let black capture this stone?  See variation.]
;B[lg];W[ng]C[Is there any hope for White?  I think Black already has it won.  Was I not aggressive enough early on?  This falling behind happens to me a lot.  Is this an openings problem I have?

Sirkut> I think you are too far behind to catch up.  You do need to think more about keeping the game balanced in the beginning.  Try and make moves that take the same amount of territory or a little more than the moves your opponent makes.  And think about invading as soon as you feel your shapes are pretty safe.  I have the same problem with invading too late! ;)]

C[Sirkut> You did not need to connect yet.  You were safe to keep pushing because if black won the ko you could have connected to the group at C9.]
;B[gj];W[ek];B[el];W[dl];B[ch];W[qc]C[Based on correct play on both sides,  can White live in this corner?

Sirkut> Yes, a 3,3 invasion can always live as long as there is not a black stone on the 3,4.  See variation.]

(;W[sd];B[rb];W[rc];B[se];W[sb];B[ra];W[qb]C[Sirkut> I think in the end this corner situation was scored wrong.  The two black stones were not removed, but white still received one point for it.  I think this is a seki, because black cannot play to caputer white, and the same goes for white, so noone should have received points.]

This always happens.  I let my opponent solidify too much territory early on and never catch up.  Is this a sign of being afraid to invade?  What play weakness results in this?

Sirkut> I hope my comments answered all of you questions.  To review, here are the couple things to think about:

1. Until you have a strong understanding of the sizes of areas, always make moving into the center your last priority and first try and gain as much in the corners as you can.  Then extend your corner groups as far into the sides as you can before pushing them into the center.

2. Get influence on as many places across the board as you can, as soon as you can.  Don't get too involved in a fight and always keep assessing whether you should keep up the fight, give up and get more from some other stronger position, or distract your opponent and take control by playing places that threaten him and he cannot ignore.

I hope you enjoyed the review.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you for submitting your game and giving me the opportunity to review it!
