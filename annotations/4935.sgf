C[That was a game between beginners. Ranked, even.

dmg: Hi, my name's Damien and I'll be your reviewer for this games. I don't know my exact ranking but I'm around 5-6k KGS.
I'll put some comments at the end of the file about both player. Hope my review will help.
I'll start all my comments with "dmg:"

The sente is when you have the initiative. That means you choose the next move.
A sente move is when your opponent needs to answer. If he does not answer then he will lose something big.
A gote move is when you have to finish the sequence. It is the contrary of a sente move.

See the first variation for shapes...]
(;B[pp]SQ[pq][qp]CR[qq]MA[oq][qo]C[dmg: Just for historical reason, we use to play on the upper-right corner in real game so it is politeness to do it on Internet game too. see http://senseis.xmp.net/?path=GoodHabits&page=PlayingTheFirstMoveInTheUpperRightCorner.
Another etiquette issues is too wish a good game/to have fun at the beginning of the game.
4-4 points are polyvalent: they are aiming more for the borders or the center than the corner. Other possibilities for starting in the corner are:
 - komoku (square). More solid than the hoshi. Aim for one border and the corner
 - San-san (circle). Very solid, get the corner directly but with less hopes for development along the side.
 - R5 and P3 (cross) does goes directly for the border and are more fighty.
Of course any other points could be good for start.];W[ec];B[dp]
;W[pd];B[qq]CR[nq][qn]MA[cd][cj][dj][jp][jq][kc][nc][nd][pf]
[pj][qf][qj]C[dmg: You already have a stones in that corner. You generally want to claim the more possible territory at the beginning. So look for bigger moves like the ones marked with a cross. 
Circles show better extension for the corner. The R3 stone overconcentrates your stones.]
;W[jd];B[po]C[dmg: Same here. Contact plays are defensive plays. Don't play them except if you are attacked and need them to protect yourself.]
;W[pj]CR[cn]C[dmg: because of black thickness in the corner Q4.  I would have gone to the other side like the circle point.]
;B[eq]C[dmg: See white has claimed nearly two borders while black has claimed only two corners.]
;W[ek]CR[cd]C[dmg: White E9 is probably too high here. I think 3rd line is better because it makes points in the corner. An other possibility is to make a shimari at C16.]
;B[co]CR[de][en][jq]C[dmg: Same here.];W[cm]CR[cd][ek]C[dmg: This is bad shape. Its also get very few territory. Try the shimari. I'll put shapes at the first variation]
;B[dn]C[dmg: This stones does not do much except reinforcing white. The white answer should be D7. Never give your opponent a "thank you" move.]
;W[em]CR[dm]C[dmg: Why not at D7 here?];B[cn]C[dmg: This is bad shape (see first variation for why)]

(;W[bm]C[dmg: This is small (see variation if white tenuki).]

;B[al]C[For this C9 is forceful... But how could W make it more expensive for B?

dmg: This is self-atari, black should have captured at B6!
W could not make it more expensive for B, B is already giving something he should not have.]
;W[ck];B[fp]CR[cd][de][jp]C[When I played this game I thought in maintain max influence in upper side (counting from Tengen). That was good?

dmg: Actually not, your stones are too heavy. Too much stones for nothing.  The circle moves are quite urgent. C16 is very big if white goes there.]
;W[hn]C[dmg: Good, but white can be more incisive and goes directly at L3]
;B[gp]SQ[cd]CR[ip]C[dmg: Black should be lighter or more incisive.]

dmg: No, R13 was good. black should die now.];B[pe];W[re]SQ[oe]
C[This was good or playing in squarte should be better? How could I response better from the extension?

dmg: Neither moves are good. S15 is contact play, P15 is too light when you can be solid without killing your hopes for killing black. I would suggest R16 (probably definitely kill black.]
;B[od]C[dmg: And because white did not extend then the hane is severe, pincing P16.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]LB[jd:4][md:3][pc:1][re:2]C[Black pressed myself, but I believe that I made good shape and was able to avoid some danger in upper right corner. That's a good vision?

Second, This has nowhere to make lives.
Third, you have better point to invade.
Fourth it does not even help to capture the three squared stones (see var).]

dmg: Who's talking? White?
White main aims would probably to kill some black stones to make a huge territory.
Black main aimes is to destroy this territory. 
Cross point for white to start may be nice then around F13 probably. Black has no space for eyes.]

dmg: What's happens here ? The game is not decided. Black can extend his wall, live and then he will win.

For both I suggest enhancing your reading skills and your shapes.
Play a lot to finds out what works, what does not.
Try to attack more lightly, always think about territory you're making when attacking.

Three principles:
  - Separe your opponent's group to make them both weak. But do not try to cut two groups that are alive/strong.
  - Construct while attacking. Do not try to kill, the kill will come later if you're opponent is too greedy
  - Think in term of sente/gote.])

[do:D][ep:C][fq:2][jd:B][kc:3][pe:A]C[Crossed stones form a tobi. It's a one space jump. It's a very solid extension, Good for escaping or making territory
The square stones form a  knight jump also called a keima. It's a good shape for attacking or making territory. In this position it's called a corner enclosure or a shimari and make a good corner.
The round stones form a kosumi, it's good for separing two groups (example 1 and 2 here). It's very strong and can get connected from both sides. It should not be connected (except for very special occasion on life and death) except if white goes to C or D then black should connect at the other side (not necessarly immediately).
The triangle stones show a cutted-tobi. It is usually very bad. If white goes at R15, you usually connects. There's a proverb, I don't know if it comes from my club or from elsewhere:
"If you are less than second dan, when someone peeps (goes at C13 for instance) a tobi, you connect (D13) without thinking. If you are second dan, when someone peeps a tobi, you think then you connect."
For the same reason. When you should not play Q16 after White plays A.

Finally, the B group form a schicho. If black goes to 3 then white can't escape (see continuation) except if you have a white stones in the way. It's important to read schichos but even strong pros got them wrong sometimes when they get very complicated.]

For example the empty triangle (1) have 7 liberties for 3 stones against 8 for the classical shape (2).
The plain triangle (3) have 6 liberties but removes two from the D9 stones.

The idiot-four (4) has 4 stones but only 8 liberties against 10 for the group 5.

6 and 7 are generally a bad shape called elephant-eye because white can goes at the triangle point and cut appart the two stones.

That's about all of basic shapes. I hope it helped.]))
