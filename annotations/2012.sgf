C[S> Hi, this is Scartol -- I was black in this game. I would have lost by 10 points or so, if I hadn't made the idiotic mistakes at the end (you'll see what I mean). Given that I felt very strong at the beginning and early chuban, I'd like to know where I went wrong, and where I should have played instead. I've made numerous comments and suggested some alternatives. Hopefully you can provide even more insight -- otherwise, I'll have to face the more agonizing fact that I already know what to do but refuse to play slowly enough to do it.


C> Heheh -- You do seem to have a better sense in review than in play, but that's true even of pros, so don't agonize over it....]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ec];W[jq];B[dj]C[S> I feel like I got an optimal
 opening setup. So how did I go so wrong?

C> It's a little early to expect black "should" beat white here; yes, black has a little more potential to develop, but if white is slow s/he's also solid...]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[S> I didn't want to let white get a double-wing formation.

c> Good reasoning, but not an absolute imperative, especially since the lower right corner is still invadable and you have your own moyo going.  The way you play, it seems at times you focus a bit more on getting to what's good for your opponent than what's good for you -- you should have more confidence in your own stones, since you play well.  

This move is fine, but I generally use the low one space for situations where I'm strong on the side of the pincering stone -- here you might want to consider a high pincer or a two space high pincer...]
;W[of];B[nd];W[rd]C[S> I've been told recently to ignore this move, as the 
corner simply isn't worth the gote.

c> Ok, but I wouldn't make a categorical rule of it.  It gives w the  chance to settle AND take the corner in sente, or makes an invasion at m17 very effective, or both.  Here the joseki would turn out ok for you, I think.]
;B[qk]C[S> So I made a base.

c>  Again ok, but it does let w get in good solidifying moves for his corner, while his upper right group is fine b/c you ignored S16.  In other words, it's defensive and puts w in control a bit.  The normal josekis would let you invade white's lower corner after settling.]
;W[qm];B[ok];W[qq];B[mp]MA[qc]LB[cn:A]C[S> Too soon? Is A better?

c> Too soon.  Play away from w's strength in the opening/early middle.  Plus, it's time to put pressure on w's group in the top right - R17 is no longer gote (w ignores at own peril), so you should take w's base with it.  Then you can complete your top while chasing them and come around to "A".  

You chose to make a base for your group on the right, so you must use that stability in order to make that have been a good decision.

This happens again later with the top group -- you want to make sure you take advantage of w's weak groups, otherwise you've been swindled.]
;W[nq];B[mq];W[gq];B[np];W[oq];B[nm]C[S> This felt solid enough.

C> Yes, a good solid move -- but gote in the early game when you *each* have an "attackable" group up top, depending on who gets there first...]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[ld];B[nf]C[S> Yes, this group is on the run, but the stability I enjoy on the right and on the bottom feel like decent compensation.

C>  But you could have had both... W could not have ignored your attacking moves up top... then you come around to the bottom if you prefer that to C6.]
;W[og];B[mg];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[cn]C[S> This also feels big. I know white 
is ahead in the power balance, but I definitely feel like I'm ahead in the 
territory balance.

C> Big, yes.  But you had a chance to attack w's heavy stones at m16,m17 first.  If you play a move around h/j16, w either has to run and help you solidify the left side (and most likely you will still get C6), or invade the side and help you take the top and center.  In general, attacking weak, heavy invading groups is a bit more urgent than taking big points.]
;W[ic];B[ff]C[C>  Kind of unusual, but not necessarily bad.  W can invade right away, however, since this move puts no direct pressure on the top.]
;W[dn]
(;B[cm]C[Seems solid but actually very submissive. The various josekis that hane at D7 would all work better here -- you could always follow with k5.

The game gets very difficult for black after this.];W[co]
(;B[go]C[S> Too deep, I know.

C>  Too soon more than too deep, but both.  This stone can definitely run -- or would have been able to if your left side were more solid.  BUT...  here D7 is much bigger -- a must. even though it is worse than the usual josekis.  Then reduce from the outside in sente (If you have D7, the difference between you getting G8 and your opponent getting it is enormous -- let alone in sente!) and  then complete your left moyo or attack the top, or both if you can.  ;-)]
;W[dm]C[Incredibly painful for black.];B[cl];W[ln];B[mn];W[gl]
;B[jo]C[S> Is there a better place to play th
is move?

This seems ok];W[ko]
(;B[jm]C[Light, yes, but too loose -- you've already invested in this invasion.    It lets white cut you off...]
;W[kp];B[lm]C[Hm.  Good to keep from getting split, but gives up g5.]
;W[in]
(;B[kn]C[Bad.  Just connect at K6 here.  You're connected, and you can bend at J7 in sente, getting a lot more influence and further restricting white.  Playing both L6 and K6 is painful.]
;W[io];B[jn];W[im]C[S> I feel like I've
 forced white to surround that stone tightly. (That is, white didn't get as
 much territory as he would have liked.)];B[jp];W[ip];B[kq]
;W[kr];B[lq];W[ir];B[dl];W[il];B[lo]LB[jf:A]C[S> I know this is unnecessary. Where should I have gone? A perhaps?

C> Yeah, this is like a "pass," and it hurt -- especially since you are now at a disadvantage in this game.  All w really has to do now is to reduce your left side and live with all his groups.   There's not much chance of your making territory anywhere else -- the play at the bottom hurt too much.  .   

To get to your question...
 
Any attacking move on the top group is big, but probably not big enough.  In principle, A is solid but a bit distant.  Distant moves are good if it is building your own moyo, but here it's not really helping you take center territory, since the white j group juts into the middle (white can also annoy with moves from the P group).  

Your only real chance is to con white into thinking your threats from the left/top are sente and letting you make more territory there.  
Maybe something like H15, a follow up, and then G10?  

If white plays calmly and just reduces without a full scale invasion, though, he probably wins.]

(;W[hf];B[fh];W[eg];B[fg]C[S> I handled this very well.. Until the end of the game, alas.

Yes, very good defense here.];W[cf];B[ch];W[ed];B[fd];W[cc]

;W[bg]
(;B[af]C[Er, good job until this.  Kind of a risky move.  The variation here looks safer (vs. variation for w's next move)]

(;W[bj]C[Bad.  C11 is a better move.];B[ci];W[bi];B[bf];W[df]
;B[ae];W[el];B[ek];W[fk];B[fj];W[fl]C[S> I feel as though I am ahead.


C> It's still close -- this bad move by white almost balances M5 -- whiite should G10.  the cut is not dangerous.]
;B[mi]C[Wrong direction.  Better to attack the top group at the same time you run your corner into the center.   Attacking the top group is still sente then you can take some points with P11 to defend the side]

;W[bo];B[am]C[Small and unnecessary.];W[an]C[Even smaller and more unnecessary!]
;B[qg];W[rf];B[pn];W[qn];B[po];W[qo];B[op]C[You don't get much here... Around K12, or even an incursion around  is much bigger.  Look at the center -- some of it can still be black's!  Don't get caught up battling for these few points just because you played here with q6. Your opponent responded -- that should be satsifying enough .]
;W[pm];B[om];W[lg];B[lh];W[kh];B[hd];W[id]C[S> Perhaps I could have done more to push in on that white area.

You are behind at this point, so a risky invasion is worth it.]

C[S> Is there a better way to attack white here? It barely lived, and I wonder if there was a way to kill it? Obviously if I had waited, perhaps I could have played here later, after more external liberties had been filled -- but then white might also have played inside, making even this much incursion impossible..

C> This is a good move! It's the best you could have done.  It's big, and better style than waiting to see if w misses it -- never play just hoping for a mistake.]

C>  Tricksy white.  Just wasting time....];B[ej];W[cj];B[di]
;W[eh];B[ef]LB[fi:A]C[S> The life mistake for white. As becomes clear, I should have connected at A. But I figured if I played here, I could keep white from fooling around any further. I didn't realize he could use the aji to live on the left.]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[bk]C[S> I thought for maybe four minutes about this next move. Obviously I chose incorrectly. Now that I look at it, I believe A13 is the correct move. Can you find a way for white to live if black starts here with A13?
--

C>  Nope, A13 would do it.  Of course, if you hadn't played A15 originally, even the way the game went w would be dead.  (you can ignore a13, answer with A9, and then throw in B14).  

S> As you can find if you finish the kos and fill dame, white still wins, even without this colossal blunder by black. However, it made my loss much greater and more painful. I'll end my comments here, as I assume you will. Thanks in advance for your assistance.

C>  Yeah, things like this always hurt.  

In this game, there's no reason w should have any real territory at the top.   Attacking the top and taking center territory would have been your best stategy even after letting white expand to J17.  Still, once that happened this became an uphill struggle for black.  

If you're not strong around your opponent, better to reduce from outside and increase your own territory.  Finding moves with dual purposes like that is of course the real trick.  

In general, you seem to play and read very well (blunder aside).  I'd say make sure you make your opponent pay for leaving weak groups, otherwise s/he gets the best  of all worlds.  Those points are more urgent than the "big" ones.
