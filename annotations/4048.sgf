AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp];W[cn]C[Hi, my name is Terence. I hope this review is useful, but i'm not sure how I'll do reviewing such a high handicap game!... I'll do my best!]

(;B[fp]C[Is this the best move for handicap games?


C5 is probably the best kind of opening in a handicap game like this. There is nothing wrong with F4, but white is left under no real pressure.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[fg];B[cg]C[this is good, preventing white from making a base, and at the same time gaining a considerable amount of territory]
;W[gf]C[white is extremely weak here, and needs lots of moves to secure himself. For thios reason I think it is too early to play such an aggressive move.]

(;B[eg]C[IS this a good move?];W[eh];B[ef]
(;W[bp];B[dh]C[Is this unnecessary?

Yes it probably was. There are other  large moves however, eg. C3. I think the move that was really unnecessary was E13.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[pn];W[nm]
(;B[op]C[This leaves your corner still vulnerable.];W[np];B[on]
;W[nn];B[co];W[fi];B[ei];W[pr]C[Because white has been able to slide into your corner it is now much easier for him to live. If you had maintained the attack on this group by preventing it from making a base, a lot of profit could be made.]
;B[fh]LB[bo:A]C[Should I make a move at A instead?];W[gh]
(;B[eh]C[This move, E12 is absolutely tiny in comparison to some of the other possibilities]
;W[qf]C[From here the game gets interesting, and pretty complicated! I'm just going to point out some simple variations and not make too many comments, they should be self explanatary.]

(;B[gi]C[i think this is small];W[of];B[nd];W[gd];B[pg];W[qg]
;B[pf];W[rd];B[he];W[ic];B[ge];W[hi];B[gj];W[ih]
(;B[hg]C[IS this a good move?

I think black is better off trying to prevent white living on the edge.]
;W[fc];B[hd];W[hc];B[fd];W[kb];B[hh];W[hj]
(;B[gg]LB[fj:A]C[should I capture at A instead? 

Capturing at A and this move are both totally unnecessary.]
;W[hk];B[ii];W[ji];B[ij];W[jh];B[bo]C[At last you played B5! This certainly was a big move.]

(;B[gl]C[Is this a good move?


Yes, but you probably should have prevented white's extension first as the variation shows.]
;W[jm];B[im];W[in];B[jn];W[kj];B[jl]C[Is this a good move?

not really, but you got away with it. White should have spotted the move at K9.]

(;W[km];B[kl];W[lm];B[lk];W[gm]
(;B[lj]C[Was this necesary?

To be honest i dont know, but i think you would have been ok without it.]
;W[bn];B[ao];W[gk];B[fl];W[fj];B[fk]
(;W[bl];B[dl]C[To tell you the truth, white really should have lived. Black's opportunity to kill had come and gne but white made some awfully bad moves.]
;W[cl];B[dm];W[do];B[cp];W[li];B[nj]C[Is this a good move?

Yes, it was fine, N11 would have been ok too];W[mi];B[nk];W[oh]

I thknk I killed white's dragon only by luck. Pls give some comments on the questions I asked and some of your own.

That was an interesting game to review. I hope my comments are of some use and if you have any questions to ask, dont hesitate to e-mail me.]
