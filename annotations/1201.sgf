C[H
i, this is a real-life game I recenty played in a tournament. Due to
byo-yomi it is not noted to the end. I tend to go for influence, but in
this game it seems even to me that it's a little too 'cosmic'. Any specific
points on where to go in a different direction would be very appreciated.
Thanks!];B[dd]C[So far, so good!
;-)];W[pp];B[dq];W[pd];B[ck];W[fc];B[fd];W[ed]TR[dj][ek][jp]
C[wow, this
feels pretty aggressive to me.  I would tend to let black make a wall here,
take some territory on the upper side, and then reduce at one or more of
the marked points soon.

See variation for a better move for black.]
(;B[ec]C[Perhaps black should answer on top to make a wall facing his
strength.  In fact he definitely should.  With the ladder broken, after
white extends black can't save both sides.

Answering the original white move with a noncontact play like white 10 to
begin with might also be a good idea for
black.];W[ee];B[fb];W[dc];B[gc]TR[dd]C[Capturing the marked stone makes
black's chinese fuseki meaningless.  This is good for
white.];W[eb];B[fc];W[cd];B[db];W[de];B[cb]C[I liked the result for me, but my opponent liked his result.

Yes, this is an interesting trade.  Black gets territory but the stone in
the middle of the left side is very much in the wrong place now.  Capturing
black's original corner stone must be good for white.];W[pj]
TR[ck]LB[ci:A][ek:B]C[This is a mistake.  Your group in the upper left is weak.
Defending weak groups is a prerequisite for trying to make a moyo.  Extend
to A, then attack black's stone if he doesn't answer locally.  If he does
answer, say at B, then you can play 20.]
(;B[nq];W[lq];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[nr];W[mo]C[Black seems to be
letting white dictate the flow of the game.];B[nd];W[pf]LB[nc:A]
C[maybe
attach at A first to try to make black overconcentrated here?]
;B[nf]LB[pc:A]C[Black can attach at A first to prevent white's attachment, I think.
31 is slow.];W[gf]LB[nc:A][og:B]C[This is small.  It would be a huge point if
white also had a moyo here.  As it is, it's awfully close to white's strong
stones, and also too close to black's strong stones.  That is, it has no
attacking or defending possibilities, only affecting territory.

As long as you're taking territory, attaching at A looks like it's worth a
lot more points.  Also B or somewhere in its neighborhood looks more like
the pivotal point where two moyos meet.];B[he]C[Black
shouldn't answer like this!  This is a huge waste of a move.  Black can
still attack at D13, and will get territory while attacking.  Defending
territory like this, so early in the game, is a huge mistake.]
;W[nc]LB[hf:A]C[I don't like playing like this but I didn't see much of an
alternative.

Funny, I've just spent the last few moves commenting on how this is a very
important point for both players.  It's almost like a double-sente point,
and it's worth about 20 points or even more (comparing what happens when
white attaches first instead of black)

It would be good for you to push along at A first for a couple moves (as
long as you can push in sente), then come back to this
point.];B[oc]TR[he][gf]C[This is an overplay for
black.];W[od];B[pc];W[qc]LB[mc:A]C[I might have been tempted to play at A
instead, but I think your move is the better one.];B[nb]
(;W[ne]C[A huge mistake, see variation.];B[md];W[me]TR[nf][pf]
C[This looks
pretty good for white! And it could have been even better if you had pulled
out the O17 stone.

 Your moyo is HUGE now, cutting off that key black stone.  The marked
exchange looks AWFUL for black now.  And the amount of the corner you gave
up in return is not much more than if black had attached first.  White
should be winning this game so far.  Black has about 30 points upper side,
10 points lower right, call it 5-10 points lower left for two stones worth.
White, meanwhile, has a moyo.  If you figure half of the moyo turns into
territory ... hm, it's actually a reasonably close game if you go by that
assumption.];B[ld];W[le];B[kd];W[nj]LB[kj:A][jf:B][do:C][ci:D]
TR[ck]C[This move is too tight.  You are very
strong above and below, so make a bigger move, like around A, if you're
going to enclose a moyo.  B also looks good.  C is also tempting to me;
perhaps that can be handled to either attack the marked black stone or to
increase your moyo.  It's certainly a riskier strategy.  A move at A seems
more like your style.

But D is really the most important point.  Defending your weak groups is
the crucial thing to do first, before making a moyo or
attacking.];B[qb];W[do]C[Probably I should
have answered Black's move, it cost me quite a bit later.

Yes, black's move looks like sente.  Maybe you can double-hane, though,
because of the double-atari threat that follows it.  I'm pleased that you
chose my move "C" though!  Good fighting spirit.  Maybe not quite the right
timing.];B[co];W[cn]C[That black stone above sure looks weak now!  But really you should
still be extending to C11 first, before starting this fight
below.];B[cp];W[fn];B[ch]C[and now the weakness of the stones above means
that your attack isn't so powerful.];W[eh]TR[nj]C[This move doesn't have
much attacking force, only moyo-making.  I'm sure you wish that the marked
stone was two or three lines higher now!];B[bf]C[black takes territory
easily here.  Can you compensate for that with your moyo?];W[ek]
C[Well, it
just so happened that I played on the fifth line, but I think it also
helped my groups.

Yes, your group in the lower left is a bit thin, so this helps that group
and also develops your moyo, a good combination.  I think black should have
played there instead of the second-line slide.  Since black has territory
in all four corners, if he can reduce your moyo he will win easily.

You have gotten thickness but you have no real targets to
attack!];B[ke];W[lg]C[A good solid answer.];B[io]C[A vague move.  What is
black trying to do?  Coming in at the top, where he's strong already, would
be easier.  Or just take your corner stone now.]
(;W[fq]LB[ko:A]C[Choosing to attack and chase black INTO your moyo.  Can you kill
black?  If not, where are you going to gain territory by attacking him?
Perhaps a better answer would be around A.  This covers your weak point
there, and if black jumps up, you can just jump too, and make your moyo
invincible.];B[ko];W[lo];B[kn];W[iq]C[I can play on the third line,
too :-).

Yes, but this is not the time for it!  You are gaining no territory and
chasing black right into the middle of your big moyo.  This is not the way
to cash in on that big structure.];B[jl];W[ml];B[qd];W[mg]TR[cn]
[do][fn]C[I missed the
threats behind the Black move, very painful.

Yes, black gains a HUGE amount here.  The tenuki earlier wasn't worth it.
You didn't really gain much by playing the marked stones unless you can
kill the center group.];B[rc];W[jj]C[Now you are trying to kill this center group?  Instead, take
territory.  Your moyo is almost destroyed already, though, so perhaps you
are hoping to win the game by killing this group?  Letting black take the
corner is very bad for
you.];B[go];W[fo];B[gp];W[gq];B[hm];W[hk];B[hl];W[gk];B[gn]
C[You are
playing very solidly here, as though you are going to win.  Are you really
ahead?  Black has 10 points lower left corner, 10 points lower right
corner, a few points on the left side, and 40 or so on the upper side,
60ish total.  You have 40 or so on your big right side, 10 or so at the
bottom.  So you are a bit behind.  You have to make up the difference by
finding a target to attack.];W[dm]LB[bn:A]C[Why this move?  Black's corner is weak, but can't you simply attack
it straightforwardly at A instead if that's your goal?  Probably there's
some cutting aji here for black, but if you kill the corner, who cares?
The center group is already
alive.];B[ll];W[mm];B[lk];W[bn];B[er];W[fr];B[bo];W[bj];B[bi]
C[This
is a good way to use your thickness.  Black says ouch, but again, you seem
to be staking the game on actually killing this group.];W[cj]

;B[bg];W[ak];B[ai];W[hf]LB[rf:A]TR[gq][iq][fr]C[Later Black destroyed quite some by
jumping to 'A'. Though for quite some time I had the impression that I
completely outplayed my opponent I just had not enough points in the end.
Thanks for any help!

My feeling is that you were indeed outplaying your opponent for most of the
game.  The turning point was in how you attacked the black reducing move.
If black invades deeply, by all means, attack.  A shallow reducing move
should be answered on the other side, not chased deeper into your moyo,
unless you think you're going to kill it.  The failure to answer all of
black's moves in the upper right corner was a problem, too; that could
have been a white corner, but instead it ended up not only black but also
undermining your moyo in a big way.

The marked stones at the bottom don't serve much purpose.  They don't take
territory and they chase black toward your moyo instead of away from it.

Thanks for the interesting game!])

Eventually black will have to take gote to try to link up to his lower left
corner.]))
