;B[pd]C[Ankh: Hello, I'll be your reviewer for this game. Comments in the  game will be preceded by my name., though I can't say the same for my  variations. Speaking of which, beware !>) I've shown a tendancy to not win  any of my recent games without having a direct kill, and my training in  theory is informal at best. Though I'll hopefully not be effected much by  these factors in giving my review, feel free to take it with the usual grain  of salt.]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[dq]C[Already I don't really know what to do next, or the meanings of the  occupied points.

Ok, the 4-4 is regarded as a fast opening stone, in the sense that it  usually leads to stuff like the classic kakari-leap-leap (such as 1. q16 r14  2. o16 q10 3. [tenuki\]), and in general, is a quickly developing,  larger-scale influence move.
The 4-3 is slightly lower and slightly more assymetric in the development;  the corner is left much more closed, but the stone is lower and has a  preffered direction for development.
That direction is...(we can always guess) to the side which has bigger  prospects for development; the side that the stone is `4` high upon.
I'll also give a little thought on what I think of the game so far.
Not much; this is usually the stage where I mostly just 'spread the stones'   as per the proverb (and try not to get a group in trouble). Here, though, I  would probably consider playing in any of the points on the board given in  the variations, though this is not meant to give the impression that your  shimari is at all. You could also find out far more about fuseki such as the  chinese opening at a good go site or in a book.]

(;B[ec]C[I intended to play c11 next, to secure some territory. perhaps here  I should have attacked a bottom corner?

Ankh: As indicated in the 'fuseki idea' variations, I personally like to  begin more 'open' configuration. This, though, again works just fine]
;W[cj]
(;B[ch];W[cn]C[Should I have played c6 last move?

Ankh: Maybe, but I wouldn't prefer it, as that seems to be playing into  white's clutches. I give a possible alternative around your idea.]
;B[pj]C[just trying to make a moyo, would r10 have been better? or q6?

Ankh: I like q6 of what you mentioned, with the other o3 also being viable.  Be careful with larg moyos; it is hard to close them off quickly enough,  and, if you are investing in the top, note that at the moment the edge is  free to invasion. A good rule is to not build the mansion's roof before the  foundation is done]
;W[pn];B[jq]C[Ankh: something like this is now strategically necessary, but  white's attack makes big profit while your stone has to stay low. This could  be the 'reason' why q10 was maybe not so great.]
;W[mq]C[Ankh: The corner is still quite open, though. Invade it when the  time is right. Similarly, the left has weaknesses at c4, c8 which you might  use.]
;B[gq]C[Ankh This is what I don't like, though, your invasion seems to  fizzle somewhat, not making much profit and ending in gote. You will have to  build the top now, but don't let white get the slide under your right too  much without compensation: the side is big territory, so it is in your  interests to have it.]
;W[qf]C[white seperated my stones and i didn't even notice. at the time. i  saw this as a threat to keep the q16 stone from reaching the center]
;B[me]C[i would have played q14

Ankh: that would be better. This stone could have a hard go of it anyway as  your moyo has no top or bottom, white should be happy to sneak above and  settle on the top, then neutralize much of the center]
;W[qi];B[pi]C[i thought maybe it's not to late to connect q10 to the top

Ankh: Probably not a good idea. the side is too big and the rest of your  claims too open. r10 would be a biggish sente-ish point for white now.  Similarly, occupying r10 will deny white the move, but also (sente,  possibly?) weaken the white group and make way for a deep undercut in  white's corner. Of course, the invasion is still there, and getting more and  more tantalizing with time...]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[of];B[ne];W[qd];B[mi]C[still trying to connect, or at least make something of q10

Ankh: good idea: this seems nice.];W[pc];B[od];W[kc];B[oc]C[trying to separate q17 & l17

Ankh: that's what you have to do, good thought.];W[gc]C[white strengthens l17 and threatens my corner]

(;B[mc]C[to prevent the "eye-stealing tesuji" i read about somewhere, & put  pressure on l17. white's 3-gap looks too big,  could i take advantage?

Ankh: eek. This doesn't seem fun for black, as now your territorial  prospects are slimmer. Maybe you could have tried jumping in at j17 to  split. 'the eye steal` wouldn't matter much if the one split group got one  (possibly only) eye and you got fights with two groups. Also, you shouldn't  be worrying too much about your group as r17 lives and n13 connects]
;W[ed];B[dd];W[ee];B[df];W[je];B[jo]C[reaching towards the center here, maybe i'll eventually surround one  of the bottom corner groups
Ankh: Invading the corner is very big. ~r10 is nice. This is probably too  small since white doesn't have much in the way of immediate territorial  prospects that are reduced by this move, and your base is pretty stable in  its little pasture.]
;W[ph];B[ng];W[qj]C[Ankh: big and easy for white];B[pl]C[building a wall

Ankh: walls are not good in and of themselves, but should have strategic  justification. Will your wall promise profit? Consider invading one point  lower at r8. Reductions are worth something, too.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[ql]C[Ankh: This is close to enough for white to easily win, especially if  black doesn't invade.]
;B[jm]C[Ankh: not worth much. invade. Note that n6 ore n7 seem to build  bigger prospects, and reduce whites potential gain in that subregion. You  could also consider playing something like c8 and fighting along the side]
;W[fp]C[don't want white to cut across on the 4th line];B[gp]
;W[fo];B[hn]C[for whatever reason, continuing w/ g5 seemed like a bad idea

Ankh: really, really small, yes. invade!];W[dh];B[dg]C[it looks like my corners are the ones being surrounded. come to  think of it i only have one corner.]
;W[eh];B[ef];W[fc];B[ge]C[another one of those "eye-stealing tesujis". maybe i can take some  of these stones on the upper left]
;W[ff];B[fg]C[trying to keep the upper left stones isolated]
;W[fh]
(;B[gf];W[fe];B[gh]C[builing a center-facing wall

Ankh: territory is needed here. Note that white has another huge move at  around f9 now, too.]
;W[eg];B[gg];W[eb];B[dc];W[id];B[jg]C[keeping k15 from the center

Ankh: and stabilizing your isolated, eyeless wall. This is why its not  necessarily good to play walls for their sake alone; but still, you can next  make a pile in the center at ~g8. also, imagine no h6, but  a simple n7  instead: seems much bigger.]
;W[ci];B[bh]C[Ankh: This seems small compared to what's up for grabs. Take ~g9 and  ruduce white/expand black (a winning combination, by any standard).]

C[maybe i can capture the 7 stones here];W[hd];B[gd];W[hb];B[fb]
C[maybe i can capture d18 & e18

Ankh: Desperate moves; you really can't, unless your opponent messes up  badly.]
;W[ic];B[cb];W[gb]C[guess not];B[if];W[lo];B[lm]C[keeping white out of the center]
;W[pm];B[pg]C[clamp on q12 & peep on q14];W[pf];B[qh]C[expanding my center territory a bit, maybe seperating white stones,  aiming to capture q12]
;W[oh];B[og];W[qg];B[rh];W[rg];B[ni];W[ri];B[nm];W[no];B[fk]
C[maybe i'll capture these 7 or 9 stones on the left here

Ankh: I've sort of toned down the general refrain, but, as I see that you  notice later, the corner is huge. And again, this is a pretty big maybe.  Don't rely on you opponent's mistakes, especially if you see how to avoid  them (unless maybe you are playing in a lightning/9 handicap game.)]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[dj]C[Ankh: At least you get a pretty wide inroad into white territory.
Corner!];B[dk]C[only 3 liberties for the white group! wait make that 5...]
;W[ck];B[cl];W[dl];B[cm];W[el];B[gl]C[otherwise g9 kills d9-f9

Ankh: good to not look that over. Oddly enough, you can check that the  corner is still worth a bit more.]
;W[fl];B[gk];W[bn];B[bm]C[maybe i can save these 3 stones by connecting to b12

Ankh: but probably not.. look corefully for coertainties.];W[dm]
;B[al];W[bk];B[ak];W[bl];B[er]C[getting toward the end of the game, this move is to reduce white's  corner a bit]

;W[rb];B[rd];W[qe];B[on]C[Ankh: overplay];W[om];B[ol];W[nn]
;B[mm];W[kf]C[white got sente

Ankh: and again, the corner will continue to be big until whiet takes it. I  guess I'll end commentary here. On the whole, you have a very strong grasp  of the game for your rank, but on the whole should focus more on making  territory, or actively controlling the game and making territory from that.  However, you do seem to have a good idea (especially in the later game  comments, as to some of your mistakes, which is very good. Your main problem  seems to came from playing too small too often, in my opinion, and if you  get past that, I strongly expect that you'll see a marked improvement in  your game. On the whole, this was very interesting, and a worthwhile game to  examine. Thanks for submitting a review!]
;B[kg];W[lf];B[mf];W[lg];B[ki]C[white is extending from the top to the center anyway! l12 should put  a cap on that intrusion.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[kq];B[kp];W[lp];B[gn]C[i should play r3 and take that corner, but first i'll threaten to  take something on the lower left w/ g6 (what a mistake)]
;W[eq];B[fs];W[pq]C[oops];B[fn];W[en]C[looks like my threat was almost meaningless]
;B[go];W[ca]C[once again, i can't seem to keep sente];B[ba]
;W[fa];B[da];W[ks];B[kd]C[maybe i'll find a way to cut around k15, but at any rate, i'm taking  a little territory, and hopefully i'll play l18 next]
;W[kb];B[ld];W[jd];B[lb];W[ka];B[js]C[k1 seems more important than m19 or m17?]
;W[sh];B[oi];W[bi];B[ah];W[la];B[ma];W[lc];B[mb];W[ko]C[white does a good job of keeping sente, perhaps because he plays on  bigger points?]

It seems that in general I have trouble minimizing invasions into my  territory.

Here my opponent was playing the biggest moves before me during middlegame  and endgame, and probably the fuseki too, since i don't know about fuseki  yet.

Ankh: Ooh, I'll raise my head again. Yes, very good call! Try to actively  raise the question of bigness in your games (but remember that size is  subordinate to urgency).]

(;B[ic]C[The low chinese.])
(;B[id]C[The high chinese. Both chinese openings plan to invest in a  moyo along the side, so that, at some point, the opposition must invade too  avaid falling behind. In the process, black will hope to use friendly stones  to attack the intruders and extract territorial profit. As you would expect,  the high chinese, being higher, is more influence-oriented than the low,  which more easily secures solid territory. I find that the low version seems  more often played.]
)
(;B[do]C[I've been told that the white d3 stone is misdirected because
a) it looks initially to develop on the side that is smaller, and, in this  case, probably more so because of the low position of black's c16; low  positions will often have lesser prospects for territory.
b) approach moves like this, if white is not careful, can easily lead him to  a low position on the bottom, which, would be more inneficient.
In reality though, I think that the opening is fine, but why not make things  more difficult for your opponent? If white does or does not pincer, this  could a good place to have a stone; I heard once that kakaris on the 4-3  could be thought of as the next-biggest thing to corner occupation (as is a  shimari). So this is another option. Also, if you could somehow arrange to  extend to around  d9, then that is not only an extension off two positions  (loosely speaking), but it makes forming a shimari very inviting, and white  will be in some way 'forced' to play near your allies. In any case, this is  another possibility.]

(;B[co]C[Sort of a similar story as the previous, but this is much  lower and territory-oriented as an approach.]
)
(;B[qn]C[Simple approaches like this are almost always reasonable.
Again though, don't take this as dogma; your shimari is good, but this is  just to give an idea on how I think about the opening; it is very important,  at some point, to spread those stones about the board. Otherwise, you'll  likely fall behind if you are not careful.]
