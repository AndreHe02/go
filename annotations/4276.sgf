C[Lunch game.  Approx. 45 minutes total.

SC: I will place my initials before my comments to make them easier to identify.]
;B[cg]C[SC: 9x9 games are good for practicing tactics like contact fights, but they miss all of the "big picture" strategy of a 19x19 game.
Most 9x9 games, in my experience, involve trying to run a wall through the middle of the board so that your half is slightly larger; and preventing any successful invasions behind your wall.]
;W[gc];B[dc];W[fg]C[SC: The "opening game" is now over for a board this size.  This next move will be an important one for black as it will set the tone for the rest of the game.  Black can attack a white stone, invade, of just play a calm move like E5.  All of these are reasonable options, as long as black knows how to follow through with the plan.]
;B[fc]C[I attack, hoping the battle gives me some strength in the middle.

SC:  The middle is not worth much as territory even in a larger board game. Here, you don't want to waste any time trying to make territory in the center.  Running a wall through the middle is good, but not trying to surround the middle.
As an exercise, imagine that black has a solid line of stones all along the second line.  It would start at B2, go up to B8, then over to H8, down to H2 and finally back to B2.  Now imagine white has a similar wall on the third line, just inside black's stones, surrounding the center. Black's only territory would be on the first line while white has the entire center.  When counted, black would have 32 points and white only 25.  The point of the exercise is to emphasize how much more important it is to make territory on the sides than in the middle.
This move isn't a bad move, I am just using it as a stepping stone to teach a lesson.]
;W[fd];B[ed];W[fb]
(;B[ec]SQ[ed][dc]C[SC: You don't have to save every stone.  You should sacrifice the stone at F7 if you can gain something else worth more in exchange.
This move makes an empty triangle (the marked stones).  Almost always, making an empty triangle is not the best move.  The only major exception is when you are making eyes to save a threatened group of stones.
See the variation for one alternative.];W[fe]C[Since I have momentum, I decide to force a move on the top while I have a chance.]
;B[eb]
(;W[ga]C[SC: See variation.];B[ee]C[Now, I went back in the middle to extend the border.]
;W[ef];B[df]C[Unfortunately, he is able to push it to the side...]
;W[eh];B[dh];W[di];B[ci];W[ei]C[I see a nasty Ko at 3D and 3E; Whoever goes first loses.  So, I try to attack.

SC: Black has 1 more point of territory on the board, which means white wins when the komi is added.  If you are behind, then attacking is good.  Don't attack if you are winning, however.  Just secure what you have.]
;B[gd];W[ge];B[hd];W[hc]C[He's keeping me from the corner.  I see the end for my black attack, but perhaps I can play elsewhere, gaining an extra move somewhere.]
;B[ea];W[he]C[If he had went F9, I could have possibly taken all of the stones in the corner, by keeping him in Atari. So, by capturing my invading force, that possibility is gone.

SC: White played 3 stones around G6 while black played only 2. This changes the final score 1 point in black's favor.]
;B[fa]C[However, I'll force him to defend and reduce his territory by one.]
;W[gb]C[SC: Forcing white to connect here changes the score by 1 point in black's favor.  Now black has 3 more points on the board. Black is still behind once komi is added, however.  So, more attacking is a reasonable plan.]
;B[gg]C[Another haphazard attack...

SC: I don't really see a better place to attack.  At this point, white would have to make an error for any black attack to succeed. In a double digit kyu game, this is worth hoping for.  Against a more skilled opponent, this sort of attack is merely annoying and insulting.]
;W[gh];B[hg];W[hh]C[Which doesn't look like it's going anywhere...
At this point, I am losing by 0.5. (we use 3.5 komi)  However, my opponent mentions that he is losing by 0.5 (actually, his count was off), so I hope I can get him to place an extra stone in my territory.  At any rate, I see nothing that I can do.

SC: I don't see any other good moves for black.  Black will need to connect at D3 eventually, so I would do that now and end the game when white responds at E3.]
;B[tt];W[eg];B[dg]C[I must now connect.];W[bh]C[SC: The game should be over, but white's mis-counting provides an opportunity for black.]
;B[ch];W[ce]C[Now or never!
I decide to pass, to get his extra stone.

SC: Passing now is somewhat risky, but you can't be sure how long white will keep adding stones in this area.  Also, since white is winning at this point, black should be taking some risks.]
;B[tt];W[cf];B[de];W[bg]TR[bi][ah]SQ[af]C[It looks like he's preparing to make eyes.  I must stop him!
But can I do it?

SC: Black needs to keep white's group small to reduce the amount of space for making eyes.  Since white needs 2 eyes to live, white's eye space needs to be divided in two.  A4 (the square) is probably going to be the best place for this.  This means that black would like to play on this space before white does. White can also divide his eye space into two parts by playing at both triangles.  So black would also like to play on at least one of these before white does.]
;B[bd]C[I wanted to stop him from extending this area...

SC: Good.];W[cd]C[Now, if I go C7, he will force me to defend (B5), and get the extra move he needs to ensure survival.. Since it doesn't matter how many of his stones are in my territory, I will extend, and connect later!]
;B[bc];W[be];B[af]C[Not so fast!

SC: Good.];W[ae];B[bi]C[If he went here, I'd be in trouble.

SC: Now white can only make 1 eye around A4.];W[cc];B[cb];W[ad]
;B[bb]C[If I went A7, he'd capture those three.  But this gives me enough liberties to prevent his attack.]
;W[ah];B[ac]C[Stop him from invading further..

SC: Since black is winning now, this move isn't bad. You could pass at this time, however.  Even if white plays A7, he still only has 1 eye and you could just block at A8.]
;W[tt];B[tt]C[And that's the end of the game!  I win by 0.5 points!
You had asked about a rating.  That can't really be figured based on just one game. But since you asked, I will say 20-23 kyu.]
)
(;W[df]C[SC: Be careful with "forcing moves" since your opponent may not agree with your definition of "forcing".  If black plays at G8 before white does, the final score changes by about 6 points in black's favor.  Depending on how the game is played out, the white stone at D4 could very well gain more than 6 points for white.  Also, black will probably not play G8 next turn since defending around C4 is suddenly more important.  White might still get to play at G8 later in the game.]
))
(;B[fe]C[SC: Black responds indirectly to the Atari by playing Atari on a white stone.]
;W[ec]C[SC: White could just connect at G6.  Black could then settle the top side stones by playing something like D8, since this prevents the ko that would be produced if Black plays on E8.]
;B[gd];W[fc]C[SC: Now white is making the empty triangles, which is good for black.]
;B[ee]C[SC: Black needs to fix a cutting point.  Black is also sacrificing the stone at G6]
;W[ge]TR[dd]C[SC: If white tries to cut at the triangle, the cutting stones die when the resulting ladder hits the black stone at C3.]
;B[gf];W[hd];B[gg]TR[gf]SQ[fg]C[SC: The white stone at F3 is now in trouble.  This stone has fewer liberties than black's marked two stone group, so white would probably lose a capture race.   White doesn't have room to make two eyes on the lower side because of the black stone at C3.]
