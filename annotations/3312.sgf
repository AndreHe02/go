;B[od]TR[pd]SQ[qd]C[Plenoptic [24k\]: hi
reviewer: not a standard opening - quite bold. triangle or square are potentially safer and easier to handle.]
;W[pp]C[stm31415 [?\]: hey];B[dd];W[dp]LB[kc:A]C[blk 3 with 1 could suggest your next move is A, going for a mini chinese]
;B[pe]LB[qe:B][kc:C][jc:D][dn:E]C[5 is very close to 1 , B, C oe D could be better if you wish to focus on territory. If you wish to use the direction of play then E would be possible.]
;W[jp]C[Observer white has san ren sai and a good moyo / framework]
;B[jd];W[dj];B[pj]C[A calm opening, but by trying a little more strength/influence in the upper right, I lose sente and white takes the center. Then, he sneaks behind the upper right at the end anyway. Am I trying for too much outward influece? Should I back off to 4-3/3-4 or even 3-3?
REVIEW: at this stage you have the same influence as black, but have used one more stone, 1 and 5 now look over concentrated.]
;W[jj]C[white has built a big moyo - don't be intimidated, moyo isn't area.]

;B[mn]LB[mj:h][jm:i]C[what does 23 gain? h is poised to allow and attack and opush into "i"]
;W[no];B[ml]C[25 is slow - your stones are very connected but not efficient in gaining territory.]
;W[ln];B[mm];W[qn]C[28 is the evidence that your exchange through to white 18 gave up the corner. White is now harvesting you contact play]

count liberties and read out the ladder.];W[ro];B[ri]C[Is there a way to win back a little more of this strip, or is is more secure than it looks?]
;W[si];B[sh];W[sj];B[rh];W[qg]LB[qe:B1]C[OK, here comes my major question. This is a real pain, when I have to kill these little stones played, almost always fulilty, in my terriroy. Is there a good way fo doing it efficiently? and how, exactly, do I select a good place to invade my opponent. I mean, I am winning at this point, by 10 or so points-- but then he lets me clog up my territory chasing his stones, and I feel somehow impolite doing it to him. And when I do, it seems as though I lose as many stones as I gain, making the whole thing pointless. So what si the strategy here? What do I look for, and what does he?

White 208 can't live. If white plays in "your" territory, and you play, the score is not affected: the capture goes into his territory at the end and counterbalances the one point loss of area you incur from playing a stone in "your own area".
Here you could respond at B1 or one point nearer the side.]
;B[qf]C[contact play will help white cross cut, in this case its all futile and you have too much strength around.]

He appears not to understand eyes.];B[lf]C[Was this the way to deal with this? Or should I have headed for P14?]
;W[oc];B[of];W[mf];B[ob];W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[lf]C[I should have played R19 to keep O18/Q18 from life? Again, that big group made me nervous, and I wanted it gone.]

The lesson is think and practice corner invasions. The standard joseki would have seen you "more or less ok" - however predicting white's moves isn't easy he did some odd things.]

Loss by 29.5. Ouch. What happened to that 10 pt lead? My only invasion lost as many stones as it clogged spaces. Also, I loked at splitting a R4, but that would have failed, yes?]
