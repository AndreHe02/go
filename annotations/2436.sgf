C[Hy, I am white (EmptyMind) and my name is Eric.
I'd like you to comment this game and tell me:

1-Where did I miss the big points
2-Where was I to fierce/careless
3-Anything you see that I could change to improve my go

I will also ask questions as the game goes on

Thank you for your time
=======================
Hi. This is James Raitsev, jraitsev2 on KGS. All coments hereafter will be preceded by JR:]
;B[pd];W[dc]LB[dc:B][ce:A]C[JR: Just FYI, although B is a bit unuaul it is better than A, because black B is better in relationship to Q16 than A]
;B[pq]LB[qj:A][qo:B]C[JR: Here you should be aware that B setup what may become a chinese opening - (one more B stone at A is needed), so you may want to spoil B's plans by playing A or B, HOWERER your responce is fine too.

Taking an empty corner is always preferable to fighting this early in the game.]

(;W[dp];B[np]LB[ce:A][pj:C][qk:B][fq:D]C[JR: bad move by B

Alternative (better) moves are shown];W[qj]C[Good or bad invasion?

JR: Excellent idea]
(;B[fp]LB[ce:A]C[JR: they say you can learn a lot about opponent's attitude by watching him play. Here B ignores your invasion and sets up a breeding environment for himself. B is correct here, although i would prefer A to marked stone]

(;W[eq]LB[iq:A]C[JR: Bad
this is way too timid. what you are telling him is that it is ok for him to take the BIG side while you will settle for small corner

You should pincer here at A];B[fq]
(;W[jq]LB[qj:A][jq:B]C[too early? D7 instead?

JR: conceptually your idea is correct. but

a) by making this move (B) you are creating second weak group and this is not good. moreover black is strong all around so ... not that it is too early - this move is just bad.

b) D7 is not great either. see variations]
(;B[jp]LB[jp:A][jq:B]C[JR: relative to A, your move (B) is great :)]

(;W[mq]C[JR: this is too far of an extension for exact reason you'll see later]
;B[kq]C[JR: correct move by B];W[kp]C[This is also correct - play lightly]
;B[iq]
(;W[kr];B[jr];W[lq];B[lp]
(;W[jq]C[JR: this feels like a mistake to me for some reason. i am not sure what the best play here might be except you must be ready to sacrifise and play lightly

i spend considerable amount of time on this part here and can not come up with something that is 100% correct. overall i think this play was fine, just be aware of above (play lightly and be ready to lose some stones)]
;B[ko];W[kq];B[ir]
(;W[mp];B[lo];W[mo];B[no];W[mn]C[was this a good way of getting out?

JR: good]
(;B[dn]
(;W[jo]TR[dp][eq]C[now this is not good because

a) you CAN run and your group is not in ammediate danger

b) you have only 2 stones in the corner, so B can severely attack you.]
;B[ip];W[kn];B[eo]
(;W[co]C[Could you show me some variations on how to make this group (left bottom) live? Later in the game, i lost it, losing the game also.]

JR: 2-3 moves ago :)]

TR[di][ck][cl]C[JR: look what you;ve done
you allowed and encounraged B to setup a base
+ 
your own stones are floating in the air - needless to say - not great
+
now your corner does not look all that strong , B may attack at A]
;W[fj];B[fl]LB[fl:B][em:A]C[generally B is not good because of A, but here it's ok]
;W[ci];B[bi];W[ei];B[dh];W[eh];B[jn];W[ln];B[io]
(;W[jm]LB[ch:A]C[Was this big?
Now that i think about it, should i have played around K16?

JR: no no no!!!
if he wants it so bad he can have it

K16 is certainly good, but judging from your playing style i would choose A

comment on "your playing style" - you seem to make good terr claims but don't support them well]
;B[qg];W[qm];B[jc];W[po]C[good !];B[qp]
(;W[qo]C[JR: too timid - considering B got so much on top];B[fc]
LB[qo:A]C[JR: This is where you lost the game

all because of A, B was able to 

a) ignore it
b) take the initiative to his hands]
(;W[ed]C[nope :)];B[fd];W[qc]C[good timing];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]
;W[re];B[rf];W[pb];B[ob]C[i looked couple moves ahead and have few suggestions about corner enclosures

OK so far]
(;W[qb];B[oc]
(;W[sd]C[JR: with this move you certainly will live, but it is not the best]
;B[rb]C[B is dreaming]
(;W[ra];B[pa];W[rc];B[jf]LB[ld:A][fe:C][ge:B][ch:E][jj:G][nj:F]
[op:D]C[My lack of playing at K16 and my corner invasion cost me the upper part of the board. What is wrong, where should I play now?

JR: B is strong on top - no argument there so the way you should think about this is:

a) can i kill him or reduce on top?
b) if not, can i take someequally big peace elsewhere?
c) should i resign?

in your case C) is not an option, but A) and B) should be considered.  it is very hard to pin point an exactl move to make, but i would suggest A B C locally and DEF whole board wise

A and B - redusing moves - don't hope to live - just dive and run
C is also redusing move but with much less risk

Already talked about DE, but F is similar to K14 - strong bold and "come catch me if you can" kind of move.

a note on G - i don't think it would be good here - it seems to lack the purpose]
;W[nq]C[way too small];B[jj]C[JR: note to self - B is a bully and how do we deal with bullies?]

(;W[nh]C[not like this.

B is strong and making itself  stronger - 

W has much potential but is much weaker than B overall];B[pi]

(;B[ni];W[mi];B[oi]TR[nh][mi][ni][nj]C[if you see something like this you should know that:

a) you can not connect everywhere, so pick side

b) this is a start of a running battle, so check whether you can survive on the first place]
;W[li]LB[mh:A][mj:B]C[this is not good

where would b cut?

only at A of course]
(;B[mj]LB[jf:C][mh:A][mj:B]TR[nh][li][mi][nj]SQ[jm][kn][ln]
[mn]C[wow. i guess it is not obvious to everyone ... let me explain why N10 is bad.

marked stones make a ladder shape

A and B are cutting points.

if B goes through A, he will live because of C

If B goes thtough B, he will die because of stones marked qith squares]

JR: 

a) play A and he will resign :)
b) because of the marked wall W is looking very nice
c) A and C are great moves to make as soon as possible

W is clearly winning up to this point by al least 25-35 points.]

JR: overall i think  this was a good game and you certainly played well. i think improving opening would be very valuable for you as well as paying more attention to life and death problems. some general suggestions are below:

#1. don't be afraid
#2. play simple solid moves, they will do more right than wrong.
#3. keep on playing])
