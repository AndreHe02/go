C[matesmat [?\]: hi
yeladim [-\]: Hi

I use the following terms in this review,
Gote: Opposite of sente. A move which your oppopent does not have to respond to.

Sente: A situation where you or your oppopent can play away.

Yose: Ending game moves.

I hope you find this review helpful please note I didn't play many 9x9 games so this advice may not be sound and always correct. All my comments are marked with Mark:]
;B[cc];W[ee]C[This isn't the best beginning no?
Mark: Correct. This play is not standard. Taking a corner at G3 or G7 or C3 would have been much better.]
;B[gg];W[eg];B[fh]C[Mark: Good move, solidifies the corner and attacks the base of E3.]
;W[fg]
(;B[gh]C[Did I do a good move?
Mark: This move does guard the cut point. Look at the sequence if you didn't play it.]
;W[ef]C[Mark: No purpose to this move. Black cannot white there basically a gote move with no purpose.]
;B[cg]C[Mark: You took a large point on the board but I would have taken other corner to play away from white's strength.]

(;W[dg]C[Mark: Bad response for white. Should have played B4]
;B[ce]C[Mark: Nice solid play. Strengthens both corners.];W[cf]
;B[bf];W[df];B[ed]TR[bg]C[Mark: Too greedy. Black cannot capture this group due to the marked cut point.]
;W[bg];B[ch];W[be]
(;B[cd]C[Mark: Wrong response. White doesn't need to play anymore and it ends in his sente. See other moves.]
;W[af]C[Mark: White did not need to play this right away. Gote move.]
;B[bd];W[ae]
(;B[ad]C[Mark: Bad move, It is yose move and it saves one point of terrority. D2 much bigger.]
;W[dh];B[ci]C[Mark: Black cannot save these three stones. Just adding more for white to kill should save for Ko threat.]
;W[di];B[de]C[Mark: Yose move, Only saves one point. G7 and G5 are much larger moves.]
;W[bh]C[Mark: Not needed by white. Waste of a move.];B[fe];W[bi]
C[Mark: Another waste of a move. After whites opening errors and this victory should be certain for black.]
;B[ff];W[ge];B[gd];W[gf];B[fd];W[he];B[hf]C[This is a bad movement, no?
Mark: Correct, This is a very bad move due to the fact it allows white to easily secure an eye which is bad for black when fighting a life and death situation. Black can still salvage the situation with the correct move shown in sequence.]
;W[hg]
(;B[ie]C[and this too, isn't true?];W[if]
(;B[id]C[Mark: Very bad move even running along the edge white can still capture you. You are just giving him strength into your terrority. H6 would have been much better.]
;W[hd];B[ic];W[hf]C[If he moves in h7 my j5 grup are death no?... this movement wasn't necessary isn't true?
Mark: Correct. This move was not needed black should easily be able to kill and defeat white now.]
;B[hc];W[ih]
(;B[hi]C[This was the apropiate counterattack to j2?
Mark: Well it works direct atari at H2 also works.];W[ii]C[Mark: Absurd. White cannot live here with no eyes]
;B[hh];W[ec]C[Mark: Pointless invasion white should not be able to live here.]
;B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[ig]C[If you could give me an aproximate level, I will apreciate it.
Mark: I am sorry I really cannot give you your level of play. Your initution for moves and direction of play was quite well also you took and punished your enemy for his mistakes. If you had played on a 19x19 board I would have been better able to judge but I would guess around 24k or so don't take that to heart I am just making an educated guess from this game.]
