C[hello,

Thank you for reviewing our game.  It would be most helpful if you could comment on both black and white moves, as we are both interested in the outcome of the review.  I have added my own comments throughout the file, but they are exclusively from black's point of view

This game is taken from the first round of the Scottish Open on 7th July 2001, between Ivan Watling (W, 8kyu) and Richard Jones (B, 9kyu)

Cheers

[nc:c]C[My opening strategy is largely random - I'm currently attempting to learn more about the opening.

The star-point stones are all about playing for influence, this move is
too small. These types of extensions usually occur if black had played
the 3-4 point. The 4-4 point is all about playing on a grander scale.
(a), (b) and (c) would all have been good moves, but this move is on
to small a scale for the 4-4 point.


This is  black's first critical blunder.];W[jd];B[dj];W[fc]
;B[ec]LB[fd:a][df:b][jd:c][fc:d]TR[jd][fc]C[This move is poor, after white (a), black (b). The combination of the
marked white stones and (a) is considered ideal. Playing (b) instead
of this move would have been better. This move helps white become too
strong here];W[fd];B[df]LB[fc:a][fd:b][jd:c]TR[fc][fd][jd]C[Was defending at this point necessary, or should I have moved elsewhere?

I think this move is correct.   Also, notice the marked white stones.. A  3 point
jump from a 2 stone wall is considered ideal. Black should not have  helped white form this shape]
;W[qj];B[np];W[pq];B[nn]LB[jj:a][jp:b][qf:c]C[I also considered moving along the bottom edge at this point, would that have been better.  As it turns out, I got to do it anyway.

I think it would have been better, after this move, white plays (a) in
sente (because black has to defend around (b)). After those two moves,
white clearly has the bigger moyo, and has sente. On the other hand, if
black (b), white (a) - black has sente and can start an invasion around
(c)


Not playing around (b) is black's second critical blunder];W[jj]
;B[jp]LB[fq:a][nn:b]TR[fq][nn]C[The board now looks good for white, and white has sente.   Also, notice the marked stone. Black lost a move because of this stone. If only black could now play
that stone somewhere else - it could equalise the score. This just goes
to re-emphasise that the marked stone was on too small a scale]
;W[cn];B[co]LB[dj:a]TR[dj]C[This split my stones apart on the left.  Perhaps playing some sort of attach and extend would have been better?

No, this move is good this time, because of the marked stone - white's group will be constrained]
;W[dn];B[pm]LB[dn:a][cn:b][dl:c][nc:d][qc:e]TR[dn][cn]C[An unsure attempt at reducing white's space on the right.

I think the two white stones are still the focus of the game. (c) is the
key point. If white plays there - the white stones are much more comfortable. If black plays there, white will be very tightly squeesed.
So this move should have been at (c).
If you were to reduce the size of  white's moyo - note that white has struck at the center of black's
moyo. To keep equivalence, black needs to play with a similar level of
severity. Invasions at (d) or (e) would have been better then this invasion, but in any case, putting pressure on white with (c) is even better.


Not playing (c) is a fairly major blunder];W[qn];B[qm]LB[dl:a]
C[Again, (a) is bigger];W[qg];B[fo]LB[dl:a]C[I don't know if this move was very big.  I'm sure there are better moves on the board.

This is overconcentrating black in the bottom left - (a) is much better.


Not playing (a) is black's third major blunder];W[ck]C[Now white is practically settled]
;B[cj];W[dk];B[fm]LB[jj:a][qc:b][pc:c][nc:d]TR[jj]C[Here, I attempted to keep white's group on the edge isolated.  Another move I considered was either f9 or f8.

Considering the marked stone, it will  be hard to separate white. Either (b), (c) or (d)  is critical now - my preference would be (c)

Not invading with either (b), (c) or (d) is the fourth major blunder. Soon after this - white's moyo/territory becomes overwhealming]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[el];B[fk];W[fl];B[fj];W[gl];B[ei]C[I took the white stone because I was concerned for the safety of the two black stones at c10 and d10

I think that was appropriate to do];W[mc];B[rk]LB[qc:a]C[I think (a) is bigger- you should be able to live in this corner (or
if not absolutly live, at least get a ko - this is so much white's  territory now, that even if you don't live, it shouldn't cost you much.]
;W[qc];B[ri]LB[oj:a]C[I think crawling along this edge helps white's center too much. (a) seems better]
;W[qi];B[rh];W[rj];B[sj];W[si];B[sh];W[rg];B[qk];W[sg];B[si]
;W[qh];B[sk];W[ff];B[hn]LB[ok:a]C[This seems small, (a) is bigger]
;W[gm];B[gn]LB[ok:a]C[This seems very small, (a) is bigger]
;W[em];B[en];W[hk];B[bk];W[cl];B[bl];W[bm];B[ok];W[ni];B[mk]
;W[li];B[il]LB[hh:a]C[Here, I attempted to buid a larger territorial framework with moderate success, although I was never sure how good it was.

I think the white group above is worth more. I think (a) is more interesting then this move.]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[nq];B[lp];W[op];B[rn];W[ro];B[pn]
;W[qo];B[sn]LB[oo:a][rm:b]C[I think white (a) is more important. White (b) isn't as big, considering that white (b) would be gote.]
;W[no];B[mo]C[I decided the ko would give me the best chance of a reasonable outcome in this fight.  The possibility of white n5 was too scary.

Yes.. although it shouldn't have come to this];W[mp];B[lq];W[so]
;B[rm];W[eo];B[fn];W[do]
(;B[ep]LB[cp:a]C[Playing  this move at (B) is bigger.. White can't get much here]
;W[cp];B[bo];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[eg];B[br];W[bn];B[dg]
;W[eh];B[dh];W[hh]C[It seems like white is clearly ahead now]
;B[ij]LB[fb:a]C[This probe into whie's territory was primarily intended to reduce his space, but worked out rather well a bit further into the game.  Are there any better moves, though, for reducing the framework white has built?

(a) is probably the biggest point. Its suprisingly large, maybe around
10 points in gote, but still not enough];W[ii];B[hj];W[jk];B[jl]
;W[kk]LB[kl:a]C[This is too restrained. (a) is bigger.. but considering how much white
is ahead, playing safely isn't that bad.];B[kl]
(;W[fb]LB[eb:a]C[I think this is bigger at (B)];B[eb];W[ea]
;B[da];W[fa];B[db];W[lk];B[ll];W[mj];B[nk]C[I took a defensive position here, but wonder whether there might have been a better move that would have both defended and reduced white's territory a little.

I don't think anything is bigger then this point];W[gi];B[ik]
LB[gj:a][hj:b][ij:c][aq:d]TR[hj][ij]C[The marked stones can connect with either (a) or the move played. Thus
there is no need to make this move at the moment, (d) is bigger (and
sente)];W[hi];B[hl]LB[aq:a]C[This move looks farily slow, but I was trying to be sneaky, as you'll find out in just a moment.

It did work, but you could have played (a) in sente.. and then played
here];W[ls];B[ks];W[ms];B[kr];W[on];B[om]LB[nm:a]C[This move should have been at (a).. see the following comment for why]
;W[oo]LB[mn:a][np:b][nm:c][oo:d][lo:e]TR[oo]C[This move should have been at (a).. then if black (b) - white captures
at (c).. If black captures where the marked stone is, then white (e)]
;B[mn];W[pj];B[oj]C[I considered simply connecting here at q9, but figured that white could then play o10 himself.  I hoped that by threatening to reduce his territory some, it might postpone his push at q9.

Yes, this move is good];W[oi]C[which it did.];B[ee]C[similarly, I tried playing a few moves which stood to make me some more territory, and reduce his potential to make much more.]
;W[fe];B[fi];W[fh];B[pk]LB[aq:a]C[then I filled in when I felt I'd done all I could (although clearly not enough by this stage in the game)

although (a) is bigger then most of the last few moves];W[al]
;B[aj];W[ar];B[gk]C[Here we go - attempting the rip off!];W[hm]
;B[im];W[ao]LB[dm:a]C[Of course, if this had been at (a)- white would have been fine]
;B[dm]C[how chuffed am I at this point ;)];W[cm];B[dl];W[am]
;B[np];W[ak];B[bj];W[mp];B[ef];W[np]C[I decided that that one point was not really going to make any difference, and settled with securing my own wall on the right.

fair enough];B[bs];W[ed];B[cc]LB[dc:a]C[Did I need to defend here?  I was concerned by the potential of white's attack on the 3-3 point.

I don't think you need to defend here, if white plays at the 3-3 point. After black  connects
at (a), there doesn't seem to be anything for white to do];W[nj]
;B[as];W[aq];B[dq]LB[dr:a]C[Not neccesary, if white plays here, then black (a)]
;LB[fq:a][nn:b][cl:c][pc:d]C[so there it is.  A win to white by about 35 points.  Any comments and suggestions that you have would be most gratefully recieved.  Thank you in advance for your time and effort.  kind regards - Richard Jones

This game turned out to be one between competing large moyos. However
white's turned out to be much larger. There were four major moves that
caused this

F3 (a) - this early move from the star-point was too small.  O6 (b) - this move allowed white to take the 10-10 point in sente. Defending along the side would have been better
Not playing C8 (c), this allowed white to settle themselves too easily
Q17(d) - white's top-right moyo got too big, because black never attempted an invasion in the top-right of the board.]

(e), black (f) in sente]))

might happen if white tries];W[fp];B[gp];W[dq];B[dr]LB[dq:a]
