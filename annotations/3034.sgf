my advise: after each(!!) move think about what you loose if you dont answer it. 

Look at stronger players: they think after each move even if it seems obvious what to play next if there maybe is something bigger.

Look for points that are bigger or play points that are very bad for your opponend if he dosnt answer it. That way you start to push
you opponent arrount and dont get pushed yourself. 

Try to get sente and keep it.

play save, big points if you are ahead. 

In Handycap games try to avoid fights as long as possible and take big points espesialy also in unsafe areas without white influence. 

Personaly i like in Handycapgames to give away some territory easy, and use the saved stones to switch the rest of the bord to a 9 Handycap game.

I mostly win my Handycap games ;)];W[qb];B[pb];W[rb];B[pf];W[pg]

artifex: i dont think its good to start a fight this early.
with your 6 stones you dont have to. 

your right group is secure, your left group isnt attacked yet.  

why not get profit; 

in this position white at A should be answered with black  at B; 

w at c would then connect or get live.

the jump at D is another good move; but not the only one]
