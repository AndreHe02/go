RE[B+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[Pribumi - dear reviewer, thank you for taking time out to review this game.

really complicated game,..
i play white in this game
after the opening i was very optimist to win this game because i cut many black group and he has many groups that became weak.

but in last middle game he can make them all live, so in move 197 b won on resign.]
;B[pd];W[jj]C[LoP: Stylish opening move ;) Of course tengen is far superiour than any other move! ^^]

i play this instead of joseki R2, because planning to attack K3.
but i am not sure is this good or bad one?

after this cut, i feel i can win this game easyly, but his stubborn was give him a benefit : P6 become huge group and LIVE
T_T

LoP: You are right this result is nice for white. Of course the game is not over yet. It still needs a lot of effort to preserve the lead until the end of the game.]
;B[pk];W[pl];B[ol]
(;W[om]C[LoP: This move is passive , black can throw the 4 stones away, you shouldn't try to just capture those 4 stones but instead aim for the whole Black group. Make it hard for black to get anything in this area. This feels like white was forced]

(;B[nn]C[LoP: Black shouldn't save those stones since they accomplish nothing and should be discarded. Baclk should aim to sacrifice them with profit. Check variations]

(;W[mn];B[nm];W[no]C[LoP: capturing 4 stones is not big, you should aim for the whole group]

(;W[fq];B[cq];W[pr]C[LoP: Sente, but not necessarily good. (Aji keshi?)
The reason is there are also other options to threaten the corner (p2) i guess you don't know yet which one is the best.]

i try to trade my H5 with left territory, but once again.
C10 will live later in middle game.

another exchange,
in my mind > if i play O14 instead R13,
after black R14,white K14 i will have more two moves(O14 and K14 and i will kill black huge group.

LoP: sorry don't understand, if you mean you have a good chance to kill the black group then i guess you are right.
And yes white r13 is not good, but it would be the normal follow up for your previous moves (R15 and S15)]

i feel like if i cut now,my E9 will get into trouble. and i sure i still can kill black C18 group even he connect the C10 stone, because it`s hard to get an eye there, is it not?]

a misclik  T_T, but since black not play C7, i feel this move doesn`t make much differnt]

ok2  i resign, but i don`t feel i worse than him. it`s because my poor tsumego instead he play good game.
