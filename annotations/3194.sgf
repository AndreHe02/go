C[HI, thanks for reviewing.  I'm black in this game.

javi: Hi, I would try to help you during this review but you seems to be doing quite well :)]
;B[qc];W[dp];B[pq]C[I'm experimenting with this fuseki.  I still haven't lost with it yet over about 10 games, but maybe it's just because players are unfamiliar with how to approach 3-3?

javi: In my opinion, and specially for double digit kyus, the fuseki only set up a scenario for middle game fights, so there are no sure-win fuseki. So if you are having a long winning streak is because you are improving, not just the fuseki.

Anyway, it is true that using a different fuseki give you a little advantage :)]
;W[dd];B[qo];W[nc]C[Javi: I thinki right now the biggest play for white is around k3.]
;B[jq]C[I didn't think the two space approach really threatened me all that much, so I thought I'd take a bigger point.

Javi: True, one of the virtues of r17 is that it is very difficult to kill so your thinking is right :)]
;W[qe];B[pd];W[ph]
(;B[nd]C[Javi: O16 is attaching to the weaker stone and this is, usually, not the best option. Look at variation.]
;W[mc]
(;B[cn]C[Javi: c6 is not bad, but you had the option of playing at f3 making a quite big moyo. Look at variations.]
;W[eq]C[Javi: e3 is very small, f3 is the usual move.];B[bp]
;W[lq]C[javi: m3 is a very deep invasion and premature, in my opinion. White lower left corner is not settled yet, so he has two weak groups in the same area and that is not good.]

(;B[ko]C[javi: L5 is a quite aggresive answer and could lead to many risky continuations. I would have played first at g3, making a base for k3 while attacking white corner. Look at the variations.]

(;W[mo]
(;B[lp];W[mp];B[mq]C[javi: Black can certainly cut m3 white stone, but usually this is not good, because white gets many forcing moves and some strengh. Black could use white running group to make right side territory while chasing him. Look at the variation]
;W[nq];B[mr];W[nr];B[lr];W[oo];B[op];W[np];B[ql]C[javi: Playing p4 forcing white to connect and then leaving is not good. It is better leaving the options open for the future.]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[oq]
(;B[qq];W[po];B[pn];W[on];B[pm];W[om];B[ol];W[mn]C[not too bad of an exchange for me I think.  I setteled the corner, and made a wall facing the left, which I could use to attack those two white stones now.

Javi: Yes, making territory while attacking  is a very good idea.]

(;B[cq]C[javi: I think this is not the right point for attacking as white shows you. Look at the variation]
;W[hq]C[javi: H3 is the key point at bottom. Look at variation]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[go]C[javi: This double hane is quite advanced. Well done ¡ :)]
;W[ho];B[ip];W[fo];B[gn];W[fp];B[dr];W[er];B[fn];W[en];B[do]
C[javi: The same commentary as before. It is not good playing a stone and then leaving it. At least it should be left as a ko threat.]
;W[eo];B[em];W[dq];B[dm]C[I wasn't really expecting to kill, but rather to build thickness towards the top, hopefully end this corner in sente, and approach the top left with hopes of a large side moyo.

javi: And your strategy has been a success :))];W[cr]C[javi: white is worried about his life, so he takes d2 stone. I think he is alive so this is gote and not urgent.]
;B[br];W[ds];B[df]C[Javi: This move is really big. White should have played around here when he could ¡ Well done :)

Now black has a big lead in territory and thickness in the center for more points.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[me];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[ic]C[javi: In this shape black can take the corner. But then he could put at risk his center moyo. Look at the variation.]

(;B[cd];W[cc];B[de];W[ce]C[i decided to give up the stone for a connection to the f16 stones and a small wall securing the side territory.

javi: Good decision ¡];B[ed];W[bd];B[cg]C[javi: probably is better to stop directly at c14, but it is a minor loss.]
;W[dj]C[an overplay?

javi: I think it is too deep but white has realized that he is very behind in territory so he must do something. Usually it is quite difficult to get points in the center so maybe he was confident about running from there]
;B[fj]C[javi: As you are strong in the area, this is the proper move to attack white. Good ¡]
;W[ff];B[ef];W[fg];B[eh];W[eg];B[dh];W[dg];B[cf];W[fe];B[ee]
;W[gd];B[eb];W[dc];B[ge];W[he];B[gc];W[hd]
(;B[gg]C[javi: Why not at f12 directly?. Look at the variation]
;W[gf];B[gi]C[javi: White has reduced only a little black territory so black lead is now very solid.]
;W[fh];B[fi];W[ei];B[di];W[ch];B[ci];W[gh];B[ig];W[nf];B[qf]
C[i really messed up the top right here.  q15 better?

javi: black only needs to live here. Because he is quite strong at bottom right corner, white can not get too many points at the right side. Q15 is not bad, but probably s16 is enough securing the corner.]
;W[pe];B[of];W[pf];B[oe];W[og];B[od];W[qd];B[rd]C[I think I have to give up the 7 stones in exchange for life now.

javi: Again a good decision. The most important thing is to get a living group there.]
;W[pc];B[pb];W[oc];B[rb];W[re]
(;B[sd]C[javi: this position can also be reached with a standar invasion. If you dont want to have the problem of the ko, play at t17 instead. Look at the variation.]
;W[se];B[hh];W[hg];B[ii];W[sb];B[rc];W[ob];B[qa];W[pk]C[I noticed that white could still kill me with ko in the top right.  Since he didn't see it, I wasn't sure if I should go fix it right away.  I have virtually no ko threats, so I was hesitant to leave it open to attack, but I decided to hope he wouldn't see it later because I think this connection is pretty big too.

javi: true, it was risky. You should have connected. You are winning so big you should not take risks ¡]
;B[pl];W[ok];B[rj];W[qk];B[rk];W[nl];B[je]C[a bit greedy by me.

javi: yes, this time white showed you why it was an overplay.]
;W[if];B[jg];W[jf];B[rh];W[qg]C[javi: this is quite small. I would have played around L7 as white.]
;B[hr];W[gr];B[iq];W[gq];B[hb];W[ib];B[ia];W[ja];B[ha];W[jb]
;B[ca];W[cb];B[da];W[bf];B[bg];W[af];B[ag];W[cp];B[bq];W[co]
;B[bo];W[dn];B[bm];W[ir]C[javi: around L7 is still bigger for both players]
;B[jr];W[hs];B[in];W[kg];B[kh];W[jh];B[ih];W[lh];B[ki]C[I decided that it was better for me to continuing pushing and making this wall.  I think white is securing more territory, but I think I'm far enough ahead that I'd rather secure what I have now instead of risking it in hopes for a larger win.

javi: Yes, the game is won so you should just play securely and without any risk.]

FINAL COMMENTARY:

I think that, at least in this game, you have a good sense of direction and a quite good management of sente. Your whole board vision is good also.

Probably your least strong side of the game is fighting but i think that fighting is usually improved playing a lot of games. So dont worry too much.

I would recommend you to read a little further the positions, because more than once you left a shape unfinished, thinking that it was safe (imho), and then after your opponent plays, you notice it was not ¡. Anyway you havent made any bad mistakes, and even after some error, you dont make it bigger as usually many players do, but sacrifice some stones in order to save the most valuables ones.

I think you will improve a lot because you have good game foundations. Probably making life and death problems could help you also.

That all ¡
