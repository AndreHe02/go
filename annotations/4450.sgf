Comment by Erwin Bruinsma, 3kyu in the Netherlands.

Before I start my review, some general remarks about looking at a game:
-try to estimate the points you and your opponent are making (balance of territory)
-look at influence/thickness (balance of thickness)
-look at strong and weak groups
Keep an eye on these three things during the whole game.

One of the most important things about the fuseki is to try to avoid weak groups!]

;B[dd];W[fc];B[bb]C[quite happy with opening at this point, but probablmor due two handi.

Erwin: I think that this is a small move. I prefer C11 instead of B18.]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[jc];B[le]C[Now we have to look at strong and weak groups!

The B18 black group is strong enough to make two eye without help from friendly stones. 
The same for white E18 group and black Q16 group.

The white O17 group and the black M17 group are not strong enough at this moment to make two eyes on their one. This are weak groups at this moment and they need attention.]
;W[lb]C[Good move!];B[oq];W[mq];B[oo];W[pp]C[I don't like this move.

It doesn't make the white corner really stronger, but is makes black stronger, when black answers P4. If black becomes stronger, white N3 becomes weaker. 
So white is forcing black to attack N3.

When you play this move at Q3 or R7, white will get a better result. 
Q3 does make corner territory.
R7 does give white the lower right side.];B[op]C[Of course.]
;W[mo]
(;B[qr]C[The idea behind this move is good.

But something better can be done. See variation one move ago.]
;W[qm];B[om]C[Good, you have to go out in the situation.];W[qj]
;B[qh];W[nn];B[on];W[ri];B[rh];W[jp];B[gq]C[Lets take a moment to look at the game. The three points I mentioned at the beginning: territory, influence and strong/weak groups.

Black
upper right: 15 points
upper left: 10 points
lower left: still very open, but good chances to make 20 points or more
lower right and M17 group: weak groups, but is important that both group have a chance to escape to the center

White
right side: 12 points
lower side: 7 points
upper side: 15 points or 40 points (depends on the black M17 group).
If black can split the white stones on the upper side O17 group will become weak.

Note that the left side of the board is still very open.

So both black and white have chances to win at this moment. Black has two weak groups now ans white will get a weak group is black splits the white stones at the upper side.]
;W[cn]C[Good move. White will need stones on the left side to win.]
;B[bp];W[cj]C[One to far.
Black C8 can split the two white stones into two weak white groups]
;B[ch];W[en];B[go];W[gm]C[quite equal? end of openings?

Erwin: chances for both
It is important that there are weak groups on the board.
The P3 and M17 groups can be hunted by white.];B[jr];W[di];B[dh]
;W[ei];B[nm];W[mm];B[lq];W[lp];B[kq];W[kp];B[mr]C[Black is happy now; one of his weak groups is connected.]
;W[fe]C[This is a good move 

It helps to build some territory for white.
It helps to keep black 'small' at the upper left side.
It isolates M17 an M15 from the black stones at the left.];B[bi]
;W[bj];B[oh]C[This is a very important part of the board. 
There is a waek black group at the upper side and there is a potantial weak white group, if black splits the white stones at the upper side.

I think this area is more important then B11/B10 moves.
Note what will happen if white plays O13, before black plays in this area: M17 group will become really weak.]
;W[lg]C[This move invites black to split M13 from O15. 
In Dutch we call this 'poortje' (that means gate).

Better is N13. Black can also split in that situation, but white will also split black. In the game black connects and that is very important.]
;B[mf]C[Of course.]
(;W[kd]C[This move is not so good.
It helps black to become stronger.
See variation one move ago.];B[ld]C[Of course. 
If white does not play L18 or N18 now, black can split the white stones.]
;W[ke]C[Mistake];B[mb]C[Of course.];W[mc];B[kb]C[bad move for white?

Erwin: Mistake is L15 and L16.];W[nb];B[la]C[Black is happy now.

Ones he was the one with the weak group and now white is the one with the weak group.

I always say: Who is the hunter and who is the fox?
Black chanced his role from fox to hunter and that is very good for him.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[rd];W[od];B[md];W[pe];B[qd];W[qe];B[rf]
;W[re];B[se];W[qf];B[qg];W[oe];B[ng];W[na];B[qa];W[nf];B[mg]
;W[pa];B[ob];W[ra];B[sb]C[Black is ahead now!

Upper right corner is at least 40 points. Lower side is 30 points, upper left side is 15 points. So 85 points and no weak groups anymore.
The white area in the middle is still open at more than one side, so it will not be possible to make more than 85 points for white.]
;W[jb];B[pm]TR[fg][lh]C[was also thinking b r6

This is a so called 'thank you move'. You are not helping yourself with Q7, you are only helping your opponent by making his group stronger.

When you look at the whole board, the only thing you have to prevent is white getting a lot of territory in the center. E.g. with the marked moves. I prefer F13.]
;W[ql]C[There was some weakeness in the white group. But not anymore now.]
;B[qi]C[The only thing you have to do to win, is preventing white from getting territory in the center. That is important now.]
;W[fg]C[Good move.
Black is leading, so white has to take the risk not to defend.]
;B[lh]C[Good move, now you are doing the most important thing on the board, reducing whites center.]
;W[kg];B[kh];W[jg];B[gi]C[not sure about this approach. it is a week part of my game. dont even know proper term for moves like this. i see possible big moyo for white and want to close it down, but maybe i should have just firmed up my territory and not be so greedy

Erwin: This is a good move, if white had not played F13. Then you would have two ways out: to the left or to the right. If white blocks one, you take the other.
Now you have only one way out. So white will block it and you will have to live inside.

But in this case it is not necessary to go in deep.
A few moves ago I said that black had about 85 points. White will make 10 at the right side, 25 at the upper side. So black has to prevent white from making 50 points in the center and at the left.

J11 is good enough!];W[ii]C[Of course!];B[fh]C[This door is closed by F13.]
;W[eh];B[eg];W[ef];B[df];W[dg];B[cg];W[hn]C[Good.];B[gg];W[gf]
;B[gk];W[hj];B[jh];W[ih];B[ig];W[if];B[hg];W[hf];B[gj];W[fi]
;B[gh];W[il]C[Good.
Black lost 8 stones, this shows the invasion was to deep!];B[ek]
;W[dl];B[bn];W[bm];B[co];W[dn];B[pj]C[sort of gave up on my left side invasion and thought best strenghten ride side]
;W[kj]C[Not good, white becomes to weak at the left side. S9 becomes an interesting point for black with Q10 on the board.]
;B[lj];W[kk];B[lk];W[ll];B[nk];W[pk]C[Too agressive. S10 is better]
;B[rj];W[rk];B[qk];W[pg]C[nexy move is a mistake, thought it gave false eye, but i was worng. nevertheless managed to make the territory back in bottom right]
;B[qj]C[As you said: this is a mistake];W[og]C[niallp [11k\]: doh]
;B[rl]C[The game is close now. If white lives at the right side he will win.]

This is where I stop the comments.
I hope you learned something from it.

(;W[rp]C[In this variation I will show why black cann't split the white stones at the upper side.
I play S4 elsewhere, so black can turn first at the upper side.]

(;B[qn];W[qr];B[om]TR[qn][oo]C[The idea behind this moves are: give white the corner and get a moyo on the right side

I don't know which moves are best in this situation. But I hope you get the idea: let white live in the corner with a few points and get a big moyo for yourself.

When you attack one of your opponents groups, the goal is not always to kill that group, but you have to gain profit somewhere on the board. In this case attacking the corner gives black a moyo on the right.

There is some weakness in the black stones marked with the triangle, so a black move near P7 is needed. If the marked stone are strong and connected play around Q10 instead of P7.]
