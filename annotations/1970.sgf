;B[pc]C[Hello reviewer,
Thank you for taking the time to do this review for me.  I'm playing white in this game.  I won the game, but I have some specific questions for you, plus any advice you may care to give.
Darrell  (snip)

[DP\] Hi - OK, I'm writing these after having reviewed the game.  I think you played fairly well throughout, although there were some over-agressive moves locally (like the hane at O3) when you lost sight of the big picture.  However, to counter that you generally spotted when the B response was poor and took good advantage of it.]
;W[dq];B[cd];W[pp];B[qe];W[ed]C[[DP\] Yes this is good - you don't want B making two shimari]
;B[ec];W[fc];B[dc]C[[DP\] Be aware that you can actually leave this position now if you want to take sente.  It is a very common joseki and worth knowing the basic variations]

(;W[fd]
(;B[jc];W[ce]C[[snip\] Is this move and the followup correct when black takes K17 this way?
[DP\] It's a contact move, and so best suited for defence rather than attack.  As you can see from the outcome, both sides come out with a stable position, although I think B gets the better of it. This is a good question to put to your top local club player - I found nothing noticeably better than yours, but it just doesn't *feel* right, if you know what I mean.]
;B[be];W[dd];B[bc];W[cf];B[do]
(;W[cl]C[[DP\] With your thickness at the top you can afford to be mean and nasty and pincer at C7.]
;B[cq];W[cr];B[cp]
(;W[br]C[[snip\] What do you think of this move and the following few till the cut?  I didn't want black to live without a fight on the left side after he took the top.
[DP\] I think the trouble with this is that you leave B an escape route, attacking your lower L group.  If you have gone for the standard joseki, B has very little room for manoeuvre, so you can take profit whilst attacking.  You get away with it because B makes mistakes, which you do well to spot and punish. Compare the variation off node 21 - a position you can get even with best play from B, and that off node 24 which is what B could have done to you after your B2 move.]
;B[eq]C[[DP\] I like this move from B - shows good fighting spirit]
;W[er]
(;B[fq]C[[DP\] Poor follow-up from B - should be E4];W[dp]C[[DP\] Good move to introduce cutting points and show up the flaw in B playing F3.]
;B[ep];W[dr]
(;B[co]C[[DP\] Here B should have cut his losses and played something like E7.  This is a B overplay of which you take full advantage.]
;W[eo]C[[DP\] Your plan has worked - though B has helped you with F3 earlier and C5 just now.  One of the B groups is now doomed.]
;B[fr];W[bq];B[dn]C[[DP\] More bad shape from B - an attempt to squirm but you've already got him.]
;W[fo];B[iq];W[em]C[[DP\] Yep, you need to confine him - job done.]
;B[bm];W[bl];B[dm];W[dl];B[qn]
(;W[fl]LB[lq:a]C[[snip\] I strongly considered a move at 'a' here, to help my corner and attack black's group.
But I was worried about the cut, so moved here instead.  As I look at it, it is terribly painful to make this move.

[DP\]  I don't think you need to defend the cut - your variations show why - as long as you can read out to the capture race where you're one ahead]
;B[qq]LB[np:a]C[[snip\] I expected black to pincer around 'a'.  This seems much easier to handle.

[DP\] agreed - the double kakari at 'a' would have been much nastier!]

(;W[qp]C[[snip\] But which way to block?  This seemed better than the alternative.  Look at my variation.  Perhaps there is a better line than I envision.

[DP\] This is the correct way - keep B separated];B[pq];W[op]
;B[oq]
(;W[nq]C[[DP\] Ouch - this is a big overplay!  Now when B cuts at O4 and S4 he can link up, seriously undermining your position.  Keep it simple with O4.]
;B[np];W[mq];B[rp];W[on];B[qo]C[[DP\] B has recovered a lot of ground here.]
;W[no];B[kq];W[gp]LB[je:b][hq:a]C[[snip\] My plan here was for black to answer around 'a' and then I would move at 'b'  But this is not how it worked out at all.

[DP\] You're still a bit keen on killing things rather than taking profit.  Your position bottom left is immensely thick after you defended the cut, so playing at 'a' is small and in the wrong direction.  Q10 is the key point, otherwise B gets a double wing shimari.]
;B[qj]C[[snip\] I thought for a long long time here.  It seems like black should pay for this tenuki, but I couldn't find a good move.

[DP\] Full marks to B for this one, who is now comfortably ahead in the game.  Incidentally, you ask later about yose - but have you counted, even approximately, yet?  You should get in the habit of doing this, always being generous to your opponent's score and being cautious with your own.
B - top left 15; top right 40; bottom right 15 - total 70ish
W - bottom left 30; left side 20; komi 5 - total 55ish];W[gs]
C[[DP\] This is small stuff again.  What are you going to do if B plays K10 for a 100 point moyo?  As you say, you couldn't find a good move, so stand back and get the big picture.]
;B[gr]C[[DP\] You are lucky B answers this - he could happily sacrifice 10 points here.  The other nasty thing about this is the reduction in liberties for your corner group - those B stones at C5 still have aji.]
;W[fs];B[es];W[hs]C[I don't think I've crawled on the first line this early in a game since I was 20k.  But I seem to be committed.]
;B[hr];W[is];B[js];W[ds];B[ir];W[es]
(;B[ls]C[[DP\] Have you considered the danger to your left corner? see variation from previous move.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[ms];B[lp];W[mp];B[io];W[lo];B[ko];W[lq];B[kp]
;W[kn];B[jn];W[km];B[ks];W[il];B[bp]C[[DP\] He's having a look, as they say in Formula 1.  Fortunately, as we observed back on move 68, this doesn't work so he's playing with dead stones and removing their aji for you.  That was very kind of him...]
;W[bs];B[ch]C[Now, with walls on both sides, I should be able to get something out of this, but instead, I lose ground.  I would really appreciate advice here.

[DP\] Yes, you have walls - but look at B's position.  It is formidable over to the right, so he has the strength to invade.  However, he goes in too deep, so you should be able to get something.  The invasion should probably be around E12.  Since he's gone in so deep, you should cap (after the urgent move at B14), intending to let him live if need be but to build up centre power to nullify B's right position in return.]
;W[bf]C[[DP\] Good - urgent moves before big points];B[eh]C[[DP\] Hugely difficult question coming up now - *where* to cap.  Consider strengths and weaknesses.  He is strong on the R, you are strong below but weak top (D15).  So push him towards your strength and away from his.  This suggests somewhere like G13.]

(;W[gh]LB[ff:a]C[[snip\] Something like 'a'?

[DP\] the trouble with 'a' is that it doesn't stop or threaten him - he just runs away further and comes back to hassle you - see previous variations.  G12 doesn't cover your weakness at D15.]
;B[ef]C[[DP\] Excellent move by B, striking right where it hurts.]

(;W[ff]C[[DP\] I think you had to play D15 here, even though you don't want to!]
;B[fg];W[gg];B[fe];W[gf];B[de];W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[di]C[I can see I'm doomed here, so I settle for another wall.  But now it's facing reasonably strong black stones, so I think I'm now losing.

[DP\] The good thing here is your evaluation of the position and determination to take something positive from it.  The ability to sacrifice is essential]
;W[ge];B[df];W[ee];B[cg];W[mc]C[[DP\] Good - sensible use of the wall]
;B[md]
(;W[lc]C[[DP\] This move is heavy.  You should be pushing him back against your wall, perhaps with a hane at O16]
;B[ld];W[nc];B[nd];W[kc];B[kd];W[jd];B[jb];W[oc];B[od];W[pb]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[id];B[hb];W[gb]C[[DP\] Why the contact play? You're not in trouble here, so F18 is better to threaten both sides]
;B[ma]C[groan.

[DP\] this trouble stems from the heavy play after the pincer.  hane and make shape instead.]
;W[mb];B[qa];W[kb]C[[snip\] I sacrifice the two end stones in hopes of a clean life.

[DP\] Yes, this is a sensible strategy];B[ob];W[na]
(;B[oa]C[[snip\] q1 better I think

[DP\] more complicated, but you read it out correctly];W[la]
;B[pa];W[nb];B[mi]C[[snip\] Now I'm really hurting.

[DP\] Have you counted yet?  No maybe don't do that - you'd probably have resigned :-)  But seriously, get in the habit of doing it very roughly as soon as the fuseki is over!]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[mg];B[kh]C[[DP\] Good from B - pushing you towards his thickness]
;W[kg];B[jg]
(;W[kf]C[[DP\] again heavy - how about some shape at M12 which also introduces some cutting points into the B position?]
;B[jf];W[ke];B[je];W[jh];B[lg];W[lf];B[lh];W[nf];B[ih];W[ji]
;B[ii];W[jj];B[ig]
(;W[gi]LB[gj:a]C[[snip\] 'a' better?  Or something else entirely?

[DP\] something else entirely - see variation from previous move]

(;B[me]C[[DP\] I prefer squeezing, to get the satisfaction of seeing a really horrible shape belonging to my opponent :-)]
;W[mf]
(;B[og]C[[DP\] Huge mistake by B - this costs him the game.  It's only a diagonal away from the correct place, but it is a cruel game.]
;W[ni]C[[DP\] You take good advantage of B's mistake];B[mj]
;W[mh];B[li];W[oh];B[nj];W[oj];B[ok];W[pk];B[pj];W[oi]
(;B[ol]C[[DP\] This was B's last chance - a move at O9 might have bought him enough time for the capturing race]
;W[nk];B[ph];W[nl]C[[snip\] Suddenly I look like I'm way ahead.

[DP\] Ah, but can you give an approximation as to how much??  Things now stand at:
B: bottom centre 5; bottom right 10; right side 25; top left 25 - total 65 ish
W: bottom left 30; top & centre 60 - total 90ish
so the yose will become irrelevant];B[pi];W[om];B[hd];W[ic]
;B[gc];W[ib]LB[hc:a]C[[snip\] should be 'a'

[DP\] Yep - one reason why F18 would have been better a long time ago]

;B[hm];W[in];B[jo];W[hn];B[ho];W[go];B[kl];W[lm];B[ll];W[mm]
;B[gn];W[hk]C[[DP\] I presume you've got your eye on killing the bottom B group with H4 through all this ?? :-)]
;B[hj];W[gk]C[I'm being very very careful here...];B[ek];W[el]
;B[gj];W[fj];B[fk];W[ej]C[And then make this stupid move.];B[ik]
;W[jk];B[gl];W[lk];B[dk]
(;W[cm]C[[DP\] You should definitely have done H4 here - see variation from previous move]
;B[dj];W[bn];B[fi]C[thank you];W[jq]LB[hp:a]C[[snip\] had to be 'a'

[DP\] yep :-)];B[hp];W[of]C[[snip\] I tried to play the endgame well.  Any comments on yose?

[DP\] 1) count earlier so you know where you are when you enter the yose. 2) double sente moves first.  Take time to find them, then play them, every last single one of them...]
;B[pf];W[qk];B[rl];W[rk];B[rj];W[sl];B[rm];W[bj]C[[DP\] this is not double sente - T10 is bigger]
;B[bi]
(;W[nr]C[[DP\] Q1 does a lot more damage];B[ps];W[gb];B[kk]
;W[kj];B[gc];W[gq];B[jp];W[gb];B[mk];W[ml];B[gc];W[sj]C[[DP\] Finally :-)]
;B[si]C[Here, I didn't know whether to connect in sente or take the ko and probably get a second ko threat out of the hane.  Really tried to figure it out too.  Which is correct?

[DP\] Connecting in sente.  The ko is tiny.  If he doesn't connect you munch about 10 points in sente!]
