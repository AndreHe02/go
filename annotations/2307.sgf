(;W[ql]C[yoyoma [3k\]: This white move is not so good, its too close to Q9 so R8 will be hurt when black answers.]
;B[qk];W[pl];B[ol]C[yoyoma [3k\]: black hanes 2 stones, good of course]
;W[oo];B[mq]C[I think this was pretty good for B
yoyoma [3k\]: Yeah black is doing well];W[ec];B[dj]C[Deny W the nice extension--but maybe it should be on the 3rd line?
yoyoma [3k\]: Yes normally its on 3rd line so its easy to make a base]
;W[dn]
(;B[cg]C[yoyoma [3k\]: I would rather take a big point on the bottom.]
;W[iq]C[B should invade now?
yoyoma [3k\]: So white took a very big point!  Invasion is definitely not the right idea here, N3 is not strong enough.  Instead you should think of reduction
yoyoma [3k\]: Another option would be to take K16 now
yoyoma [3k\]: Or F16 is another possibility]
(;B[mo];W[om]
(;B[nl];W[rl]C[yoyoma [3k\]: White undermined your biggest territory with S8, I think you should defend.  Also it keeps the pressure on white's stones here.]

(;B[lo]C[yoyoma [3k\]: See some other black choices.  I don't think M5 is worth much.  S4 is big because it's in the corner and also puts pressure on white's group which is not 100% alive yet]
