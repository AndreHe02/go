C[Joonas Tyystj√§rvi: I've added some comments and variations. Until move 83 you were doing fine. As a general comment, when faced with a loose reduction like white 64, it is usually best to defend firmly (this holds especially true in this case, since your moyo is huge).]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dd];B[eq];W[gq];B[do];W[co]
(;B[dp]LB[dn:A]C[JT: should be at A. Now white gets (or could get) ahead.]

(;W[jp]C[JT: this is simply a bad move (wrong direction and leaves a weakness)]

(;B[cq]LB[cn:A]C[JT: I think A is better (see the variations).]
;W[bq];B[cn];W[bp]
(;B[dm]LB[bn:A]C[JT: I think A is better.];W[bn];B[oc]LB[bm:A]
TR[bn]C[JT: you should block at A, since the marked white stone restricts your development on the left side.]
;W[qo];B[op]LB[qk:A]C[JT: I'd prefer to play at A, since it's at the same time a pincer and an extension from your shimari. This is playable with the weak white group to the left, though.]
;W[pl];B[qp]C[JT: a big point.];W[pn]
(;B[kq]LB[lq:A]C[JT: at A is better. Remember - use contact plays to defend, attack from distance. This is the right direction, though.]
;W[jq]TR[kq]C[JT: now the triangled stone is weakened.];B[kp]
;W[kr];B[lr];W[jr];B[jo]LB[ko:A][mq:B]C[JT: at A or B is better; two cutting points so close together are bad.]
;W[cf];B[ci]LB[ic:B][qj:C][bm:A][io:D]C[JT: this area is uninteresting - there's not a lot of space here and white can still play at A. At B is bigger, at C is more urgent. Also, D is somewhat interesting since the white stones aren't actually alive yet.]
;W[ec];B[jc]LB[qj:A]C[JT: at A is more interesting, since it attacks the white group.]
;W[hc];B[qj]C[JT: good!];W[qk];B[pj];W[rk];B[rj]LB[je:A]C[JT: although big, this is somewhat non-urgent. A is more important.]
;W[bh];B[ch]C[JT: the right direction. Tenuki is also possible.]
;W[cg];B[pk]LB[rp:A]C[JT: this move doesn't really do anything but lose a ko threat. If you want to attack, I prefer A, since it also has some endgame value.]
;W[qm];B[nk]LB[je:A]C[JT: this side is already strong. A is bigger.]
;W[lc]C[JT: now white gets to invade here.];B[ld]LB[kd:A]C[JT: at A is a stronger way to attack. This kind of contact play makes white stronger (I've added some variations).]

(;W[ic]C[JT: ..and now white abandons the invading stone for a bit of territory.]
;B[jd];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[if]LB[kc:A]C[JT: you really should block at A first to remove the bad aji. Also, this isn't really such an interesting point, since white doesn't have that great potential here.]
;W[kc];B[lb]C[JT: still much bad aji in the white stones.];W[hf]
;B[id]LB[jg:A]C[JT: I prefer A, to defend your moyo.];W[gd]
;B[he]C[JT: good, this fixes your shape.];W[ge];B[hg];W[gf]
;B[hh]LB[ig:A]C[JT: I think just the solid connection at A is better (no cutting potential)]
;W[jj]C[(Copied from the original file):Did I play in the first part of the game
well?
I think that I started to play wrongly
after this move.
What is the mistake???

JT: you did well in the first part of the game. If black just keeps his moyo now, he has a comfortable lead of well over 10 points.]

(;B[nm]C[JT: you should keep white out of your moyo. That makes the white stone weaker as well.]
;W[kh]
(;B[ji]C[JT: this is the worse way to cut (the proverb says "strike at the waist of the keima")]
;W[ki]C[JT: now white gets to block here, and the weaker side is strengthened.]
;B[kj];W[mi];B[lj]C[Where should I play against white?];W[li]
;B[kg]LB[mg:A]C[JT: too close. I think A to destroy white's eye shape is the best.]
;W[lg];B[mg]LB[ng:A]C[JT: at A looks better now, although it allows white better eye potential.]
;W[kf];B[jg];W[mf];B[mh];W[jf];B[lh]C[JT: right.];W[jh]
(;B[ii]LB[lf:A]C[JT: MUST be at A. No choice here. This is the losing move.]
;W[ig]C[JT: black gets nothing here.];B[le]LB[ie:A]C[JT: well, this is better than A.]
;W[ie];B[je];W[hd];B[lf];W[kg];B[ni];W[mj];B[mk];W[jk];B[hk]
LB[kl:A]C[JT: you need to protect the cut with A now, to keep white weak.]
;W[lk]C[JT: white is very happy.];B[ll];W[kk]LB[kl:A]C[JT: (A would have been better for white)]
;B[kl]LB[nf:C][bi:B][bm:A]C[JT: a bit pointless. The territory black can expect with this is less than 10 points. A, although late, followed by B is bigger. C is huge.]
;W[jl];B[oo];W[nf]
(;B[og]LB[mc:A]C[JT: protecting at A is bigger.];W[mc];B[mb]
;W[kd]C[JT: and now the bad aji manifests.];B[md]C[JT: this move doesn't actually work.]

LB[pc:A]C[JT: the ladder at A works.];W[pc];B[pb];W[ob];B[oa]
;W[oc];B[qb]C[JT: white could still destroy some more territory.]

(;W[pe];B[of];W[pf];B[pg];W[qf];B[rh]LB[bi:A][bm:B][io:C][rp:D]
C[JT: since you're already alive here, there's not much point in protecting about 4 points. A and B are bigger. C and D are also somewhat interesting.]
;W[hj]
(;B[fh]LB[ij:A]C[JT: firmly cutting at A is better.];W[ij]C[JT: white connects safely again. You must not allow this.]
;B[gk]C[JT: it's better to leave this stone for now, as it doesn't really do anything.]
;W[fg];B[dg];W[df];B[eh];W[hi];B[gi];W[ih];B[gh]LB[qc:A][bi:C]
[bm:D][rp:B][cr:E][fr:F]C[JT: too small, since the two stones aren't cutting. I've marked bigger moves in a sort of order of urgency.]
;W[io];B[jn];W[jm];B[fr]LB[in:A]C[JT: at A is bigger.];W[gr]
;B[gp]LB[gn:B][in:A]C[JT: too loose, doesn't do much. At A is better. If you really want territory here, around B is better.]
;W[hp];B[go];W[in];B[km]LB[mq:A]C[JT: this is smaller than, say, A.]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[lq];B[lp];W[mq];B[mr];W[gn];B[hm]LB[fn:A]C[JT: it's better to play straight at A.]
;W[hn];B[fn];W[gm];B[gl]LB[fm:A]TR[hm]C[JT: the marked stone was free for you. You should forget about it - A is bigger.]
