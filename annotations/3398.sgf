C[Hi,

this is a game I recently played in a tournament. I recorded only the first 92 moves, but I think at that point the game is already hopeless for me (Black). I resigned shortly after, but I feel I might have resigned at this point already. Rarely ever I have been outplayed like this by a player of supposedly my level. So any help on what went wrong would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! (My own mumblings  on the game are marked with AB.)

-> White really make very few mistakes that I can point out, and although one was big enough, you failed to take advantage of it, while white could easily punish your own not-so-big ones with natural moves, building up a lead.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ep];W[gq];B[fo];W[cm]C[Choosing the right joseki is not easy.
I give here one played in 1992-11-16 between Cho Chikun and Sakata, only upper right corner is different, but I've no games exactly like yours in my 5800 pro games database.
Usually adjacent corners are the relevant ones to choose a joseki, ladders apart, so I think it can be a good reference.]

(;B[hp];W[iq];B[hq];W[hr];B[gp];W[kq];B[gr];W[ir];B[fq]C[AB: I feel this move is necessary, but White gets a good position on both sides...

-> even worse: you end in gote and strengthening white on the lower side hurts your stone at the lower right hoshi.
See the variation for the correct joseki moves, that anyway I think that is not good here.]

(;W[nq];B[pn];W[nc];B[qf];W[jd];B[cf];W[de];B[bd]C[Usual joseki here, but because of the marked stone I'm not sure that it's good anymore.
Maybe someting else should be better.
See later analysis, unfortunately I've no conclusion besides pointing out the difficulty of this damned game ...]
;W[ch];B[df];W[ce];B[be];W[cc];B[bg];W[ef];B[dh];W[eg]C[Up to here is joseki, but there are some issues with the lower left corner. 
The followup I suggest keeps on the joseki and tries to follow a pro game.
See comments in the game.]
(;B[ci]LB[di:A][eh:B]C[Normal joseki move is A, because now white B is sente, and you don't want white getting more influence at the top.
White has to make this exchange quite soon as it will help in any fight going to the center, and maybe during the fight it will be  no more sente as other bigger things are hanging.
On the other hand, lower left stones could settle nicely.];W[ne]
;B[og]LB[pb:A][nb:B]C[Usual continuation here is A, threatening B.
This is really very big.
The problem with your move is that neither protects right side nor reduces upper side.
It has good follow up at the right, but not at the top, so white can invade without fear.
In the variation I will try to aply a reducing sequence I've found in a Lee ChangHo's game, but I'm not sure it's best here.
It's from 2001-11-07 Samsung cup against Chang Hao.];W[ql];B[rm]

;W[mo];B[mn];W[ln];B[mm];W[qi];B[rl]LB[pk:A]C[AB: I'm unsure here, I feel this move is big, but it also helps White...

-> As yose move is enormous, and it takes away white's base, so even if  it's not the severest attack on white, I think it should work.
Now the more important thing is to setup a good reduction for the upper side, and this weak group must be the key to get enough thickness to help in the reduction.
Maybe the traditional peep at A is better.];W[qk]C[A bit heavy maybe.]
;B[mk]LB[nk:A][oi:B]C[I think that A would be more severe.
B is another interesting point to keep white eyeless.];W[ni]
;B[mg];W[li];B[kg];W[le]LB[kj:A]C[Too risky, and not really necessary.
I would play at A instead.
Before proceeding, lets see white's shape weak points:]
(;B[kj]C[Good !]
(;W[lh]C[This peep is doubious, as later a cut here could be possible, and white is reinforcing black while losing one liberty.]

Must cut.];W[ji];B[ke];W[kd];B[if];W[he];B[hj]LB[hh:A][eh:B]
C[Maybe to keep the attack with A is better, but to kill the white group is not easy.
Again it's obvious that a previuos white move at B would be very usefull !!]
;W[hh]C[Now not only the white group is out, but white can think about playing at upper right 3-3 and black wuold have to be carefull.]
;B[oi];W[nh];B[ng];W[oh];B[qh];W[rh];B[ph];W[pi];B[lo];W[mq]

(;B[ko];W[jo]C[AB: I missed that one...

-> empty triangles are always suspect, sometimes they are good, but it's unlikely. Look always for another way to achieve your aim, and double check them if you don't find another move before playing.
I see some possibilities, and the sacrifice seems the best.]
;B[kn];W[jn]
(;B[km]C[There are bigger moves on the board !
And white takes them with next 2 moves.
See variation.];W[pb];B[qc];W[dq]C[AB: Now there is no more weakness in White's position, I feel the game is hopeless for me....

-> agreed, upper side is too big and last move secures a nice corner.]

;B[pb];W[ob];B[oc]C[I think that this is as optimistic as black can get.]

The black group is in big danger !!
And letting white connect at the top to make life quickly is an enormous loss.]
