Review for:

Sub0 (white) <sub0kgs@gmail.com>.


Review to move 100.

You were pretty far ahead for most of the game, you made too many needless risks.

Cut when you can cut, and try to make a few less over plays.  

If you are ahead, just play calmly, it is ok for you opponent to get territory too.]

There are variation to the follow up here.  Allot of it can be designed to your strengths.

A and B are both playable.  
B guarantees life and removed the aji from f17.

A is a great extenstion for influence.

I do not disagree with l17, as I have played it before with good results.  Any higher would be a problem because r17 stone.]
;B[jp]LB[pd:A][qj:B][qp:C]TR[qc][oq]C[black has a good moyo going now and k4 is a large move for influence.  Once black gets at shimari at q5, it will be lots of territory.  even with a move at q11 or r9, black will have an advantage.

As white, you jumped to A.  I would negate territory at r10 or r4.

i have always preferred larger and slightly over extended moves.]
