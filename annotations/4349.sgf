C[Hello MissesOrMisterALotBetterThanMe,
This game was played on kgs and I didn't recognized any lagging of the server. I (JGurgeh) played white and offered this japanese rule-set match with the time setting of 30 minutes + 5 1 minute extra periods.
Recently when I play like this, I don't reach the extra periods. I feel like I don't use the time enough, because I have a lack of ideas where to place stones.
Thanks in advance that you take some time to review this match.

vlkplk: That N16 is not joseki means simply, that it is not considered to be the best move for this situation.  I`m not sure, but to call a sequence to be joseki, means that it is the best one considering situation over all board, not just in the corner.

Particularly, in this situation, N16 might not be joseki, because 1)it allows black to slide into the corner easily, 2) the distance between wall which white is building and white stone at R13 is too small to be called effective enough. But its hard to say. 3) even 1) and 2) it`s hard to say, it`s clear that the SHAPE which would white stones have formed by playing at P17, looks much more `nice`.]

(;W[md];B[ld];W[cn]C[vlkplk: White played tenuki in upper right corner, but I feel it would have been better to continue there. With W P17 instead of N16, the tenuki would seem ok.]

Distance of white`s C11 stones is proper I think, even though I would prefere to play it one line up, at D12. In the corner, some weak points are left, white can utilize captured stone H2, when time comes.]

Now it is quite too late for doing anything here. Maybe, simply haneh at Q1 in senteh. Reamining weakness forces black to connect, so white gets senteh. That`s all white can get now.]

vlkplk: I wouldn`t say that it`s impolite in general. You may test your opponent at any time. That it `obviously` doesn`t work is not an sufficient reasoning. Sometimes situtation which seems `obvious` for both players would appear as not a such in later.

It could be called `impolite` if you make such testing moves when your opponent is in short of time or when you (mis)use some extra-game circumstances.]

vlkplk: It may sometimes not to seem so big, but at endgame stage of a match, you can get/loose surprisingly many points, especially in the corners and sides. But endgame theory is quite complicated, I even didn`t try yet to study it much. Generaly, best is to: try connect/don`t allow to be disconnected, haneh in the corners and sides are quite big, you should think about senteh or half-senteh every time (not in the endgame, ofcourse).]
