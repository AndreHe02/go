C[Hello!  Thank you for reviewing this game for me.  My name is NathanA and I am playing white here.

Ilya: Hello! I'll prefix my comments with my name. I hope my review will help you to improve your strength.

The game was lost mainly because of the bad sequence on the left side. After it black was noticeably ahead. Your main mistakes there were not finishing a joseki on the 14th move and starting a premature 3-3 invasion on the 20th move. I suspect that your main problem is that you overestimate strength of your stones while underestimating strength of your opponent's stones. For example you considered that you can capture black stones on the left side while it was a rather long short. And you didn't saw that it is actually white who is weak after that 3-3 invasion in the top right corner.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[df];B[id];W[po]C[I figured since I already had presence in two corners preventing a shimari here was big.

Ilya: Yes, looks like a rather standard move for this fuseki.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm]LB[pn:A]C[This seemed like a sequence I have seen in pro games before.  I am not sure I took advantage of what this sequence is supposed to offer or even if it is standard.  It seems a reasonable enough way to get influence both to along the side preparing for an extension and into the center, as well as limiting black.

Ilya: This or A is a correct move. Both of them start a joseki. The problem is that you don't finish it.]
;B[nq];W[qf]LB[pi:A][on:B]TR[pm][qn][po]C[I played this approach thinking black would defend the corner and I could play 'A' or something.

Ilya: This is quite unreasonable. White should finish the joseki with a move at A. The move you played allows black to play at A himself. This looks like an ideal spot - it prevents the ideal extension from the marked white group and works as a pincer. Besides it is high enough to run in the center if white starts a counter attack.

Perhaps black can also play kikashi first at B before A. See variation on the next move.]

(;B[qh]
(;W[of]LB[qj:A]TR[pm][qn][po]C[Maybe a second pincer would have been better. 'A' maybe.

Ilya: It looks playable. White should be able to connect all stones on the right side. It seem like an easy way to stabilize white stones. See variation.]
;B[nd];W[oh];B[ql];W[qc]LB[pc:A][qd:B][pj:D][rn:C]TR[qh][ql]
C[At this point I expected to be able to kill the two marked black stones and that I would get the corner as it would surely be to blacks advantage to block at 'A' rather than 'B'

Ilya: In positions like this B is the only move for black. Consider what happens if black blocks at A. White connects the corner with B to white stones on the right side and gets comfortable position on that side. Black only gets some influence oriented towards the top side. Compare this with actual play where white corner gets locked in and black gets walls oriented towards both sides.

And of course the marked black stones are hardly captured yet. As you see later in the game it is possible to connect one of them to the bottom right corner with C. Even if it were not possible there are also moves like D which would connect the marked black stones and allow to either run in the center or make a life on the left side.

In summary the 3-3 invasion was premature - it weakened your stones on the right side a lot.]
;B[qd]C[Although this came as a surprise I felt confident I could make life.

Ilya: It shouldn't be a problem to make a life here but end result is quite bad for you for the reasons I described earlier.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]
(;W[pa]LB[rd:A]C[Ilya: Perhaps playing at A first is better. See variation.]
;B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[sb];B[na];W[pb];B[rf]C[I would appreciate some commentary about the sequence that follows here on the side.  It is clearly a significant part of why I lost.

Ilya: You already did the damage to your position with the 3-3 invasion. Probably the only way to minimize the loss is connecting your groups like in the actual game.]

(;W[qj]LB[re:A][rg:B][pi:D][rn:C]TR[ql]C[This felt key to seperate black.  I still believed I could cut either at 'A' or 'B' so playing here seemed apropriate to prevent life inside.

Ilya: these cuts don't work. See variation. And marked stone can be connected via C. Overall you misreading the position. Black don't have to worry about life - it is white who is weak here. Perhaps your best strategy is to connect your stones as separated they'll get under severe black's attack.

To make a connection the move you played is bad as black can easily cut at D. In the actual game black allowed you to connect but you were just lucky.]
;B[rn];W[pl]LB[qm:B][rm:A]C[I played this because 'A' seemed to fail. 'B' didn't seem much better.]
;B[pi];W[qg]C[I'm not sure why I played this.  It may have been a misclick.]
;B[rg];W[ph];B[qi];W[pk]
(;B[qk]LB[oj:A]TR[pk][pl][pm][qn][po]C[Ilya: Black could play at A and separate your stones. Marked group will become a target of attacks.]
;W[oi];B[pj];W[oj];B[fq];W[hp]LB[cn:C][dn:A][jp:B]TR[qo][qp]
[nq][pq]C[Played this because I wanted same sort of thing that happened on right to me to happen to him here.  I.e. if I were to play 'A' he would just play 'B' or something.

Ilya: While I?m not sure about the best move here you are certainly wrong to expect "same sort of thing". If you compare the positions you'll see that marked group is very strong so the current position is very different compared with what you had on the right side.

It is quite hard for me to find a good move here. Myself I?d play A or C. It doesn't look it is possible for black to take all bottom side under control with just one move (like B) and you have a lot of influence in the center thanks to the white wall on the right side so later an invasion on the bottom side should be possible.]
;B[cq];W[dq]TR[hp]C[I decided sealing black in and getting outside thickness especially with the marked stone seemed a good strategy.

Ilya: It is not possible to seal black in this position. In the joseki which I'll show later black gets big corner and has further play on the right side. Also you made a joseki mistake which I'll show later so black got even more than normally is being expected.]
;B[cp]
(;W[co]TR[fq]C[Ilya: This is an overplay quite common even among single digit kui players. Many players confuse this position with ordinary 3-3 invasion but here marked stone makes big difference. Proper play is shown in the variation.]
;B[cr]C[Ilya: This is one way to punish the overplay.];W[dr]
;B[do];W[eo];B[dn];W[fp];B[cm]LB[cn:C][ep:A][fp:B]TR[dp][dq]
[dr]C[Ilya: Compare this with the joseki variation. I hope it is clear that if you played C instead of A then black move at B would catch marked stones.]

(;W[kq];B[ci]TR[kq]C[It seems to me now it would have been better if I had traded these two moves with black.  He doesn't really need to respond to my move and I dont lose that much if he plays there whereas the reverse is true for his.  He gains quite alot, forces me to respond and is hemming my corner in.

Ilya: Frankly you already playing lost game. Black is noticeably ahead in the territory. If you played on the top side instead then black doesn't have to answer too and would able to profit on the bottom side. These two moves look like a miami. See variation couple moves earlier.]

(;W[dk]LB[ck:A]TR[cm][dn]C[Thought I could cut through here and would punish black for an excessive extension.

Ilya: Black played the ideal extension from the second stone wall. There is nothing to punish. You cannot cut here even if you played at A. See variation.]

;B[bj];W[di];B[dj]C[My opponent pointed out afterwards that this ko is probably not worth fighting for me.

Ilya: Well, black doesn't lose much if you win the ko but for you results are quite bad in case if you lose it. So yes, you'd better not starting it.]

There's no ladder - so you don't have to worry about ladder breaker. See variation on the next move.]

(;B[mp]
(;W[lo];B[kp];W[ko]C[I decided with all this thickness facing the center on two sides it seemed foolish to just let it's value evaporate so I decided it would be worth it to trade the lower edge for virtually secure territory in the center.  A better strategy was probably available.

Ilya: As I counted in total you got about 58 pts of the center territory at the end of the game. To make it you sacrificed around 12 pts on the bottom and allowed black to turn all upper side in secure territory. So end result is 46 pts for you. I belive it is suboptimal usage of your influence in the center. See variation a move earlier which shows a better strategy.]

Black gained more here - playing for a territory in the center was a bad strategy. I'll not review end of the game in details as you are clearly lost already.]

[jg][kg][ih]C[After three attempts to reduce this upper black territory without much success I realized the only way I would win would be to invade and live here either by killing a piece of the wall or by living inside.  Kinda a long shot but it seems like it's about all I've got.

Ilya: Seems to late. It is impossible to make a life here unless your opponent makes a huge mistake. This invasion should be started before black enclosed this side. I.e. before the marked stones were played.]
;B[nc];W[md];B[lg];W[mb];B[oe];W[ma];B[nf]C[It was probably a mistake to allow this.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[jd];B[kc];W[ie]C[I debated this alittle bit.  An atari seemed appropriate just didn't know which side was best.

Ilya: It doesn't really matter. Unless I'm missing something there is no way for white to profit on the top side.]

[js]C[Ilya: There's about 40 pts of the territory in the marked area. In the actual game you've got just 46 pts in total in the center (after the loss on the bottom is substructed). This is almost safe territory already where you don't have spend many moves enclosing it. In other words your hands are free for the invasion on the top side which would erase many black's points on the top side. The balance would be shifted in your favor compared with the actual play. As a rule influence is most useful to support attacks or invasions.

In the actual game you had to spend moves to enclose your center territory which allowed black to secure the top side.]
