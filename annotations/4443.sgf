;B[qo];W[dj];B[kq]LB[jq:C][iq:B][fq:A]C[Here you can play farther I think, maybe play A, and if white simply defends develop the bottom, or directly B or C to build bigger. 

I might be wrong, but I like A at once : it aims for playing a move on the 4th line then at the bottom. After your move, when you come to A your bottom is flat, it's a bit annoying.]
;W[jd]C[I am not sure where should i play now.];B[pj]C[this is a good point]
;W[jj];B[fq]C[here you're wishing very hard that your L3 stone is around K4, J4 ... :)]
;W[cn];B[fo];W[qf]C[I think i should fight, so I go ahead and R15

Is 017 better?

R15 looks ok ; as long as you keep his group weak, you can chase him and enter his moyo, and hopefully build your own moyo.]
;B[qe];W[pf]
(;B[qh]C[but this doesn't look right]
(;W[nd]C[this feels really wrong];B[oe];W[ph]
(;B[qi];W[ng]
(;B[og]SQ[ph]C[What is my aim in this position ? I think it's a question worth asking before every move :)

As I said, you need to keep his group weak. His marked stone is not worth much anymore, so it's just here to help the connection and can be sacrificated without damage.]
;W[of]
(;B[pg];W[qg]LB[ne:A]C[here, I would even say that the best is to abandon your 2 stones ... it would give strength to his weak group, but the attack is missed anyway ... so maybe playing at A to prevent him from getting a wall, enclosing your corner and making territory at the top, playing at A would be best.]
;B[oh];W[ne]TR[ng][nf][nd]LB[ph:A]C[this ends in complete failure : you captured a stone which is only worth 2 points :( 
While his goup is connected, and he has a wall towards his moyo ; moreover your corner is still weak.]
;B[oc];W[od]LB[nc:A]C[looks wrong : descending at A would keep sente and give him a great position.]
;B[qc]C[I didn't gain anything.

Indeed.];W[nc];B[dr];W[cq];B[dl]LB[kl:B][lk:A]C[Interesting move. Hard to say how to enter his huge framework, or maybe you can build your own around A or B or ... ?]
;W[dm];B[el];W[cl];B[bm];W[bl];B[fc]LB[cc:A]C[maybe you can go for the san-san ; hard to tell.]
;W[ec];B[fe];W[df];B[ce];W[de];B[cc];W[cd]SQ[fe]LB[fd:1][eb:A]
C[if your marked stone had been on 1, A would be the normal move ; it doesn't invade the corner, but settles a bit your group, which is very big in this kind of position. 

Here I think A is still ok.];B[dc];W[eb];B[ed]LB[fb:A]C[My bad. Naive move

Well, you cannot gain more now anyway than a sente move at A, it's ok. I think white should play here right now to prevent your move there.]
;W[bc];B[db];W[cb];B[fb];W[da];B[ic]C[ok, if you manage to settle without problem it's already a result ; you could not have hoped for much more.]
;W[jc];B[ib];W[id];B[hd];W[jb]LB[he:A]C[this move in A feels big for both]
;B[nb]LB[he:A]C[this is a bit strange ; I like A to make your group defeinitely alive and completely erase his center.]
;W[ob]LB[pb:A]C[here if you payed the hane, the follow-up would be A to play a dangerous ko ...]
;B[pc];W[mb];B[pb]LB[lp:B][he:A]C[once again, playing A in sente and then entering your moyo (on B ?) looks a lot bigger.]
;W[na];B[hf];W[he];B[ie];W[hc];B[ge]C[I thought of sacrifising the 2 stones to gain entrace to the middle of the board

ok, no problem. You seem almost alive, and center influence is very important here with your moyo on the bottom, and some invasion to try on the left side]
;W[hb];B[hi];W[jf];B[je];W[ke];B[dh]LB[lp:A]C[Nice sequence.

For white here, to invade, the shoulder hit of A is a leisurly manoeuver to reduce your territory without creating a too weak group. That's one problem of being low and flat at the bottom.]

(;W[iq];B[jo];W[gp];B[fp];W[hn];B[ho];W[io];B[ip];W[hp]C[I don't know how to answer this kind of move.

you don't have the choice here, you must take. You gain strenght towards the left, where you still have a moyo, and a ko to threaten white with.]
;B[in];W[go];B[gn];W[io]C[... but you don't have ko threats :(]
;B[jp];W[hm];B[ho];W[fn];B[gm];W[io];B[en];W[im];B[ho];W[gl]
;B[fm];W[io]TR[fq][fo][fp]LB[kl:B][jn:A]C[ok, here your marked group is not entierely alive, but strong enough for you to play elsewhere apparently : playing two move to close your moyo on the lower right, like connect A then B to keep the attack against the weak group, or something to enclose more solidly your territory, might be ok.

I think after A, and then B if he connects the connects the ko, you're ok.]
;B[kf]C[making this group clearly alive is big as well.];W[jn]
C[now white's group is almost alive and your moyo reduced, this is painful.]
;B[kd]LB[le:A]C[this looks like a mistake. atari the other way with A was a bit better.]
;W[le];B[jg];W[nh]C[I'm not sure this is big enough ; defending your lower right or completing the invasion of left side would be bigger.]
;B[oi];W[mp];B[mq];W[nq];B[np];W[lq];B[mr];W[lp];B[lr];W[no]
;B[op];W[oo]SQ[jn]CR[dr][el][fm][en][fq][fp][fo]TR[lq][lp][mp]
[no]LB[dh:1][kn:B][ln:A]C[this is not a great result for white : his invading stones are not connected to his strong group, you can aim at A or B to attack them (they have no basis), and you have sente. Trying to attack both your "round" group and your invading stone "1" would have been more promising.]
;B[ej]C[This is the right place];W[di];B[ei];W[pp];B[oq];W[po]
;B[qp];W[kp];B[jq];W[rf]LB[ch:A]C[if this doesn't threaten your corner, then c12 looks bigger]
;B[ir]
(;W[hr]C[this is bad ; see the attack of corner in variation]
;B[hq];W[gq]
(;B[iq]C[oops ; see variation to save some points and definitely make your left group alive.]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[cr];B[kn]C[ok, this is good ; white is in trouble ; his invasion of your bottom right was not a  success.]
;W[km];B[mo]C[White was careless and I was lucky.

Actually, connecting his groups at the cost of 8 points is good for him.]
;W[ln];B[lo];W[mn];B[ko];W[nm];B[pn];W[om];B[on];W[nn];B[pm]
;W[si]C[white could still begin in your top right corner, I think it might kill, and anyway it's sente ...]
;B[ri];W[sj]LB[sh:A]C[this is a pointless move, it is not necessary for the double hane he plays afterwards, so connecting at A would be normal.]
;B[sh];W[pl];B[ql];W[qm];B[qn];W[qk];B[rl];W[pk];B[rk];W[sg]
;B[rh];W[sc]LB[sd:A][rb:B]C[playing at A, as in a previous variation, or even maybe at B looks more dangerous.]
;B[rc];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[sd];W[pa];B[qa];W[ra];B[qb];W[qd]
;B[sb];W[eg]LB[eh:A]C[connecting here looks biggest, as white would be in trouble to protect his territory, even in gote.]
;B[mj];W[nk]LB[eh:A]C[cutting at A instead is better I think.]
;B[fk]LB[mj:1][eh:A]C[Your stone 1 was big, but this looks ver small ; definitely you need to play A.]
;W[gj]LB[eh:A];B[gk];W[hk];B[hj];W[ij];B[eh]C[ah ! :)];W[ch]
TR[di][dj]LB[cg:A]C[hane at A was possible as well, due to the shortage of liberties of the marked stones ; maybe it was a bit bigger.]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[ef]C[ok, this is big for you.];W[ee];B[fg];W[fd]
;B[gc];W[ni];B[nj];W[oj]C[this is senseless];B[ok];W[ol];B[oj]

;W[ck];B[gb];W[ia];B[gd]LB[cs:A]C[? this is not necessary. hane at A is big here, but anyway you're a bit behind. The problem was the sequence at the beginning, in the top right. When your moyo is invaded, always try to keep his group weak and separated from his other stones. You played well afterwards and began to catch up, but it was too much.]
