C[i played black in this game];B[gg];W[cd];B[fc];W[dg];B[dc]
;W[cc]C[white is happy whith this exchange because he secures the corner
and strengthens the whole left side.  black should try to keep the option
of playing 3,3 himself.];B[ge]C[solid territory making move, securing the right side.
it's now almost  an endgame battle.];W[ee]C[not so big territorially but strengthens left side and creates aji
at top.];B[eh]C[pretty big. black should also consider playing d2.
now white should block at d2, leaving no aji for black.];W[db]
C[black should consider d2 here, since it has a huge followup at c3
(even if white blocks at c2)];B[eb];W[dd];B[ec];W[da]C[bad shape. if white wants to defend it should be solid at c8,
leaving no weaknesses or sente moves for black.];B[ea]C[should be saved as ko threat. also, in rare circumstances black may
want to play b8 instead and try to kill white.];W[cb];B[ci]
C[my opponent said this was a bad move, why?

it's not obviously bad here, but he said that
because either black d2 or c2 is ausually better;
c2 taking more away, and d2 leaving less aji.];W[dh];B[di];W[fh]
C[this looks like overplay];B[eg]C[is this the right move?
sure.];W[fg];B[ff]C[is e4 better?

looks like it.];W[ef];B[ei];W[gh];B[df];W[cg]C[i think white shld just c4. now black might play c4 at the right time.]

(;B[hg]C[better at h2];W[hh];B[bh];W[bg];B[ih];W[ah];B[hi];W[fe]
;B[gf];W[gd]C[is there anyway i could have prevented this?
play h2 earlier:)];B[fd]C[balck g7 instead is safer];W[gc];B[gb]
;W[hb];B[hd];W[hc]C[this exchange is never good for black];B[ha]
;W[he]C[clearly black would be better off without h6-h7 exchange]
