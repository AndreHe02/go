RE[W+69.50]

C[I think both players played a pretty sophisticated game considering their ranks.  For white I would recommend incorporating the "kakari" approach instead of these high distant moves.  They won't do enough for you in the middle and they don't take enough away from the corner.  Black in this game, several times made moves of little or no value.  And both players ignored a move, the double approach on f-16 for a very long time.  In fact it was never made.  This is an excellent mistake though!  It is easily correctable and it gives me an idea of what you need to do to improve.  When  a person doesn't answer your approach move especially a high distant one, think about the double approach.  If you want to see examples look at the games between the old masters games like Shusaku and Shuei.  For some reason their opponents seemed to get into those situations a lot.  I highly suggest you play over professional games like this.  Don't overlook the older players (Shusai and earlier) either, sometimes their games can be even more instructive than the modern masters. Find them at Gobase.org.  Keep sending in games too!]

(;B[jd]C[This is a little unusual.  p-16 is the usual move.  See the variation.]

(;W[hp]C[Again a little unusual.  I dont see anything wrong with f-3.]
;B[pc]C[This is a little close.  Again p-16 was the move and you will end up with something similar to what I showed earlier.]
;W[dm]C[These moves are so distant black could even consider playing away and try to gain an advantage elsewhere.  But responding is is good too.]

(;B[gp]C[This contact play will only help white get stronger.  f-3 or f-4 seem natural.]
;W[go];B[fo]LB[fp:a]C[At "a" was a little better.];W[fp];B[gq]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[hn];B[fq]C[Black ends in gote and white has substational thickness.]

(;W[dg]C[In Go the most important and hardest thing to do is try to find the optimum relationship between all of your stones.  Here I understand white is trying to play distantly to avoid a pincer and make a large amount of territory along the left side.  However this plan is flawed.  Black can still easily erase this territory.  If you wanted to establish side territory I would suggest playing tighter and lower, perhaps c-11.  The thing you have to understand is that thickness is flexible, it might become profit or it can be used for other things.  Probably your opponent will get worried if you start getting a lot of it and try to attack it.  You can then use it to attack him in turn because thick groups like the one on g5 tend to be hard to kill.  Therefore my move would probably be c-14.]
;B[qn];W[on];B[qp];W[po]TR[on]C[I can hardly suggest better.  Proabably p-6 (the marked stone) was an innapropriate response here.]

(;W[of]C[Unecessary.  Probably you are familar with the "table shape."  This is an excellent shape to make when you are trying to make eyes for a weak group.  However these stones are not weak at all.  Just make territory with r-11]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[pr];W[or]C[p-2 is pretty small when you factor in that black has an open skirt to the left.]

;B[pl];W[nm];B[ol]C[Black 75 is worthless.];W[ok]C[Both players are making very small moves.  The best move is around f-16 for both.  Locally the best move would be around r-11 or r-10.]
;B[pk];W[oj]C[r-11 is still better for white.  Why did you play p-10.  You are not making very  many points if any, you are not attacking a weak group or making life for a weak group of your own.]
;B[pj]C[r-11 is faster.]
(;W[pi]C[The territory in this sector is badly ruined for white now and this move, locally at least, is probably acceptable.  Although f-17 is still big.  See the variation.]
;B[kj]C[I guess this move reduces white's little moyo that's beggining to form.  Wouldn't n-16 do that too and help defend though?]

(;W[el];B[em]C[Obviously bad.];W[fl];B[dn]C[Locally the proper move would have been c-6.  d-6 is practically pointless.]
