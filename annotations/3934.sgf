C[Chris: Hi!
About 5 months ago it felt to me that I actually got  worse than I was before. I had a break from Go for 3 months and started playing again a couple of weeks ago. Now, people I used to beat easily seem to pose an un-breakable barrier.

I am posting this game with all questions I have because I feel that it might represent the fundametal error in my thinking.

Please help me uncover this fundamental flaw.

Thank you in advance.

of course];W[dq];B[jq]LB[bo:A][nq:B][dn:C]C[Chris: I was considering A but I wanted to get a foot in there quickly, hoping I could bring the stone at B into good use. Also if I played A I was a bit afraid of white playing C in sente, and completely killing my pincer stone. I felt that when I played the pincer I had to make use of it now as for it not to be completely useless.]

C[white gained from this exchange];B[gr];W[hr]C[Chris: Was this exchange correct? I thought it would give me a couple of sente moves to exploit later.]
;B[fc]LB[en:A]C[Chris: Now here a real big problem for me. I was wondering if I should save my cutting stones at A. But I thought Whites groups on both sides were too strong for it to be any useful. I do not think I have any chance of attacking either and all I would do is give white more terretory/influence.]

(;W[ek]C[useless move]
(;B[cf]C[Chris: Is the double kakari ok here? I am not so sure now, as it gave me a weak group and black 43 wasnt of much use...]

C[ok, i will stop comment here
althrough you live in top left, overall position is bad
You fighted well later, so result was almost close game];W[ok]
;B[nr]C[Chris: The whole fight in the top left together with me being shut in small in the bottom right gave White a very respectable moyo. I felt that a reduction wouldnt be enough. Is an invasion correct here (considering I am trying to fix earlier mistakes).]
