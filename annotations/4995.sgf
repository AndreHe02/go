C[Dear reviewer,



in this game I played white as TL and ask for the review. I will mark my quesions with "TL:".]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[pk];W[nc];B[qf];W[jd];B[de]LB[fq:A]
C[janr: I prefer the kakari at A as the game move invites a strong pincer]
;W[dg];B[cc]C[janr: this is usually not a good idea as white can make a wall]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[ee];B[df]LB[ed:C][ce:A][ef:D][bg:B]C[janr: black will get another hane on the top of two stones.  It is better to connect at A and after white D extend to B and aim at the cut at C]
;W[ef];B[cg];W[ch];B[bf];W[dh];B[fp];W[dn]LB[po:B][qo:C][hq:A]
C[TL:

Is that the right direction or should I rather pincer at A or play kakari at B or C?

janr: white seems ok];B[jp];W[qo]LB[po:A]C[TL:

This one or better at A?

janr: I usually play A, but this is possible too];B[op]LB[qp:A]
C[janr: blacks answer is soft, giving white ample space to live.  Black should consider the tsuke at A to make white heavier]
;W[qm];B[pn];W[rk];B[qj];W[pm];B[om];W[ol];B[on]LB[pl:A]C[janr: I would cut at A]
;W[pl]C[janr: the result looks successful for white];B[qn];W[rn]
;B[nj]LB[rm:A][qn:C][ro:B]C[janr: if black does not intend to cut at A or B, he should not play the (aji-keshi) at C]
;W[nl]LB[oj:B][ml:A]C[TL:

Is it better to jump out at A? Now I felt quite comfortable because I managed to seal in the upper left corner group and jumped out in the center with my group to the right. At that point I thought that I should be able to win the game. Is it really in my favor so far? If so, what went wrong afterwards?

janr: I think white is (slightly) ahead.
A would prefer A, it can not be cut due to blacks weakness at B. The difference is probably not big.]
;B[rp];W[rj]C[janr: I would solidly connect.  It keeps aji in the corner, and makes white's group stable.

The game move makes white stable, and is nearly sente, so it should be good too.]
;B[jj];W[fq]LB[rj:A][ro:B]C[TL:

I tried to expand my corner, but somehow this move immediately felt dubious. Do you see better alternatives?

janr: black did not answer A, so there is a big follow-up
Blacks biggest territory is at the bottom. A successful invasion may make white's lead larger.
The game move seems to strengthen black.  If black can make his bottom territory and invade the top, things may become more uncertain.]
;B[cq];W[cp]LB[dq:A]C[TL:

Better at A?];B[eq];W[ep];B[dq];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[go]
LB[er:A]C[White ends in gote, but the result is not that bad for white, as blacks bottom side potential has been reduced by the white influence.]
;B[ao];W[bn];B[ri]
(;W[qi]C[TL:

I tried to create aji.];B[pi];W[qh];B[rh]LB[qi:A][ro:B]C[janr: Is still prefer B above A.  It would leave more endgame aji.]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[rl]LB[rl:A][sn:C][ro:B]C[TL:

Is that too passive?

janr: white played a lot of aji-keshi, making black strong.  Playing at A invites black to play B in sente, as white will play C to make A work for 2 eyes.]
;B[ro];W[so];B[ie]
(;W[id]LB[je:A]C[janr: there is an alternative to reduce blacks influence]
;B[he];W[hd];B[ld]C[janr: black tries to flatten white and take the center]
;W[lc]C[TL:

Feels a little docile, but I di not find anything better. Any suggestions?]

(;B[kc]LB[md:A]C[janr: I'd prefer A];W[kd];B[mc];W[lb];B[md]
;W[mb];B[nd];W[kf];B[ih]LB[oc:A]C[janr: A is good too];W[pb]
;B[oc];W[nb];B[fj]
(;W[jr]LB[cb:I][bg:B][bh:C][rh:H][ek:A][an:J][ro:G][ap:K][sp:F]
[rq:E][er:D]C[TL:

I thought that I would become overconcentrated if I had answered at A. Is K2 really biggest and best?

janr: playing sente at B has been valuable already for a while.  It makes C gote
Moreover, D may be sente (depending on whether white wants to give a few points on the left).
E (or F) is quite big too.

I feel that if black can reduce too much white's left, white can lose.  We should consider that G, and H were two good points that partially compensate for blacks mistakes earlier.

So maybe white should think carefully on timing.  There are a lot of possibilities.  The game move is certainly a big gote point, but I would prefer to take as much sente as possible first.
I added some variations.];B[kq];W[iq]LB[kr:A]C[TL:

Better at A instead?
janr: yes, this seems too slow];B[qc]LB[db:A]C[janr: first play sente (e.g. A)]
;W[bg]LB[db:A]C[TL:

I wanted to close the "open skirt" in sente, but this move just was not sente. Should I have played A instead?]
;B[cf];W[bh];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc];B[kr]C[janr: as white just made his left side larger (at the cost of endgame at the top), black may consider reducing it further.]
;W[ek]C[TL:

Bigger moves elsewhere?];B[ej];W[dj];B[fk];W[el];B[lg];W[lf]
;B[mf];W[kg];B[lh];W[kh];B[lj]
(;W[qp]LB[mm:A][sp:C][rq:B]C[TL:

This move does not work at all, I hallucinated.

Better at A as in the variation?

A is big.  But I prefer B, as black C will be sente if white does not play it.]
;B[rq];W[if];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh];W[ks];B[ls];W[js];B[mr];W[ob]
LB[rb:A]C[janr: thisis not very big
locally, A is better];B[mm]LB[ml:B][jn:A]C[TL:

I did not dare to jump to A. Do you see any better way to reduce black's center moyo?

janr: I think B may be a good probe.]

Thank you for taking your time.

janr: I think white's opening was good, but in the middle game and the endgame he did not pay enough attention to sente and gote.  sente (or reverse sente) moves are more urgent, especially if the follow-up to "not answering the sente move" is big.
Moves A-E are typical endgame points which you'd like to play as early as possible.  Especially D,A (and B?) because they threaten to kill.]

(;W[an];B[as];W[ar]C[TL:

If white wins the ko, black is dead by "bent four in the corner", right?
janr: it is a direct ko
we only say "bent four in the corner" if the ko should be fought at the end of the game (which does not happen under japanese rules).]
