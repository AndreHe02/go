C[Hello!
This is very strange game. Just after fuseki I had some big gains. I've captured 2 groups and turned 2 of my moyos into big territories. To be honest I was wondering why my opponent didn't resign.
I did not make a big error til the end. WHY DID I LOSE WITH 20 POINTS??
Was my evaluation of the position so bad?

I'd also like you to comment on any other error you see.

Regards
Tomasz

Dear Tomasz,
Your evaluation of the position was not good indeed. Furthermore your opponent played a very good endgame. If you improve these two points, you'll soon be a lot stronger.]

(;W[ed]C[F: There is not much hope to live here, but this surely isn't the best way.]

(;B[hd]C[F: But here you're going the wrong way. By giving up six stones, white manages to live wit the rest. See variation]

(;B[ef]C[F: Bad shape]
(;W[dc];B[cd];W[eb];B[ej]C[This is the moment I was telling about. I thought I was far ahead.

F: If you had killed the whole white group, things would be different. 
But in general,  what you have  to do to evaluate is to count:
Black has: 
-36 points at the left (including prisoners)
-21 points at the upper side
White has:
- 2 points upper left
- 10 points upper right

So you're 45 points ahead, but as you said, white has two shimaris. If you count 15 points for each shimari, the difference is reduced to 15 points, which is not that big. If you count 20 points for each shimari, the difference is only 5 points.  Presuming you split up the bottom,  everything depends on what follows. If you're overconfident of winning, you might play slack moves next.]
