C[Hi, thanks for reviewing!  I'm white in this game.  I took about a month break from go, and this is my first game back.  I expected to be a bit rusty and it showed in my fuseki.]

Q8 or M4 are the common josekis];B[pl];W[qq]C[here's where things kinda started to fall apart.  I let black cut me off from the center from this area and he got incredible influence while I got the small corner.

This move is a trick move.]

;W[qf];B[qi];W[qc]C[I debatedabout this for awhile, I knew that if I invaded black would get a huge wall on the entire right side and that he would turn almost all of it into territory.  I didn't want to jump out  around p14 because I didn't want to create a weak group in an already strong black area.  So I decided to take the 4th corner.

After all, taking 4 corners means white automatically wins right? ^_^

Try telling takemiya that, and see if he agrees =P];B[qd];W[pc]

score estimate at this point of time by computer is useless]
