C[Thank you for reviewing!

i was white in this game, especially, can you criticise the fuseki stage and black's 57th move and so on...

Of course, i'll be  very happy if you have time to do the whole review!

Thanks again,

Best,

Dakre: Hello ;) i hope you find this commentary useful... i especially concentrated on the fuseki and move 57, as you asked for. I tried to stick to the things i am very sure about, because i am only a KGS 2d and a stronger player may say "ooohh noo, what is he doing???" :> so i want to avoid that and didn't comment on everything which came to my mind, but i hope you have enough to read ;)

 If you have any questions left, just ask. I am happy to get any feedback ;)

at the end there is a short summary of the commentary and things you should remember.]

[cn:A]C[Dakre: usual fuseki... you chose a good point to reduce the potential framework of the black chinese fuseki... A, B and C would have been other possibilities in such a situation, but your move is fine... it wants to develop a moyo at the top side... so this is the side, which is most valueable now.]
;B[cf]LB[nc:A][od:B]C[Dakre: This seems to be a bad move for black... black must approach the upper right corner, i think... for example at A... B seems possible, too... but this just by the way, because you're white ;)]
;W[ch]LB[fc:B][fd:A]C[Dakre: as the top side is the one, which is important, i'd prefer a move at A (maybe B). It would become a moyo game, because black would get the left side, which is not bad either.
So if you don't like moyo-games, this move is the way to prevent it ;)]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc]C[Dakre: i like black in this position. the value of the top side is nullified by the last black move]

;B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[bn];B[em];W[oq]TR[op]C[This is not the best, is this?maybe something like k5 or around is better?

Dakre: with this move it is very difficult for white to develop properly... the stone at the marked place would be lighter to handle, but is not best in my oppinion either. Black already has a princer... you reduce the local moyo, but black will benefit a lot by attacking this stone.

try to imagine where black wants to play... look at the variation for another thought... after that, you should know a better alternative for white :)]

LB[sb:A]TR[qb][pc][qc][rc][qd]C[Dakre: this is a common shape... it has 4 liberties (in fact it has 3, but due to eyespace black needs another move being really able to capture it...)
Black usually begins with A, the weaker side...
so if it were blacks turn, black would win this capturing race, but as it is whites turn and both have 4 liberties, white wins...]

Dakre: yes, definitely! now white has further chances to attack the marked group and completly capture it. but as you noticed before, white could have avoided this trade]
;B[bo];W[iq]LB[li:B][lj:A]TR[oc][od][pd][ne]SQ[nn][op][mq][oq]
C[Dakre: deep invasion ;) and that with a weak group to the right... i'd prefer a move in the middle to capture the marked group and help your weak group at once... like A or B for example....]
;B[io];W[kr];B[ng]C[Dakre: black moves out... maybe white can not capture anymore, but take profit by chasing it]
;W[lg];B[ni];W[oh];B[nh];W[li];B[mj];W[kk];B[lr]
(;W[lq]C[Dakre: for me it seems, that the black group is not out of danger and that an additional white move can capture it... and this is much bigger than the lower side. even if you can not manage to capture it all moves attacking that group should be sente, because it is so big... after you took profit there you still can come back here... if black tenukies, you can be satisfied having captured a big group... no way for black to win this game then anymore ;)]
;B[jr];W[kp];B[jq];W[jp];B[ip];W[jo];B[mr];W[lo]TR[mr]C[Dakre: black has to be very careful allowing you to build this much strength... the marked black move was a present for white ;)]

You loose a point here!! just play A to get a seki... white can not atari at B, because then you could capture four stones with the now played move ;) 
japanese rules don't count points in sekis, so that would be one prisoner less -> one point less, because territory doesn't count... with chinese rules this throw in would not matter in points]

C[thespis [3k\]: thank you
rs220675 [3k\]: thx
thespis [3k\]: i ejoyed the game

Dakre: close game ;) some things i want to point out... 1. sometimes you seem to loose the focus on where the action takes place. You had a good opportunity to capture the p17 group after finishing the ko. 2. reading... but probably one never finishes improving on that ;) you could have killed the whole o12 group as i showed in a variation and you didn't need to accept the resulting ko in the upper right corner if you had continued your good idea properly. It would have been an easy game then ;) 3. you have already a good style of playing the fuseki... only small things to improve there... try to play moves here, where you really feel comfortable... this is most important... THEN think whether you have to play harder not to grant your opponent too much... do you count during the game? in fuseki and middlegame it is very important to know, who is ahead.

I hope the ideas are helpful to you. If you have any questions left ask me on kgs or write an email.

B is better, but black is still flat... white could reduce at the marked place. C is a move, which helps both sides... but white has a good move on the right side like "1" or "2" to reduce black's moyo, while making territory herself.

Black D is the answer.]
(;B[pl]C[Dakre: look at this... Black's moyo becomes two-dimensional ;) it gets even harder for white to approach the lower right corner and even a reducing move at the marked place may be answered by a capping play.
