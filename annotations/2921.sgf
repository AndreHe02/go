C[FK [14k\]: hi

Hi, and thanks for sending your game into the GTL! My name is Adam Marquis, and I play on KGS as Makar 6k. 

A couple of things to think about: 

1) When attacking a group, don't give your opponent the chance to sacrifice a small portion of it in exchange for a better position. If you threaten to take part of the group, make sure it is a large enough part to be happy with.

2) Don't play moves (like C15 in game) that invite your opponent to take away your base if you don't have to. Weak groups are a large burden, and you should try to not have them around as much as possible.

It was a good game, hope this review helps!];B[pd]C[rvf [13k\]: hi]

(;B[qm]C[Adam: This seems rather low. I think the joseki is Q5, white extention, black gets sente (and can punish the tenuki in the lower left).

I'd argue that the shape could give you trouble down the line as well, with white moves at Q4 or R5 being difficult to deal with. Maybe if this type of move is called for R6 is better?]
;W[jq]C[Adam: Too far. I think if you were going to make an extention you had to add another move to finish, you should go farther and make a pincer.]

(;B[hq]C[Adam: I don't like it, I think it induces white to fix the overextention, and black hasn't gained enough to compensate. I'd play towards the lower left corner, where white tenukied. You took a little bit of a lower right local loss to get sente, why not use it to gain from white's earlier tenuki?]
;W[dq]C[Adam: Now white induces you to make a wall of two stones, and your H3 stone is too close. Is this why you ask if H3 should be at J3 in the end?]
;B[eq]C[FK: I think I should move j3 instead of h3, is it right?

Adam: I would say that J3 is bad in general (attaching to an enemy stone when the stone isn't already very strong). Usually you see kinds of moves like that when black wants to make quick life and settle the shape where white is already strong.]
;W[cm];B[jd];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[qj]C[FK: Is this joseki suitable at this moment?

Adam: Yes, I think it is a good choice for black with the K4 stone in place. Also, white's becoming a little settled doesn't really hurt the lower left since R7 is low. If R7 was on the first line, I might have chosen a pincer. Black will still have to watch the shape in the lower right, though.]
;B[og]C[Adam: I'm not sure how I feel about the next few moves. White can still, by the end of this sequence, use the cut point at Q15 as leverage to invade around O17 or so. (I think white was wrong to cut directly in the game)]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[oj];B[om]C[Adam: I think O16, preventing the invasion is very huge for black right now. I assume you played P7 to keep white from getting a seal over this side? Not sure, but I've two worries:

1) I don't think white could manage the seal in one move yet.
2) I don't think it is as big as other moves.

Perhaps now is the time to approach the upper left and create a large moyo? Perhaps O16.]
;W[rd]C[Adam: I'd take this time to protect the cut so white can't invade.]
;B[rc];W[pe];B[oe];W[od]C[Adam: Again, I don't think this works well for white.]

(;W[qb];B[rd];W[sf]C[Adam: I don't see why white has need to be greedy here, even if the corner was killable. White connects at Q16, and black has to live in gote. White has destroyed black's potential here in sente, and can be very happy.]
;B[pd];W[qg];B[ra];W[sb];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[ne];B[ob];W[mg]
C[Adam: This whole series was unreasonable by white. N13 does more damage. There is no reason to run with the O15 stone now. With P16 already dead, it doesn't cut black or hurt his formation. If this turns into a running battle it is all in black's favor. Perhaps white should play E16 or so? It prevents black from approaching there, which would be nice for him. It nullifies somewhat the influence of black's power in that direction, and it is a developing move for the corner.]
;B[ni]C[Adam: splitting moves are good against weak groups, but could white have connected here in a move? I'd have made a move from the other direction first as black.]
;W[md];B[mc];W[ld];B[lc]C[Adam: I don't like it. Black doesn't need to protect anything here, why not just put the pressure on white of playing K14 or L14 or so?]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[jc]
(;B[me]C[Adam: When attacking, and you play a move that lets the opponent sacrifice part of his group, always make sure you can be satisfied with that part. This one stone is not worth taking.]
;W[je];B[id];W[kf];B[ic];W[jb];B[nf]C[Adam: May as well play M14 in sente first as black.]
;W[fc];B[ib];W[fn];B[lf];W[ke];B[lg]C[Adam: Again, you swallow the one stone and leave the large group some wiggle room to escape.]
;W[jh]C[Adam: White takes the chance.];B[li]C[Adam: Black is slow here. This doesn't hurt the running white group badly, or gain territory for black. Black I feel is behind, and must be more aggressive. Perhaps push against the group from the left and build a position on that side?]
;W[rl]C[Adam: And white is also slow.]
(;B[ce]C[FK:how about this invasion?

Adam: Good that you ignored S8 for now, but this invites white to take away your base at C13. This is too close to white's strength.]

;W[qc];B[qg];W[pc]C[Adam: It is a very poor trade for white, but always when you take time out of a sequence to atari stones you should read out what happens when the atari is ignored and the stones sacrificed.

Now that it look at it, I think white can't even manage Q17 ^_^.]

(;B[qc]C[Adam: Perhaps this is safer?]))
(;B[cq];W[bq];B[dq]C[Adam: I'm not sure if this is the kind of development that is needed, however. Perhaps black should try for something that gives him influence and split white's lower groups?]
)
(;B[iq]C[Adam: Answering your question about H3 at J3: this doesn't look good for black. You've placed a stone with 3 liberties, and white will take another in his next turn. The fight is unfavorable for black.]

(;W[ip]C[Adam: I don't like black's position. You can't really fall back to H3, because if you were going to be passive you shouldn't have played J3 (a contact play) in the first place. Crosscut? Black will have many floating groups, and white gets to move first. Should turn out badly for black. If black plays hane now, even if white connects passively I think white has gained here.]
)
(;W[jp]C[Adam: Even if white plays passively it doesn't look like good shape for black.]
;B[ip];W[io];B[ho];W[hn]C[Adam: White can play the double hane here, and what has black gotten for white's gain in strength?]
)))
(;B[po]C[Adam: I've vague recollection that this is joseki. White would then extend from his wall according to the proverb "if one jump two, if two jump three." So, L3 is a three space jump from the two space wall.

Maybe a pro would buck this sequence, and black's trying to get sente, by playing a pincer on the E4 stone and trying to develop from there? Being 6k, I've no clue as to the correctness of that, but I'd probably try it.]
