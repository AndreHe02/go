C[Hi there:

No specific questions were attached to the game record so I've
made some general comments without going into too much detail.

I think W had a winning game even after 30 moves but failed to
capitilize on a potential splitting attack.  Once Black lived
with one group inside your moyo, you had a chance to harass the
other group.  Alas, it was not to be :)];B[pd];W[cq];B[dd];W[pp]
;B[qn];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[qk];W[nc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc]
;B[pc];W[jc];B[pg]LB[lq:B][dp:A]C[Questionable move.  I'd rather play at A.  I also think B is
better.];W[cf]C[Maybe it's my style, but I don't like this move - it and C3 are
low.  I'd prefer White D6.]
(;B[ce]C[Now this is a bad move.  See variation.];W[df];B[fc]
LB[cc:A]C[A is still a weak spot.];W[dj]C[The last few moves have been more beneficial to White.]
;B[jp]LB[dp:A]C[I like A better.];W[hp]C[This is good for White.]
;B[mq];W[nq]C[This seems like the wrong direction of play- I'd prefer N4 to
press down ob Black.  Also, I'm not too worried about this group
(yet) as White can still play S3.];B[mp];W[om]LB[mo:A]C[A is more forceful.]
;B[rq]C[Not good. B should tend to his weak group.];W[in]C[Excellent!  It is clear that W has the better game.]
;B[co]C[Outrageous!  I can see why B played here-W's moyo is too big.
However, with one weak group already on the board, how can B
manage two?];W[ep];B[cl];W[ck];B[dl]C[With two weak groups on the board, how can W lose...]

(;W[bn]C[Not good!  Unless you know you can kill Black outright, you should
play moves that threaten capture (like casting a net).

See variation.];B[bo];W[cn]C[A tactical blunder...];B[dn];W[bl]
;B[bk];W[bj];B[bm];W[ak];B[an]C[...that throws away a winning game.  Now Black's group is safe.
W has sente and Black still has another weak group but...]
(;W[jq]LB[mo:A]C[...you only force black to strengthen himself and the next few
moves are better for Black.

A is better - press down hard on Black! and aim for territory
in the centre.  See var.];B[kq];W[iq];B[io];W[ho];B[jn];W[im]
;B[jm];W[mm];B[ln];W[qi];B[qg];W[oi];B[ok];W[mi];B[mk]LB[pi:A]
C[Now it's W with 2 weak groups and Black is winning (and White
doesn't have time to protect the weakness at A)];W[ll];B[lj]
;W[li];B[jk];W[qo];B[ro];W[pn];B[qm];W[rr];B[qp]LB[pr:A]C[If you feel like it, see what happens if B plays A.]
;W[pr];B[po];W[oo];B[pm];W[on];B[me]C[Not good. K11 is better.]
;W[ld];B[le]C[Bad move. K11 still better.];W[ji];B[kd]C[Unneccessary.]
;W[kc];B[kj];W[kf];B[kh]C[Why didn't Black just cut?];W[ki]
;B[pi];W[ph];B[pj];W[og];B[qh]C[This puts Black ahead.];W[oh]
;B[ke]TR[ig][ih][hh][hg][gg][gh][fh][fg]C[White is actually forming territory in the center, so this should
not have been played.];W[hi];B[il];W[gm];B[ib];W[ic];B[hb];W[ie]
;B[jf];W[if];B[bf];W[bg];B[be]C[Now Black is clearly winning.  No further comments made.

There were mistakes made by both sides.  Unfortunately for White,
his were more costly.];W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[eb];W[cm]C[???];B[dm]
