[pm]SQ[qo]C[This would be joseki, if the white marked stone was on the 4th
line. If white is approaching on the 3rd line, a pincer on one
of the (triangle-)marked points would be normal.];W[qq];B[qr]
;W[pp];B[oq];W[no]LB[oo:A]C[Attaching with 12 leaves a weak point at A (although black shouldn't
play there immediately; that would be bad shape and leave Black
with a weak point).];B[mp];W[mo];B[ci]LB[oo:B][lo:A]C[I think black should play one more move in the lower right corner.
If white gets to play there first, black will get pushed down
and the white wall will work nicely with the white stone on the
upper corner. But if black plays there first (at A for instance)
white is almost forced to answer because of his weakness at B.
One more reason not to play 15 is the fact that it is a little
slow. White could afford to ignore this move and play elsewhere
first. Never let your opponent take the initiative if you don't
have to!!];W[cg]C[16 is OK, but not urgent. Playing on the lower right seems to
be bigger.];B[cl]C[Black almost has to play there. So white gets sente. That shows
that 15 was not very good (because it was not so big in means
of territory - and that would be the only excuse for taking gote).]
;W[lp]C[Good.];B[lq];W[lo]LB[oo:B][kp:A]C[A would be more common, but I think white 20 is OK (especially
because of the possible cut at B).];B[jq]LB[qi:A]C[Playing 21 on the 3rd line seems to be a little submissive. Black
has a strong position on the left. Playing low on the right doesn't
add much. It does not utilize the black power in this area.

Black should play at least on the 4th line or play elsewhere.
Playing somewhere around A and reducing the influence of the
white wall would be one possibility.];W[pk]C[A good idea, but to close to the white wall. White could jump
one or two points farther.];B[ic]C[This is again (like 15) a slow move. White is building a huge
moyo on the right side. And black leaves the initiative to white.
White has now the possibility to choose the direction of play.

Especially in the fuseki it is important to control
the game and not to let your opponent control it.]
(;W[mc]LB[kc:A]C[That is the right direction, but white can go as far as A. Jim
Kerwin (1 dan Pro) once said: "Go all the way to the pressure
point!" See variation.];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[jd]LB[ke:B][kc:A]
C[Black would have played the same moves, if 24 was at A. In this
case white would have a nice follow-up move with B. But in this
situation it is much more difficult to find a move that harmonizes
with 24.

I don't like white 28, but that is because white 24 was not so
good.];B[id];W[jc]C[The black stones on the upper side are not too strong, so it
is OK to try to attack them. But after white 30, black has still
many resources (to hane, to jump out, to make eye(s) on the side,
...).   That is why I didn't liked white 24 and 28. It is not too bad
for white, but it could have been better.];B[qg]LB[qf:D][oi:C]
[rk:B][qi:A]C[White has a huge area of influence on the right and black wants
to reduce it. That is OK, but I don't like black 31.

It is hard to tell what is the best point, but I'd suggest to
play at A, because it has good follow up moves with B, C or D
(good invading/reducing
moves should always have many good follow-up moves).];W[ph]
LB[qi:A]C[Like white 28, I don't like this shoulder hit. My first idea
is to play A, but this is very close to white 22 and makes 22
almost a wasted move.   (Now imagine how nice it would have been, if 22
would have been played somewhere near A- as I suggested earlier.)]
;B[qd];W[qc];B[rd]C[I think that black should try to run into the center before he
trys to build a base on the side.];W[pc]C[Too slow. This gives black a second chance to run into the center.
White should try to enclose the black stones.];B[pe];W[pf]C[That gives black the chance to split the white groups - not good
for white.];B[qf];W[pg];B[qh]LB[oe:A]C[I think it is better to play at A first. Black should separate
the white groups before white connects them (in sente!).];W[qi]
;B[ri];W[rj]C[That double-hane won't work.]
(;B[si]LB[qj:A]C[Must be at A. See variation.];W[pj];B[gp]LB[jo:B]
[oe:A]C[Not big enough. White builds a strong influence on the right.
Black should fight back. I'd suggest to split white with A.

(If black really wants to play on the lower side, he should consider
B instead 47, building a big, box-like shape).];W[oe]C[Now finally white get this sente move.]
;B[qe];W[ip]LB[jf:C][ie:B][jo:A]C[If white wants to reduce from the top, A would be normal. But
I think it would be better to utilize the white influence and
attack the black stones on the upper side (with B or C for instance).]
;B[iq]LB[jp:A]C[If black wants to play on the lower side, he should rather play
at A and try to cut the white stone off. Black is strong in this
area, so if white wants to fight there, black can be happy about
it.];W[hp];B[hq]C[The last moves have been submissive play by black.]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[kq]C[??? That must have been a lack of concentration.]
;B[kr];W[ko];B[kq]LB[jo:A]C[After whites mistake at 56, black could think about cutting at
A and then fighting a ko (instead of connecting). But since white
is strong, black has
not many ko-threats.   I think black should rather take sente and try to reduce whites
influence in the center.];W[im]C[White expands his influence and is approx. 20 points ahead.]
;B[jo]C[This cut is not possible. White can capture this stone in a ladder.]

(;W[io]LB[jn:A]C[Has to be at A. See variation.];B[jn];W[in]
;B[jm]C[Black fights, but this is whites area of influence. I can't see
how black wants to turn this into profit for himself.   He is just creating a target, that can be attacked by white.
That is exactly what you don't want to happen!];W[jl];B[je]
C[OK. Playing from the upper side seems to be more promising for
black.];W[ke];B[jf];W[ie]C[Now it seems to be whites turn to play a stone that can be captured
in a ladder - not exactly advisable.];B[he];W[if];B[ig];W[kf]
C[White could make this move without sacrificing two stones.]
;B[jg]C[I'd rather capture the two stones, because it would eliminate
the bad aji. White still can play a ladder-block later on.]
;W[ib]C[I think white should rather try to enlarge his territory in the
center.];B[hc]LB[hb:A]C[Why not at A? But I think it would be even better not to play
there at all, but to switch to the center.];W[go]C[Like 76, this move is not the most urgent one.]
;B[fp]C[This is also not the most urgent area for black to play. Rather
switch to the center.];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb]C[80 and 82 are not big enough for taking gote.]
;B[kg]C[Finaly!];W[lg];B[lf];W[le];B[mf];W[me];B[mg]LB[lh:A]
C[Black is fighting with his weak stones in whites area of influence
- that's not to best way to go. He should rather sacrifice his
two stone to gain speed on the outside (playing at A).];W[lh]
;B[mh];W[li]C[Now all 4 black stones are lost.];B[kd]C[This is nothing but a ko-threat. Black should wait for a ko to
play it.];W[kc];B[lm]C[Once again black is playing with his weak stones where white
is strong. By the way: 95 does not save the 3 black stones.]
;W[mm]LB[km:A]C[White should just capture the 3 black stones with A.]
;B[kl]
(;W[jj]LB[km:A]C[I think this is a big mistake. White should capture the 3 black
stones with A (see variation) and everything would be fine. But
98 is putting little pressure on blacks stones. Black gets now
the chance to fight back.];B[jk]C[Now things getting more complicated for white, than it had to
be.];W[il];B[kj]TR[jl][il][im][in][io][jp][ip][hp][go]C[Now white gets really in troubles - and it started with move
98. White was at least 20 points ahead, but now black has saved
his already lost stones (and these stones are cutting stones!).

Whites marked stones are cut off and white will have a hard time
making two eyes for them!];W[ki]C[White should rather help his 9 stones on the lower left. This
group is to big to sacrifice, and it is in trouble.];B[ij]C[OK.]
;W[lk]C[This move helps none of the weak white stones properly.]
;B[lj]LB[kk:A]C[Big mistake. Black must connect at A to save his stones and keep
the white stones cut of!];W[kk]C[White has to be very happy to be allowed to play there.]
;B[mj]C[Now black will get only 4 white stones, giving up 6 of his (cutting!!)
stones. White has been very lucky.];W[ik];B[ji];W[ii];B[jh]
;W[hg]C[That is the bad aji I was talking of earlier.];B[hf]
;W[hj];B[ml]C[That won't help black.];W[ll]LB[mk:A]C[Not good. White should just play at A, but after 116 black has
two or three more forcing-moves to reduce whites territory.]
;B[mk];W[km];B[nm]C[Now black has made some profit out of whites mistakes (although
had could have done even better). Whites had an enormous influence
in the center, but now he gets almost no territory there and
he also had no chance to utilize this strength to attack black.
White had a comfortable lead in the game, but now black is not
just catching up, but taking the lead for himself.];W[mn];B[ol]
;W[pl];B[pm];W[ni];B[mi];W[on];B[om];W[qm];B[nj]LB[rq:A][bh:B]
[rc:C]C[Too small! Since black is leading, just think of big endgame
moves like A, B or C.];W[oj]C[Also too small!];B[oi];W[nh];B[nf]
;W[ne];B[gg];W[ff];B[hh];W[en]LB[ck:A]C[All the last moves have been quite small. This one is aiming
for more. What are possible strategies for white?

He can attack at the left. But black has no obvious weak point
there, so its hard to find a good attacking-point. If somebody
forces me to attack the black stones on the left, I would play
at A. But since black is strong there, white can not expect much.
The only thing he can do is fighting like mad and hoping for
a black mistake. That seems not advisable to me.

Well, black is leading, but only by approx. 5-10 points. So it
is still possible to turn this game around. White should be patient,
play big endgame moves and wait for his chance.];B[dn];W[dm]
;B[cm];W[em];B[fk];W[fi]LB[dj:A][dk:B]C[This move is somehow in the middle of nowhere. It has no clear
function.

Since black has no really weak stones, it is difficult for white
to attack. He could try A or B, threatening either to cut 143
off or to reduce blacks territory on the left, but I think black
will have no big troubles defending.];B[ej];W[dk]C[This stone will be cut off.]
;B[dl];W[dj];B[di];W[ek];B[el];W[ei];B[fj];W[fl];B[gl];W[gm]
;B[cj]LB[fm:A]C[Just capture with A!];W[gk];B[fm];W[fn];B[fl]

;B[gd];W[hb];B[fe];W[ef];B[ee];W[de];B[dg];W[ch]LB[df:A]C[Defending at A would be better.]
;B[df];W[cf];B[eg]C[Once again, this was a setback for white. Black has now a comfartable
lead.];W[gi];B[gj];W[hi];B[hk]LB[rq:A]C[This is really small. Compare it to A!]
;W[hl]C[Small.];B[bh];W[op];B[nq]C[Black doesn't have to defend there now.]
;W[sj];B[rg];W[pr]LB[rq:A]C[Useless. Better play A.];B[rr]LB[rq:A]
C[Better play A.];W[rq];B[sq];W[sp];B[sr];W[rp];B[or]C[That is not necessary right now. White can add one more stone
and black can still capture them.];W[bg];B[bi];W[dh];B[eh]LB[fg:A]
C[Big mistake! 195 must be at A.];W[fg];B[gf];W[fh];B[ag];W[af]
;B[ah];W[rc]C[And now white is catching up again!   1. Black mistreated the lower right corner (he should get much
more profit there).   2. Black lost 4 stones on the upper left without getting any
compensation.

3. White is taking the upper right corner.   Conclusion: Blacks (approx. 20 points) lead is reduced to almost
nothing.];B[og];W[oh];B[ha];W[ia];B[ga];W[fa];B[gc];W[jb];B[ed]
C[That is a dame move (=worth 0 points).];W[pn];B[dc]C[That won't work. White can save his 4 stones.]

at b17. An undo was made and the game played out. However, black
resigned despite winning. \]

I think allowing the undo is very generous and resigning by black
is a proper reply: sportsmanship on both sides!!];W[bc]C[Not necessary. One wasted point.]

was catching up and taking the lead in the middle game and finally
white was catching up and winning in the endgame. WOW!])
