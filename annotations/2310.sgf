C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  In my games, it seems as though no matter what I try, I keep falling badly behind early on.  I try doing the same things that work for my opponents, but that doesn't seem to help.

*****************
Ted,

I hear much frustration in your comments about the game. Go is not an easy game - if it was it wouldn't be interesting! I do not know how long you have been playing or what your experience has been in getting stronger to date. But I do know that around 10k, Go's learning curve gets significantly steeper - you will advance much more slowly from here on out, and only gets harder and harder to advance as you get stronger. Perhaps some of your frustration is due to the fact that so far you have been advancing fairly rapidly and now suddenly its not coming all so easy.

The way to get stronger is practice, though I think there is a limit to how much actually playing can help. I mean problems of various types. Its important to get books and see what correct play looks like. Sometime you can imitate what your opponents do but one also needs understanding; and sometimes what worked at an earlier level doesn't work later.

***********************************************

If I attack, I invariably end up with two weak groups; if I try to create territory, I invariably end up conceding a large moyo and not getting much territory myself.

***********************

Keep in mind that rarely does one attack to kill. Usually one attacks to make territory or gain power to attack other groups. If either of those two goals are not being achieved by continuing the attack it is time to desist and play elsewhere.

Often when attacking, one must take some time to strengthen groups around the target both before and during the attack to be sure that you don't get the situation you describe. Exactly how and when to do this is a matter of experience, but perhaps you should desist your attacks earlier to strengthen one of your groups so you don't get split. Actually, often this strengthing *is* part of the attack. 

Its hard to address this generally....

**************

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger
Fedya on KGS];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]C[Ted: Since my opponent has played 3-4 points in both corners, I wasn't certain which corner would be better to approach first.  So, I decided to play the Chinese fuseki instead and concentrate on territory.  Besides, my attacks always seem to go wrong, so perhaps playing for territory might not be such a bad strategy.

*******************
This is fine.]
(;W[qo]C[Ted: My understanding of the Chinese fuseki is that Black wants White to invade, so that Black can follow up with the old adage of attacking one group (in this case the invading stones), and using that attack to get territory someplace else.  That never seems to work for me, however.  When my opponents attack I always end up with a bunch of weak groups.

What makes this attack even more galling is that the last time I tried the same attack I promptly ended up with a weak group while my opponent was able to get a lot of territory on the outside.

**************

Your understanding of the Chinese Opening is correct. I myself do not remember the many variants of this fuseki and I had to refer to my reference materials to get a better understanding.

From what I have read, White's invasion is too early. See variants. These are "normal" play. To come in now is too early because white's stone is overwhelmed. See variants to see what I would play]

(;B[oo]TR[pq]C[Ted: I thought for quite some time about this move.  I thought I'd be able to keep White to a small group in the corner, and get territory to the left of the Q3 and P5 stones.

******************

This move is too aggressive. Destroy white's base first so he is weak.]
;W[pm];B[ok]C[Ted: I thought that this move would strengthen the R9 stone, while continuing to attack White.

******
Yes this is OK.];W[qq]C[But now white gets a base. You can't attack a group when it is already alive.]
;B[qr]C[Ted: I think this might be a mistake.  I believe I should have played at Q2.  But I played at R2 because I recalled a joseki in which Black has stones at Q3, R2, and P2 where that's considered good shape in conjunction with the surrounding stones.  This isn't that particular joseki, apparently.

**************
A stone at P2 would make a tremendous difference! But that isn't to be.

At this point Black might consider P3. This is a strong base to build on for something on the bottom. But really the ship has gone out of black's sails.]
;W[pp];B[oq];W[op]
(;B[nq]C[Ted: Could I have gotten away with playing at O4?  I looked at it during the game, and have looked at it more since, but figuring out whether White can take advantage of the various cutting points requires far more reading than I was able to do at the board.  Besides, stronger players have suggested that one shouldn't be afraid to sacrifice stones, so I figured it would be OK to give up the P5 stone.]
;W[np];B[ce]C[Ted: I didn't like the position I had in the lower right, but concluded that both of my groups were stable, so I decided to tenuki.  I decided against E3 since every time I extend from a group like the one in the lower right, my opponents are able to play in between (in this case, that would be a move around H3) and split me into to groups, each of which is open to attack on one side.

***********

Tenuki was incorrect, and white's play shows why. The three stones are lacking in liberties, and to create a secure group black mush continue to extend at N3, or possibly M3 (risky). After N3, Atari at S3 and then hane is possible (atari can happen anytime).]
;W[mq];B[rq];W[qp];B[mr];W[lr];B[ms];W[ls];B[or]C[Ted: I think White might have made a mistake someplace in this sequence, yet I can't help but feel I've come off much worse than White.

Every time I get a game reviewed I get criticised for playing slow, unnecessary moves that I play to stop my opponents from attacking, but when I tenuki like the stronger players suggest, I invariably get attacked and end up with weak groups.

****************

This is an absolute disaster for black. Not only has the white group escaped attack, but black has almost no territory and white has a strong commanding wall.

How to know when to tenuki? In this case, reading out the situation correctly could have told you that. You had too great a confidence in the strength of the bottom group.]
;W[lq]C[White's move should have been at M4 to prevent a ladder. The peeps at N5 and L3 are not very meaningful, while your ladder breaker on the next move is.]
;B[ch]C[Ted: Obviously, I had sente, but I wasn't certain what to do with it.  C12 is certainly a safe move, but I have no idea if it's any better than C6 or E3 or K17.

***************

This move is good because it extends and its a ladder breaker. I would have played D11 for two additional reasons: 1) High-low balance. Generally you don't want to keep playing low like that unless you are in danger. Its best to have a combination of 3rd line and 4th line territory. This is a good balance between making territory and growth potential. 2) You can extend to three spaces when the situation is not dangerous like it is now. Yes of course white can play between the stones, but in the ensuing fight, one can profit, especially if its done early.

Generally speaking you don't want to be diving into enemy territory this early (so no E3). C6 invokes something like E4, or more daringly something on around C or D10. Either of these moves creates some difficulties for black. After E4 black has no move that really seals together his three stones. If white goes between things will get very messy, but black's stones are on the side while most of white's are already in the corner and thus stronger.

K17 is quite large and is a viable alternative to C12 I think.]
;W[lo];B[eq]C[K17 now];W[gq];B[eo];W[cn]C[****************

E3 has brought you lots of headaches.];B[cl]C[Ted: I had a game recently in which there was a position like the one in the lower left, except that I had the White position.  In that game, I ended up with a very small group while my opponent was able to take lots of territory, so I figured I'd try the same thing that's worked for my opponents.

*******

No. The black stones are too weak. This move causes too many problems for them.]
;W[em];B[cr]TR[em][cn]C[Ted: Should I have played at either D7 or D6 to try to prevent White from connecting?

*****

No. Black needs a base.];W[br];B[cq];W[bq];B[dp]C[Black now has good shape.]
;W[co];B[go]C[Ted: I thought for quite some time here.  I was worried about White playing at D2, but eventually decided that if I played at G5, I'd be able to run out to the center while at the same time limiting what White can get on the bottom.

*******
Your thinking here is entirely correct. See variation.]
(;W[hp];B[hn]C[H5. Keep the pressure up on white.];W[ci];B[dh]
C[Ted: This is another move that I spent quite a bit of time thinking about.  In hindsight, I believe I should have played B11.

*******************
The situation is complex. White is starting to worry a bit about his left group. By swallowing the c8 stone he ends his worries and makes territory. Your move played straight into this thinking, which is no good.

B11 is one possiblity.  C10 offers some wierd possibilities. D11 is another (the goal of this would be to run on the 4th line and then cut the F7 stone, helping your weak group and gaining central influence in return for giving up some territory.]
;W[di];B[fc]C[Ted: I really wasn't certain what to do here, but I figured attacking the D17 stone looked like a good idea.

E9 is where I would have played. This attacks the two white stones. The hope is to deny white the left and help the weak group simulaneously.

However, I cannot say this is a bad move as it is quite big...]
;W[pj]C[Ted: Suddenly, I've got a weak group on the right side.  Playing a tenuki doesn't work for me -- look at the position I got after playing at C15.  But it works just fine for my opponents.

*******

This is an overreaction. The two stones there are not yet a "group". And it isn't weak. Its close to white's thickness yes, but the lone stone above them is far weaker.]
;B[pk];W[fd];B[gc];W[ee]
(;B[fh]C[Ted: This is what happens when I attack.  I'm about to end up with two weak groups.  That never happens to my opponents, though.

****************

Deny white a base. Play B17 instead of this move. Left group is then solid.  Threatens connection. See variation.]
;W[ei];B[eh];W[he];B[ic];W[hd];B[hc];W[cd]C[*******************

This is huge for white. Now his group is safe and black's group is in trouble.]
;B[be];W[bd];B[ae];W[el]
(;B[qc]C[Ted: This is another case where I felt I had sente, and had no idea what to do with it.  I finally decided that there was no possible way it could be good for me to let White invade at R17, since that would leave me with almost no territory.

************

You have two weak groups, at the bottom and on the left. Either could be strengthened in (more less) sente by pushing on the adjacent white groups.

Your move, while big, does not address the urgency of these other positions.

Your fear of invasion at 3-3 is not legitimate. The resulting wall you get could create a large territory on the right. See variation.]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[Ted: I figured that I could either connect this to the three stones at Q9, or else capture the R14 stone and make a nice chunk of territory that way.  Besides, this sort of splitting attack always seems to work when it's my opponent who's attacking.]
;W[ph];B[qj];W[pi];B[qi];W[of];B[nd];W[me];B[md];W[le];B[ld]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[kd];B[kc]C[This sequence was very poor by white. The wall is too porous and the gain for black too great for this to have been worthwhile.]
;W[hk]C[Ted: I really don't understand the point of this move, or what (if anything) I should try to do about it.

*******************

It appears to be an asking move of some kind. It vaguely threatens your two weak groups and threatens to make central territory. Depending on your response, White would attack or make territory.

However, I agree in that it seems that in trying to do too much it ends up doing little.]
;B[bi];W[bj];B[bh];W[ck]C[Good.];B[jn]C[Good.];W[df]C[Didn't want to risk D15? It creates a complicated fight. See variation.]

(;B[cf];W[io];B[in];W[ll]C[Ted:  This move prevents me from connecting the group in the bottom left from the group on the right, which was a backup plan I'd had in mind to make certain everything ended up with two eyes.

*****

Too far.];B[gp];W[fq]
(;B[fr];W[gr];B[er];W[fp];B[fo];W[ep];B[do];W[jp]C[White makes a mistake...]
;B[hq]C[Ted: I was pretty confident that this move would lead to my capturing something and ensuring two eyes.  I was actually beginning to feel good about my chances to win the game, since White had let me get a fair chunk of territory at the top.]
;W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[gs];W[lj]
(;B[qg]C[Ted: Time to get two eyes for my group on the right!]
;W[pf];B[pg]C[Ted: This is the wrong move.  I should have played S14.  But I thought the five stones on the third line would ensure I'd get two eyes.

*****************

This is not a bad move. 5 stones on third line doesn't assure two eyes though. See variation.]
;W[nh]
(;B[de]C[Ted: Did I still have to play an extra move to ensure that this group gets its two eyes?  If White played at D13 first, I think this group would have been in big trouble, but I felt there were other pressing needs I had to take care of earlier.  Urgent moves before big moves!]
;W[dd];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg]C[It was good to play this sequence, though the right group is also in trouble.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[rf];B[rg];W[ri]C[Ted: I didn't realize how much trouble I was in on the right.]
;B[ql];W[rm];B[oj]C[Ted: I think I should have tried P13 instead, but even then I'm not certain I'd get two eyes or connect to anything.]
;W[ni];B[om];W[pn];B[qm];W[qn]
(;B[pl];W[nl];B[ol];W[mm]C[Ted: I realized there was no way I could get two eyes on the right, so I resigned.

*************

Had your group lived, it would have been somewhat close, although I give white the edge; white's mistake on the bottom left and (more seriously) granting black the entire upper side counterbalanced the gains he had made earlier. White is behind in territory, but has good prospects of making enough in the center to eke out a win with Komi.

I hope that my comments have been somewhat helpful. Good luck improving your Go! Don't get discouraged. I haven't moved up a stone in over a year now, but I'm still plugging away!
