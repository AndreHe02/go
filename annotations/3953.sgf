p.s. i made alot of mistakes when making this kifu on a fresh board, sorry for the inconvenience.

Hi Mike!

My name ist Rainer (Beholder, 8k), I did the review of this game. All my comments have the prefix "Beh:".

It was not easy to write a review for this game as you haven't written many questions in this file. Perhaps you would like to write more specific questions next time, it would help.

Generally I would say White was playing good during the opening and in the endgame, so both players lost some points during yose. Black was playing too passive during early opening but did well in the middlegame. White did earn the win.
White won the game with 6.5 points, but had the chance to finish the game quite early (move 84)

I hope this review helps you to get even more fun out of this great game!

Best regards

Beh: To pincer would lead to a hard fight for B. W is strong in the lower right corner. To play underneath is ok, but it still helps W to stabilise her position.]
