RE[W+2.50]
RU[Japanese]

C[Hello to whoever is reviewing this and thank you very much ahead of time.  This is a match I should have lost by about 10 but ended up winning by 2.5 due to a careless mistake by the opponent in the end.  I am white in this game.  I will try to leave comments wherever I can to let you know what I'm thinking.

Hi

i'll be your reviewer this evening. please keep in mind that the sugestions i make are sugestions from my level (15k). i 1d might find might many errors in what i sugest. Also, i might make a few comments that might be too complicated for you right now. if they are don't worry too much about them, they are mainly intended to keep in the back on your mind.

note: not all variations i put down work equally well. unfortunately the sgf tool i'm using doesn't let me undo stones

[ep:A]C[This is the first game where I did not start out with at least 1 stone on hoshi.

although there have been pro-games that start simmilar to this, if you play the 3-4 point in this direction you let your guard down. the 3-4 point is easy to invade from A, and hard to attack from a B dirrection. so it gives black an easy run for the lower side playing like tihs

note: A & B as in directions, not as in exact points];B[eq]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[nq];B[lq];W[pq]C[I have a tough time with pincers and chose to play for the corner here instead of extending into the center.

try to run to the center anyway :-)
if you let yourself be closed in this early in the game, you give black a lot of influence where he wants it. (on the outside
in about 20/30 moves, if you can, do play here to either settle your group or just for proffit]

;B[bd];W[bc];B[bf];W[de];B[df];W[ee]C[also nicely taken advantage of black's B16 (B16 was a bad move) this early in the game one shouldn't play on the second line if one can help it]
;B[ef];W[ge]TR[jc][kc][jd][kd]SQ[mc][nc][md][nd]C[I was debating on whether to keep extending, or to strengthen the left some more.


the group on the left is safe, so 5th line proffit anyt ime you can get it. but do try to get a stone in around square. otherwise black can invade easily at triangle]
;B[cj];W[ck];B[dj]C[proverb: 2 stones, hane on top]

[fn][gn][hn]C[attempting to shut the left black stones from the center...

if you want to gain influence in the center, you can always try the big open space around A
also B is crucial in actually shutting in black
(and possibly even C

but let's think about this. why do you want to gain center influence
1) because you can
2) because black's group has only one, or no, eyes
3) because you don't want black to form terretory here



since i think only 3 is applicable in this case( 1 is too but doesn't seem a strong enough reason since there are many other nice plays available) i would sugest anyone of the triangle stones , or something around A on the right side

these points all seem more or less reasonable jumps from your wall and all get you some quick center influence

a second proverb that might help is push toward your strong stones. the stones on top are strong, so that would sugest a play at B]
;B[ff];W[gf];B[fe];W[fd];B[gi];W[qf]C[now you are about to be shut of from the center yourself]

(;B[nc];W[qi];B[rk]C[this play is very low. you might even ask yourself if it even puts any preasure at all on your group (maybe a little but even a play at S11 doesn't hurt you much, see variation)

therefore try to get sente and play somewhere black should have played]

(;W[rj];B[qk];W[oi];B[le];W[mp];B[no];W[mq];B[lp];W[mo]C[attempting to break out of the corner and into the center...]
;B[ok];W[mi];B[lh];W[mg];B[lg];W[mk]TR[ne][oe][nf]C[Upon later review, I probably should have played n6 instead to break into the center for certain.

This is probably what would have cost me the game as I had to spend too many moves to protect the m9 stone and black ended up with a lot of territory at the top and bottom.



n6 seems very slow. if you think your top group needs more attention play one of the triangle stones

i think M10 also has promise

but most importantly, i don't think n9 is a bad move];B[nj]
;W[mj];B[ni];W[nh];B[mh];W[ng];B[mn];W[mm]C[n9 stones in danger.  I played n7 to force black to play m6 and possible create some eyespace for the n9 stones?

be very carefull with contact plays. even if he does play like you intent him too, he probally ends up blocking your path more than he helps you

also look at some other moves he might have tried. these variations arn't a complete set, but just some examples of which direction the fighting might go to

also, i would consider sacrificing the N10 group and prevent black to become huge on the lower side

most of the fights seem to favor white, but especially the very last thread is good for black]

(;B[ln]
(;W[oj]C[now you just mentioned you needed eyespace
if you want to give the N10 group eyespece, is this really the right direction

but better is not to play either of these (this one and variation) right now, since they are forcing moves and can be played later
this about where exactly you would like to see your eyes

then think about  how your moves could help you shape these shapes, but remember, you need to allow your opponenet some moves too]

(;B[nk];W[kk]C[attempting to create eyes for n9 stones or possibly connect to the 4 stones to the left if that fails]
;B[nm]C[luckily he opts to protect the right territory than to cut off my escape.]
;W[lm]C[is this really the fstest way to escape?
maybe a move around H9 would be more urgent];B[lo]C[now this move of black did nothing]

(;W[dq];B[eo];W[dp];B[fq]
(;W[qd]C[perhaps I should have invaded at r17 instead?

i like this move because it works well with the terretory you already have

if you look at the alternative it seems black might be able to do some damage to your group on the right side

one thing to remeber during yose is where are the BIG moves.
black could easily have ignored one of your moves and play something on the lower side]

;B[kr];W[ms];B[qj]C[I didn't realize the weakness in the walls until too late.

don't worry too much about having "some kind of weakness"
as long as you make sure your groups are alive, it might not even always be worth  patching up every weakness. it gets black only a few points... so no big deal]

Well, that's it.  Thanks again for taking the time to review this!!!

run earlier, i think that's the biggest thing you are missing.

i hope this was helpfull. for any questions or comments, feel free to email me 24/7
