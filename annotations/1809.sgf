C[Hi!  Thanks for reviewing this game for me.

magnus: Hi, I play as Zapp on KGS and I am rated as 3 Dan there.

My first impression from this game is that you are good at playing efficient shape in fights, but miss the overall perspective. White plays many overplays but goes to a good point often enough after each lost fight too keep up with you. If you combine your fighting skills with some improved strategic insights you will become much stronger. :-)

Summary of points:

* When the opponent ignores your moves you need to play severe counters, that also take into account which player is strong in nearby corners.

* Do not play low moves on the second line unless it is the only way to give your stones eyes.

* You have learned a lot of "good" moves. But you need to rethink the meaning of every such good move. Most moves in a joseki have a very important strategic purpose. In order to punish the mistakes of your opponent you have to understand this purpose.

You also have to realize that what is valid in the early game as a rule of thumb - does not hold later when a lot of stones on the board completely changes matters.


* What you need to do at every move is to think about what is strong and what is weak. *On the whole board*.
As soon as a local fight is stable you have to analyze how strengths and weaknesses combines too a good strategy, and then find a good move. 

* Remember that securing territory with no strategic purpose need to be worth at least 20 points or so - otherwise it should be left for the endgame. In this game and in the variations you seem to be happy sometimes with a gain of 10 points which is probably a loss of 10 points compared to the best move...

Go back to these points after you have read the comments and check where each of them applied to your game.]

(;W[od]LB[cf:A][mc:B][oe:C][ld:D]C[The problem here is that white ignored you. Fighting spirit would be to ignore white and take the initiative in the upper left.

The second problem is that a white move near K17 would be both a pincer attack and an extension from P16.

I searched my progame-database and there 9 out 17 players played at A, 3 played B, 2 played C and 1 D.

My point here is that the move you chose simple helps white to follow the strategy of attcking your stone at F17.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[md]C[M: At this stage you realize that the normal joseki will be painful for you. That is good - but you should have been thinking this before you played P17.

It is impossible to go through every variation in the head but at least one should check the "normal outcome" of a joseki choice.

Just following joseki is not enough. Joseki are only guaranteed to be good on empty boards. As soon as there are other stones on the board you need to adapt.]

(;B[db]C[Mp: This is too low to be active. You should pincer with C 14 and start a fight. or extending to to the right to prevent the pincer

This move make me suggest that you "continue playing the joseki" as if white had played D14.]
;W[hc];B[cc];W[ec]C[A decision for black....I think I made the wrong choice here.  Do you think so?

mp: Yes it was very wrong. Allowing white to cut through here:

a) Make the upper side into a huge moyo
b)  Make the white stones completely safe.
c) F17 becomes a bad wasted move
d) The corner is only good for eyes it has no territorial potential for expansion
e) Playing E18 will force white to play F16. If you get to play E18 and F16 then white will be split which is the opposite of a) and b).]

(;B[qf];W[eb]C[This is a very good position for white now.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[qk]LB[cg:A]C[M: White should calmly play A. R9 is not urgent. There are plenty of big points to play. But C13 is a must to stabilize the shape and take control over the center.

A minor point is that R17 is strong and low which means that it has little potential other than attacking so white should perhaps play R6 here if anything.]
;B[cg]C[m: Good!];W[fe]LB[ef:A]C[M: This move should be at A - which is proper shape.

There are different kinds of mistakes. There are mistakes that leaves a) weak groups to attack b) are inefficient.

In the first case one should attack, but in the other case one should wait and see. Perhaps the best opportunity will come later in the endgame.]

(;B[ef]TR[ec][hc][dd][fe]C[Junjun [7k\]: this was the move i did,,,,,didnt like it.  I know c 13 was big but is this continuation  or d 13 "big" as well?

magnus:
Locally this is an excellent point to play... but white is not weak here. The marked stones are strong so you should play elsewhere.

This move is like trying to cut the tail of a hunted animal.]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[fd]C[Junjun [7k\]: this seemed small of white

Yes, it is a mistake of the same reason as E 14 was a mistake. It seems as you were lucky and gained a little here.]
;B[rn]LB[pn:A][qi:B][fq:C]C[M: I would rather play A aiming at B and C simultaneously.

S6 is too low and if the continuation is as in the game it will look as you have played a slow move at S6 in the end.

Compare this with your move at D18, which also was low and "kind" to the white stones.]
;W[pn];B[no]LB[op:A][oo:B][po:C][qp:D][np:E][mp:F][mq:G]C[I had played high here with the idea of punishing white for allowing s 6.

M: It is too late to punish. Playing keima here is dangerous since it leaves bad aji (w A, bB, etc...). You are only punishing your self this way.

Even if white will not play A immediately you will need to protect this defect sooner and later.]
;W[mp]C[This move seemed really annoying.   I quckly saw the variation and didnt like it.

mp: Just answer with O4 and your problems have vanished (see your var.)  See it this way:

If you had played the correct move at O4 (instewad of o5), if then white would have attached with n4 then O5 would be a solid good answer.]

(;B[fq];W[np]C[m: This is the vital point. Compare this thinking with E18.
F3 is only a big point it is not urgent.

Note also how much better F3 would have been if you played bQ5 (instead of S6), followed by w R12.]

(;B[pq]C[wasnt sure what to do here .......

mp: This is ok (considering how bad the situation is) - but please check my comments in your variation.]
;W[po];B[ro];W[hq]C[M: This is a good move. It puts pressure on the black stones and begins to make use of the thickness in the center.]
;B[cq]LB[cn:A][fo:B]C[Another idea would be to play A - prepared to sacrifice the stone at F3. Or jump to B and fight.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co]C[i know this is wrong......but i mess it up >.<]
;B[cr]C[m: This is the correct and difficult move to remember.]
;W[dr]C[i remembered this part.....]
(;B[bo]C[but a mistake here

m: right You have memorized some good moves but did not understand them. The only way C5 can be a mistake is if Black can cut there. The Difficult move is C2 which is a calm move that gives strenght to the corner in preparation for the cut. If the cut works then white will play D5 now right?  So B5 cannot be the "strong" move here.]
;W[cn];B[do]C[M: Now it is too late.];W[bn]LB[eo:A]C[M: White should perhaps simply play the ladder.]

M: E9 is good!  The only alternatives I can see here is A, B and C but I cannot tell what is best.

The key to this position is the marked stones. You have to think globally. I added a lenghty explanation  why D8 is wrong in the variation.]
;B[gn];W[hn];B[gm];W[hm];B[hl]LB[fk:A]C[m: Dangerous move. Attaching at A first would be better. That would protect the hane at H8 later.]

(;W[fn]C[this seemed bad.....i am out now....and he loses sente doing this]
;B[fm];W[fo];B[dl];W[gj];B[cj];W[dk]C[m: bad. White should expand the moyo. There is no point of attacking the black group now at least not in this fashion that only complicates things.]

C[this seemed bad it ignores that black is safe now.

MP: Yes. The key point now is at A. since white provoked the the marked stone.]
;B[df];W[or];B[pr];W[rm]TR[ld][pg][gi][qk]C[mp: This is bad the marked stones is already in place and already do the job. The center is most important now.

White wish to play the marked points.];B[nr]LB[gr:A][hr:B][hs:C]
[is:D][gs:E][ir:F]C[m: This is also bad. There is very little territory in the lower side.  There are >50 potential points in the center but only 10 on the lower side since black will be able to play A etc in sente.]
;W[mr];B[nq];W[mq];B[op];W[oo]C[white now has a very big moyo ....was o2 a misplay?

mp: Yes, see previous comment];B[gq]LB[il:A][ho:B]C[Mp: This is not a huge mistake but playing these endgame moves now is a a mistake in principle because they make white even stronger.

If you instead invades the moyo (or reduce it) and a fight breaks out you could play A and B to win the fight.

These moves ruins this potential to some degree.];W[hp];B[hr]
;W[ir];B[ne]LB[lj:A][li:B]TR[nb][lc]C[my goal here is to reduce white as much as possible

m: I would play A or near it - perhaps B, most likely A.

Besides, I do not like this peep. Because if white connects then the connection between the marked stones is broken.]

(;W[ld];B[nd];W[mc];B[mb]C[m: If white now do not help you and play L17 the upper side has become a little stronger for white.]

M: Such rules only apply to the opening when there are no strong groups on the board.

How many secure points do white get? Max 7 if black plays first and perhaps 12 if white is first.

All marked stones here are strong and they cancel each other the left side is thus not interesting at all, because it is difficult make territory. White should try to make black make territory here! Then b6 and c6 would cancel it!

Now look on the center. I added a lot of dots there. This is the part of the board which is important.

In this variation black is very happy because the wakest group is running into it ruining the moyo potential. Black might even play L4 now and attack H3 and G5.]
