C[Hello,   I played this game against Gnu Go 2.6. Since I'm a beginner the program was handicapped with me 3 stones ahead. It was a very interesting game to me, and a very illustrative one in the sense of my Go playing skills.

I couldn't resist putting several comments during the game which emphasize moments when my thoughts were strongly "converging" towards some goal. I would very much appreciate if you could comment the game, with as much detail as you like.

Greetings,

[gm][hm][im][jm][km][lm][mm];W[kd];B[ki]C[far too close to your komi stones.  When opening you want to spread stuff out with in reason.]
;W[fc]
(;B[dc]C[Again too tight for an opening.  learn some joseki, they can be applied in 19X19 games also.  See variants]
;W[hj];B[fj];W[gh];B[eg];W[id]
(;B[gg]C[I think this is premature.  Your ahead on influence so you have no need to attack him so strongly.  See variant.]
;W[hg]C[why not cut?  You are strong attack.  don't pull back to defend now.  See variants.]

(;B[fg];W[kg]C[White should play solid at H6 or J6.  this is all too loose.]
;B[hh];W[gi]C[see variant.  This is a basic position.  Don't play into situation where you have few liberties.]

(;B[hi];W[ii];B[ih];W[ij];B[gj];W[ji];B[jh];W[jk]C[You gave up something that was yours all because you played H5.  you lose a lot.

I'll give it the LR corner (I feel I'm going to anyway), and try to take some territory on the R side in exchange.]
;B[kh];W[kj];B[hk];W[fe]C[This is a huge mistake.  White is opening himself up for death.  See variant.]

;W[fd];B[gc];W[ig];B[jg];W[gb];B[kf]C[I liked this one: 1. protects k8, 2. places L7 in atari, 3. expands along R side]

;B[gl];W[da]C[End game moves.  Don't respond unless you need to.  See variant for a possible continuation.]

(;B[ca];W[ea];B[cb];W[de]C[now begins a big invasion that white should have done well before H1 or D13]
;B[ce];W[df];B[cf];W[dg]
(;B[jl]C[You can't kill white now. Can only gain profit.  See variants

this attack seemed very plausible at the moment, but...];W[kl]
C[...not anticipating white L2.
I make this mistake often. Now White lives for sure.];B[lj]
;W[ik];B[lk];W[kk]C[C7 is the biggest point here.  The lower right lives so leave it alone.  Playing M2 gains 5 point smaybe.    trying to reduce W some more...]
;B[ll];W[cg]C[This loses you round 60 some points probably in the end.  One move difference.]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[bf];W[ck]C[this doesn't look good]
(;B[bj]C[This is very bad.  Stay connected in close fighting like this.  The whites variant on move 79 and you'll see why its so horrid for you.    Again learn some corner joseki.  It'll help with these kind of invasions.]
;W[cj];B[ci]C[see white variant]
