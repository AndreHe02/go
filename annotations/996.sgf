GC[A hard fought rengo game with some interesting turns and mistakes by all players.   Handicap was estimated at 5 stones which seemed to work quite well.]


C[Hello! This is a rengo game that was played at the local club. B is played by Paul Yates (2d) and Ben Handley (10k) while w is played by me (1d) and Matt Wood (2d).  Local (New Zealand) rules were used. This was a bit of a marathon game, lasting until after midnight and I think you'll see some errors coming in later in the game as we all got tired.

I have included all the comments that came up during the game.  if you have any insights that we have missed then I would appreciate you sharing them.

Thank you, Corrin];B[dd]C[tob : This is my first time to review in this web.
Hope you enjoy and get some idea from my  comment.];B[dp];B[pc]
;B[pq];B[qe]C[The top right shimari wasn't the one b initially played (it was pointed towards q3) but it got bumped in the game and we decided it was safer to continue with this than change it.]
;W[po]C[(at this point the top right shimari was pointed here, hence q5)

Generally the teams coordinated their moves well.  Where w coordinated badly (about move 40) I have labelled who made each move.  If you want to work out who made any other move then  divide the move number by 4 and get the remainder.

0: Matt
1: Ben
2: Corrin
3: Paul

e.g. 6 % 4 = 2, so I (Corrin) played the first white move];B[qo]

(;W[qn]C[tob : I don't like r16 because this is handicap and  it's not good for white to end with gote.See my  reference.]
;B[qp];W[pm];B[nq];W[qh]C[Obviously this move makes more sense if you  imagine the shimari pointing here.

tob : I think this is not good for white because black  can invade at r8,r10 or around it.]

tob : Instead of c17,A or B is interesting.];B[dc];W[db]C[tob : I prefer e18.See variations.]

(;B[cd];W[bb];B[dj]C[ben ommitted c17 (he didn't know the joseki) but I  didn't find a way to take advantage

tob : It is not urgent.White will take advantage in  end game.]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[fp];B[fq]C[Paul felt f3 was a mistake.  I didn't particularly like it  but didn't dislike it enough to call it a mistake.

tob : See my reference.]

(;W[hp]C[I would have played h4 at g4 because of g2  weakness.  Matt and I seemed to be pushing in  different directions for the next few moves

C[matt made this move];B[in]C[ben made this move];W[do]C[I made this move.

This is a mistake (overplay).  I had thought c5, e5,  c3, and w strong in sente

tob : d5 is still playable.];B[co];W[dm]C[Matt played this move

I didn't like d7, but I can understand why matt played it];B[en]

;W[il]C[from now on matt and I managed to coordinate a little better, so I'll no longer annotate the moves by who made them.]
;B[nn];W[ln]C[This was probably and overplay (should be F8) but I  feared b would get too far ahead

tob : Play at m4 is not bad.It seem slow but in  handicap game if black play safe it will hard for  white to play.]

;W[gm]C[mistake by me.  I was trying to make the connection  sente and didn't see the e8 bamboo forced w to  defend.  g6 would have been better because it _is_  sente.

tob: should be  f6 or g6.];B[fn];W[gn];B[el];W[dk];B[gi]C[I think g10 better
