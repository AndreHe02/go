;B[pj]TR[rf]LB[pk:A]C[I think you'd be better playing this one move before, and missing out S14 (marked) altogether. Yes, blocking white from jumping into your territory here is big, but it's only endgame really.

Once you have played S14, I think you should probably make your extension one point lower (at 'A').]
;W[jd];B[fc]LB[cf:A][co:B]C[There's no need to invade here. White has put all his effort into the top side, while you are already building on a larger scale. You can play to expand your own framework with a move like A or B. Invading like this just gives W something to attack.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[cf];B[ib];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[hc]C[Good. This makes a fine shape.]
;W[kb]TR[mc]C[I think this move was a bit slow. Black has sufficiently good eye shape that attacking him more won't be very productive, and since the N17 stone (marked) is low (on the third line), White doesn't really need to defend his territory in the top right.]
;B[he];W[qn]LB[op:A]C[Now white is invading a narrow space, like black did earlier. This white stone doesn't really have room to extend up the right-hand side to make eyes, so it's going to become a target for attack. If white wants to approach this corner, he would be better to do it from the other side, around A.]
;B[ql]LB[op:A]TR[pj]C[I think black should also have played around A, which makes a nice profit while keeping up the pressure on white.

Your marked stone at Q10 is already doing a good job of preventing white moving up the right hand side.]
;W[op];B[po]C[Good, it's importand to keep White separated.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[ol];B[qr];W[or];B[mn]C[Good. Now white has two weak groups, both of which are too big to sacrifice easily.]
;W[lq];B[iq]LB[jq:A]C[You should consider stretching one line further, at A. This will attack white more strongly, and you don't need to worry too much about a counter-attack while white already has so many weak stones.]
;W[jq];B[hq]LB[ip:A][ir:B]C[A or B would have more effect on white's group.]
;W[jp];B[nq]C[This is an interesting idea...];W[np]TR[nq]C[... but you can only play it if you're willing to follow up by pushing through and cutting. I don't know what would happen, but anything else will surely turn the marked stone into a bad move.

See the variation for one possibility.]
(;B[pq];W[oq]LB[pq:1][oq:2][nq:3][np:4]C[If you imagine the last four moves in the order Q3 P3 O3 O4, you can see how bad this result is for black.]
;B[mp]C[Playing on here just costs you a move for little return.]
;W[mq];B[no];W[lp]TR[mp]C[Best to ignore this. N4 isn't cutting white into two, so it's of little value.]
;B[mo];W[nk];B[oi];W[pp];B[qo];W[pr]C[You could consider ignoring this, too. White's group at the bottom is already strong, so there's no harm in letting it get stronger. If you use the move to attack white's group on the right-hand-side instead, you shouldn't need to worry about your own eye space in the corner.]
;B[qq];W[rn];B[ro]LB[ll:A]C[This more-or-less gives you two eyes in the corner, but still I think it would be better to move out into the centre (maybe around A) to keep up the attack on white. White will have too hard a time trying to save these stones to have time to take away your eyes in the corner.]
;W[rl];B[rk]C[Good.];W[qm]LB[sl:A][sm:B]C[I would be tempted to answer this at T8 (A). It would be hard for white to answer at T7 (B) and fight the ko. See variation.]

(;B[qk];W[sm];B[sk];W[sl];B[so];W[sn];B[om];W[pl];B[ml]LB[ll:A]
C[This is a little bit close. M8 instead might make it harder for white to push his way out.]
;W[mk];B[ll];W[mi];B[nh];W[ni];B[oh];W[oj]
(;B[ne]LB[od:A]C[I don't like this. Your stones here are already strong, so you don't need to spend a move. You're not reducing white's territory by much either, and when white answers you're removing the possibility of trying something with P16 later (see variation).]
;W[nd];B[me]
(;W[fq]TR[me][ne][nd]C[This is worth more to white than the marked exhange was to black.]

(;B[fr]TR[hq][iq]LB[do:A][hn:B]C[You can connect the marked stones out like this, but the cost is too high. I think you should try playing calmly at A, or running away at B (see variations).]
;W[gr];B[gq];W[er];B[fp];W[eq];B[ep];W[dr]
(;B[ho]TR[gq][hq][iq]C[The three marked stones aren't very important. I think it would be better to protect the corner (see variation).]
;W[cq];B[dp];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn]C[White has made a lot of profit in the corner and, importantly, has kept sente.]
;W[ci];B[bn]TR[ci]C[This is a bit small. White doesn't really have to answer it, and you don't have much prospect of making territory above now white has played C11.]
;W[bp];B[bj];W[bi];B[cj];W[fl];B[di]TR[fl]C[Good. This is a key shape point, and it will be hard to attack F8 if white gets to play here.]
;W[dh]
(;B[ai]TR[di]LB[eh:A]C[This is too early. When you've played a move like D11, you want to be able to follow up with another hane at E12 (A). The moved you played reduces the threat of that.]
;W[bh];B[ah];W[ag];B[aj];W[cg]
(;B[ei]LB[dj:A][fj:B]TR[di][fl]C[This attacks white's marked F8 stone, which is good, but it leaves a worrying cutting point at D10 (A). I'd be more tempted to play B, which allows black's marked D11 stone to be given up if necessary.]
;W[hk];B[eh]LB[jj:A][jk:B]C[It's going to be hard to win the game if white's two stones escape, so I'd be tempted to attack them directly, perhaps by playing A or B.]
;W[jj]C[Now white's stones have escaped, and the game is hard for black.]

;B[kh];W[mh];B[mg];W[eg];B[fg];W[ff];B[ef]C[Good. White's last move was too greedy.]
;W[dg];B[ee];W[gg];B[fh];W[hf];B[if];W[ge];B[hg]LB[ie:A]C[There's no need to play too close to these stones, just prevent them escaping. J15 looks safest to me.]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[id];B[gd];W[gi];B[gh];W[fj];B[ej]C[You're letting yourself get pushed around a bit here. All your groups are strong already, so there's no need to worry about being cut.]
;W[ek];B[dk];W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[hr]C[Good, white's last move didn't need an answer.]

(;B[sa]LB[ra:A]C[I think if you play S19 instead, you can get a seki in sente. That would make the game close, but I think you would be ahead by a few points.

In the end, the ko you reach requires you to ignore four white moves to win, so it's worth very little.]
;W[ra];B[qa];W[nc];B[sa];W[qd];B[ja];W[ra]LB[sa:A][pc:B]C[Note that white can win this ko by connecting at T19 (A), but black needs to play four moves to win. Instead of fighting the ko, I think you should fill an outside liberty, offering white the chance to connect at T19 for a seki. If white wants to continue fighting the ko, he will have to play Q17 (B); then black will only need to ignore two white moves elswhere to win.]

(;B[cr];W[br];B[sa];W[pc]C[This is a terrible move. After it's played and black answers, black only needs to ignore two white moves to win the ko, when previously he needed to ignore four. White would do better to pass.]
