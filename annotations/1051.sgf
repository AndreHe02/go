AB[pd][dp]C[Jeff -- I'm playing white and am a 13k  player on KGS

Martijn Wallage - Hi, I'm the reviewer. I'm a  Dutch 1st kyu. I hope you learn something  from this review.]
;W[qp]C[Angalot [15k\]: and hello from Belgrade. <bonk>];B[cd]
;W[ec];B[hd]
(;W[ee]C[Jeff -- Is the two space jump appropriate  with the  two space pincer? I wasn't sure, so I went  with the  once space jump.

Martijn - The one space jump is an unusual  move with the two space pincer. But it's not  that bad. I often go for the kosumi, see  variation. Just try different moves and see  what you like.]
;B[df];W[cb]C[Jeff -- should I have counterattacked at k16  instead?  Or elsewhere?

Martijn - No. You're in black's sphere of  influence.  That means you should play defensive.  And since you can still settle yourself,  that's what you should do.  So what you did was right.

It's a simple rule: Play defensive in your  opponents sphere of influence, attack in  your own sphere of influence.]
;B[bc]C[Martijn - Black shouldn't play here. He  should tenuki (play elsewhere). He can  later decide how he wants to attack white.]
;W[hb];B[fd];W[de]C[Martijn- Just connect. This helps black.  You should only play moves like this when  you get sente, but here you don't since  after this move you still need to connect.]
;B[ce];W[dc];B[gb];W[gc];B[fc];W[fb];B[hc];W[ga];B[eb]C[Martijn - This move is a total waste. He just  throws a dead stone inside your territory. It  doesn't even threaten a sente move. It  threatens a thread for a sente move, that's  how gote this move is. So don't  respond.]

(;W[db]C[Martijn - ah :). This move is a total waste  to. If your going to play here you should  play as in the variation. That at least  makes two eyes.]
;B[gd];W[gb];B[ci];W[oq]C[Jeff -- Would it have been bigger to approach one of  the corners instead?

Martijn - I'm sure this is a great move. But  approaching a corner would have been big to.]
;B[jp];W[qj]C[Jeff -- I also thought about playing on the  fourth line.  Would that have been appropriate?

Martijn -  No, this is good. Playing on the  fourth line is for influence. But since white  won't get a moyo (at least, I don't see it  coming), playing for territory like this is  right. In fact it's the best move you could  have played. In fact, black should have  played there with his last move, because  this side of the white shimari is bigger.]
;B[qg];W[nc];B[lc];W[qc]C[Jeff -- I knew this move would make him  thick, but I  didn't see that I had much choice. And  since he was  open on the left, I figured I could reduce  that later.

Martijn - It's ok. But black isn't so open on  the left. Later in the game he can probably  close off that side in sente. Since white still  needs to live.]
;B[pc]C[JMiller [13k\]: You're always welcome at the Boston Go club]
;W[pb]C[Angalot [15k\]: it's a long journey to Boston... as a matter of fact, maybe next year I'll come to Philadelphia, so, who knows? :)))]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[qe];W[rf];B[rg]C[Angalot [15k\]: ... all I know about Boston is the Celtics. :)]
;W[dn]C[Jeff -- I chose the high approach because  my position overall is low.

Martijn - I think it's better to approach low.  Because you need to settle yourself, and  that's easier when you're low.]
;B[dl]C[JMiller [13k\]: They haven't been playing so well lately. But the football team, the Patriots, now there's a good story.]

(;W[cp]C[Jeff -- Is there a better move?

Martijn - Yes. This move seems strange  because it looks like you want to help your  single stone. But that stone has very small  space to live in. So you should probably  try to use that stone to settle in the corner.]
;B[dq]C[Martijn - Black should have played on 3-3.  Now he lets you live in the corner.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[br]C[Angalot [15k\]: I'm sure it will, USA is a big land]
;B[mq]
(;W[oo]C[Martijn - This doesn't defend your weaknesses very  well. The white shimari is quite strong. But  there's a gap between the white shimari  and the lonely stone. Normally it's not that  bad. But now black is strong in the  surroundings so white needs to defend.]
;B[ql]C[Martijn - It seems deep. But I think it's  quite a strong invasion.]

;W[pp];B[mn];W[rp];B[cn];W[co];B[en];W[cm];B[dm];W[do]C[Martijn - This is a good move. It threatens  to break into black's moyo.]

(;B[cl]C[Martijn - And black doesn't respond so...]
(;W[bm]C[Martijn - No. See variation.];B[eo]C[Jeff -- I think I got lucky with that sequence.  It seems black could have really done a lot  of damage to white.

Martijn - I think black got lucky. You could  have walked into his moyo. Now black has  a big moyo. You played too frightened  here.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cs];B[eq];W[nn];B[nm];W[mm]C[Martijn - Ah, that's the spirit :).]
;B[no];W[on];B[mo]LB[no:A]C[Martijn- That's a terrible move by black. He  defends a stone (A) that's not important.]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[nl];B[ok];W[ol];B[oi]
(;W[ph]C[Jeff -- In hindsight, this play seems  unreasonable.  Instead, It hink I should  have jumped out to k8 or nearby.

Martijn - yes, it's unreasonable. But there  are things possible there.]

C[Martijn - On general you play reasonable.  But you play to many unneccesary moves.  If you would play only moves you were  sure are neccesary you'd get stronger  quickly.
Thanks for letting me review this game.
