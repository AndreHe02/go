C[i mail to GTL first.
Here is my attached file. I am sadwind and i take black.

(my english is poor..^^:)

Hi,

my name is Rainer (Beholder on KGS) and I will do this review.
I will first go through the game, making suggestions and trying to answer your questions.
After that I will try to summarise the main points here.

General advice:

Do not try to kill intruding stones right away, but let them live small and get stronger while attacking the stones.
Try to avoid generating cutting points.

All in all you play very well.

Best regard

Rainer];B[qd];W[dc];B[pp];W[cp];B[oc];W[qf]C[Beholder:
This stone is too near to the black shimari. It is easy to attack, so considerable territory should be gained by attacking it.]

(;B[qh]C[black (12R) or (14p) what is good?

Beholder:
R12 is ok. Black puts pressure on the white stone and should be able to gain something by it. It is not important to try to kill the stone, but you should gain while attacking it.

P14 would not be so very good. Always try to press enemy stones against your thickness (see variation).]

[eq:B][jq:H]C[(17R) to get corner territory

Beholder:
The corner looks quite save to me.
But consider the alternatives to your move (A-G). You are very concentrated in the upper right, while white is present in 3 areas.]
;W[mc];B[nb];W[pd];B[pc];W[od];B[mh];W[ng];B[mg]LB[nh:A]C[Beholder:
Better play at A, because now you generate cutting points.]
;W[nh];B[ni];W[pg];B[ph];W[kc];B[jd];W[kd];B[jf]LB[fc:A]C[Beholder:

Here you should try to make a base for this group before jumping to the center.]
;W[gc];B[kg];W[lf];B[eq]TR[je][lg][mi]C[(3E) to approach move

Beholder:

The kakari is ok, but you have to keep in mind that you have a lot of cutting points and your moyo on the right side and corner is still open for invasion.]
;W[dq];B[er];W[dr];B[ip]C[here (J4) (J3) (R3) (R4) (L3) (L4) what is good?

Beholder:
I would prefer J3. It is less open for an attack from around L3.
L3 and L4 are too far away from the E3 group.
R3 and R4 would leave the E3 group very alone and prone to attack.]
;W[qn]
(;B[nq]LB[ql:A]C[Beholder:
The pincer at A would be better (see variations) or the play at O4 .]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[qk]LB[oi:A]C[Beholder:

Here the cut at A becomes dangerous.];B[on];W[po];B[oo];W[qo]
;B[ok];W[cf];B[ch]C[Beholder:
This is not good. You invite white to pincer you.];W[cj];B[eh]
;W[ef]C[Beholder:
With the play at C12 you have strengthend the upper left corner considerably.]
;B[ej];W[di];B[dh];W[ei];B[fi];W[dl];B[ek];W[dk];B[el];W[em]
;B[fm];W[ep];B[en];W[dm];B[fp];W[eo];B[fo];W[dn];B[fn]C[i want to my place more thick

Beholder:
You have very tough wall and a very large moyo, so white has to do something against it or loses for sure.]
;W[lq]C[white (3M) into my place ...how can i kill it ??

Beholder:
The question is not how to kill it. You have to make it live small and eventually kill it. Do not go into a fight with the basic wish to kill your opponents stones, but to let them live small. If you go for the kill you will make risky moves and lose more than would be otherwise necessary.

Try to cap it, this way you strengthen your own position while attacking white's stones (see variation).]

(;B[jq];W[kp];B[kq]C[Beholder:
Playing contact moves makes the stones on both sides stronger.]
;W[lo];B[lm];W[no];B[nm]C[Beholder:
Why not O6?];W[np];B[op];W[jn];B[kn]C[Beholder:
There is no possibility to cut.];W[jo];B[jm];W[hn];C[white is more bigger >"< and this time...
my time to exhaust~
thx for your teaching ~

Beholder:
Here the game has stopped.
I have added one possible continuation.];B[hm];W[im];B[il];W[in]

TR[gg]C[Beholder:
A and B are miai for black, the white stones are very probably dead. So black can continue to form the moyo into territory with e.g. a move at the triangled point.
I think it is possible for black to win with about 40 moku.]

Now the possibilities for white are small.]))

(;W[on];B[np];W[ol];B[pk];W[rp];B[qq]LB[pm:A]C[Beholder:
This leaves A for attack by black. White is not settled and has still to find eyespace.]

(;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po]LB[jp:A]C[Beholder:
This is almost joseki. J4 would have to be at A.])))
(;B[of];W[qi]LB[pe:A]C[Beholder:

White slips away...
And A is a weakness white can explore...]))
