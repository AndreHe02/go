C[Honinbou [11k\]: hi again
Honinbou [11k\]: enjoy

Dear reviewer, this was a blitzgame (time setting 1+10/2).
However, after the game I noticed that I played almost exactly like I would play in normal games.

RickMott: Hello.  That may not be a good thing; perhaps it means you don't read things out deeply enough in normal games... :)

You and I have very nearly the same rating, but it is said that one is two stones stronger when not playing, so maybe it's OK.  I'm actually at a conference in Germany now (12-17 June), at Wildbad Kreuth (south of Munich).

Overall, I thought you played well, especially considering the time pressure.  Most errors were probably things you could have seen with more time.  The biggest place you can get some points quickly is in the end game.  There were a number of places where you missed threats, or played small gote moves when bigger or sente moves were available.  I don't know how easy it will be to find in Germany, but I like Volume 5 of Janice Kim's "Learn to Play Go" series, subtitled "The Palace of Memory".  This book has an excellent, concise section on analyzing end game moves for maximum effect.  I recommend it highly.  I think this section alone made me half a stone stronger.

Good luck!];B[pd]C[AlphaSai [10k\]: hi again :-)];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[fq]C[RickMott: This is Ok, but a play on the right side would be better.  If you start with the Chinese pattern, the third move should be on the right; Q9 or R9 for the classical Chinese, or some kind of extension from your asymmetrical corner.  The right side is the biggest open area, therefore the most important.

White chose to answer you, but he might have been better to tenuki and take a big point on the right.]
;W[dn];B[jp];W[nc]C[RickMott: Again, not the most urgent point for White.  He should make a play on the right to disrupt your emerging moyo.]
;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]C[RickMott: Small move by White, you should ignore it...]
;B[qn]C[RickMott: Good!  My sense is that Black has come out better in the opening so far.]
;W[jj]C[RickMott: Wow.  This is a very greedy move.  White has no hope of holding a moyo that size, but it may help him later in fighting.  You must be careful with joseki which expect the center to be open.]
;B[pj]C[Is q10 good? I wanted to make good shape at the right side, but maybe there's a better way to build a large framework.

RickMott: I think it's OK, but a little passive.  Ok because White's moyo is so loose it cannot become territory, while Q10 secures territory on the right.

I might be tempted to push down on White's low position in the top right, with something like O15, and then come back with a higher blocking move like N10.  Or an immediate invasion at the top or left; probably left, because you don't want to build up white's upper right position.]
;W[id];B[cf]C[RickMott: It remains possible to invade white's moyo for at least one more move.  Since you opted for territory on the last move, maybe N4 now, to make your own territory rock solid, would be good.

Then if white plays around D10, you can invade the corner at C17.  You will finish with sente, and then you can reduce white's moyo from the outside in safety.  This approach will let white solidify his moyo, I think.]
;W[ci]C[At the moment I'm trying some sabaki stuff. Please correct my mistakes :)]
;B[ef]C[RickMott: I think it is normal to dive into the 3-3 point in response to a pincer.  Jumping out, especially with White's tengen stone blocking an obvious escape, just makes you a target.]
;W[fe]C[RickMott: I don't think this is White's best response.  He would be better off to close the corner somehow; maybe C16.]
;B[cd]C[RickMott: I like this move.];W[cc];B[dc]C[RickMott: You don't need to start the complication of a cross-cut here.  Just descend to B16, I think.  Living simply is good enough.  You will be ahead in territory.]
;W[ec];B[db]C[RickMott: But if you crosscut, this is correct.  You should (almost) always descend toward the edge from a crosscut atari on the 4th line, even if you can't save the stones, to get more aji from the sacrifice.]
;W[ce]C[RickMott: This is probably not so good for White because it leaves too many cutting points in his shape.  He would do better to play E3.]
;B[bd];W[de];B[be];W[eb];B[cb];W[df];B[cg]C[RickMott: This is all fine for Black.  You live easily.  The trick is to know when to tenuki now.]
;W[dg];B[cl]C[was this overplay? I felt as though i should first have secured the bottom.

RickMott: I don't know about overplay, but you didn't need to make a deep invasion with the resulting complications to win.  You're ahead in territory; you should be looking to simplify the game.

If I were going to play in this area, I would be tempted to play on the 4th line.  Easier to escape.]
;W[ej]C[RickMott: But fortunately, White offers you a clear way out, and weakens his own corner stones.  Good deal.  Take it.]
;B[el];W[go]C[RickMott: I think this move tries to do too much.  You should fight now.  You will either live on the side and damage White's corner, or capture G5 and make your bottom territory huge.

I would play F5 to separate White.];B[bn];W[bo];B[cn];W[co]
;B[dm]C[RickMott: This sequence is Ok, but it makes White stronger and now F3 is weak.  I would prefer to separate White and fight that way.]
;W[en];B[hp]C[not a good time to tenuki, aint it?

RickMott: Maybe not so bad.  You still have room to run, and make a base.  Strengthening F3 is important.]
;W[mq]C[whats the best response to this move without becoming overconcentrated?

RickMott: This invasion by White seems very risky.  I would cap at M5 and ask him to live inside.  Even if he succeeds, you will build outside power with which to destroy White's center moyo.]
;B[lp]C[RickMott: I don't like this so much.  I would prefer either N5 to seal White in, or L3 to force him to run out.]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[no]
(;B[lq]C[RickMott: I think if you start down this path, you are committed to fight.  You should double-hane at O6 or cut immediately at O4.  See variations.]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[op];B[pp];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[pl]
C[RickMott: Ok, up to here you have been forced a bit compared to the cut-and-fight sequence I described, but you are strong on both sides with solid territory.]
;W[nf]C[RickMott: Too far.  You are strong here.  Play O16  and cut.  You are strong enough to fight, and you don't want to give White so much territory easily.  See variations.]

(;B[oh];W[mh]C[RickMott: You are consolidating territory but White is getting too much here.  You must reduce somehow.]
;B[gl]C[RickMott: This move doesn't help you all that much, and it asks White to plug the remaining gap in his moyo.

I'd think about making a base for this group with B10, or extending to C12.]
;W[hm];B[gj]C[RickMott: You are not strong enough.  When White peeps at F9, it's not a good fight for you.  I would play a contact at F10 instead.]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[bk];B[bl];W[dk];B[ck];W[bj]
(;B[ek]C[RickMott: I think this move is not good.  You force White to patch up a weakness, without getting anything in return.

I would prefer to keep pushing at C10, or connect at G9 to break into White's territory.  White's theat to push at D8
is empty; if he tries, you can capture himin either case.  See variations.]
;W[dj];B[fj];W[dl];B[em];W[cm]
(;B[an]C[RickMott: Too passive, and still doesn't guarantee an eye.  D12 is probably strong for you, or you can poke out at J9.  See variations for D12 fighting.]
;W[hk]C[RickMott: White gets some forcing moves in.  You live, but you're sealed in and White will complete the moyo.  This is not good for you.]
;B[gk];W[gh]
(;B[fn]C[RickMott: I like a push at H8 better; see variation.]
;W[gm];B[eo]C[RickMott: This move is premature and costs you sente.  A simple connection is good enough, locally.]
;W[do];B[hl];W[fm]
(;B[im]C[RickMott: I think the cutting stone is very important here.  If you allow white to connect, you lose all aji against both the corner and the center stones.  I would connect at F5 and fight.]
;W[fo]C[RickMott: Big move for White.  Now his groups are connected.]
;B[hn]C[RickMott: This move is forcing, but the result doesn't matter.  A better move would be H11, threatening to both capture H9 and break into White's moyo.]
;W[gn];B[ik];W[qe]C[RickMott:  Good move by White.  Your move is not forcing; he can give up H9, it is not important.]
;B[pe]C[RickMott: It's very important for you to end this sequence in sente.  White has greatly reduced your right side, so you have to get sente in order ot reduce his upper moyo.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[qd];B[qf];W[re];B[rf];W[pc]C[Whats the best way to pressure on whites territory now?

RickMott: I like F12.  It threatens to cut off white's left-side group, and break into white's moyo at the same time.  See variation.  If white chooses to defend against this, you can make a significant reduction on the other side.]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[me];B[mf];W[mr];B[dr]C[RickMott:  Too small, I think.  This is not forcing; White can live anytime by capturing E5.]
;W[cq]C[RickMott: But White answered you anyway, so it must be OK. :)]
;B[ii]C[RickMott: Only a single-purpose move (reducing).  I like the F12 sequence better because it also threatens to cut off the left side.]
;W[ig];B[lf]C[RickMott: This move implies a cut at N17 next.   I think M13 or even M12 might be better; you put indirect pressure on White's stones and also make it easier  to connect to your left-center group.]
;W[ng];B[jh];W[jg];B[kh];W[kg];B[lh];W[lg]C[RickMott: This sequence was not good for you.  You made White's position solid and eliminated any aji against the three stones at N12, O13 and O14.]

(;B[mi];W[nh];B[ld]C[RickMott: This doesn't work; make the cut at N17.]
;W[mc];B[ni];W[mg];B[ll];W[ln];B[kn];W[kr];B[lr];W[ls];B[jr]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[oq];B[pr];W[or];B[kp];W[ks];B[js];W[ms];B[ea]
;W[fa];B[da];W[fb];B[cj]C[RickMott:  I think this could be the final losing move.  All you do is force White to fix his weakness without even gaining a point.  The F12 sequence in the earlier variation is much better.]
;W[di];B[bh];W[bi];B[ch];W[dh];B[bf]C[RickMott: This move is not necessary.  Giving White sente at this stage is unfortunate.  B2 would have gotten you enough points to win, as would F12.]
;W[ao];B[on]C[RickMott:  Save this kind of move for a ko threat.]
;W[oo];B[ol];W[nm];B[fh]C[RickMott: You found it, but it would have been much more effective before you force White to make himself safe on the left.]
;W[fg];B[gg]C[RickMott: I don't think this can work with so many strong white stones nearby.]
;W[hh];B[eg];W[fi]C[RickMott: Ouch.];B[gi];W[eh];B[cr]C[RickMott: Jump to B2.  This is a good trick to learn.]
;W[br];B[og]C[RickMott: 1 point gote move.  There are many bigger moves; B1 is even sente!]
;W[rg];B[se];W[sd];B[sf];W[of];B[pg];W[oi];B[oj];W[li];B[ij]
;W[ih];B[ji];W[eq];B[er];W[gq];B[gp];W[fr];B[fp];W[gr];B[fs]
C[RickMott: In a liberty battle, always reduce the opponent's liberties from the outside.  So this would be better at H3.]
;W[es];B[hr]C[RickMott: Good response.];W[dq];B[hq];W[gs];B[hs]
;W[cs];B[fs];W[ho];B[io];W[in];B[jn];W[ep];B[hn]C[RickMott: Ko is half a point.  Again, lots of bigger moves; P1 is worth 4 points.  O8 is worth at least 2.  The end game is where a little study can pay off in a big way; learning to evaluate the size of end-game move and handle sente optimally can easily make a difference of 8 or 10 points.]
;W[hi];B[ds]C[RickMott: You can take this anytime; White cannot connect, so this is a wasted move.  Taking H10 is worth 2 points; P1 is still bigger, because Q2 by White is sente otherwise.]
;W[nl];B[oc]C[RickMott: ends in gote.  This could be the losing move for you; playing O9  instead protects the cuts at N10 and O10, and ensures that you keep some territory in the center.  The swing is easily more than the final spread of 6.5 points.]
;W[ob];B[od]
(;W[lm]C[RickMott: White missed a good move here.  O10 atari is a problem for you.  See variation.]

(;B[kl]C[RickMott: M10 atari would be better, possibly by enough to win.]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[mk];B[ml];W[nk];B[os]C[RickMott: Now, the cut at M10 is worth more, otherwise White gets to rescue both K10 and M11.]
;W[ns]C[RickMott: But he answered you anyway.];B[ps];W[ok];B[pk]
;W[lj]C[RickMott: This should be at L10 instead.];B[kj];W[kk]
;B[jk];W[km];B[lk];W[jm];B[in]C[RickMott: K8 is a little better; whole point vs. half-point ko.]
;W[jl];B[il];W[mm];B[kk];W[nn]C[RickMott: Unnecessary move.  White would be better to connect at H10 or B1; 2 points each.]
;B[hj];W[bs];B[bm];W[ah]C[RickMott: Mistake by White.  A8 is more valuable because you can't connect and you will eventually have to connect at C7, too.]
