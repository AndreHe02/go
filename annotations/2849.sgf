C[Dear reviewer,

I don't know how you'll take this, but a friend of mine and I sometimes play together as a team so we can study Go better. By putting ourselves in real situations and discussing the best move, we find that our games improve afterwards. This game is one of them.

This opening was truly interesting... the middle game was interesting... I think we held our own easily until the endgame. It was not just interesting... I found it hair-raising.

My most specific request for this game is help regarding endgame. Other help would be appreciated, of course, but our opponent made a surprising invasion in a fairly sizable moyo in the center that destroyed my morale. We should have been able to win easily, but we won with an all-too-close 1.5 moku.

Please help us get stronger!

F: Dear one
Since you asked help regarding the endgame, I'll concentrate on that. Hope you find my comments useful.
Frank];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pq];B[po];W[pk];B[qq];W[qm]C[F: This is giving up the corner, more or less]

(;B[qp];W[nq]C[F: Good];B[pr];W[or];B[pp];W[kq];B[oq]
(;W[np]C[F: Here I would connect];B[nr];W[mr];B[os]C[F: Black invested a lot in this corner, so white can be satisfied with the result]
;W[qg]C[F: Good];B[de];W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec]
(;W[db]C[F: Connecting leaves less aji. See variation];B[fd]
;W[df]C[F: Good];B[cf]C[F: Seems like an overplay]
(;W[cg]C[F: If you play a move like this you must be very sure it works. Did you read out what happens if black extends?
See variations];B[ef];W[dg]C[F: Better capture, leaves less aji.]
;B[fe];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[pg]C[F: Better first extend on the upper side]
;B[kc];W[ld]C[F: Better run out immediately. You don't have place for a base here.]
;B[of];W[kd];B[jd];W[je];B[ic];W[mf];B[og]C[F: Now black can play a splitting attack]
;W[re];B[rc];W[cn];B[fq];W[dk];B[eb];W[id];B[jc];W[oh]
(;B[cp]C[F: Better continue separating white, and not getting surrounded itself in the upper right corner. See variation]
;W[hq];B[nh];W[oi];B[mg];W[lg];B[lc]C[F: First play in the center !]
;W[lh]C[F: Very good];B[ni];W[hf];B[fi]
(;W[di]C[F: I think you could attack this stone, since you're very strong in the center. See variation]
;B[pm];W[ql];B[nn]
(;W[lq]C[F: This is very slow. See variations];B[bf];W[bc];B[em]
C[F: More or less connecting the black stone on F12 up- or downwards. It seems that the middle game comes more or less to an end here.Let's have a look at the situation:

Black:
13 point upper left
6 points upper right corner 
11 points lower right corner
13 points lower left corner
Makes 43 points

White:
left: +/- 30 points
under: 7 points
rignt: 18 points
center: 5points
Makes: 60 points

So white should be able to win this game quite easily.
Let's have a look];W[dl]C[F: OK, necessary and creates possibility to cut black stone in the center]
;B[nb]
(;W[hi]C[F: Blocking black on the upper side is bigger. See variation]
;B[mc];W[hd]MA[bo][gr][rn]C[F: Very big, but there are other points on the board which are even bigger.
The points with a cross are so called "double sente" moves. Meaning, if you play here first, black almost has to answer, but if white plays here first, you almost have to defend..
So in fact, you could play these three points and than come back to H16
E19 is of course also very big and sente];B[hc];W[gk]C[F: Small, since the center is still open on the other side]
;B[eg];W[lk]C[F: Big, but not sente. You should first play the sente moves.]
;B[md];W[me];B[ne]C[F: Blocking white on he upper side earlier on would have prevented this]
;W[le];B[dh];W[ch];B[eh];W[ci]SQ[cf]C[F: You have to come back here because you didn't capture the marked stone in the beginning of the game.]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[iq];W[ir];B[io];W[jp]C[F: Better capture immediately.. This way you give black another free atari]
;B[ho];W[gq]C[F: right , black should have played here first]
;B[fr];W[gp];B[kn];W[bo]C[F: Yes !];B[bp];W[ro]C[F: Yes !];B[il]
;W[jk];B[jo];W[rd];B[qc];W[gd]C[F: Not so big, not really sente]
;B[gl]C[F: Small];W[nf]

;B[jl];W[kl];B[hj];W[ii];B[gj];W[fk];B[hk];W[ap]C[F: Yes, very big.]
;B[aq];W[ao];B[br]
(;W[rp]C[F: Why not jump further ? Black played tenuki here before. You should punish him for that.]
;B[rq];W[gc];B[gb];W[hn]C[F: Overplay];B[fl];W[el];B[gn];W[fn]

;B[ph];W[rg];B[od];W[ne];B[co];W[bm];B[fj];W[ek];B[ok];W[pl]
C[F: The biggest points on the board are now probably T17 and T3. Plays in the centre are smaller, because your opponent can counter each move rather easily. E19 is also big, but not your sente any more]
;B[li]
(;W[lj]C[This is the beginning of the loss of our lead. Should I have just played docily at L11, or was there a way to save my stones even after this move?

F: Black 56 points, white 67, so you lost already some of your lead.  The obvious move is indeed L11. Why take risks if you're leading ?]

;B[ig];W[ih]C[This move should have been at G13, right?

F: Would have been better];B[gg];W[hh]C[F: You lose more than 20 points here, but still managed to win. Not bad]
;B[km];W[lo];B[ko];W[eo];B[ep];W[do]C[I didn't want this move, but my friend clicked before I could tell him I wanted something else. How does the exchange at T17, followed by M7, look?
