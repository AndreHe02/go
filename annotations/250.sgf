Hello Slawek,

my name is Christian Reiling I am a German 1 Kyu and
5k* on IGS (SirSedrik).

I hope my comments will help you.

;W[dj]C[SP : I did not really know what to do at this point. Kakari in
UL, san-san invasion, or tengen? Maybe still something else...
I get confused in situations like this: large loose frameworks...


I think you kakari in the UL is quite ok.

Maybe tengen would be a bit better, because that's "the point,
where both moyos meet" !

An invasion at 3-3 in the LL corner would be too early, IMO.

If you had already played tengen, 3-3 would be good timing.]
;B[fc]C[This move cannot be bad.];W[fe];B[cc]C[Good move.];W[cd]
LB[dc:A]C[Wrong direction, IMHO. Too submissive. Should be at A.]
;B[dc]C[Very good for Black.];W[no];B[jj]LB[jf:F][hd:E][he:D]
[mj:C][pl:B][nm:A]TR[pj][pd][jd][no]C[SP I felt it gave me control and mostly I feared W would play
there as I so no reasonable way to cope with it.

Yes, I think it is a good move, but ...

... now tengen has not that power as in the early stages, because
of the presence of the marked white stone.

1) Consider a sequence of White A, Black B, White C (or something
like that).

There is another weakness in Blacks moyo:

2) After White D, Black has to defend both: at E and at F !

So with 1) and 2) your move at tengen doesn't form a moyo with
your 3 marked starpoint stones.

But although you may think I critisized you move, I did not!
I would probably have made this move, too.

Go back to move #10 and imagine you would have played tengen
there. Do you see the differences?

I think it is a very good move, because:
- I is "the point where both moyos meet"
- It reduces the white moyo
- It aims at 3-3 in the LL corner];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[ld]
;B[cn]LB[dg:C][mg:B][jf:A]TR[nc][nd][ld]SQ[fe][dd][cd]C[SP: Probably not the best idea ....

Yes, I fear I have to agree with you.

You should think in weak groups and in strong groups!

This is one of the most important things in go.

If you learn to think in weak and strong groups, you will improve
at least 2 stones.

I think the white invasion was not really good. You should be
happy about that. White has a weak group there and you should
take advantage of that fact.

If you have the chance to attack, don't hesitate: attack!

White has another weak group in the UL, markes with squares.
Imagine a black move around C there.

Therefore I would suggest to play simply at A. White will probably
defend with B and Black can play C.
Now White has two separated weak groups - very bad for White.

With your move at 23 you did exactly the opposite:
you went into White's sphere of influence, which strengthens
White.

All in all a very big mistake.];W[cl];B[en];W[fp]
(;B[hp]TR[en][cn]C[Overplay!

If you have a weak group, you cannot generate two weak groups
- first settle you group, then you can think about an invasion
somewhere else.

Let's have at look at this situation compared to the situation
before your kakari move #23:

1) You have a large group with no eye.
2) Your stone at tengen is meaningless now.
3) The marked White group is strong now
4) All the left side is White's territory.];B[eg];W[dh];B[ff]
;W[cf];B[ge];W[gj];B[fj];W[mg]C[The chance too attack the white group becomes smaller and smaller.]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[ne];W[me];B[ee]C[SP should have defended the corner and risk problems on the L
side?

Never risk problems - so this move is ok and probably very neccessary.]

;W[qc]TR[ld][lc][nc][nd][me][mf][mg]C[SP: I estimated the score was about even providing I killed UR
corner. Was there a way to do it?

Yes, I think you are right about the score.


I fear there is no way to avoid this white invasion, but ...


... the question is, is this invasion good for White?

If you deny White to connect, it will harm the marked group,
which is still not alive.];B[pc]LB[ob:A]C[Usually at A.];W[qb]

This is a loosing move.

See variation.];W[of];B[oe];W[og];B[ph]C[The game is lost :(.

The question is why? Surely because of last mistake (#175).

I think White was not really stronger than you - you had the
same chance to win.

The last mistake was a pity.

Look once at move #23 and what I said about weak and strong groups.


In your next games try to think in weak and strong groups (more
than in territory).

1) Give territory in order to make you group strong.

2) Give territory in order to make your opponents group weak.

3) Never allow your opponent to make his weak group too easily
strong.

4) Avoid to produce weak groups by your own.

Follow these advices and you will see, you will get MUCH stronger!


Best wishes
