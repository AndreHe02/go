C[To reviewer
I play this game with my friend in igs.
Both of us are 12k and I play White.
The game finish becasue I ran out of time.
My friend and I interest in fight after move 118 due to
fight on left side is very complicated.Both of us have spent long time in this section and we like to know the best way to play]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[eq];W[dd];B[dj];W[qf]C[should I play at  lower-left instead of this move?   aga: I think, this move is ok. At the moment, k4 point is more interesting than LL corner - because it extends either b or w position, but playing it now means to lose initiative.

Also, at the moment it's not clear which point in LL is the best to invade - it should be more clear after several moves around the board.]
;B[nd];W[qi];B[cp]C[aga: I prefer faster development - k4, f17, k17, o4 - I feel it's a bit premature to go for territory so early in the game.]
;W[lc]C[aga: K4 area is more important - it's not only extends b or w position, but also prepares for invasion to opponent's moyo.]
;B[mc];W[qc]C[aga: If w was not going to play wM16 now, then what wM17 is for? It just invites b to gain influence.]

;B[cd]
(;W[de]C[aga: Here, I'd hane at wC15 - with wH17 stone in place that looks ok. Then, either w will get corner, or will have a nose in b's position.]
;B[bf]
(;W[kd];B[le]
(;W[qe]C[aga: becaus of Q15 liberty, w would better play wS18 - that move also insures connection, but takes some territory and hurts b territory in the process.]

(;B[pe]C[aga: This b move is small; to protect possible cut it beeter to play lighter move that would extend b position.]
;W[mq]C[aga: this is too close to w corner - it does not affects b LL enough.]
;B[qq];W[qp]C[aga: now wR11 is a bit too far to block corner invasion at this side, but wN3 is too close to block from other side.]

aga: I think both b and w moves were reasonable in the sequence.]
;B[mj];W[lj];B[li];W[ll];B[mi];W[pl];B[ql];W[pm];B[jp]C[aga: This is big indeed.]

(;W[eo]C[Is this move good?

aga: it was very good - before b got both d10 and k4 - and it would be excellent having w stone at k4. But in this position, I'd first tried wB4, to steal some territory deep inside moyo, and then think how to reduce the rest.]
;B[gp];W[dl];B[lh];W[co]C[aga: This is trong shape indeed.]
;B[dp];W[ch];B[do];W[cj]C[aga: w played good here.];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[fc];B[lb];W[kb];B[mb]C[aga: too small.];W[cn];B[bo]
C[aga: b would better play bB4 here, to keep sente. - w still could ignore bB4, but at least that would be kind gote that would later allow to reduce w territory.]
;W[bn];B[bp];W[lo];B[kq];W[qk];B[qj];W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[nh]
;W[ri];B[pc];W[qb];B[pb]C[aga: this b move should be better delayed - it protects just couple of points, sente could be used much better across the board.]
;W[pa];B[oa];W[qa];B[ka]C[aga: once again, small b move];W[ke]
;B[kf];W[lf];B[mf]C[aga: Why? what's wrong with bL13? That would put pressure on outside. And let that w stone die itself.]
;W[jf];B[kg];W[ja];B[jg];W[if];B[la];W[jb];B[mr];W[ig];B[ih]
;W[ce];B[be];W[hh]C[aga: w does right job increasing own terriotory, while b gains nothing in the process.]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[gh];W[hg];B[gj];W[fi]C[What we interest is the move after this can you give us the best way to play for both black and white

aga: Best? :) I don't think sequence played in the game was bad - and please don't consider my variants as 'better' - just as variants.

Well, at the moment w is about 10 pts ahead, but upcoming b attack is stong indeed; I've placed some variants I would try myself - note that game becomes even - w should seriously think about trying to get some teritory in lower center after resolving left in order to win.]

;W[fp];B[fq];W[dn];B[fo];W[fn];B[ep]MA[hj]C[Last question, can you estimate the score for both side.for black I can count easy but for white is hard to count.

Let's try to count here. It's reasonable to assume that next white move is wH10 - that's quite big.

For b:
UL&L=14
T=19
LL=28
LR=10
prisoners: 2

total for b: 73

For w:
T=25
UR=13
R=20
L=5
Komi: 5

total for w: 68

Game is quite close - w is a bit behind, but also stronger in the center where he can grab some more points. After wH10 it would be b move, but w have potential to build bit of territory in center s w have good chances to catch up playing endgame reasonably.]
