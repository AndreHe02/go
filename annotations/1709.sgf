AB[pd][dp][pp]C["Hello
At first i no good in English
I' m a begginer some tactics is good for me
Your suggestion is very valuable for me"

T:Hi! 

I´ll try to go through this and point out some things that i might notice. I will focus on you as the black player. 

My comments are marked with "T:"];W[dd]C["4-4 huh."];B[qk]TR[fc]
[gc][fd][gd][cf][df][cg][dg]C["i think R9 is good or
 R10 is better?"

T: R9 is fine. At this stage maybe approaching the lone white cornerstone at one of the marked points would have been better, but r9 is absolutly playable. No big difference between R9 and R10 except the obvious one, r9 emphazising the lower right a bit more.]
;W[qf]TR[nc][nd][ph][qh]C["oh no
how can i defend it"

T:In this situation a pincer from the other side (Q12;R12) is probably a good continuation. you can play at r15 but you should be aware that your corner is still open after that. also possible is o16 or o17. See Variations.

Notice, too, that by playing one of r15, o16, o17 you give white the possibility to make a two-space-extension down the right side there, which settles him (not completly but for the time being). Putting pressure on him will become much more difficult then. On the other hand... pincering him might lead to white pincering at o16,o17...]

(;B[qe];W[of];B[nd]C["i think O16 is too small
any suggestion?"

T: o16 is ok, though i would still pressure him from the other side. It is certainly not too small, especially given your handycap lead.]
;W[pi]C["hmmmm"

T: Good move by white... Extending to make his group more or less stable.]
;B[qi]TR[ri][ok][pk][pn][qn]C["how this?
is it bad?"

T:Not necessarily bad. A play to reduce the eye shape of the group.  Be aware that making contact plays (Playing directly adjacent to an opponents stone) tends to make positions stronger (which you dont want in a situation where you have  the upper hand already). So, maybe S11 would have been better for that Purpose. In this case, the white stones seem pretty safe anyway as they can easily escape to the middle.

Also, in Handycap games, it might be better to keep things simple by playing something like Q9,Q6,R6,P9.]
;W[qh];B[pj];W[oi]
(;B[mf]C["I want to kill P14 group with my N14
any suggestion?"

T:You will not be able to kill this group, so your goal in attacking it should be to gain something else. It is not all bad to play at N14, as you may be able to build up influence on the upper side. In this case, however, because of the stone at D16 the lower side looks much more interesting (see variation).

Try to lean against P11 with P10 and you will probably get influence with a formidable connection to q4.]
;W[fq]C["oh again"

T: See the first time it happened for standard answers to this approach. 

In this case I´d again have chosen the pincer, To start building up influence towards your cornerstone again.]

(;B[eq];W[fo];B[jq]C["i think this is good move but.."

T:Good spot there. Be aware that the possibility of an invasion is not necessarily a bad thing. If white invades he will get a weak group which you can attack to profit (only sometimes to kill). If he invades to often in a risky way, eventually he will have too many weak groups on the board and one or more of it will die.]
;W[nq]C["he attack me"

T:Standard attacking move again.... In this case, probably a bit too much for white to handle in an even game. He has one weak group up there already, o3 is almost guaranteed to make another one. OTOH Black LR threatens to get big. 

If I where white i´d have tried a reducing move around N6, threatening to go in either one of blacks gaps there.]
;B[oq];W[lp];B[jo]C["K5
is it good?"

T:Standard move to avoid getting shut in, at the same time putting pressure on both white groups. 
Good.];W[no];B[gq];W[fr];B[gr];W[ep];B[dq];W[do];B[co];W[dj]
;B[cm]C["C7
or C8"

T:I think C8  would be too far to be securely connected.

C7 is ok.];W[dn];B[cn];W[dm];B[gp];W[fp];B[go];W[cl];B[gm];W[el]
TR[oj][pn][qn][lr]SQ[ln]CR[qq]MA[ni]C[T:Good. You pressure the left group and build influence. Now use this influence to attack the right. (Left has escaped).

Moves to attack the right group:

Q6;R6 (You get a lot of  almost secure territory; He has to run for the middle):
 Will probably be very good for you.

O10(Leaning against the whites first will make your attack even stronger):
A bit risky since it leaves Q6 area open, but there is a good chance that he will react since otherwise your attack on the upper white stones will be severe. You would want to follow up with Q6.

M2(Taking away the eyespace): This is a good follow up to Q6, or P10-Q6. It threatens to really kill the whites. I would not play it first however, remember: Goal of Attacking is not to kill, but to gain territory. 

M6(Threatens to shut white in): This move comes to mind, especially as a follow up to p10; i think however, that it would be a big mistake. It is a severe attack on the whites, but all it does gain is a little center influence, while driving white directly into the fertile area around q6. I would only play this after Q6, if white doesnt take the spot]
;B[fm];W[oj];B[ok];W[pl]C["hm
what is he thinking
i don ' t get it"

T:White has recognized the weakness of his own group and is trying to save it.]

(;B[ql];W[pk];B[qj];W[om];B[nk];W[qm];B[rm];W[qn];B[rn]C["I think R10 group is survi."

T:No! a move is still needed to secure two eyes! (I think T9 does the job)]
;W[qp]C["hmm"]
(;B[qq]C[T:I think that cutting off white here would have worked (see prev. variation)]

;W[jd]C[T:Good point for white.];B[lk]C[Very good multipurpose move.]
;W[mc]C["oh
any suggestion?"

T:o17 is correct and safe. Makes the corner finally yours. Dont fear that white will make too much territory there. He is still wide open.]
;B[nc];W[md];B[ne];W[rf];B[re];W[nh];B[ng]C[T:This is a too direct way to attack..]
;W[og];B[lg];W[nf];B[me];W[cc];B[mg];W[jf]
(;B[fd]TR[gc][hc][ic][jc][ch]SQ[ff][gf][hf][fg][gg][hg][fh]
[gh][hh][ih][fi][gi][hi][ii]C["F16 is good
any suggestion?"

F16 is a little risky. Probably better: f17 or one of the triangled spots. Since White´s corner is already secure and strong it is probably better to play away from it, at one of the triangled spots for invasion, or even first prepare an invasion with a play somewhere around the squared area.

In this situation, however, i think it would be better to attack the white stones on the right. neither the upper, nor the lower group are completly settled and you should be able to profit while attacking.

I think it is a must to start the attack with a play at s12 as your own group looks weak too and s12 is part of the eyespace of both groups (see variation for this)]
;W[gg]TR[hc][ic][cf][ff][ci];B[ed]C[T:Now, this and the following moves are probably bad ones (unless you´re a dan and have a clue what your doing :)).

In this situation, where you have invaded white´s sphere of influence it is important to play lightly and to look for eyespace or possibilities to connect.

In this case possible moves would be at the triangle spots in the previous diagram.]
;W[df]TR[hc][ic][he];B[ec]C[T:Again... by playing so tightly you give away to sacrifice a part of the group to live and you dont make any eyespace at all. See the previous dia vor probably better moves. Also: The shape you made here is called an empty triangle. It is considered bad shape, since it has less liberties than other 3-stone-shapes (because two of the stones share one liberty).]
;W[hd];B[hc]C["hmm
i think i am in trouble"

T:you are right.];W[gc]C[oh];B[gd];W[ic]C["escape"

White is too strong around here and you cant sacrifice anything.]

;W[lf];B[gj];W[fk];C["My question is
where is my weakness?"

T: Your weakness is mostly lack of experience.  One of my favorite Go Proverbs is "Lose your first 50 games as fast as possible". As a beginner, the only thing you need to get a big improvement is getting experience by playing a lot of games. You will then automatically see what works and what doesnt etc. 

Of course, it doesnt hurt to do some theoretical learning as well, but you will see that just by playing you will already improve a lot.

"Please teach me some joseki"

T: You will not need joseki for a long time, to improve. I know maybe, 3-4 josekis and i learned them more or less accidentally. :)

"please tell me any bad move in this game"

I tried to do so, though of course, my understanding of the game is still very limited, too, so a better player might have had more and better advice.

"what is empty triangle?"

See the comments. 

"Thank you for review my game"

It was a pleasure and I hope that you benefit a bit from it.]
