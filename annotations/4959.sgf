RE[W+15.50]

C[Dear reviewer, thanks for commenting this game. This game was played @ KGS as a Iwamoto cup round 1 game. I won this game but I was a bit desperate after about 50 moves, which I feel should not happen:). Pls comment anything you find interesting, I wrote several comments to explain what I was thinking.]

White has about 40 points in the board, and no prospects of big improves.
Black has about 35, but can get more points in several places: lower side, center and upper center, and has the initiative now. I Think that black can win with a good yose here. I prefer black position.]
