jlim:  Hi, I will be reviewing this game.  At time of writing, I have been on a hiatus from GO for a couple months, so I would estimate my rank as 12 kyu on KGS.  Please feel free to ask stronger players for a second opinon ^^.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[op];W[dd];B[fc];W[pq];B[cf];W[ce]C[jlim: perhaps better to run by E15 . . in trying to save the corner area, W will have to defend from both sides.  In the meantime, B will be able to develop both sides.  If W wants to keep the corner, simply playing C17 may be a better option.]
;B[cn];W[qo];B[cp];W[gp];B[cj];W[ee];B[od];W[mc];B[qj];W[ql]
LB[id:A][jq:B]SQ[qm][rm][sm][qn][rn][sn]C[jlim:  this move gains a few points at most (squared area) The Q3 & R5 stones are relatively safe, so there is not much priority with R8.  By itself it is a strong and safe move, but other moves probably take priority at this time.  

A few alternate moves to consider are listed as follows:

A:  makes a light extension from N17 - can later be used to support this stone.  As a general guideline, weak stones should be helped first.  If N17 should be cut off, it can be sacrificed, and A can be used to attack the F17 stone.  

B:  makes an extension from the G4 & D4 stones, but more importantly, starts to solidify the lower right group.  It also prepares for a later attack on the P4 stone.  For comparison, picture a black stone at J3 - with the G4 & D4 stones starting to get closed in from the left, this white group may start to feel limited.]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[id];W[kd];B[ie];W[kc];B[dc];W[cc];B[df];W[ec]
;B[eb];W[db];B[fb]C[jlim:  I personally don't like the move at O15- it only lets Black build up on the right side while chasing White.]

(;W[ne];B[of];W[ic];B[jb];W[kb];B[ib];W[fd];B[gd];W[mq]C[jlim: ok move, although I would have preferred to extend from G4.]
;B[nf];W[me]LB[ob:B][kf:A]TR[ne]C[jlim:  By extending here, I assume W wants to try and save the marked stone.  However, I don't see what value this stone has - it holds little if any territory, and doesn't really threaten any Black stones.

If you were thinking of running into the center, I would suggest A.  If you wish to form a base, I would suggest B.  

Extending to N15 allows B to seal the group in while expanding influence on the right side.  Imagine if B played at P9 now.]
;B[mf];W[lf];B[oj];W[jp]C[jlim:  Good, although possibly stretched a bit thin, W has a great framework on the bottom side.]
;B[mj];W[oo]TR[mj][oj][qj]C[jlim: not a great move but not a bad move either.  I suppose with the three black stones on the right side, White may feel leaving the P4 stone would be a bit of a risk.]
;B[do];W[ep];B[eo];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[gm];B[gl];W[lh]
LB[kg:B][jm:A][cq:C]C[jlim:  Not a bad move, but I was surprised to see this.  Did you consider A, B, or C?]

(;B[fe];W[ed];B[hl];W[ef];B[eg];W[ff];B[ge];W[gf]C[jlim:  Poking out at G13 might be slightly better.]
;B[hf];W[hg];B[ig];W[gh]C[jlim:  Great shape, and White has managed to be able to poke his head inside Black's framework.  White can now run around in there later, hoping to reduce Black's territory.]
;B[hh];W[gg];B[hi];W[nl]C[jlim:  Nice, you created an opening into Black's territory on the left, and now you look to expand your own.]
;B[ll];W[lm];B[km]C[I think that I should have taken the J5 group while I had the chance, but some of the following paths are not very good for me.  Please comment on the proper way to fight this type of invasion.  I think what my opponent did here was pretty slick, but I made too many mistakes.  I don't think this should have been successful.]
;W[kn];B[ln];W[mm];B[jn];W[ko];B[ml]
(;W[mn]C[jlim:  a move at O7 instead of N6 might be better, but this is ok.]
;B[nm];W[ol];B[jo];W[jm];B[kl];W[lo]C[jlim:  doing well in the fight, I don't see any mistakes so far.  Perhaps L4 instead of M5 might be better, but this is ok.]
;B[im]
(;W[in]C[jlim: W was doing well until this move here.  Compare a white stone at J5 (one space below) instead, and all problems are solved.]
;B[io];W[hn]CR[ip]TR[in]C[jlim:  At this point, probably better to extend to J4 (circle), sacrificing the marked stone.  The stone is only worth a point, and being able to seal off Black and create territory on the bottom side is worth the peace of mind IMHO.]
;B[ip];W[iq]C[jlim:  Now there are a few cutting points in your wall.]
;B[jq];W[kp];B[hq];W[ir];B[gq];W[hp]C[jlim:  good move to cut, Black should have kept his group connected.  see variation for followup moves if Black does not capture.]

(;B[fq]C[I think that I should have taken the J5 group while I had the chance, but some of the following paths are not very good for me.

jlim:  yes keeping your groups safe when they are in danger is definitely a crucial move.  However, note that at this point, even if you did capture the J5 group, Black could have cut with F4, and you would still lose the bottom left corner.]

(;W[fp];B[jr]
(;W[eq];B[jl];W[ho];B[jm];W[hr];B[le];W[ld];B[lg]C[jlim:  instead of capturing immediately, how about playing at L14 instead?]

jlim:  looking ahead in the game, you still had the situation under control, it was simply an errant move or two that cost you.]

;W[pp];B[nq]TR[mq]C[jlim: probably better to extend with M3 and save that lonely white stone.  White was doing well in this fight, just forgot to save a weak stone, giving Black a chance.]

(;W[np]C[Jaydee [21k\]: want more time?];B[ms];W[qq]TR[qp]C[jlim: minor note - better to capture the marked stone in a ladder using S4 - capturing the stone this way could lead to more moves and more problems in the future.]

;W[mh];B[kj]C[jlim:  sacrificing a stone (one point) to build a strong wall is generally a good trade.]
;W[ok]TR[cq]C[jlim:  this move is worth perhaps a point or two.  C3 is much bigger - compare a Black stone at C3.]

I did not comment on any moves past this point, but did not edit them out in case anyone wanted to look at the future moves.  

My advice to White would be to slow down just a bit to think it through when in a middle of a fight - you seem to understand the fundamental concepts, but making a crucial mistake can change the entire game.  Great game, I enjoyed making this review.]

Cheap play, I know, but I think they were trying to challenge themselves in some way with this, so I played along.]

;AB[nm]AE[nn]C[jlim:  going back to the previous move, we assume Black is a good player and will occupy the critical point.  We then visualize what might happen next.  

Note that White should feel comfortable in dealing with Black if Black plays anywhere else in the lower right hand corner, simply by playing at the critical point himself!]
;B[nn]C[jlim:  Now it is easy to see that White's groups are divided.  White should try and capture stones to stay alive, and help the weaker group.  Take a moment to decide which group to help before moving on.]
;W[qm]LB[rm:A][qp:B]C[jlim:  Suppose White tries to save the right group.  White could capture this stone and the right group would be safe.  A & B are miai; White can capture either of them.

Let's see in the next move if this will leave White's left group in danger.]

This move saves perhaps one point.  Even if Black takes this stone, White is in no danger.  Thus, Black's move can be ignored, and White is better off playing somewhere else, perhaps at the marked locations for ideas.  

I would personally play C, as it helps out a weak group - picture a Black stone at C instead.  Verify that White would almost certainly lose the entire bottom left corner!]
