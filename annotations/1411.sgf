;B[dp];W[qc];B[pq];W[cc];B[qo];W[jq]C[I've
only found 3 profesional games out of 3 thousand with this position, the
are games 3, 5 and 7 of the 1978 Honinbo title between Kato Masao and Ishida
Yoshio. In the 3 games Ishida had black and played from the other side of
the white stone.
He won the first 2 games, but despite this Kato kept
with the 2 3-3 fuseki and invasion and managed to win the last one and the
title.

I'll give the followup just for reference.]
(;B[gq];W[mq];B[cq]LB[df:A]TR[cq]C[Playing some approach move like A seems better than playing at the 3-3 point now.]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[pg];B[jc];W[lc];B[gc];W[od];B[kb]LB[cf:A][dd:B]
C[This is a yose move, big, but as it does not affect the life status of any group is too early to play it now. 
I think that A or B are the right ones. In any case anything on the left side would have been bigger.]
;W[eb]LB[df:A][cf:B]C[Again I think A or, more probably, B, are in the  good direction.]
;B[lb];W[nb]LB[mc:A]C[I think A is too important ot let it to black.]
;B[mc];W[ld]C[Those 2 white stones can end beeing a problem for white.]

must extend all the way to A, the corner is strong enough to support any
fight white can try to make here.];W[ci];B[cm]LB[ek:A]C[Again, black is too submissive, A looks like a better point.]
;W[nf];B[fb]LB[qh:A][cg:B]C[Another
2nd line move too early. Black is already alive at the top. Attaking the
2 stones in lower side or trying to exploit the weaknesses at A and B are
more positive approaches.
I think that black has already lost the advantage of having first move.]

[om][qm][qn][pn]C[Witht the last 6 moves the difference still increases.
Roughly, white gained 12 points while black gained 7.
And white keeps sente.];W[ee];B[rk]C[This is big, but only yose, black must try to recover attacking the 2 white stones.]
;W[or];B[pr];W[gr];B[fr];W[hr];B[gp];W[em]LB[fk:A]C[Too close to black thicknes. A counter attack is possible at A.]

LB[hl:A][rj:B]C[White is forcing black to attack his own stones.

[rj:B]C[Too small, again A and B are the biggest points.];B[ri]
;W[rh]LB[rg:A][qh:B]C[Bad move.
A or B, depending a bit on the surrounding, are usually a better way to stop the invasion.]
;B[qi];W[qh];B[pi];W[pj]C[Risky. To save this stone white is giving away too much in the center.]

(;B[rj]LB[mf:A][qg:B][gk:C][lp:D][kh:E]TR[ig][kf]C[ok realise i didn't need to connect, wld m12 have been better?
Sure. 
But
I would have go to L12, trying to create a big mess in the center so that
either those white stones or the 2 in the left are captured in a big scale.
White
has some bad aji because of A and B. C almost captures the 2 stones on the
left, and black has the kikashi at D that threatens to cut. 
E, that also occupies a key point of the 2 marked stones, could launch a sever attack with almost no risk.

See variation for a possible followup.];W[mo];B[oq];W[nr];B[mm]

C[Too slow, A or B are better.];W[gl]
(;B[in]C[Too slow again, see variation.];W[bj]C[There's too much hanging in the center for this move to be sente.]

(;B[bk]C[The center !!!];W[fs]C[Same as before !];B[er];W[en]
C[White is adding a stone to a capturable group !];B[eo]LB[sh:A]
[ob:B][ec:C]C[First attack, if the the white stones manage to scape you'll have time to defend.
But any of the marked points is bigger than here.];W[dm]C[Same.]
;B[cn];W[gm]
(;B[hn]C[There  was no cut here, see variation for another attack.]
;W[ik]C[Finally white scapes.];B[jl];W[jk]LB[ob:A][sh:B][gj:C]
[ec:D]C[Now small yose begins. A is worth about 6 points in gote.
It's a good mesure to compare the value of other moves.
B is about 5 points in sente, is considered equivalent to 10 in gote.
So first B, then A seems better now.
Maybe first is possible to throw in some sente moves like C and D.]

(;B[jn]C[How many points does this stone make/destroy ?];W[mg]

(;B[mj]C[But this is a mistake, see variation.];W[mi];B[mk]
;W[ni];B[nl]LB[lk:A]C[Too submisive, at least A looks like sente.]
;W[pl];B[pm];W[qk];B[qm];W[ps];B[qs];W[os];B[qr];W[gg]C[guess here should have tried g10 or higher?

G10 seems ok. See variation.]

;B[ei];W[eh];B[gj];W[hj]C[Dangerous move by white.]

(;B[cj];W[bi];B[md]LB[sh:A][nq:B][ob:C][hl:D]C[Definitely
bad. First A (5 sente points) then B ( at least 1 more sente points, then
C ( 6 gote points ) for a normal yose of 12 points in gote.

Of course there is D, worth about 20 points in gote.];W[me]

;W[rg]C[... and a (reverse) sente 5 points move, while black only got a 6 points gote move and some 1 points sente moves.

Now the game is very close. White a bit ahead if he plays the big sente moves left for him.]
;B[nd];W[ne];B[oo]LB[no:A]C[Again submisive, there's no reason not to play A.]
;W[np];B[nn];W[nk];B[ml];W[ln];B[gh];W[hh];B[hm];W[hl];B[fk]
;W[fl];B[fh];W[eg];B[hf]LB[ak:A][es:B][fn:C][fa:D][sh:E][ol:F]
C[Small. It takes away 1 point and maybe will be worth another one, so 1.5 in gote.
A is worth 3 points in sente.
B is worth 2.5 points in sente (because of the ko left).
C is 2 sente points.
F is about 3 points in gote but threatens 2 more in gote again if black plays there, so almost sente at this stage.
E is worth 3 in gote.
D = 2 points in gote.

finally 1 point in sente is considered like 2 in gote, but they are usually played before if possible.

So
normally now white must get A, B, C and F, black gets E and white D. In the
game E and F get reversed, but are about the same value as after black gets
F in sente is worth 3 points and there's almost nothing left.]
