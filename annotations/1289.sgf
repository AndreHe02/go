AB[pd][dp]C[2 stone handicap game, turned out close, but I had problems developing my begining strength out to the middle.
I have some ideas why, but need other input.

Hi, there were some interesting problems in this game. I hope my comments will give you some ideas to think about. Please note that these suggestions are my own humble opinion and may be wrong. Feel free to email me if something is not clear.

Bye, Joerg];W[dd];B[pp];W[nc];B[qf]C[---
This is a usual joseki move, but with the advantage of the handicap stones it is a good idea to put more pressure on White by playing one line to the left (Q14).]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[jd]C[---
Should be at L17. Now this leaves a weakness to exploit later on.]
;B[ld]C[too early for this reduction, lots of big points still on the board.    C14 the 6-3 or iron pillar on either of the lower corners, C10/D10, K4/3

I would probably choose C14 instead next time

I think this was my biggest mistake.


---
I agree. This is indeed too early.
Just leave the weak spot alone until you see how the board develops.   Instead expand your positions. Even if White defends immediately by playing another move at the top it would give you yet another move to expand your moyo.

Attacking this soon may lead to postitions which do not fit to the board later on.   C14 would make good use of your corner stone.

Just making a corner enclosure would be too passive.

K4 is another good idea to expand the moyo. I don't like K3 because it can easily be capped.

But the focus should be on the left side where both players want to play now. So C14 is a good idea or C10/D10.

By the way: This move will only strengthen White and will give you not a lot in return. Except for some special cases the invasion point is at M17. Lay out some sequences on your board or read the chapter about this invasion in "Attack and Defense"(Ishida/Davies).]
;W[lc];B[lf]C[same bigger points elsewhere, not sure about this

---
The M16/M17 excchange was not good for Black, but still it was sente.   Hm, I think you just should play on the left side and leave the position here as it stands.

If you want to play here you should fight by playing a hane for example at L17. But the position is in favour of White. It would be better if D16 was Black and R14 played higher.

If you want to attack play R14 at R15. R14 in itself is very defensiv.]
;W[cn]C[---
Now White can take the initiative.];B[co]C[---
This move is a big mistake. It forces White into good shape. Only play this move when a black stone is around D10. If this would be the case White would come out overconcentrated.

In my opinion playing a pincer around D10 would now be a good way to establish a position at the left. Or play F14 to make it a moyo game and put M14 to some use.]
;W[dn];B[gq]C[---
This is too far. With the strong white group here it should be at G3. Anyway the 3-3 point is still open for invasion.]
;W[cj]C[---
perfect];B[pq]C[---
I think this is too passive. Don't be afraid of an invasion in the corner. An invasion can almost always be sourrounded which would help your other positions. You see this later when you invade at C17. ;-)

Rather prepare for this invasion and expand the moyo with a move like O4. Your moyo would be bigger than White's.]
;W[jq];B[lq]C[---
I think this is a good answer. Makes a nice extension from the two stones.]
;W[jo];B[lo]C[---
Hm, I think playing at G5 would be better. G5 would put pressure on White as well, defend the extension of D4/G3 and make a good base to jump into White's moyo.

Don't be afraid of a White move at O3. You have the advantage here.

Also this move does not secure as much territory in the corner as you may think. The right side is still open for invasion.]
;W[fp];B[fq]C[---
White wants that.   A difficult situation. The corner is not really save and White exploits nicely the weak extension.   Just trying to fight the way out with G4 may harm the corner.

That move seems to be the only one in this situation. But keep in mind to reduce the resulting white strength as soon as possible.]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[hn];B[km]C[---
I don't like this move. It is not a real threat and is not really suitable for expnading/reducing the moyos in this case.

But the general idea of reducing is ok. I think you are better off with territory so far so a light reduction move (by guess) should be enough. For example a move around D11, D12 or E11. See what you can get and maybe you could invade at the top, too.]
;W[ne]
(;B[nf]C[---
Try a hane at L17 first.

Usually you cannot stop White by attaching.];W[me];B[mf];W[le]
C[I think R10/9 would have been a better play here


---
This move is indeed a little bit slow.];B[oe];W[qn]
(;B[pn]C[---
Attaching will make White strong.
Try a pincer at C9 and use the backup strength of your wall.

Or, in this case. attach at R5 and pincer after White's next move.

White will have a hard time to live.

First of all try to prevent the invader from making a base.]
;W[ql];B[qo];W[pm];B[rn];W[qm]C[---
Ugly, heavy shape.];B[rm]C[this move is bad I think.  I would much rather cap at P7 or press in at R10 next time

---
Yup.];W[rl];B[on]C[---
Still R10 or R11 is the best move.];W[qh]
(;B[pg]C[---
Much too timid. White has an eyeless cluster and Black is very strong at both sides. Just try to invade at R10.]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[oi];B[ph];W[pi]C[---
That was not a good sequence for you at all. You helped White a lot. ;-)]
;B[qi]C[not sure about this, it just seemed that there was nothing to loose by the throw in, and it might come in usefull later

---
Unless you find a good tesuji (S11 later?), White is alive. You should leave him alone for the time and play the bigger points as long as you still can. That is: reducing the white moyo.]
;W[ri];B[qj];W[rj];B[pk]C[this was a bad move, forced the cap at P9

P7, P9 or O8/9 would have been better I think.];W[ok];B[om]
;W[qk];B[ol];W[pj];B[nk]C[right idea I think, should have just played here to start

---
Small move and not a real threat. What if White ignores and fortifies his moyo.   Don't get too excited about local fights. There is not much to get for either side here. In fact you are fighting over one or two points.

Don't forget the rest of the board.]
(;W[mi]C[---
pointless as well. There are much bigger moves left.];B[lj]
;W[gd]C[now black should take the last chance to reduce at D12/13, espcially with strength coming to the center

---
Yup. The very last chance.];B[cc]C[instead the 3-3 invasion

this does not use my developing power in the center effectively, although I was actually thinking about that when I made the decision.  I'll try not to make that mistake again.

---
Yes this is what White wants. If you have a good moo you usually just wait for this move. That's why Q3 earlier was not the best move you could play.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]
;W[cf];B[bn]C[I mistakenly thought I would keep sente after this sequence.. this probably lost the game.   I think a play at H10 would have been more interesting and productive, or J8

---
I agree. You should first reduce the center.

Still this is a big endgame point and should keep sente! R18 would be another one.]
;W[bm];B[bo];W[hj]C[this seemed like an over extension to me, but I couldn't figure out how to overcome it]

---  Hm, yes, there is not much to do about the center after H10/H13.

Play the big endgame moves instead. B8, R18,...];B[hk]C[pointless, I think L9 would have been better, or at least first]
