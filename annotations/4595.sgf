C[My name is Sean and I'll be the reviewer for this game.  Sorry for the delay, work sucks is all I can say.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp]
(;B[ic]C[This is an overly ambitious and over extended move that gives up the initiative when you don't have to, and leaves your stones issolated.  In the opening try to make moves that challenge your opponents territory but without being to aggressive.  Too close and they will cut you off, too far and you surrender territory that you don't need to.  Whites next move is a typical opening move.]
;W[qf]LB[mc:2][md:3][of:1][pf:A][pg:B][qg:C]C[As I mentioned this is a standard opening move, I've marked several others in the same area with letters, they can be approached on either side depending on the situation.  This move is close enough to threaten your position in the corner but not close enough to be easily captured by you.  The numbered positions mark typical responses to this.   1 demands a response in that it could cut off the white stone.  2 and 3 are more passive but influence more territory given the stone you have already placed there.]

(;B[nc]LB[mc:1][md:2]C[A good response to a typical opening though one more move over would be a little stronger.  You would still be close enough to prevent a cut between it and the corner stone but would be influencing more territory.]
;W[pj]
(;B[dj]C[This move is also over extending, and you could be cut off easily.  It would be better to approach closer to white in the corner and then back over towards your corner so that you have a stable base on either side and are more difficult to kill.  See the variations for an example.]
;W[cm];B[nq];W[pn]
(;B[fq]LB[kp:4][lp:3][gq:1][hq:2]C[I understand this was a big overplay. Suggestions for better moves are very welcome.      ~~~     You're right that it's an overplay but you did have to make a move down here to prevent white getting too much influence.  I think i would have played a stone or two to the right and tried to defend it as shown in the varient.  But a safer option would be 3 or 4 it would allo you to create a strong position but at the cost of allowing white's extention from the left corner.  If you feel you could beat your opponent in a close battle then go for the larger jump and the reduction but if going against a stronger player then stay safe.]
;W[dq]
(;B[hp]LB[ip:1]C[One more over would still be safe but allow for less room to cut.]
;W[lq];B[jq];W[jp]
(;B[kq]C[This is a rough situation to be in, and in a situation like this it sometimes pays off to be more aggressive.  This can sometimes make the difference between a large loss and a close win.  But against a stronger opponent this move would be better in that it gives your group on the lower left more room to live.]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[mp]
(;B[lo]C[In this situation I would have played at N3 instead of extending see the variants for why.]

(;B[jn]C[Perhaps this move should try to rescue the weak group at P6 instead?  ~~  Yes, this is a bit defensive.  The two white stones are a threat but not worth as many points as the group on the right which when it escapes makes for a huge reduction to white.  However if you were to abandon that broup at the right at this point you could gain a large amount of influence, that may be worth more than the stones themselves.   Later on when that group has extended to a large dragon that is obviously not the case.]

;W[ed];B[dc];W[de];B[ce];W[ec];B[df];W[ef];B[dg]C[This was a good defense of the corner and has the added bonus of connecting the corner group to your stone on the side that could have otherwise been easily lost.]
;W[db];B[cb];W[eb]
(;B[qd]LB[rd:A][of:1]C[Two things on this move, first, try not to connect like this unless absolutely neccecary, "A" would be much better.   Also given your strong position on the top I would have played at  "1" instead this would threaten to cut the white stone.  You may lose a bit of territory in the corner but you would gain a huge influence along the top edge.]
;W[ie];B[kd];W[kf];B[me];W[of];B[mg];W[mi];B[lk]C[The next 30 or so moves were well played, you managed to keep that dragon stretching from the bottom right corner alive and also reduce whites territory on the side significantly.]

;W[tt];B[tt]C[To improve your game there are two things that i feel you need to focus on, and it many cases they are interelated.  The first is one that i think you already realize, you need to avoid overextending.   You spent a lot of effort throughout this game simply trying to recover from one over extended move.  In a situation like this it may be easier to cut your losses and build up around that stone instead.  In this case that was not a particularly viable option as white had such strong groups on either side of that one major overextention on the bottom, but you'll have to take that on a case by case basis.   The second is much more difficult and it's one that you will need to think carefully about on each and every game and that is to try and keep the initiative.  Before you make any move try to think about what viable moves your opponent will have to it.  If you do it right you will know your opponents move before they make it and design your's not to kill them, but to allow him to live by falling back and solidifying while you you expand.  If you focus on these to things i'm sure you'll improve rapidly.  Your endgame is fairly strong, so if you can start from a better position you'll be able to make better use of the area that you are already strong at.]
