C[In this game I play Black and fall far behind in the opening stages so I would appreciate any comments on fuseki.  White made some aggresive moves and I did no know how to punish them or hold my ground.

Review by JR KGS 4kyu

Black did not fall that far behind.  I suggest a bit of thought understanding which joseki achieve which outcoves will help.

Also you seem unwilling to invade at thee 3-3 point. Its a good move in the right place.

Finally I think you need to think more about connection, which moves are big and what you are attacking.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo];W[kq]C[White extends one point further than the star point so my problem is this:  N3 is small and the two other variations seem unfavorable for Black]

(;B[ce]C[JR: This is perfectly good. Approach the corners, then approach 4-4 points them extend from corners.]
;W[ci]
(;B[ee]C[JR: I don't think the game gives black as good a position as the alternative joseki.]
;W[fd];B[bc];W[id];B[bg];W[nc]C[JR: Do you see that Black appears quite cramped and small in the top left? Four stones has not generated much territory or any influence.

On the other hand white 's position looks quite spread out, although it is still subject to invasion.

And when white follows through this move white will make the top look quite solid.]
;B[pf]C[JR: I would prefer to play on the thrid rank. Playing high implies the desire to invade on the top. When white safely draws back this stone feels a bit high and the right side a bit vulnerable.]

(;W[lc];B[ck]C[I wanted to approach the D4 stone but a knights's approach left good pincers open for white.  I expected the variation in response to this.]

(;W[dg]C[JR If I had been white I think i would not have responded. The idea of cramping and attacking the top stones while also stopping black taking the side seems important.]
;B[cn];W[fp]
(;B[mq]C[JR: This move invites white to respond by strengthening the bottom, which he wanted to do anyway,  a thank you move.

I think the alternatives are better.];W[ip];B[pj]C[JR High is for influence, low is for territory.

Here white has strong groups. There is nothing to use influnce to attack/invade so I would play low.

This stone is nicely in the middle of the right side. But this makes it a bit thin, too far from both top and bottom corners so white has room to invade above and below. closer to one of the groups would have been more solid for territory on the side.]

I think white should consider that C11 has done its work for the moment. Black is cramped in the top. White should play big moves and be happy if Black wastes moves to capture C11]

Either way it seems good not to play Q18 and leave the option of R17 for later. Black is not solid on the right and it is worth keeping the options open.]

 White has left a 2 space jump towards the black corner in case black invades behind this stone.

This would be fine except the result will be quite close under the shadow of the black corner and subject to attack.]

Black can easily run into the middle and white is not that safe]

Black may yet get the chance to play N3 but equally that is not the biggest for black at the moment.]
