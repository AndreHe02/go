C[This is a game against stronger opponent. I'm white. I resigned after 89 moves
because black was is huge lead.

It seems white's most important mistakes are:  1) letting black seal him in (right side).  First try to run with your groups
2) build a too loose structure in the presence of enemy thickness]

I do not think the move is very bad but  1) see alternative in variation
2) the followup can improve.];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd]

I don't know what to do now.  Playing Q13 as in the game is terrible.
Perhaps you can consider
1) tenuki ?
2) a lighter variation?
