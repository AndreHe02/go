RE[B+8.50]
RU[Japanese]

C[Hello, I played black in this game, and I am not satisfied with my playing. Wether I won or lost is of no importance (I won, but considering 1 reading mistakes each side, the result is not significant)

The main reason is my opponent played some agressive moves, and I'm weak at using close fight to orientate the game.

In other words : go being an exchange game, when my opponent agressively gets something, there should be a compensation, and I'm not very good at getting those compensations.

g4: Hi. I am only a 1 kyu on KGS. So don't take my words too seriously. But maybe some of my hints are useful for you. First of all some of the invasion of your opponent were normal concerning the weakness of your stones. So you must not expect to get something in return. He just has used your weakness. Be sure you have made some profit with another move instead of covering your weakness.


This concerns particularly moves by White #14, 50,56 and 64

The general aspects i would like to be commented are then

1) Advices as to answers to these moves

2) Yose

3) some random questions which are to be found within the game.





Thanks for your diligence.


g4: I hope my comments throughout the game are a little helpful for you. In general this was a reasonable game, and I enjoyed to go through it.

(;B[bc]C[g4: I would prefer D16 (A). Letting white live on a small scale, being shut in cannot be bad.]
;W[dd];B[ce];W[cb]
(;B[jc]C[This is not joseki, but I thought it was bigger than the joseki move at D13.
g4: It is ok not to finish the joseki. Perhaps a move at G15 is interesting. It puts more pressure on white, and an early invasion should be welcome by black. But this seems a matter of taste.]
;W[hc]C[how to deal with this ?
g4: This is a bad move. Attachment moves are played to settle ones group quickly. They make the opponent stronger. My first impulse is G16. But your move cannot be bad.]
;B[hd]C[J16 a better idea ?
g4: J16 would white let have the move at G16 or H16. This is fine.]
;W[ic];B[id]C[g4: Of course. But you can also consider G16, which doesn't allow the connection. White has then 2 weak groups.]
;W[gb];B[gd];W[jb]C[g4: This is an overplay. F18 is severe now!]

(;B[kb];W[ib];B[kc]C[I evaluate this exchange as better for B, though I have not had sente.
g4: I agree.];W[pg]C[how to treat this this one ?
g4: Don't play to close to strength. This seems to close for me. So I would pincer. :-)]
;B[pj]C[I thought using the top strenght
g4: Great!];W[rg]C[I would have played toward centre ...
g4: Me too.];B[qn];W[qj]
(;B[qk]C[g4: I would be tempted to play on the other side.]
;W[qi]
(;B[cn]MA[nk][rk]C[I thought the right group would be on its own.
I realised when playing R9 that this group would be somewhat concentrated, and did not want to add more stones.

Is it a error in the appreciation ?
Move I did consider are marked

g4: This seems the first mistake. It is right, that the group can look after itself. But remind yourself how the situation came up. First white approached your strength. Then you attacked white with a pincer. And then white tried to make eye shape. So remember YOU are attacking. and you should keep white's group eyeless. If white's group is secure your upper strength is greatly reduced. You can only use it to make territory :-(
Therefore S9 seems best to me.];W[pk];B[pl];W[ok]

C[g4: I would like to close the gap at N5 instead.];W[on];B[om]
C[I don't know if I should have tried to use the P5 stones, since they impair White shape.

On the other hand, I preferred to have the possibility to run to the centre.

Any opinion ?

g4: Now it seems too late to do so. As I said, I would like to close the gap. But this does not work now.]
;W[nn]
(;B[nm];W[mo]C[g4: This hurts. White's weak group is now secure. And black got nearly nothing.]
;B[fq];W[hq]C[how about this one ?
g4: Because of the weakness of M3 you cannot expect too much. But you can decide now to take the corner or to take the bottom.]
;B[jq]C[g4: Ok, taking the corner];W[lo];B[kp];W[eq]
(;B[gp]C[this is bad : I think F5 is better.
g4: F4 is better. F5 leaves the same weakness at F2 and white can connect both white groups.]
;W[fr];B[dj];W[cj]C[this is very unorthodox.

Waht should I do with this ?];B[ci]C[I though I would save the upper part territorry.]

;B[el]C[g4: Good!];W[dk]
(;B[ek]LB[ek:A][bl:B]C[I explored B8, but it does not work.
g4: Maybe it works. But this move cannot be bad. If you close th e gaps at F5 and E15 this is a promising game.]

;W[dq]
(;B[fh]C[this may not be the better direction.
Can you elaborate on this to show me what would be the appropriate move, and why ?
(assuming there is no urgent move somewhere)
g4: This move keeps your (coming) moyo intact on the upper side. You can always consider a similar move on the right side of the moyo. A move like L7 may be the right one. If you look on the walls black and white have, this is the point between the borders of 2 moyos (or walls of influence). 
But at first white ignored your first move F5. I would like to punish him therefore before doing anything else.]
;W[oe];B[nd];W[mm];B[nl];W[jn]C[g4: Now white got to play there first.]

(;W[mi]C[g4: Black is lucky. N4 would have killed];B[ri];W[ni]
;B[rh];W[mj];B[rj];W[jj]C[now I counted :

W
10 top
5 to 10 bottom right
15 bottom left
3 left
10 or so in the centre


B
10 left
10 bottom
30 right

there is no significant move on the sides, apart, B18, S4, Q2
so the centre must be bigger

g4: It's not time for endgame. There are some undecided situations on the board. 
1) The beforementioned Ko on the lower side. 
2) The weakness at N18. If white gets to play there first, the black group left of this is eyeless.
3) The black bottom group is not alive yet. 
But beside this. You counted roughly a small win for whiten regarding komi. So the best you can do is playing the double sente moves, esp. against the corners.]
