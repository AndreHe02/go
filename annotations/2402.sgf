C[Dear Reviewer:
 I guess I was better at the begining, but somehow a ended loosing the game. I have problem in the mid-end game. I greatly appreciate your comments. Thank you in advance, Juan


Juan,

Caveat: I only have the limited knowledge of an AGA 2d, so some of my comments may be completely wrong. However, I hope this review will give you some ideas to think about.

Actually, upon quick review of your game, I feel that white's opening lagged behind black's. Letting black settle on the upper sealed the deal. I'm going to go through more carefully now, and I'll see what I think this time through. My comments will be marked "W:", and I'll try to point out variations. I won't make much comment on the endgame, although the gut feeling is that there were many mistakes on both sides, but I am not good enough to say where would be better.

After a second go-through, it felt that white was never in control of the game. At move 34, initiative was almost completely lost, and black cruised for most of the rest of the game. I'd say that white was less efficient in the opening, and then failed to create chances to fight and complicate in the middle game. I think that counting will help, then you will know if you are behind, where the most points can be made, and whether or not it's necessary to complicate. It's important even in the opening! 

The good stuff: White never makes an overplay. Maybe too solid, though. There are few real holes in white's shape, although there is perhaps some overlooked  minor aji. Put that thickness to use attacking! Otherwise it is better to play thin and try to get territory.

Your mid-endgame does not seem to be particularly bad. In fact, you got more points in the center than I thought you would. I think that focusing a little more on the opening and early mid-game for the direction of play will improve your game the most.

My suggestion is to try and play on a larger scale to make use of your thickness. However, I do understand that my throwing general advice isn't too useful, so I hope that some of the variations I give can spark some new ideas about your direction of play in the beginning.

I apologize if I am confusing or incoherent. I will be more than happy to answer any more questions you have.

(;W[dn]C[W: This lets black set up a moyo. Maybe you want to pincer instead?]
;B[jp]
(;W[qp]C[J: I do not know whether this is the place to enter?

W: Here, you invite black to press, so there is probably a better strategy. I can't say for sure, there must be many possible variations, I will put down a few and see if you get any good ideas.

If you can't think of any good places to exploit shape, you should probably stay away from the thickest part of the board. Maybe a wedge, or approach upper corner, and decide later how to reduce bottomr.]

(;W[qf]C[W: this is the wrong direction. The right side is already uninteresting becuase your right side stones are so low. How many more points can you gain there? try o17 intstead.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe]
(;W[qg]C[W: Is this the correct connection? This is worth a lot of points, but the right side is pretty uninteresting otherwise. I think it's better to play high to try and cooperate with your star point. You still have big followups at F7 and around P9 at the boundary of two moyos]
;B[fc];W[nd]C[Here, I think that you are worrying about black's potentially huge corner. Unfortunately, black already has a stone in place (at f17) to negate your influence.]

(;W[gd]C[This is too small. White needs to develop on a grand scale, considering the  thickness at top right. E13 or D13 is probably more appropriate.]
;B[dr]C[J: Should I answer this?

W: I think that you need to play to enlarge your own moyo. Maybe F12? That makes it difficult for black to do anything inside.]

(;W[cq];B[jd]C[J: and this?

W: Yes, see next
This is sort of the beginning of the middle game. However, the middle game is very mild and short, so I can't say a whole lot about your fighting or attacking skills.

Time to count! Most importantly, where is the greatest potential? the top is the current hot spot, so play there!]

(;W[cj]C[W: This is strange. If you play on the left side, the move is c12, threatening the peep. But this is a big point before an urgent point. I think that G17 is good, and then you can attack k16 as best you can.

The result in the game is too easy for black. He reduces your moyo without any effort.]

;W[sp];B[cr];W[jn]C[J: Is ok now?

W: If you're asking that question, that means you have to look at the territorial balance. For B, 16 in upper right, 8 in upper left, 4-6 on top, 40 points on bottom for a total of about 70. For white, 15 points on left maybe, 10 points on top, 30 on right side for a total of 55. So in fact, this is too mild, you cannot win if you play this move. However, black has more territory, has more thickness, and more influence. So now is this time to fight like crazy!]
