C[Llywelyn:

In this game it appears that white was ahead for most of it, but slowly seemed to lose confidence until it all collapse and she started losing ground through fear.  

Big issues to work on:

* Stop showing fear.   Many times given the option between a strong resistence and a passive one, White caves in and let's black get away with murder.  Give your strongest resistence, even if it doesn't work in the end.  It is better to tenuki than to give in to the opponent.

* Speaking of tenuki, do so more often.  Every move, if you can.  This goes hand-in-hand with the above point: even if the opponet can make a followup move worth 50 points, it doesn't matter so long as you can make a move worth 51 points.  Fight back tooth-and-nail--force the opponent to consider your moves, rather than passively following him around the board.

*  Relax.  It is a game, enjoy yourself ^_^  If you allow youself to get flustered by the opponent, it makes it more likely that you'll fall into a reaction-pattern.  So, if you find yourself panicking into error... RELAX, take three deep breaths, and count the board to see how far ahead or behind you really are, and see where you need to play next.

[dp:A][pp:B]C[Llywelyn: D17 is a questionable move in that ignores the direction of play.  

It invites Black to play at D, which compliments Black's high stones at A and B perfeectly, while only providing minimal added value to White's high stone at C.    A stoned played at D will radiate power across the board, and since Black already has strong influence at A and B, it will help Black more than it will help White.

A move at 1 or 2 is a good balance with White's earlier C  and doesn't give B such a pretty move in response.  A move at 3 is not so balanced with C, but is a strategy to try and "catch up a move" from B's playing first, and doesn't provide B with a good followup.

Moves at 4 and 5 work as well.];B[de];W[fd]
(;B[ed]C[Llywelyn: A vulgar play on B's part.];W[ec];B[gc]LB[fc:A]
[gd:C][ee:D][fe:B]C[Here I didnt know what to do any advice

Llywelyn: B peeped, so White should connect.   There are four moves I look at in this situation, so let's discuss each of them in turn.]

(;W[fc]C[Llywelyn: A is the simplest and shows the least fighting spirit, it is the one you picked.]
;B[jd]LB[ce:B][fe:A]C[Llywelyn: Black has punished himself, and W has nothing to be sorry about here.  Later W can look at A and B to bring on the pain.]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[Llywelyn: Another Black mistake.  This move is very popular among teen-kyus, and it is also very very bad in most of the circumstances it is used in.

* It contacts a weak stone and gives W a firm base.
* It  does not protect the corner and W can come in at R3 whenever she feels like it.
* It mistakes the fundamental purpose of the 4-4 stone to start with (influence, not territory).]
;W[pn];B[mq]LB[oq:A][qq:B]C[Llywelyn: Black is leaving severe weaknesses behind.]

(;W[qk]C[Llywelyn: This is too tight.  The expression goes "from two, jump three."  Particularly with that high stone at Q16...]
;B[nc]
(;W[oc]C[Llywelyn: This suffers the same problems as B's play at R5, except in this case B already has that pretty three space extension we discussed earlier.]
;B[nd]LB[jd:A]SQ[nc]C[Llywelyn: A now is in a perfect place to work with the marked stones, and White not only fails to protect the corner, but ends in gote.]
;W[qg]LB[qc:B][qe:A]TR[pf][qf]C[In retrospect I think I should have played 20 down on the left or the bottom.

Llywelyn: this suffers the same set of problems N3 does.  Allowing for an easy invasion at A or B.    The marked moves don't make it quite so easy, though Black could still slide under at B whenever he feels it is appropriate.]
;B[cm]
(;W[fq]C[I tried to invaid the best I knew how]
(;B[eq]C[Llywelyn: This move is questionable, though it may work out with N3 there.

In response to this, the instinctual move is "bump-extend."]

(;W[iq]C[Llywelyn: This move feels like an abandonment of F3 and all of the purpose behind it.]

(;W[gh]C[Llywelyn: this shows a lack of fighting spirit.  While up to here it is fine, after this point your game shows a lot of fear.]

[oq:G][qq:E]C[Llywelyn: Fear again.  Time to be looking somewhere else.

A is a power move that stablizes the group and makes a claim at the center.

B is just a nice big move.

C is tempting, simply because it gives a nice lead-in and prevents Black from playing there.

D is another power move that stabilizes the group and aims at E8 later.

E, F, and G are all potentially fun (and workable) invasions.

H is a nice reducing point.

I and J and more good invasions.];B[bi];W[ic]C[I dont know if this was a good idea

Llywelyn: The idea is sound, but I would have lead in from M18.]
