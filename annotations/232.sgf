;B[hq]C[instead of this move, splitting the left side with c10 is a much bigger play,,.....as a general guideline, you should always be looking for the biggest play, the one worth the most, unless there is an "urgent" move that needs to be made...]
;W[gq];B[hr]C[same for White here...answering this is smaller than c10 or d10]
;W[gr];B[gs]C[same comment...this is endgame, and even though it is big, white should ignore it...if W answers all these kinds of moves , it will cost him lots of points....]
;W[fs];B[hs];W[fq]C[e2 is better shape here for this];B[ip]
C[much too slow...Black has nothing to worry about here...c10 is much bigger

if Black did want to play in this area, such moves as n4 or q5 are better]
;W[jm]C[White is apparently worried about Black building a big area.....this is a common overconcern...

for one thing, W can still invade at r5 and make a live group if he wanted to...

and c10 is still a monster move for White];B[kn];W[jl];B[ll]
;W[ne]C[nice move by White, even though c10 or d10 is bigger]
;B[oe]C[an important idea:

If you attach to an opponent's weak stone, you make it stronger.....here the White o15 stone is already strong, so this is a forcing move by B that does not help w so much...and is therefore ok]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qe];B[qd];W[qg];B[qh];W[pe];B[od];W[oh];B[oi]
C[i think that protecting the cut at p14 by  playing at o14 is better....then if he cuts at q12, you can play r11 and his 4 stones at r15 are dead...]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[of];B[re];W[oc];B[pc];W[ob]C[the "empty triangle " shape is one to avoid in general]
;B[pb];W[oa];B[pa];W[jj];B[lj];W[lh];B[mi];W[mh];B[nh]C[c10 still bigger.... :)))]
;W[ng];B[ni];W[og];B[rg]C[endgame move...too soon, and leaves you too thin and subject to getting cut up]
;W[rf];B[sf];W[rh]C[one of the things tht will get better as you play more, and in fact will be the main determiner of your go strength is your reading ability...the ability to calculate a few moves ahead....get volumes 1 and 2 of graded go problems for beginners and go through them repeatedly until you can do all the problems..you will be at least 20 kyu then

here you should try to see that if you play at t13, W will atari you again and if you connect again, he will ge tthem all.....so cut  your losses now withs11 and then something like s17 to be sure the corner i s alive]
;B[sg];W[sh];B[se];W[rd];B[rc];W[sd];B[sc];W[dj]C[at last...an enormous move]
;B[hn]C[good incursion....but keep in mind the other moves that are there for you: c3,c14,c17,f17]
;W[gm];B[gn];W[fn];B[in];W[im];B[jn];W[kl];B[lm];W[kj];B[kk]
;W[jk];B[lk];W[li];B[mj]C[not necessary....try to picture what happens if he plays here,,,,you just capture him]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[pi];B[qj];W[ql];B[ol]C[better to play from the side at maybe r5 or r6 to deny White room to try and live on the side]
;W[qm]C[too slow....he should jump to r5 or so];B[qo];W[qn]
;B[pn];W[qk];B[rk];W[oj];B[ok];W[rl];B[sl];W[sm];B[sk];W[rn]
;B[ro];W[so];B[sp]C[no, you need to play at s4 here, and then if he pushes at t4, then you atari at t3 and after he connects, you defend the cutting point

by playing this you are giving him a chance to fight a ko];W[po]
C[but he doesn't take the opportunity to playa t s4];B[qp];W[on]
;B[pm];W[om];B[pl];W[nl];B[nk];W[mm];B[mn];W[nn];B[mo]C[you are doing fine here]
;W[oo];B[op];W[np];B[no];W[mp];B[ln];W[oq];B[pp];W[cf]C[nice move for white]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[bk];W[bj];B[dm];W[dn];B[cn];W[co];B[bn];W[em]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[cl];W[bm]C[nice move by White...when you read vol 1 you will see the vital points of certain shapes]
;B[an];W[am];B[al];W[aj];B[ak];W[el];B[bo];W[bp];B[ap];W[aq]
;B[fd]C[you could have cut at b3 with double atari and fought a ko

regarding this f16 move....it is more usual to invade at f17...when you play on the 3rd line it is easier to make a base in order to live]
;W[gd];B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[fe];B[cb];W[fc];B[ed];W[ee];B[fb]
;W[gc];B[gb];W[hb];B[ha]C[b17 is very big here instead of this]
;W[ia];B[ga];W[eb]C[once this happens to you a bunch of times you will start to see it coming....always try to read a few moves ahead.....if you start doing this you will be shocked at how good it is when you are reading ahead and your opponent is not:))))]
