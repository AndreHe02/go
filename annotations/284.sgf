C[Hi, I would try to do my best to help you. Anyway I am only 7k* so take all my advice not too seriously because it could be wrong ¡.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[jp]C[Until now the opening is quite standard.

Now the *maybe* most common joseki is jumping to the center as in the variation]

C[this move of white is not usual because it has a big defect at a.

The usual white moves are a or b and black should answer at c.]
;B[cm];W[fp]C[When the pincer is played far and high, as k4, f4 is an important move.]
;B[dn];W[en];B[oc];W[qj]
(;B[ql]C[This move is not very good, see previous variation.]
;W[qg];B[fc];W[nq]C[This white move is really important because it attacks black corner and makes the white bottom territory really big.

The bad move was not f17 but r8 as I pointed out in the previous variation.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn]C[Black corner is still open at r3 while white is now stronger.]

;W[dc]
(;B[ch]C[This is a very good move by black :)];W[dl]C[I would have played like the variation

D8 is a very important point for both players because it enlarges white territory a lot.]

(;B[eh]C[Usually jumping into the center is not bad, but i prefer the  variation.]
;W[cg]C[white tries to protect the corner while attacking, a very good strategy.]
;B[ce]C[C15 is clearly the weak point of white corner but as black is weak at this area i think it is not a good idea to invade now. Usually is better to reinforce oneself and IF white dont defend himself, then invade.]
;W[cf];B[de];W[ee]
(;B[ed]C[Look at the variations.];W[ef];B[bd]C[Good tesuji, but white has too many liberties to be killed.]
;W[bc];B[ac]C[No way. Black should left that stones and play in another part of the board.]
;W[be];B[cd];W[cc];B[ad];W[ab];B[bf];W[bg];B[ae];W[ba];B[pf]
C[Black should attack white weak groups to get the iniciative. I think black is behind now.

Maybe a good strategy is attacking white upper group to make thickness and then use that thickness to attack the white right side group.]
;W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[nn]C[Good move because defends black corner while reducing white territory]
;W[co];B[bo];W[cl];B[lo]C[Even an invasion at m4 seems possible.]

(;B[kc]C[L17 is a very big territorially speaking but it is gote, you lose the iniciative.

So probably was better to first play all the sente moves and then l17.

The cut at e7 looks very promising for  example, see variation]
;W[ff]CR[gc][fc][ed][fe][ch][eh]C[This move is also very strong because white reinforces his stones while attacking the two marked groups.]
;B[gh];W[hg];B[gg];W[gf]
(;B[hf]C[When you are weak and the opponent strong is better just to run and threat to cut. See variation]

;W[kg];B[jf];W[kf];B[je];W[li]C[Very good sequence for white because the j14 stone was not important and he has reinforced himself to keep on attacking the black left side group.

BUT the m11 conection was bad, and you didnt notice it. See variation]

;W[ek];B[eo];W[fn];B[fo];W[go];B[al];W[bm];B[am];W[an];B[bp]
;W[ak];B[am];W[jj]C[Now all black left side stones are dead.]
;B[aj];W[ai];B[fj];W[dh];B[fk];W[dk];B[el];W[bk];B[ao]C[I think you have played quite well but for some very bad mistakes during fights, mostly while trying to escape with  weak stones. Also you didnt see  the chances white gave to you, so you cut when you shouldnt and didnt cut when you should but that has happened to all of us, and many times still happens.

I think you have a good style but you must improve your fighting skills by doing problems and playing games AND reviewing them later by yourself first and if necessary by a stronger player.

I hope my commentaries would help you to improve a bit.])
(;B[ek]C[If you played e9 first you could save your stones and kill white´s.

White is weak so couldnt cut.];W[ei];B[dk]))

So i think it would be better this way];W[qe];B[qf];W[rf];B[pe]

(;B[ip];W[jq];B[in];W[ho];B[jn]C[Now a black cut at e7 would be possible. So white should defend and black ends in sente.]

(;B[cl]LB[em:a][ck:b]C[ Now white because the  cut at a cant play hane at b so should extend again]
;W[dk];B[ck]LB[ce:a]C[So black has connected and make a lot of territory. The question now is if  white can use the wall to convert the whole bottom into territory but black has some thickness at top that could be used to reduce white moyo. Also, as you tried to play in the game, white UL corner is open at a, so white only territory is at the bottom.]

(;B[jn]C[Another idea is:];W[lo];B[ln];W[mn];B[lm];W[mm];B[il]
C[This way white territory is not so big.])
(;B[dl]C[Black has sente to play anyway.

Black has three corners and only one  group a bit  weak. White has one corner, one big moyo, or semi territory at the bottom and two weak groups.

One posibility for black is:];W[em];B[el];W[fl];B[fk];W[gl]
;B[ch]))
(;B[qh];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[mq]C[I think that this would be better for black than the actual game.

It is very important to extend in front of a corner enclosure like r16 an p17, and when white approach the other black corner, black can secure the corner territory WHILE reducing white moyo at the bottom.

Choosing the right move at this situations is very important in the opening.

Now black would have three big corners and an easy game.]))

(;B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[jr]C[This is a good joseki for black because through he has given white the LL corner, the white pincer stone is now quite weak so black could make thickness or territory on the right side attacking it.]
