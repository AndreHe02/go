C[Vorkosigan: Hi, my name is Jun (Vorkosigan on igs) and I would generally like to know how to improve my game. I just about won with 0.5 points. I would like to know on which part of my play I should try to improve next. Thank you kindly for your efforts.

;B[eg];W[di]LB[eg:1]C[kk1: The move at 1 and the response by W seems better for W. B keeps sente, but having sente has a certain point value which can be less than defensive moves that secure territory. Sente is important, but always keep in mind the change in territorial values. In this case, perhaps a gote move that claims a large open area would've been better than 1.]
;B[qn];W[qf];B[nc];W[qj];B[qh]LB[fq:X]C[Vorkosigan: I guess I should have left R12 for later and played on X first.
kk1: Yes, there are bigger areas to play first. Your style is very confrontational, which can work for you if your strength is in close fighting. If not, it would be better to create your own large territorial frameworks and let W do the same with what remains.]
;W[pg];B[ph];W[od];B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qc];B[qb]LB[rc:X]C[Vorkosigan: Playing X would have been better. But later it turned out to be ok.
kk1: Yes, you played better than W later in this corner.];W[rc]
;B[qe];W[pe]LB[qe:1]C[kk1: Playing 1 was a small move when there are still big points elsewhere on the board. In the end, it worked out, but at this point there are bigger moves.]
;B[pj]C[kk1: Still, I think that you should have first laid claim to the bottom edge. Often, it is the territory that is created out of the side-effects of outside fighting that determines the winner.]

;W[fj];B[gi];W[lo]LB[gi:1]C[kk1: You allowed W to play twice in the bottom right area, without responding. It is advantageous to extend a secure corner into the centre, as it does not need as much defense and offers much influence. At this point the corner is isolated and only good for making local territory. Good moves by W.]

;B[dh];W[ch];B[dj]C[Vorkosigan: This hand instantly felt stupid. I don't know why i kept pushing after that...
kk1: It happens. The best way to avoid following up bad moves, is to keep looking at the rest of the board for ideas for where to play, and not just near where you or the opponent just played.]
;W[ci];B[dk];W[fl];B[cm];W[cn];B[cl];W[bj];B[gj];W[el];B[gm]
;W[gl];B[hm];W[jn];B[hl];W[jl]C[kk1: This is a good move by W. It works on both sides to push  B on the left, and prepares to make territory on the right. You should be making similar moves with your groups on the left top and right of the centre.]
;B[gk];W[en];B[fn];W[fm];B[fo];W[eo];B[mf]C[kk1: That was a good move. It caps W and brings the top and right groups together.]

;W[np]C[Vorkosigan: I have the feeling i could have gained a bit more here by playing differently.
kk1: It does seem like B should be able to save more territory, although not easily.]

;B[kk]LB[jj:A]C[This would've been better played at A. I think B has more to gain, W has less to lose. With a move at A, it limits W's upward movement, begins to make territory on both the left or right sides.]
;W[jf];B[kf];W[jh];B[kh];W[ki];B[lh]LB[ji:A]C[kk1: A cross-cut move may have been better. B is perhaps has a little more local support. If you were ahead and just needed to maintain the lead a more defensive move would be good.]
;W[jj];B[li];W[kj];B[lj];W[je];B[ke];W[id];B[kd]LB[gf:A]C[kk1: That appears to be a wasted move. A move like at A is worth much more.]

;W[sg];B[rg];W[sb];B[sh];W[pb];B[pa]C[Vorkosigan: After i killed that R14-group, I decided to keep on playing. Otherwise I would have resigned.]

I believe I won with pure luck (because of the dead white group). After I reviewed the game, I felt that my biggest problem seems to be keeping sente. Otherwise I could have gained a few points more in yose. But most of the time I have problems deciding which move will give me sente and which not.]

[sp][qq][rq][sq][ar][er][sr][as][bs][cs][ds][es][ss]C[kk1: Looking at the final board scoring is helpful to see what you made and kept vs. what your opponent did. See which move initated the securing of each of the largest territories for either side. Other than the large top right corner which was won by a fortunate kill, B secured very little corner or side territory. This happened because you play close to your opponent rather than making territory for yourself and letting your opponent take the next largest area. The opponent was able to play to defend your approaches while making safer groups requiring less follow up defense.
kk1: Your pattern of play tends to be very reactionary. You attack, expecting defensive reaction. When attacked, you react defensively. Try to think in other styles too: you take the biggest territory, they take next biggest; they attack, you play offensively in same area or elsewhere with collateral damage. Playing sente moves too often means that you may have many smaller, weaker groups that you have to defend and work to link up.
kk1: In the beginning, play to take the corner and side areas in order of decreasing point value. Instead of playing close to your opponent, play in the largest open corner or side area. If approached, play in the opposite direction to secure area, or if there is already a stone on the other side, pinch to do both attack and make area with that stone.]
