C[Dear reviewer,
This game I played on KGS as black. My nickname there is no2k.
I would be very pleased to get some advice regarding my style of playing.
In the beginning I thought to play a good game. But the more stones appeared, the worse I felt. Is this due to a mistake in mind in the beginning.
Or is it because of bad play afterwards.
I am mainly inetrested in advice regarding the opening and the middle game, but of course every comment is welcome.
Thank you very much in advance,
Peter (as no2k)

* I would say the main thing you have to work on is tactics. I don't think you played so badly strategically, but your attacking let white off the hook multiple times.  You have a few chances to capture white groups just by making slightly different moves. I have tried to point these out in the review, I hope it will be useful.]

(;B[lp]C[* Pincering from this direction is definitely not very interesting. It looks like the pincer stone might come under attack. But more importantly, even if you manage
to attack properly, you will never make any territory out of it. I can see why you played it, you are probably afraid that white will make too much territory,
but there is nothing to be afraid about. See the variations for other ideas.]
;W[oo];B[pn];W[on]TR[lp]C[* This is a move that is normally taboo, it gives black too much territory. White must be confident about capturing the black stone to play this way.]

;B[lf]C[* This is an excellent move for black. White must be very careful.]
;W[kd];B[jd];W[ke]
(;B[lh]C[* This is the first big mistake. You have a chance to severely attack white here, M12 is in the wrong direction. You want to squeeze white against your good shape  at the top. See variations.]
;W[je];B[ie];W[jg];B[fo]LB[fr:A]C[* Better test white at A first.]
;W[fr];B[jq];W[dn];B[cm];W[if];B[he];W[ci]C[* Now if black had played the other attack variation, white would not be able to play C11 because black would have been too thick.. Even so, black is in the game here]
;B[gq]C[* This is a very heavy move..];W[gr];B[ir];W[hp];B[go]
;W[hr]
(;B[fm]C[* Maybe you could play an 'inducing move', i.e. a move that forces white to force you to play a jump like this? In this way you gain efficiency. See variation]

captured white :) See variation.];W[gj];B[gi];W[hk];B[ik];W[gk]

it's not so  important. In my opinion, if you play B10 instead of F15, and then play a good endgame, you will still win.]
