Here you have two weak groups marked with X and square respectivley.

he attacks the other.];W[dm]LB[el:A]MA[an][bo][cn][cm][bm]C[White 36 at and your marked group is in trouble.]

may be support for L7 ?

(first big mistake i think)

I think Black 79 at M8 is better.];W[ll]TR[kn][km]C[I think you can get away with the two marked stones like this,
...]
(;B[ch]LB[fh:B][dh:A]C[xxc : good idea ?

White has the easy answer at A. White catchs your stone and gets
a nice wall at the outside. You gets more trouble with your left
group only, which is still weak.

Why don't play at B which makes your left group stronger, leads
to more power in the center and threatens an invasion.];W[dh]

overall feeling ... wrong order in choices i made !

a main line to study and and apply in my games to come is needed

thank u for reading

If you want to attack, think about it, if it is really an attack
or if your opponent can ignore it or if the attack makes your
opponent stronger only. Even more important, make your stones
safe before you attack. Sometimes a denfensive move is the best
move on the whole board. (See also power)
You can't keep all stones. Take the bigger piece if you can't
get both.
Take care of power. White has used his power and he eventually
wins.

I hope my comments are usefull for you.])
