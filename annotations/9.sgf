C[What I really want to know in this game was when did I fall behind and when did I come back into the game?   Was there some really silly moves (black and white) which tipped the scales?   Was the attack at c14 to early?

Where did I falter in the end game?

What moves should I have not made and made elsewhere (playing  the big points) and what big points did I play without securing locally first?

RickMott: Ok, that's a pretty big stack of questions, I'll do my best:)]
PL[B];B[dp]C[RickMott: So far, so good :)];W[pd];B[fc]C[This threw me straight away. I wasn't sure if I should just take the star point up there, or ignore it. So I choose to ignore it since I could get a nice formation.

 RickMott: Very unusual.  Standard corner points go out as far as 5
lines, but not 6.];W[qp];B[dd];W[oq]C[Like so. I was quite happy with this situation]
;B[pj]C[Expected response];W[jp]C[So I took this point,

RickMott: left side is bigger now.  C10 or
C6 approach, maybe.];B[jj];W[fq]C[I did this to expand my bottom territory. was also considering h16 and d10

RickMott: Yes, left side is better.  C10 maybe better than D10; you
want to live, can't run easily, so play low.  Expansion of bottom
is too early; want to reduce black potential.];B[dj]C[RickMott: In one move, black's position goes from too weird
to reasonable.  That's why you wanted to play around here.]
;W[jd]C[So when he took d10, I took k16];B[id];W[je]C[RickMott: why stand up?  Better to stand down at K17, works
better with your corner stone and doesn't build his center
moyo, leaves opening to slide at G18 for end game.];B[ie];W[cf]
C[This was risky, but I generally planned just to peek in, fool around, and with draw, while stuffing up the the moyo. I originally planned to connect to the right, but went with the bottom instead.

RickMott: better to approach the bottom corner.  You already have
an approach move on one side, C6 puts pressure on the single
corner stone instead of approaching a strong top position.]
;B[ce];W[df];B[fe]C[RickMott: he shouldn't have let you get away with this.
As black, I'd have played C12 to take away the white
group's base, and because of the K15-J15 exchange you
have more trouble escaping.  Black should have a strong
attack here.];W[ci]C[RickMott: but now you should be OK.];B[di]
;W[dh]C[RickMott: I wouldn't hane here, I'd extend to C10.
You can still connect and you make a wider base.];B[cj];W[bi]
;B[bj];W[fg]C[I had 2 choices, make life, or retreat. Since my orginial idea was to retreat, thats what I did. Was this a good idea?

RickMott: You have a weakness because of the C12 cut.  Black can
play the belly tesuji at B12, for example, to take away part of
your base.  But running isn't easy because black J13 makes it
hard to escape.  I think B15 followed by B13 might be better.
If black plays well now, he might not kill you but should get
very solid outside positions out of the attack.];B[bg];W[cg]
C[RickMott: descend at B14 is better.  You get a chance
to monkey-jump into the corner later, maybe, and you
threaten to capture the stone.  Black should have
played at B12 instead.];B[bf];W[hg];B[gh];W[gg];B[eh]C[RickMott: Black gets a good attack and builds strength towards
the bottom left.  He really should play K13 instead of the peep
at 33; then he has a threat to capture the whole shootin' match.]
;W[eg]C[false eyes galore. I should of played e15 earlier to guarantee one eye, but I was never sure he would respond]
;B[bh];W[ch];B[mf]C[RickMott: weird move by Black!  Trying to do too many
things at once, not strong enough for any of them.
You can look after your group easily now.  Start with
the hane at H12, then jump out to (say) L12.];W[md];B[pf]C[RickMott: Black fixes his shape.  Too bad.]
;W[qf]C[trying to keep my top area. I was willing to let him have the centre area realising I could invade from either k15 or h13

RickMott: You still have to look after your weak group!  Black has
lots of possibilities, starting with the hane at K14 or the cap at
K13.  You don't have any sure eyes yet.];B[pe];W[qe];B[nd];W[nc]
C[RickMott: Why underneath?  Black is being way to aggressive
here.  Play O15 and punish him.  Either you make a big corner
or split all his weak stones.];B[od];W[oc];B[ld];W[lc]C[RickMott: Too passive.  You're giving the guy a free ride.
Stand a N15, what does he do?  P15 then captures two cutting
stones, and leaves his other two stones very weak; M15 cuts
off his clamp, which was an overplay.

When confronted with a wild man like this, just look to keep
your stones stable and cut his stones apart somehow.  The
Go gods will reward you for it, even if you can't see quite
how yet :)];B[me];W[mc]C[after this I was looking at q13 (threatening p15) followed by r11, but wasn't sure that would work the way I wanted]
;B[pg]C[RickMott: small move, but necessary to defend P15 cut.
You still have to worry about life on the left...];W[cq]C[Since I lost the q13 trick, I decided to take the (big?) point of c3]
;B[ig]C[RickMott: Contact is the wrong way to go about this for Black.
He should play K13 or K14 and you will have a hard time.
The contact play allows you to try some tricks...];W[hh]C[he ignored and ruined any chance of me connecting with the right side. However I didn't mind to much as e,g 12 were weak.   RickMott:  You can probably connect if you want to.  Think about
wedging at J14.  Sure he can atari, but after you connect he has
weak stones all over the place.];B[fi]C[he realised that

RickMott: this is a terrible move, but descent at G11 would be
pretty strong.  You'd have a hard time capturing either stone
and he's starting to wall you in.];W[gi];B[fh];W[fj];B[ei];W[hj]
C[make the connection temporarily stable. I felt as though I was well behind at this stage, but until the lower centre was decided, I knew I had a chance

RickMott: You're not really behind, especially since you just saved
the group that should have died...  you have edge territory, he's
trying to make center territory.  You should come out ahead.
You've already weakened his lower left potential with C3 and
breaking out the left center group in that direction.];B[dm]
C[RickMott: again, a poor move; trying to hold onto the bottom left
when it's open underneath to your C3 stone.  Black should play
C4 in sente first.  You can respond now with B5 or C4, strongly
reducing Black.];W[gm]C[my first move to start my attempt to get most of the lower centre]
;B[bo]C[RickMott: weak; should be D3 now to force you to connect
underneath.];W[dq]C[to save teh corner

RickMott:  If you're going for the bottom moyo, a move around
Q8 might be bigger.];B[fk];W[gk]C[to keep connected];B[fl];W[gl]
C[I think from this point I was sure the groups would connect

RickMott:  Now a move around Q8 is definitely bigger.  You don't
have to answer the peep, if he cuts and you play H8 in response,
you have a hanging connection with the upper left and that wedge
of J14 to fight with.];B[fm];W[ee]C[but just in case.

RickMott: buk buk BUUUUUUUUUK!  ChickenMan!!!

But seriously, folks... Don't play "just in case" moves.
There are much bigger plays around.];B[ed]C[RickMott: but he answered locally, so OK.]
;W[ii]C[this was a bad move. r8 would of been much better I think. Or o6 or something like that]
;B[qn];W[on]C[I gave up the right for the lower centre

RickMott: better at P5, this way he can cut
through at Q5.s];B[qg];W[qd]C[wasn't sure how stable I was

RickMott: You're right, if he cuts there you lose
the two stones and probably 12 or more points.  You
should win this game, so there's no need to take
chances.];B[mj]C[RickMott: He's trying to protect center territory, but
it's full of holes.  You can get in at left along the
K or L line and reduce it to about 20-25 points, while
a move to complete your bottom moyo is even bigger.];W[jl]C[started to map out the lower centre. Was looking to peep at m9 to keep him worried about k10

RickMott:  This is a little too aggressive.  Your moyo is still open
on the left.  I'd consider E4 (threatening to break into his territory)
with F6 hane as a followup.];B[pm];W[po]C[went with security

RickMott: Good locally, but you wouldn't have had to do it
if you'd played P5 in the first place.];B[om];W[mm]C[this was risky I thought

RickMott: No, it's fine, good relationship with both K8
and P6.  It makes use of the extra strength in P6-Q5-R4,
which are a bit overconcentrated.  Your problem is the
opening on the left.];B[ml]C[this made life easy];W[lm];B[jc]
;W[le]C[RickMott: Good response!];B[kc];W[kd]C[all of a sudden black realises the centre top isn't that big after all.]
;B[jf];W[kf];B[kg];W[lf]C[interesting form, but it works];B[lg]
;W[jh];B[jg];W[ki];B[li];W[kj];B[kh];W[mg]C[RickMott:  Good reducing sequence, but save this for a ko
threat.  You can't do anything with it now, but it's
sente anytime.];B[oe];W[go]C[everything else was too small.   RickMott: This is solid, but I like the sequence that
starts with E4 better.

Did you realize that black K11 atari, followed if you
connect by L9, is about a 10-12 point swing in Black's
favor?];B[eo]C[RickMott: but he didn't see it and settled for a small
defensive move.];W[fn];B[en];W[ro]C[big points - the two lower corners, g15, and securing my lower center. at this point, I thought if I managed to not make any mistakes I would win. I think though, looking back, I really needed to reinforce a bit more. This was a bad choice I think, as I lost a bit up in the centre. maybe m9 first.]
;B[ji]C[RickMott: See, he found it eventually.];W[kk];B[ih]
;W[ij]C[RickMott: small move.  Take something like B4 instead.]
;B[jk];W[ik];B[jh];W[kl]C[RickMott: M8 is better, threaten to break in with an atari
on N8.];B[rn];W[qo];B[pn];W[nn];B[nm];W[mo]C[RickMott: Not necessary, B4 begging to be played.]
;B[fo];W[gn];B[ar]C[big loss

RickMott: right, B4 anytime in last 5-6 moves.];W[cp];B[co]
;W[ge];B[gd];W[he];B[hd];W[br]C[played this as I knew he would continue down there else a2 was a waste, and I also wanted to prevent something like c2 later.]
;B[aq];W[rg]C[played since I thought I would keep sente];B[rh]
;W[rf];B[lb]C[saw trouble here, but then realised the structure had an eye (false, but it helped)]
;W[mb];B[kb];W[ri]C[RickMott: fine end-game move.];B[qi];W[sh]
;B[rj];W[qh];B[ph];W[rh]C[filling was worth 3 points I think, and there was nothing I could immediately see worth more]
;B[ma];W[na];B[la];W[ai]C[This turned out to be bigger than I thought and should of been played earlier

RickMott: the hane at A12 is bigger.];B[aj];W[ah];B[be];W[ag]
;B[de];W[ef];B[ob]C[an attempt in vain.];W[nb];B[pc];W[pb];B[lj]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[af];B[ae];W[bq];B[bp];W[ep];B[do];W[fp];B[so]
;W[sp];B[sn];W[hf];B[if];W[bs];B[sj];W[as];B[ap];W[ff];B[fd]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[gj];B[ll];W[jn]C[And in the end a big win to white.   RickMott: Yes, you made big territory at the bottom, but
only because he let you by making some really bad moves
along the way.  I think he could have killed your group
around E13 earlier, which would have changed the balance
considerably.  He should have been able to either kill
it or make big territory attacking it, but failed to do
either.])
