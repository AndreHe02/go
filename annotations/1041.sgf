AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I lost this game by half a point, and it turns out I had one endgame move which I overlooked which would have allowed me to *win* by half a point instead.  Nevertheless, I feel the game shouldn't have been that close in the first place - a one point endgame move shouldn't be allowed to have that much influence over the outcome of the game.  Please in your review tell me about ways I could have made the margin of victory larger in my favor.  Were my mistakes more strategic in nature or more tactical in nature?  Or some of both?  I seemed to be doing pretty well in the opening (considering the four stone handicap) and then in the midgame I seemed to be falling further and further behind.  Towards the end I caught up pretty fast, but only well enough to make the game pretty much even.  What could I have done in the midgame or opening to give myself more point-gaining opportunities in the last third of the game?

Feel free to make any comments, whether they address the above concerns or not.  Thanks!]

i'm your reviewer here.So sorry for the late review :p

;W[nd]LB[fe:a][dc:b]C[Normally,play at 'a' or 'b' is more considerable move.]

I have no obvious framework-developing moves, (except I guess something around L7 but during the game it seemed too small to me) and I could find no useful ways to attack except possibly B10 but that would be a small gain even if it worked.  I was looking for a good time to attack at R17, but almost anything I could do following such an attack would simply have helped Black to attack my upper group.  What other opportunities did I miss?

It doesn't matter :) but this move did help you to strengthen your marked group.And there is a crucial point you must play before black,around the 'a'.]
;B[ll]C[Black get what i mean,perhaps.];W[jm];B[jl];W[il];B[ik]
;W[hl];B[hk];W[ck]C[Would B10 have been a better move?  Or is it too stretchy?

Yup, B10 is better here;)];B[cj];W[bk]C[B10 is still considerable.]

But I shouldn't have to rely so heavily on Black's mistakes.  I am interested in knowing how I could have had a good game *without* having had to take advantage of this mistake.

Frankly speaking, Go is mostly playing by having a good strategy and tactic and luring black to make mistakes in order to win the game :)]

(;W[tt]C[I should have moved at E4, subtracting one point from Black and allowing me to win by half a point instead of losing by half a point.  :-/  A little disheartening, but such moves are not the point really.  It shouldn't have been so close in the first place.

Imbue me with your wisdom.  :)

Nope.Playing at E4 now did not help you at all.see variation.]
