C[TC: I felt pretty good about the opening, so I'm not including many questions here.  Nevertheless, feel free to suggest (and explain!) better opening moves.

bignose: I see several things for Black to improve upon.

Black paid a little too much attention to the centre without valuing the corners and sides; many opportunities were lost because of a Black move on the fifth line or higher which simply allowed White to gain territory underneath, and insufficient attention to the corners led to Black losing all four of them.  Partly this was because GnuGo also paid too much attention to the centre, but Black's failing was in allowing White to lead the game so much.

More importantly, Black is making moves that seem to be attacks, but which do not actually pressure White.  A successful attack will restrict the options of the group under attack, while keeping sente to go back and defend any weak points created.

A successful attack will also gain something while attacking.  Many of Black's attacking moves failed to gain territory, influence, or strength for his own groups, while making White stronger and leaving weak points for a White counterattack.

Several moves were played that did not actually gain anything for Black, but instead gave White opportunities to attack while Black struggled to defend the stone.  These moves ended up being worse than a pass, since many moves were spent rescuing a worthless stone.

I would say the main principle this game illustrates is: Look to your own weak points before attacking the opponent.  Strengthen before attacking.

A secondary principle illustrated is: Gain territory while attacking.  A move with only one purpose has no purpose.

A reading of Kiseido's "Attack and Defense", and perhaps "In The Beginning", will be of benefit.  For the endgame situations, a study of Kiseido's "Life and Death" and the "Graded Go Problems For Beginners" series is recommended.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp]LB[oq:a][op:b]C[bignose: A very standard opening, with Black and White placing in two adjacent corners each.  The best moves for Black 5 are to approach White's lower right stone (around 'a' or 'b') before it can settle properly, but that will invite fighting and is partly a question of style.  The board is so open that any other developmental move will also be fine.]
;B[pj]C[bignose: This move claims another open area of the board, but allows White to take sente.]
;W[op]TR[pj]C[bignose: White needs to settle this corner before Black makes use of the marked stone.]
;B[jp]C[bignose: Splitting White's lower side is a good strategy, but will result in a lot of fighting.  If Black wanted to do this it may have been better to do so with Black 5 instead of allowing White to settle the corner first.]
;W[fc]LB[cf:a][ic:b][db:c]TR[jp]C[bignose: White uses the principle of approaching the corner to split up the side, although the stones on the 4-4 points are less susceptible to this attack.

An approach move here is good for White because Black must answer it (or White will make another approach at 'a'), and White has several options to choose from depending on Black's response.

If Black plays around 'a' himself to extend down the left side, White can settle her stone at 'b' and the approach is successful because a large Black area has become two smaller ones (the same principle that Black used with the marked stone).

If Black pincers around 'b', White can threaten the corner with 'c', allowing the group to settle either in the corner or along the upper side.

Black's strongest response is to pincer at 'b' or one stone closer, to prevent an easy settled group for White.]
;B[kc]LB[hd:A][id:B][hc:c][ic:d][jc:e][cf:f]C[TC: Is it better here to get closer to W F17 -- say at 'a' (H16) or 'b' (J16) -- or help support Q16 and Q10?

bignose: Yes, if you want to approach this stone, you need to come closer to restrict its potential.  This move still allows all the options for White discussed on the previous move -- especially the easy extension to 'd' -- and thus doesn't really bother White.

Any of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' will prevent White from extending along the upper side, pressuring her to settle the group another way and allowing Black time to settle the upper left corner.  The move at 'c', followed later with Black 9, would be the strongest.

This isn't really much of a loss for the upper side, but the real loss is a loss of sente -- White is under no pressure now, so she can settle her stones at leisure while Black's upper left corner still needs another move around 'f' to defend it.  This loss becomes great later in the game.]
;W[pg]C[bignose: White is not pressured by Black's move, so takes the opportunity to split Black up some more.]
;B[of]LB[ng:A][qf:b][nj:c][qn:d]C[TC: Wasn't sure if this was a good way to proceed here.  I also considered 'a' (O13).

bignose: Capping plays are usually used on already settled groups to prevent them expanding into the centre.  This White stone is not settled, and does not have enough room to make an easy settling move along the right side, so there are more effective ways to attack it.

The slide to 'b' invites some close fighting, and may endanger Black's right side stone in the process, but the gain in territory is huge.  It removes a lot of potential for Black to invade, and removes a lot of White's space along the side, leaving it floating in the centre.

The jump to 'c' keeps the right Black stone out of trouble, while still pressuring White by removing any easy targets for it to attack -- it must simply run away into the centre, or White can try yet another invasion on the upper side.  This move is good because, in addition to keeping the Black stone connected out, it allows a followup extension to 'd' if given the chance.

The problem with Black 11 here is that it appears to harrass White, but it does so at a loss to Black.  White has many opportunities to grab some of the side and corner, and Black's upper group is actually weakened as a result.  This move is almost worse than a pass.

Try to find attacks that gain you something in the process.]
;W[qe]LB[qd:a][qi:b]C[bignose: White can settle this group at 'a' or 'b', so the invasion is successful.]
;B[pm]TR[of]C[bignose: Note that Black need to take a move to settle this right group; this shows that the attack with the marked stone was unsuccessful, since White is not pressured and Black needs to make a defensive move.]
;W[qd]C[bignose: In addition to settling White's group, this move puts Black back on the defensive.  Black's prospects in the corner are greatly reduced now.]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[oc]LB[pc:a][pe:b][qb:c]TR[of]C[bignose: This move throws away the corner.  It attempts to protect the weaknesses at 'a' and 'b', but does not really protect against 'b' very well and ends up being a half-measure that helps neither.    More importantly it completely ignores 'c', a glaring weakness that ensures Black does not get the corner despite playing so many moves here.  A play at 'c' is vital for Black.

Remember that the corners and sides are worth much more than the centre.  If you defend at 'c' and White later pushes through at 'b', you can afford to lose the marked stone -- it was poorly played -- and defend the upper side, turning it into territory.  White would only gain one stone in the centre, not much of an exchange.]
;W[ic]LB[hc:a]C[bignose: Having gained sente, and leaving Black with several weak points, White is now at leisure to settle her group.

If Black had managed to keep sente, an extension to 'a' would have been a big gain, attacking the upper White stone strongly while gaining secure territory.]
;B[je]LB[cn:a][df:b][fq:c][mq:d]C[TC: At this point, I thought my B group in the upper right looked pretty good -- was it?

bignose: As discussed, there are weaknesses which will have to be defended or lost as territory.

This Black 19 attempts to pressure a settled group, which will not work.  White is not threatened by this move, and keeps sente.

Black is far better using the opportunity afforded by White's settling move to take sente again, and strike out in the open areas of the board.  'a' is huge, allowing the defensive move of 'b' later to work well along the left side.  Sliding to 'c' or 'd' are also good opportunities for gain while attacking.]
;W[lq]C[bignose: White uses the same principle to gain along the right lower side while attacking the lower Black stone.]
;B[kq];W[lp];B[fp]LB[fq:a][jq:b]C[bignose: Not a bad combination, strengthening the marked stone followed by an extension, but this move needs to be at 'a' instead to prevent White creeping in underneath.

Also, in making himself stronger, Black has strengthened White's lower right corner.  White comes out with no weaknesses in her lower group, while Black's lower group has weaknesses at 'a' and 'b'.]
;W[dn]LB[df:a][cf:b][cl:c]C[bignose: With a partly-settled Black group on one side of the corner, White needs to prevent a Black approach from the other side.

Black needs to do this at 'a' or 'b' for the same reason.  A good way to do so would be to pressure White with 'c', followed by playing 'a' or 'b' and setting up a moyo on the left side.]
;B[fn]LB[fq:a][jq:b][ck:c]C[bignose: Again, this move doesn't gain anything for Black nor prevent White from doing anything useful, and ignores the weaknesses of this Black group at 'a' and 'b'.  White can safely ignore this, or respond by gaining a large lower left with 'c' while Black gains nothing.]
;W[nm]C[bignose: Having gained a strong lower right group, White proceeds to use it to split Black's still-weak groups to make them easier to attack.]
;B[ln]LB[ko:a]C[bignose: This is another move that is worse than passing.  It has no connection to any Black group -- a White move at 'a' cuts it off -- and it simply gives White something to attack.  This move costs Black dearly, because he spends many moves in the centre later on trying to defend this stone while White gains territory in the centre that would not otherwise be possible.]
;W[eq]C[bignose: White defends the corner, gains territory and attacks Black all at the same time.  Black needs to find more moves like this one.]
;B[qh]TR[dj][el][fq][ln][of]LB[fq:a][dj:b][cl:c][el:d]C[TC: Here, I didn't know how to best choose an option.  I also considered all of the marked points.

bignose: Black 29 is a good move to keep in mind, but the timing is bad.  White's marked stone has exposed a large weakness in the lower Black group that must be defended at 'a'.  Omitting this is a large loss for Black.

The move at 'b' would not really affect white, so consider playing 'c' before it, after which 'b' looks a lot better and looks toward the upper right corner stone.

The move at 'd' would be useless, almost as bad as the marked Black moves -- White would not be affected, and Black would gain more weak points.

Black 29 is the style of move Black has been needing for most of the middle game, if only it were played when 'a' was not so urgent.]
;W[lm]LB[rg:a][qb:b]TR[ln]C[bignose: White is taking a risk here, leaving the upper right, but note that a White move at either 'a' or 'b' will keep it safe.

White begins to surround the marked Black stone, which proves such a liability for Black.]
;B[km]LB[ko:a][kn:b][fq:c][qb:d][qn:e][kr:f][cl:g]C[bignose: This ignores the weakness at 'a'.  If you want to respond, a move at 'b' is much more solid.

Better, though, would be to let the marked stone go and strengthen a weak point at 'c', 'd', 'e' of 'f', or develop along the open left side with 'g'.

A play at 'c' is the most urgent.  The lower group is now weak at both ends, and is in danger of losing all territory along the lower side.]
;W[cf]C[bignose: White shows Black why he needed to take the left side earlier.]
;B[ee]C[bignose: A good response to the double approach.  Black does not want to be surrounded in the corner.  Note, though, that it would be far superior to have an extension down the left side instead.]
;W[cc]C[bignose: The weakness of the 4-4 stone is the 3-3 invasion.  Here, with two White approaches on each side, it is far more effective.  White has gained a large amount of territory while Black has lost all four corners.]
;B[ge];W[el]C[bignose: Having weakened the Black group from below, White gains strength while attacking from above.]
;B[di]C[bignose: Another poorly timed attack.  White is severely threatening the lower Black group, and Black has several weaknesses there and elsewhere to attend to before thinking of attack.

Additionally, this move attempts to separate two strong groups, so is not really an attack at all. White has gained sufficient territory and influence that she can ignore this attempt to separate her -- none of her groups are threatened.]
;W[ll]C[bignose: White strengthens the splitting stones further, setting up more attacks on the right and lower sides.]
;B[kl]LB[ko:a][jm:b][kn:c]C[bignose: All for naught with the weakness at 'a'.  This move might be better if it were at 'b' or 'c', but still Black should be ignoring the centre and strengthening his side territories.]
;W[lj];B[nk]LB[qn:a][kr:b][ko:c][ol:d]C[TC: I guess my thought here was to allow the lower center group and the right side group get split apart.  Each seem to have enough space to live.  Should I have been more aggressive in cutting off W's lower right group?

bignose: "Enough space to live" will not win you the game.  White's lower right is too strong and well connected to consider attacking, and especially not while the surrounding Black groups have such large weak points at 'a', 'b', 'c'.

This Black 41 is another worse-than-passing move.  It gains Black nothing, does not threaten White with anything, and creates another weakness at 'd' for White to attack.]
;W[mh];B[mf];W[lg];B[cl]LB[dg:a][bi:b]C[bignose: This is a weak point for the White group, but White can counterattack the Black right side with 'a' or 'b', whereas White will end up with solid territory as a result of any attack.]
;W[kk]C[TC: OK, W's move was a surprise here.  Why not strengthen the lower left group?  Was my last move too weak?

bignose: GnuGo is paying a little too much attention to the centre, but with such strong White groups and weak Black ones, White can afford to play slowly like this.

The worst affect this seems to have had is the Black is now fooled into playing many moves in the centre, gaining nothing and giving White some centre territory.  It is still not too late to strengthen Black's side groups, but soon the opportunities all evaporate.]
;B[ki]LB[bn:a]C[bignose: If your attack on the left side was good, and you don't see a threat from these centre stones, why abandon your attack now?  You should commit to your attack and make it worthwhile with 'a'.  White would have to defent the corner, and you would be able to strengthen your lower side in response.]
;W[dl]C[bignose: White continues to strengthen the groups surrounding the lower Black group, preparing for a devastating attack.]
;B[dk];W[nj];B[ok];W[cm];B[bl];W[gl]C[bignose: Now Black's lower group is in serious trouble; it will be reduced almost to nothing with so many weak points surrounded by strong White groups.]
;B[cg]C[bignose: This is a defensive move.  It strengthens your left group, but in return forces White to strengthen her upper right corner, gaining a lot of territory.]

[ma][na][nb][mb][lb][nc][mc][lc][md][ce][de][ch][ci]C[TC: I was feeling good about the game until right here.  Then it starts getting ugly.  Please comment on the state of things up through move 65 (this move).

bignose: As is often the case, the point where you start noticing that White is kicking you around is actually much later than the causes of the kicking.

Weaknesses in groups are a normal part of the game -- in order to press an attack, one usually has to make the attacking group temporarily weak.  However, if Black leaves too many of these weaknesses unattented while White gains strength around them, and they will all come back to hurt Black in the late middle game when White takes all these groups apart.

At this point all Blacks groups have weaknesses that severely limit the territory potential of the groups.  All the lettered points 'a' through 'h' are weaknesses left from earlier exchanges that will cause the groups to come under attack.

My estimate of current territory, marked, gives a current total of Black 30, White 65.  Black needs to gain about 30 points to draw even (with White's 5-point komi), and must do so without losing anything further; a big ask at this point in the game.

Notice that the weaknesses in Black's groups cause his secure territory to be far from the edges, while White's groups are strong enough to count territory almost to the edge of each group.

This illustrates why defending any weakness at this point (or, preferably, earlier) would be such an advantage.  Playing at 'a', 'd', 'e' or 'h' would each be worth at least five to ten points of territory immediately, and each would also allow Black to consider future attacks on currently secure White groups.]
;W[rm];B[qo]LB[ro:a][qn:b]C[TC: Too aggressive?

bignose: Unreasonable.  Black's right group is in danger of losing all its eye space; you can only play this way if you are confident of capturing some White stones to make eyes.  In this case, a simple White hane at 'a' or a clamp at 'b' will gain more territory for White while making 67 a big liability for Black.]
;W[qn]TR[qo][rm]C[bignose: This move is more in line with GnuGo's fighting mood, but it demonstrates even better that the marked Black stone was worse than passing.  Black has failed to respond to the marked White stone, and the right group is in trouble.]
;B[rf]LB[rk:a]C[bignose: This is a good example of gaining while attacking.  Black threatens to cut off White's upper right corner, effectively gaining a free move while White connects and Black can settle some territory with 'a'.]
;W[qf];B[rg]LB[rk:a]TR[rf]C[bignose: A little slow.  Now is the time to play 'a' before White invades and Black loses eye space.  Keeping the side group is more valuable than saving the single marked stone.]
;W[no]C[bignose: However, White misses the opportunity and strengthens her group instead.  This move gains some more territory as well and allows further attacks on the lower and right sides, so it's not a bad response to Black's right side.]
;B[rk]TR[qo]C[bignose: Now the side group has gained about five more points, and is much more secure.  Without the play at the marked stone it would have been better, but this is the right direction.]
;W[pn];B[hm]LB[fq:a]C[TC: I'd already given up on R5, but should I have kept working on the right side group?

bignose: The right side is still weaker than Black would like, but there are much bigger weaknesses to attend to first.  This lower group is in trouble.  Black 75 defends against an attack from the top, but much more severe is the attack from below that costs about twenty points of potential territory.  The play at 'a' was much bigger than this.]
;W[kn]TR[ln]C[TC: Ah, yes.  In considering H7, I completely overlooked this weakness.  I really regretted the previous move now.

bignose: Better to regret the marked Black stone, which was a wasted move the moment it was played.  Losing this stone isn't too bad; what hurts is that you have left the rest of the group open as a result.

With this move White gains territory in the centre easily, further increasing her lead.]
;B[ko];W[jn];B[in];W[jl];B[jo];W[jm]LB[fq:a][kr:b]C[bignose: Black has had to fall back, leaving a strong White group in the centre.  White now has a massive advantage in any fights that occur there.

Note that Black has solidified the top part of the lower side group, but the bottom of it is still wide open at 'a' and 'b', making it much smaller than it appears.]
;B[lo]TR[ln]C[bignose: Saving this marked stone is worth nothing to Black.  It is not a threat to White's strong lower right group, and gains no points for Black.

Look at how many moves were played (and lost) attempting to save this stone.  That is the true cost of a move like the marked stone -- it becomes a big liability for Black if he tries to save it, or it becomes a free gift to White if he does not.]
;W[jh]C[bignose: GnuGo seems to be paying a little too much attention to the centre here.  This Black stone was poorly played, though, and should be left alone while Black strengthens elsewhere.]
;B[ig];W[oh];B[kh]TR[ki]C[bignose: Throwing good stones after bad.  The marked Black stone is another liability, and attempting to save it costs Black dearly again.]
;W[ji];B[jj]LB[jg:A]C[TC: Was this a good idea?  I also considered 'a' (K13).]
;W[ij];B[ii]LB[jg:A][gj:B]C[TC: In retrospect, 'a' (K13) now seems better, although wouldn't W have then gone for something like 'b' (G10)?]
;W[kj];B[hj];W[jk];B[kg];W[fi];B[gh]C[bignose: Note that no real advantage has been gained on either side in this exchange.  At any time Black would have been better to play on one of the sides rather than squabbling for the centre.]
;W[al]LB[ck:a]C[bignose: Making the weakness at 'a' a better target.]

(;B[ak]LB[ck:a][bk:b]C[bignose: Because of the cutting point at 'a', this move does not work and Black must instead play 'b', allowing White to come in further but keeping Black's stones connected.  See variation.]
;W[ck];B[am];W[cj];B[dj];W[bj]
(;B[ch]LB[an:a]C[TC: Was I right in thinking that this move was the last I needed to play here right now, or did I leave critical weaknesses?

bignose: White can capture the Black left side stones with 'a' (see variation), making the invasion a big success.]
;W[fq]C[bignose: The long-delayed devastation of the lower Black group now occurs.  Black could have prevented this any time during the game by playing Black 106.]
;B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[hr];B[ir];W[hl];B[fj]LB[qb:a][bi:b][lr:c]
[jb:d]C[bignose: Paying too much attention to the centre again.  Black has bigger moves defending at 'a', 'b', 'c' or 'd', all of which White must answer.  Keeping sente is very important in the later part of the game.]
;W[ib];B[hd];W[la]LB[jb:A][jc:b][jd:c][kb:d]TR[ib]C[TC: Ouch!  I was much more worried about an attack along lines 15 or 16 between F and J.  W totally took me by surprise here.  Should my last move have been at 'a' (K18) instead?

bignose: The monkey jump, White 116, is a very effective tesuji that must be learned (after it is used against you a few times it will be very easy to remember :-)  Once the marked White stone is played, a Black play at 'a' would not have prevented the monkey jump.

White can connect back to the marked stone in sente, no matter what Black does, even if Black has stones at 'a', 'b' and 'c'.  It is very instructive to play out all the variations yourself to see how effective and self-enclosed this move is, and to be wary of it in future.

Descending to 'd' would have prevented the monkey jump in this case.  It would have been better to play 'a' before White played the marked stone though, strengthening the Black group while forcing White to respond.]
;B[gc]TR[la]C[bignose: While it can be good to respond to an attack with a counterattack, this move does not hit a weakness in the White group.  black has weakened himself further and failed to respond to the marked stone, jeapordising all the Black territory on the upper side.]
;W[gb];B[eb]LB[mb:a][qb:b][lf:c][pe:d]C[TC: Complete foolishness on my part.  In retrospect, it seems like I should have tried to do something about M19 -- but where?

bignose: Once the marked stone was played, Black was going to lose some territory since the marked stone can connect back to the upper left.  Falling back to 'a' might have been best.

Note that this situation is exacerbated by the weaknesses left at 'b', 'c' and 'd'; the whole upper Black group can be devastated.]
;W[ca]C[bignose: White protects a weak point before considering Black's weaknesses.  It is far better to strengthen in preparation for attack and possibly miss the opportunity, rather than rush to attack from a weak position and possibly lose a whole group.]
;B[om]TR[la]LB[mb:a][qb:b]C[bignose: This move is tiny.  It gains little and threatens little, and is best left for the end game.

Far more urgent is responding to the marked White stone.  A direct response at 'a', or an indirect response at 'b' to keep some eye space, would both be good moves.]
;W[kr]LB[on:a][jq:b]C[bignose: A common response to a probe at one side of a group is to attack an adjacent group on a different front.  If Black continues at 'a', White is compensated with 'b'.  If Black responds to White 22, on the other hand, White is then free to return to 'a' or somewhere else.]
;B[jr];W[lr];B[nn];W[on]C[bignose: White's corner is now large and impregnable, while Black's surrounding groups still have weaknesses to probe.]
;B[mn]TR[ln]C[bignose: Keeping this connection is worthless, and further demonstrates the inefficiency of the marked stone.  Every Black stone connected to this one is doing nothing for Black and is no threat to White -- a loss of seven moves.  These moves could all have been spent gaining ten points each earlier in the game.  This is the size of the loss that the marked stone represents.]
;W[ol]C[bignose: White starts nibbling away at Black's weaknesses, at no risk to her own groups.]
;B[pl];W[nl];B[ql];W[mc]C[bignose: At a single blow, all the territory in the upper Black group disappears.  Black cannot win from here.]

;B[nb];W[oa];B[na];W[hi]C[bignose: GnuGo is a little too interested in the centre; there are still large gains for White on every side before trying to capture single stones like this.]
;B[ih]LB[pa:a]C[bignose: Capturing at 'a' is far more valuable, gaining some security and eye space for your upper side group.]
;W[gj];B[ei];W[fk];B[ek];W[fh];B[fg];W[gi];B[hh];W[pa]C[bignose: Again, nothing really came of the scuffle in the centre.  No groups will live or die as a result of centre fighting this late in the game, and spending three or four moves to capture one or two stones is very inefficient.]

(;B[jc]LB[lb:a][ai:b]C[TC: After a long stretch of not having sente, here I get it.  Was this a good place to reinforce now?

bignose: It is a point to watch, but 'a' and 'b' (see variations) all represent larger gains for Black at this point.  They also keep sente, which this Black 169 does not.   Having waited so long to gain sente, you should be using it while you have it.]

bignose: The monkey jump is very effective.  There was never any way to prevent the marked stones connecting back, so they should now be considered part of White's wall.]
