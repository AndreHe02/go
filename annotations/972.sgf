pajaro: Hi. In this game I played black, against an opponent two stones stronger than me. Although I think I did quite well (I won :) I'd like to know my weak spots in the game, as I felt I was winning fairly larger than the actual result.
Thanks


:: Hello, I hope my comments will present some interesting ideas to you...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pj];B[pl]LB[ph:A]C[pajaro: May be pressing from upside, towards my shimari?


:: Yes, since your extension seems to be too close towards your corner stones below.]
;W[pf];B[nc]LB[nd:A]C[

:: I would play one line below. But that's mostly taste, I'd guess.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[fq]LB[rc:A][fp:B][gp:C]TR[ph]C[

:: I would perhaps first extend with A. This serves two purposes:
1. you strengthen your own group
2. you might later on be able to exploit the weak extension around Q12.
(see variation for what happens if white gets to play there first)

To the actual line of play:
 I would play one line above (B or C). Seems to better match with the right side. Though, of course, this is a nice one, too. And most likely bigger (not more urgent!) than (A).]

(;W[ql]
(;B[qk]C[

:: I don't know. Seems like you cannot kill that group this way. So this will actually help white.
I would back up a bit (see variation).];W[pk];B[qm]
(;W[rl]C[

:: as white I'd have an eye on the black moyo below and would try to play not that submissive (see variation).]
;B[rm];W[pm]C[

:: Actually this one helps black. Thanks, white! ;-)];B[ol]
;W[rk];B[pn]C[pajaro: Now white is quite safer, and I... well, did I get enough? I guess no.


:: this formation pumps power into the lower part of the board since it is quite thick. It's a bit cramped to the right, though.]
;W[om];B[nm];W[on];B[oo];W[jq]
(;B[lq]LB[nn:A]TR[fq]C[pajaro: The ladder has a very bad aji. I know I'm supposed to capture the sooner, but...


:: No 'but'. Capture now. If not, white can exploit it even more. Thank him for the power you gain! After capturing these stones you will no longer have to worry about the right side. You can fully concentrate on F3 and the like.
The power you get by capturing will shine over the whole board: into the center and even to the left since white has just few stones there. After S17 even the white group above could be squeezed out.
Due to this power the white stone will look quite lonely (see variation).]
;W[hq];B[fo];W[dq]C[

:: I guess what white wants here is to connect the stones to the right with the ones to the left...]
;B[fc]LB[cn:C][er:A][gr:B]TR[fo][fq]C[

:: ...I'd play one more move at the bottom - e.g. E2 to separate the groups fully and move on after that.
Perhaps G2 would be even better. To fully remove eyespace from white's group. The idea is to get these two stones moving. Now it is a bit of a drawback that you did not capture the ladder-stones.
But your own two stones will get stronger by squeezing white's two stones to the right..

There is another possibility by attacking the two stones to the left - e.g. via C6:
Let white connect but get some of the left side of the board in exchange.

The acutally played F17 looks good, of course, too.]
(;W[df];B[ic];W[dc];B[dk]TR[fo][fq]C[

:: This could be responsible for pressure on your two bottom stones. You will have to be careful with such moves!]
;W[dn]C[

:: white starts to put pressure on two weak groups.];B[dh];W[eh]
LB[ge:A][in:B]C[

:: for White:
:: this is not a good move by white, making contact. Better to stay away like she did with D6. Putting pressure on the two black stones and reducing black's moyo to the top. Maybe G15.
It would also be possible for white to play below. Maybe this is even a better idea. Drawing the two lone stones into the center with - say - J6.
After exchanges around D/E12 this will get harder.];B[eg]C[

:: Just now this seems to be the wrong side to me. This group of yours is not that strong and the two stones at the bottom are even weaker. Later, if they should get in trouble, it is better to have a strong group here.

So watch for the right direction. This works out fine for you. This time.]
;W[dg];B[ei];W[fh];B[ch];W[ff];B[fi];W[fg]C[

:: well done!];B[cm];W[cn];B[bf]TR[eg]C[pajaro: Necessary?


:: what for?
white's group surely lives since the captured stone. At least it has quite enough room to live.  So this move is just to reduce territory.]

(;W[fd]TR[ff][fg][fh]C[

:: this seems to be no good move. Better to make the group live for sure. The stones around F13 already build a wall pointing towards the right side. F16 seems to serve the same purpose, since there will be no real damage to the 3rd-line stones of black emerging from that move.  Conclusion: play as in the variation (just to give an idea).]
;B[gc];W[be]C[
:: so this move played immediatelly is better than F16 first.]
;B[fm]TR[gm]C[pajaro: After not answering to W B15, I think I should not have played B14. Right?


:: Depends, see there.  F7 is quite important now. A very good move. Perhaps one line to the right will put more pressure on the two stones. The group around D9 lives and don't has to be connected...]
;W[bg]
(;B[cg]LB[bh:A]C[

:: better not. stay away a bit with A and keep sente (hopefully. But B14 must be something worth to white why else should she play B13? :-))]
;W[cf];B[bh];W[lp];B[nn]C[

:: well seen. Just - the white group at the bottom now gets eyespace :-(]
;W[mq];B[kq];W[kp];B[mp]LB[io:A]C[

:: I see you like cutting. Don't cut at 'every' opportunity!  Since you have your power there maybe it is better to play from the other side (A). If you want to play here.]
;W[mr];B[nq];W[mo]C[

:: That's why the cut is not that good.];B[np];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl]
C[

:: I think pushing just once would be enough for white here.]
;B[bk];W[ho]
(;B[go]C[pajaro: I tend to not play defensive moves like this one. It usually gives me a lot of trouble later, but, is it really necessary?


:: It seems so. See variations.]
(;W[hp]C[

:: Too submissive?];B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[kn];B[lm];W[dr]C[

:: Why this? To me it seems there are bigger plays on the board - like playing at the top.
This is not a urgent move, either.];B[nr];W[lr]LB[kr:A]C[

:: Playing at A reduces the number of ko-threats arise from a ladder.

Though not you made this move remember to make (defensive-) moves that create least number of ko-threats.]
;B[eb];W[db];B[ld];W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[ph];W[qh]LB[oh:A]C[

:: Again, white is too submissive. Seems like A would work better.]
;B[qi]
(;W[qj]TR[rb]C[

::Since white invested S18 it seems to me that white could play different here. See variations.]
;B[pi];W[ri];B[qg];W[rh];B[pg];W[rg]LB[rf:A];B[qf];W[re]LB[rf:A]
;B[rf];W[pe];B[se];W[pc];B[pb];W[od];B[ob]
(;W[nd];B[mc];W[sd];B[sf]C[

:: Right. Keep the two white groups disconnected.];W[nf];B[nh]
;W[nj];B[lh];W[lf];B[mj];W[nk];B[mk];W[mi]
(;B[mh]LB[ni:A]C[

:: I feel that the move in the variation is nicer and more skillfull.]
;W[ni];B[jh]LB[li:A][lj:B]C[

:: This move has to be made since the ladder starting with B after black bended with A does not work for black.
So it seems like the ladder in the variation to node 123 is better.]
;W[jf];B[mf]C[

:: No. Why?
This is few points since either white connect its right group to the left or lives autonomously.]

[ik][hl][il]C[pajaro: Actually, that group couldn't die. There were many friendly groups to link. What could I have done instead?


:: The territorys are quite settled in this phase of the game. And you are right with the possibilities to link that group.

I marked the biggest endgame-moves I could find. In the order A-G.
Starting with F they are no sente-moves, though. (And C is not really, too)

There will be not much territory around the squares, though.]

C[pajaro: B mistake...];W[ed]C[pajaro: ... and also W. I played E17 because I thougth  That would gave me  E16 in sente. But I think it doesn't work. But W thougth it would :)
