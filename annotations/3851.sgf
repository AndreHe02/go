C[Review for white. (Zilly)

White, in the fuseki, exhibited a territory oriented, possibly somewhat envious style. A series of strong moves in the middle game turned it into a success. We will discuss the importance of strength in the fuseki, and the balance between the 3rd and the 4th line.

Hi, this was a game I played on KGS. I am White. I can't exactly understand why I lost the game (except the last part where I made a mistake that killed a group of mine, but even without that, Black was leading).

I would especially like comments on some moves in the opening, which I consider the wrong direction.

Thanks.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[hc];B[fe];W[df];B[db]
;W[cc];B[fg];W[dh];B[fq];W[kc]C[<sestir> L17 is a good move because although 9 stones have been played on the top side, it is not settled. Black has no eye-space and white is weaker but not dead.

After wL17, it is not hard to imagine black's four stones becoming heavy, so black's strategy will be constrained until he has found a way to ensure life for his worm.

<Zilly> Since Black ignored his group on the top, I decided to strengthen my single stone. Bad idea?]
;B[qo];W[iq]C[<sestir> This move gives white another weak group. In general, it is not good to play a stone which is allready in a pincer, when it is your opponent's turn to move.

All black has to do is jump to F5.]
(;B[cq]C[<sestir> This is also ok.]
(;W[dq]C[<Zilly> Wrong direction for blocking? I played this because I reasoned that with the pincer 2 spaces away, Black wouldn't be confined in the corner.

<sestir> Indeed, it is harder but he would be, sort of, almost confined. ;) See variations.

I believe C4 would have worked better.];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er]
;B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[<sestir> At this point, it is urgent for white to help L17.]

(;W[qj];B[nc];W[lq]C[<Zilly> Wrong direction perhaps? I was thinking of playing W R7, B M3, inducing White to defend with something like J5.

<sestir> M3 is a big move and probably the right direction. You would normally want J3 on the 4th line but since black L3 is too good to allow, I agree with M3.]
;B[hp];W[fr]C[<sestir> You can try some advanced tricks but make your groups strong first.]

(;B[hq];W[hr];B[ip];W[jq];B[im];W[qf]C[<sestir> Smells like overplay.]
;B[ne];W[pd]C[<Zilly> Is this move bad? I don't really see the point of this move..

<sestir> hehe ... moves are bad if they do not serve their purpose. In case they do not even have a purpose, it is clearly not the moves that are bad ...]
;B[pc];W[pe];B[qc]SQ[ph]C[<sestir> Now, it is urgent for white to play Q12 or so.]

(;W[gj]C[<Zilly> Could I have confined (and possibly killed) Black with F11? I didn't consider it during the game...

<sestir> Confined, yes. Killed, I think it ends up in a ko where black has more local threats, but it takes someone stronger than me to read it.

It could be worth trying against a 9k. =)];B[ei];W[di];B[ej]

;B[ge];W[he];B[ib];W[jb];B[pk]C[<Zilly> These types of moves annoy me a lot. I don't really see how to respond properly. Is it a mistake on my part?

<sestir> Usually, connecting is right when the cut is sente like this. To be annoyed is probably a mistake. Annoyed players are more likely to screw up in the middlegame, than those that enjoy the numerous reading-challenges that arise in the late middlegame and early endgame.

If you feel annoyed or impatient, I can recommend annoying back at your opponent by spending two minutes counting the score. I count b+8 here.]
;W[pj];B[qk];W[ol];B[pm];W[pl];B[ql];W[rm]C[<sestir> ... so it is even now ...]
;B[rl];W[ok]C[<End of review.>

- Main points:

   1) In the fuseki, try to make your groups strong rather than trying to play everywhere on the board. It is hard to play against someone who does not have any weak groups.

   2) Do not play a pincer if your pincer-stone will come under attack immediately.

   3) Do not feel annoyed.

   4) Read 1) again. I know you understood the first time but it is important and has to be your main concern in the fuseki. Strength is meassured as a combination of eye-space, connection, influence, thickness, liberties and the absence of forcing moves, including peeps.
