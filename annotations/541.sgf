;B[cp];W[pd];B[pp];W[ce];B[ec]C[B should have D17 or C17.];W[dc]
C[The way to look at it is that: If W had D17 already, would B-E17?  Certainly not; K17/K16 will be the move here...  Thus, E17 is questionable.]
;B[ed];W[dd];B[ic]C[B should E15.  The hane is too big to be allowed.  The usual sequence is that B-E15, W-D14/C13, BK17/K16.  If...  B-E15, W-K17, B should C14 -- at this moment, W could only B14, B-D15, W-B15, B-C13 -- B is safe and sound plus, seal W in the corner.  If W resists B C14 by playing at D14, B-D15 -- either C16 take the corner or D13 ladder (favor to B at Q4).  These are the reasons that E15 is OK before J17.]
;W[ep]C[Note that if W-E14, B couldn't F15 cause W could F16 right away...]
;B[gp];W[dm];B[do];W[eo];B[dn];W[en];B[em]C[B ought to C7.  Either side of B (C4 & G4) are not strong enough to support the cut. If B is afraid of G4 being attacked, the pincer should be made at H4 to start with.]
;W[cm];B[dp];W[eq];B[dq];W[gn];B[ip];W[dk];B[fl]C[F7 is the move, threat F6 and also allow F9 later.]
;W[gm]C[If W-F7 then G8, W'd be in a much better shape then B.]
;B[gl];W[in];B[di]C[An overplay by B; should J8 to force W-L6 B-L4 exchange -- then D11 would be a good move.  Also note that if B had E15, B-D11 is much more powerful -- after B-J11/W-L6/B-L4 exchange, of course.]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[fj];B[il];W[kn];B[kp];W[qn];B[on]C[Nice.];W[km]
;B[pm]C[B-L8, keep up the attack.  B will have the W-N6, B-N4 exchange, W is still under attack, and R6 is not alive for sure yet.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[or];B[pq];W[pr];B[nq]C[Why not B-R2?  B-R2, W-S3, B-S2, W-S4, B-S5 -- W is dead.  By trying to live P2, W would strength the sorunding B -- which leads to a more power attack against L6 group; and it's not very desirable.]
;W[rq];B[rp]C[Still, B-L8.  W is alive in corner already.  Connecting S3 with R6 is a YOSE move -- so does S4.  B's target -- L6 -- still out there at large, and that's where the focus should be.]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[kk];B[hi]C[Maybe B-K8, then B-J10 is better?  The link of B-H11 to either side (E11 & G8) is weak...]
;W[hj];B[gj];W[hk];B[hl];W[gk];B[gi];W[fi];B[fh];W[eh];B[fg]
;W[dh];B[ci]C[B-J10 -- connect J8 to the H11 and hence keep the pressure on L6 group.  The age is bad at the right hand side, but it doesn't mean that it will necessarily cause any problem.]
;W[ch];B[ij];W[ik];B[fk]C[B-R9!!  B-R9, W-F9, B-R7, W-L8, then B-R10 -- W has to take care of L6 before it had chance to go back to the right side.  E7 is the cutting stone -- no way B sould give it up for any reason now -- or should have C7 instead to begin with.]
;W[jk];B[ck];W[dl];B[bh];W[bg];B[bj];W[bn];B[bo];W[bl];B[cg]
;W[dg];B[cf];W[df];B[bf];W[be];B[ag]C[B-E7 is lost.  W made quite a few nice move during the battle.]
;W[qm];B[ql];W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[qj];W[rj];B[ri];W[sn];B[sj]
C[B-T3 then B-R12.  B-T3 forces the live of the corner (W gote) and prevent the pass of W-T4.  B-R12 supports B-O17 later and perhaps B could get some territory at center.  The idea is to let W live and claim the loss back later by playing B-E15 + B-P16 combo -- aiming at the center to make a moyo.]
;W[sk];B[rm];W[si];B[sm];W[rh];B[rn];W[qi]C[No idea what either side was doing...]
;B[lc]C[B-O17 -- nothing to afraid of -- all B's groups are safe and sound so, no worry of been attacked.]
;W[ii];B[ih];W[ji];B[jh];W[pc];B[bk]C[B-E15 then B-L11.  Afterwards, it should be more clear that why B-O16 is better than B-O17 -- the moyo is formed and more solid using O16 than O17.]

;B[kg];W[lh];B[lg];W[mg];B[li]C[???  L11 is dead, why pull it out??  B has cutting spots at H12 & K13; B ought to worry about them more than M11.]
;W[mh];B[mj];W[pj];B[pk]C[B-P9 is the move to make the shape.]

;B[nl];C[In conclusion: B should improve the gloval view of the game and try to idedtify heavy/light stones.  Also, don't be greety -- stones are put on board in turns, B & W have equal right unless someone makes stupid mistakes.  There is a big difference between 'attack' and 'kill' -- once you realize it, you're two stone stronger.  Good luck.]
