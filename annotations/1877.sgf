AB[pd][dp][pp]C[At the outset I would say that you play quite well.  One thing I notice, however, is that you like to fight a little too much. I say this because in several key places, where you could just play very simply and shut down the opponent's possibilities, you take complicated paths that lead into unnecessary struggle, or you fight where you simply don't need to.  This is typical of players around your strength.  You are developing fighting power now.  You have definite tactical ideas.  But you over apply them, fighting even when it's bad for you.

I think this will be a major area of growth.  I'll touch on it more.  Here goes.]
;W[dc]LB[ce:A][de:B]TR[pp][pd][dp]C[
In this case you have star points all around.  Therefore you are more or less committed to an influence style opening.

Therefore, I think B is better.  It's more influence oriented, more consistent.  And it will be harder for white to get superior influence in this corner--which I think he would like to in order to offset yours.]
;B[ce]TR[de][ee][fd]C[For example, white can play at any of those points, and get better influence than you, which would offset your starpoints somewhat. The recommended high approach limits this.

For more info, see Kajiwara's   The Direction of Play.];W[dh]
;B[fe];W[gc];B[dj];W[fq];B[jq]LB[dn:A]TR[cn]C[Maybe a little loose here.   I'm not sure.  My feeling is that this gives white lots of ways to create confusion.  When, for example, he plays at the marked spot, the whole left side is quite even.  His tactical superiority should give him a good result across the entire left side of the board.  

I think I would play A.  If he adds anothe rstone in the lower left, I'd resolve in sente and go for a sanrensai on the right side.]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]LB[dm:A][em:B]TR[dh]C[I know you that you have the more severe move at A available, but in this case I think B works better, even it it is milder, because white's cut later at b is working too well given that he already has a sentry (marked stone) out there and that black is quite thin above.  Once white cuts, his sentry comes to life. In other words the joseki you chose is creating problems up the left side.

Playing at B gives white more latitude on the left, but the lower right side is really your interest here.]

;B[po];W[rn];B[ol]TR[mq]C[Don't think this was a good choice because white gets the corner and sente, plus his stone is far enough away from the wall that with sente he should be able to settle one way or another in your moyo]
;W[ip];B[kp]LB[dj:A][dp:B][ce:C]TR[em]C[Upto this point I felt that my game is going well. There are 4 weak white groups.

Yes, but don't forget that the A, B, and C groups are not all that settled just yet, so even though they are not in trouble, white can  lean against them a bit and in the process settle. Your moyo strategy cannot work well if your enclosing shapes have significant weakenesses that can be used as leverage for white to make sabaki.]
;W[el]C[See... 

with this one move, the lower left corner and left side aji come to life.]
;B[gn];W[ek];B[ej];W[bl];B[dk];W[ci];B[bk];W[ko];B[lp];W[lo]

(;B[mo]C[This move is a mistake.  I don't understand why you don't simply extend.

See var];W[mp]C[I decided to accept this cut when I played M4. From now on there's a fight that was not quite to my liking.

Again, just a simple extension would have kept things simple and left all the problems with white.  Now you are sharing the problems.  White will use those problems as leverage.  Sure he'll have to give something up fighting as he is in your influence, but he'll get something easily now.]

;B[np];W[is]TR[jn][jo]C[I think this ko was the best I could do on the lower edge.

This is a huge victory for white....
He is  established in both lower corners.  He got you into a complicated reading battle where his three stone strength advantage could shine, and he used it to capture some key stones in the middle of your moyo, and now he has got you in a ko fight for your life, again, in the middle of your moyo.    I say your life cause white can afford to lose this ko. 

My advise to you is not this move or that move, it's more attitudinal: slow your game down, just a tad.  Play a style slightly more BALANCED towards solidity and defence.  I am confident that you will grow this way, because as it stands you are giving the opponent too many targets.]
;B[ns];W[jr];B[ln];W[kn];B[ir];W[gk]C[Now I think I should have given up the ko.]

[gp][gq][jo][jn][cm][dm][bk][ck][dk][dj][ej]C[All the black marked stones are either captured our at risk. Too many weaknesses.  Too many targets.  Especially given white's tactical advantage with stronger reading skills.]

[hl][il][hm][gm][gn][fn][en][eo][dp][dq][eq][er][gp][gq]C[I know white makes a mistake later on and you spring them, but, really, they should die now.  White pulls quite a bit ahead and is thick to the centre, which negates your advantage on the upper right.  So my feeling is white should win as it stands.]

He is first trying to limit the outward territory you are going to get when he goes after the corner in a few moves time.]
;B[ng];W[mi];B[oh];W[oi];B[pi];W[pj];B[qj];W[qi];B[ph]C[now white should strike in the corner.]
;W[qk];B[rj];W[pk];B[rk];W[pl]MA[qd]C[That is white's mistake.  It serves little purpose but to lose sente.  He should go for the corner at x]

Perhaps he treated it a kikashi but forgot.

It's like a hockey game in the third period with 10 minutes left on the clock and you're 3 goals up.  Stop fighting.  Go to defense.  Run down the clock.]

When you are ahead, give the other guy points here and there to reduce complication.  Now he's going to start poking around, probing your weaknesses, looking for an upset. Why risk a chance that you'll make a mistake, or that he'll find something?

By way of the Hockey analogy, even though you are ahead and the clock is almost out, you have pulled your goalie in order to be able to bring another forward out to beat him by even more. No team takes a risk like that when they are ahead, but only when they are behind and desperate.]

Summary Statement:
As players approach about 5k, they develop some real tactical ability, and feeling their growing power they tend to flex it whenever they can.  The mind set is:  "if I'm pushing him around, it's got to be good right?"  Not necessarily!  Ever had an experience where you felt you won ALL the battles but lost the war?  I have. Fact is, not all battles are worth fighting.  Many are best side stepped, even if it means giving up a few points.  You could have sidestepped the huge one in the lower side by simply extending--just a simple move.  You didn't and really lost there when the large snake-like group became captured.  Ok... you sprung it out.  And you could have avoided the upper right  invasion by not fighting a one point ko.   You were way ahead.  You just had to give him the 1 point (1/2 point really) --but you wanted to fight it out.

Advice:  As you advance from this level, you have to do two main things.  First,  pump up your reading ability.  Do lots and lots of tsume-go.  I recommend hundreds of problems a week.  The Korean sets on GOBASE.org is excellent.  I do this myself.  This will help you be better able to decide whether you can win a fight before you enter into it, and help you handle it better when you make a mistake, or have no choice but to fight.  Second you can develop a stronger sense of balance.  This you get by playing lots of games, pref. with stronger players, and getting pointers.

 My main pointer to you is try to play a little more solid--especially in handi games as black.  Don't fight too early.  Avoid fights that aren't clearly even or good for you.  Play a little more solid.  It seems slow, but it's very powerful.  Let the other guy over-extend;  let the other guy try to take too much, too early; let the other guy fight where he shouldn't.  You'll get nice opportunities to counter attack from a position of strength and flexibility.

Hope this is helpful.

(;B[mp]C[This is really a nice move, even if it is dull and obvious. 

It's so solid that white has little to exploit.  You don't want to give him weaknesses to manipulate for shape.  In other words... if he has no leverage, then it will be harder to pry open a crack in your moyo in which to live.  Your weak points are his leverage. So in allowing the cut you are offering him a huge lever.  Therefore, I think, believe it or not, that this simple extension is a much stronger attack than the move you actually made.  There's a stage you go through in go where you try to do too much with your stones; then, as you grow stronger still, you begin to reevaluate the worth of simple, solid moves.   Most times, I would say, a simple move is best.]
