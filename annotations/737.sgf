AB[pd][dp]C[bignose: This is a game played at our local club last night.  I was Black, and I felt I had the advantage for most of the game.  I'd like to think my yose play let me down, but I'm honest enough to realise my mistakes must have been much earlier.  I've spotted some of my mistakes, but I'd like the *real* ones to be pointed out to me :-)
----------

Hi bignose/Ben,

This was a good, solid game by black.  You're right the game was lost in yose, since black had a small lead going into the endgame.    Still, with a two-stone handicap, black should've had an easier time.  Especially concerning the thickness he got on the left and the bottom, these could've been put to better use.  Besides getting bigger territories more efficiently on the left and in the lower part of the board, black could've invaded or reduced white's top territory quite substantially.    There are no big mistakes through the game, but there does seem to be a lack of focus or what some call "whole-board vision."   If you try to think more about how your groups in different parts of the board can work together, the game can get more interesting.  This should not be hard to do, since you already seem to have a good awareness of the importance of "thickness".    And finally, learning to take a quick count sometime during the game is a good habit to develop.    Feel free to e-mail me if you have further questions.

Good luck in your future games!


Ken];W[pp];B[dc];W[de];B[ce];W[dd]C[This choice by white is questionable, since the usualy play would give him a thickness facing right.  But there's already the black stone at the 4-4 in the upper right corner, a white wall facing it wouldn't be very effective for building a moyo.]
;B[cd];W[ec];B[db]C[I don't think B8 is usually played.  D17 would be better.  It's simple and solid, which should be the kind of game you'd want to have, given the two-stone handicap.  Black D14 or c14 would lead to the long and complex "avalanche" josekis, which you might want to look up in a joseki book.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[ef]C[This is not good.  It pushes black out along the fourth line and gives white an outside wall with severe weaknesses left at E15-E16.]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[dh]C[Good.  Black is one step ahead of white and should keep going if white keeps pushing down below.]
;W[eb]
(;B[ch]C[I think black doesn't have to give up the corner here.  See variation.]
;W[cc];B[bg]C[Shoud B17 first.];W[cb];B[mc]LB[nq:a][qn:b]C[Another idea would be to play 'a' or 'b'.  White cannot expect much on top because of the cutting points at E15-16.  B20 shows good awareness of the potential power of thickness (on white's part here), but it is too conservative and a bit slow.  With 'a', black can aim for a two-wing on the left and the bottom;  with 'b', black can build up his own moyo on the right if white approaches Q16 from the left.]
;W[dn]
(;B[cl]LB[fq:a][fp:b]C[It is better to play F3 or F4.  B22 is too narrow an extension from black thickness on top.  I think I'd like to 'b' in this situation.  See variation.]
;W[cp]
(;B[dq]C[Black absolutely has to play C3 here.];W[cq]
(;B[fp]C[What is black trying to accomplish here?  The next few moves are rather inconsistent and seem to lack a clear purpose.    Black should aim to develop the bottom right now.  The left is too small, especially after black has already made many moves there and have a solid territory.

Therefore, B26 should push up to D5.];W[dl];B[cm];W[cn];B[dm]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eo]C[B34 at F3 is the proper, solid move.]
;W[en];B[em];W[fn]C[You can see now that B34 does not stop white from coming out into the open.  Moreover, it's as if black just played a move against a solid white wall!]
;B[go];W[do];B[gn];W[eq];B[ep];W[fq];B[gq];W[fr];B[nq]C[Black should play the forcing move at G2 first, to seal off the side.  But then again, white might not bother to save the three stones, since the corner is basically alive, and will likely play N3 instead.]
;W[np];B[mp];W[mo]
(;B[lo]C[This is an overplay.  See variation.];W[mq];B[lp];W[oq]
;B[nr];W[lr];B[no];W[op];B[mn];W[pn]C[White comes out much better in this exchange.  Black's capture of N5 stone means very little given the thickness he already has on the left side.  Black seems overconcentrated.]
;B[gr];W[es];B[mr]C[M3 would give black slightly more points, but that's really too small to play at this point.  a black extension to, say, R9 or even R8 right now is huge.]
;W[lq];B[kq];W[kr];B[jq];W[or];B[jr];W[ms];B[qj]C[Finally! :)]
;W[fm]
(;B[el]LB[hl:a][oj:b][nk:c]C[Building up the center with either 'a'-'c' is more urgent and works better with the thickness at bottom.  W27 stone is small.  Let it go, since black already has the left side after playing B28.]
;W[fl];B[ek];W[jc];B[pg]LB[je:a][id:b]C[Perhaps a better move now would be to 'a' or 'b'.  However white answers, black can look forward to cutting at E15 to make the B72-74 worth more.  B76 still leaves it open for white to invade at 3-3, so it's not very important right now.]

[dc][ea][fa][ga][ha][ia][ib][hb][gb][fb][fc][gc][hc][ic]C[Securing the corner with R17 is bigger.  Alternatively, black can immediately try to reduce white's top.

It is useful to get used to do a rough count from time to time during a game.  Let's do a rough count right now:
Black:
Lower: 13
Left:  25
Right and top: 19 (W might live in corner yet)
Captured: 1
Total:  58

White:
Top:  23
Lower right:  30
Lower left:  11
Captured: 1
Total:  65

Black is a little behind now but gets to play next.  So, if black plays R17 now, that'd give him an extra 15 points and a good lead (+8).

B80 is not too bad if it is followed up by cutting at E15.]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[hl];B[in]C[Too submissive!  Black can afford to play J8 here.  The bottom black group is thick and safe.]
;W[gk];B[gj]C[Still, R17 is more important.  But again, if black can follow this up with cutting at E15, that'll be really nice.]
;W[hj];B[gi];W[gg]
(;B[ol]C[Go back to our estimates from before.  Even if we grant black the 15 points in the upper right corner, white has now also gained another 15 points on top, so black is still somehow behind.  He therefore should do something more aggressive, like invading the top.  The defect in white's shape around E15 makes that possible.]

Thanks to white's gift in the center and his failure to take the upper right corner for himself, black now enjoys a good lead! :)]
