C[Ilya: Dear reviewer, thanks for the review in advance. I don't have specific questions about this game but if possible it would be helpful if you are able to identify main weakness in my play. I've left some comments on some moves.



Ilya Martynov (9k), played as black.

Review by John Rae

Overall I suggest black consider three learning points

1. Think more about the whole board
2. Place more value in sente
3. Most importantly do not try to kill things which are unlikely to die - preapre your position first.]

(;B[mo]C[JR Normally one would make sure this white stone was dead with a move here.


I suspect you are thinking this expands the black moyo.

However you need to consider whether, at some later stage, white will try to pull out this stone. See variations on white's next move.

Playing securely looks small but will help in the long run.]

(;W[lp]C[JR Black's last move left a weakness which I would expect white to exploit later in the game (Not now!)]
;B[co]C[JR:  Once you decided on making a bigger  moyo I'd keep on doing it.

When your  moyo is larger keep expanding.
If your moyo is smaller invade.];W[fp];B[cl];W[cj];B[cq];W[cr]

(;W[dp]C[JR:

I think white did well out of this sequence, although this move gave up sente

OK black gets a small live group, but it is  low. On the other hand white has a higher position and is well placed to keep pressing black lower.

White can look forward to expanding in a large way on the bottom - on both sides there is a fairly solid stone on the 4th line.

Black is going to have to invade or let white take a big territory.]

(;B[cc]C[JR: See variation on later moves where I explain why I think this was not the best move.

On the other hand why play in this corner at all? White sems to come out of it well-( if the lower left corner is to be expected).

Black has established a group splitting up white's moyo. Perhaps it is better to build the black moyo and wait to attack the white invasion which must follow.]

(;B[cb];W[dd]
(;B[dh]TR[mc][qc][qg][ki]C[Ilya: Probably a bad move which starts a sequence that ends with quite bad result for black: 1) it ends in gote 2) makes white group stronger. Would it be better to play a move enforcing black moyo instead? Like one of marked points? Or was it a time to consider an invasion on the bottom?

JR:  the bottom seems bigger if you are going to reduce];W[ch]

(;B[ef];W[de];B[fg]TR[bj][cj][dj]C[Ilya: Now I've got a wall facing my group on the left side.

JR: You also have a high wall facing towards the top right corner.

The key question for me  is whether your group in the bottom left is alive after white plays B2. It looks OK to me so things are not so bad.]

(;B[md]C[JR: Is thre a realistic chance to kill?

I don't think so. Therefore this stone is asking for trouble. I'd simple take sente to develop down right side or invade on the bottom]

;W[kg]C[JR: Do you see how your premature  attack has left black with a lot less on the side and white with a secure group?]

(;B[jf];W[kf]
(;B[if]C[JR:This gives up sente for no gain.

 I don't think you need to defend that stone. If you did, you should not have played K14.]

;W[ri];B[qi]LB[rf:A]C[Ilya: I guess simply playing A is better.

Yes - but even more than my previous comment - all this atttacking has forced white to develop thickness facing the centre AND reduced  the black territory on the side.

If white simply uses sente to secure territory on the bottom the game is reasonably even. I think black should have been well ahead.]

(;W[rj];B[rf];W[pj];B[rk];W[qj]TR[pj][rj]C[Ilya: I've just forced white to create another wall which faces not very strong group on the right side. Quite bad result.]
;B[nh]C[Ilya: Now I see that it was too deep and later white punishes this move.

JR: This white  group is very unlikely to die now so you are really doing harm to yourself. Look at the black group below - are you forcing white to attack it :)]

JR: This is very cautious by white. I would be thinking if the black group can be surrounded and killed - can I convert R5 into a dead shape inside black?]
