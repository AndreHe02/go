You choose a fuseki based on a moyo strategy.
The pb is that it involves difficult fights after invasions and mistakes in the fights generally implies a lost game. That what happened to you.
Nevertheless, playing moyo games, although difficult and risky, appears as a good mean to develop fighting ability and good direction of play.
See Takemiya games.

This game was played in the last round of the Nordic Championship 2000, my first tournament.

I'm quite satisfied with the beginning, but after my failing to kill the upper right group of white's (move 39), and definitely after my desperate attempt to reduce white's moyo (around move 59), the game is lost for me.

What could I've done? I find reducing enemy moyo's terribly hard. Here, I'm just helping w to make a huge lower side territory.

39 : The first really bad move.
Playing S9 is enough.

It does not help you (your group is alive and M17 weakens your K16 stone.

The good way is still K15 (W should also have played this move).
It's a key point in the game.

B is behind now in the game,
so B has to try something,
eg attacking L15 group
But the moves 55 57 make now diificult to attack.
These could be the really losing moves
C6 is correct but the situation requires something more ambitious]
