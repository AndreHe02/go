C[buckyyowza: Hi Bill!  Comments by Mark Fyffe... mostly for white, but often black fails to punish, so I go into detail on that as well :-)]

;B[md];W[jd];B[pe];W[oe];B[od]C[buckyyowza: bad for black, see var.]

(;W[re]LB[nd:A]C[buckyyowza: should be o16, s15 is ajikeshi.]
;B[rf];W[rd]C[buckyyowza: now if black plays o15, white is in bad shape.]

(;W[pc]LB[ob:A]C[buckyyowza: q17 does not work, should be at p18. see var.]
;B[ob];W[pb]LB[ne:A]C[buckyyowza: wrong side.  now black gets out and leaves white with bad aji.  do not forget the weakness at o15, see var on w32 and w42.]

(;W[ra]LB[dj:A]TR[kc][kd][ke][jf]C[buckyyowza: overplay.  white is alive without S19.  Instead, white should tenuki and take a big point that puts pressure on black's weak dragon, like D10.]
;B[lg];W[lf];B[lh];W[kf];B[je];W[jh];B[jp];W[cj]LB[pn:A]TR[lh]
[mh][jp]C[buckyyowza: bad timing, it is better to start something in the lower right after black's thick plays.  If black gets Q6, for example, it will be difficult to win even after all the victories on the upper side.]
;B[df];W[fc];B[cm];W[cg]LB[dh:A]TR[jh][cj]C[buckyyowza: the lower shoulder hit is almost always bad.  this helps black cut your groups and leaves your stones weaker.  it is better to play closer to the K12 stone, at D12 for example.]
;B[cf];W[jj]LB[bd:A]TR[cf][df]C[buckyyowza: you are allowing black to live in the upper left too easy.  These stones should be a difficult fight for black, try instead to fortify the corner like with B16.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[bc];W[cb]LB[bb:A]C[buckyyowza: B18 is more common, and probably a bit better.]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[dg];W[ch]C[buckyyowza: white should be more careful through here... see comments on the next 20 moves.]
;B[dh];W[bl]LB[di:A]TR[jh][jj]C[buckyyowza: D11 keeps black's thickness down and helps connect to the center stones.]
;B[dj];W[dk];B[ek];W[be]LB[di:A]C[buckyyowza: this steals an eye, but white is still vulnerable on the left side.  D11 is better to play first.]
;B[bf];W[ce];B[de];W[cd];B[ae]
(;W[ej]C[buckyyowza: this is like driving a nail in your own coffin :-)  After black D11, white will need to protect against a cut at C11, and the E10 stone will be bad aji. D8 is more important now to keep white's stones alive.]

(;W[fk]LB[fl:A]C[buckyyowza: F8 is a little cleaner, as it leaves less good aji for black.]
;B[hk];W[hg]TR[ek]C[buckyyowza: now black can escape, see var.]

(;B[gf];W[gg];B[hl];W[fp]LB[fn:A]TR[ek]C[buckyyowza: white is creating more problems, better to play F6 first and ensure that you do not get cut by e9.]

;W[iq];B[ql]LB[ee:B][ie:C][kn:A]C[buckyyowza: white is lucky :-)  after having the lower side handed to him on a platter, it will be much easier to counter the lower right.  Also, even though white's big group on the left is dead, it also has a lot of good aji, especially if white gets to play at L6 to keep pressure on black's big dragon.  In all, where white was losing before now the game is close.  Also, white can score big at E15 or J15 anytime, although the lower right is more interesting right now.]

[ml][nl][rl][gm][hm][im][so][sq][rr][ss]C[buckyyowza: an interesting game.  Both players have decent strategic play, although black's opening was a bit stronger because of the lower right moyo.  Both players have good ideas, but not quite the strength in followthrough to carry these ideas out.  So this game was defined by some large scale fighting.  In all, I cannot offer any overall advice other than more careful reading.  Thanks for the chance to look over your game, it is always a pleasure.]
