C[Thanks a lot for reviewing this game!

In this game, I played white.

This is representative of most of my games. I feel that I play too defensively, and in trying to protect my measly territory, I end up helping my opponent build up even more territory :-(

R> That's seems to be because, you aren't trying to take sente, or when you do get it you don't make the best of it.

Even though I won by 1.5 points (thanks to Komi), I'm very dissatisfied with my play, but I have no idea on what to do to improve :-(

R> I've prefixed all of my comments with "R>"];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[cn]C[R> According to many books on opening theory. Ideally B wants to make his stones work together.

Out of 231 pro games that started like this 220 of them played either F3 or Q10, only 9 of them played this way.]
;W[fq];B[cj];W[jq]C[R> You're concentrating too much on one side here, that stone at the top looks awfuly lonely.

You need to realise that C4-F3 are comfy for now, and b6-c10 are a little wide, you can invade at C8.

I would prefer to play something like C13, K16, R10, or O17]

(;B[mq]C[R> B answered this so the move wasn't wasted ... but see variation]
;W[cg]C[R> Looks like you spotted that C13 is a big point];B[mc]
;W[qj]C[R> Nice, good point];B[qm];W[qf];B[qe]C[R> Not too good by B he's helping you out]
;W[pf];B[od]C[R> Unnecessary, B has obviously read "Get Strong at Gote" ;-)]
;W[gc];B[ei];W[cp]C[Aristy: Was this the right time to try to protect the bottom left corner? Or should I have extended to k17 on the top?

R> The two points look pretty even in terms of points to me. I like this move best though, because it takes territory, and threatens to invade at C8.]
;B[qh]LB[ph:A][rh:B]C[R> A and B are the obvious choices.];W[ph]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[re]
(;W[qg]C[R> Not a good move - makes an empty triangle];B[rk]

(;W[rj];B[pk]
(;W[pj]C[Aristy: It seems to me that this sequence benefited black greatly. He ended up with a huge corner on the right top and bottom. Should I have played this differently?

R> Well your stones live in this situation - so it's not too bad a situation, and you can always play C8 next :-)

B's situation at the bottom isn't that big, you can play L5, or P9 to reduce. You might even get away with a 3-3 invaision :-) (You shouldn't get away with one)]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[nj]
(;W[nf]C[R> Not strictly necessary, your stones have penty of eye shape]
;B[ni];W[nh];B[lo]C[R> Now L5 looses it's power. I feel you should have played L5 instead of O14.]

(;W[qq]C[Aristy: I couldn't stand the thought of black having such large territory on the bottom right, so I decided to invade at 3,3 and gut out some of it. Is this sensible?

R> Not really, but it's worth a go. You shouldn't be jealous of your opponent's territory. How about that C8 invaision?

NB: C8 might not live, but you should get something out of it.

In order to play this invaision, it should come down to a ko - see variation, so having a few ko threats available wouldn't hurt before trying this invaision]

;B[qn];W[rp];B[ps];W[qs];B[so];W[sp];B[rn];W[sr]C[Aristy: I feel unhappy with this sequence. I get the corner, but it's such a small life :-(

R> Better that than a big death :-). I don't think you should have been able to live in the corner - so you shouldn't feel unhappy, you've just deprived B of 21 points, scored 5 points for your self. Which is a 26 point gain who would be unhappy with that - it's like catching 13 stones of your opponent's - would you be happy in that situation?]
;B[kd]
(;W[jd]C[R> Not sure I like this move, K17 would threaten to strike at L16's underbelly, whilst K16 just encourages B to make L16 stronger.]
;B[jc];W[ic];B[je];W[id];B[kc];W[ke]C[Aristy: My plan on cutting here was to connect to my bottom group, and at the same time, keep black from connecting into a large framework on the top]

(;B[le]C[R> Strange move for B - "automatic atari", better to play K14.]
;W[kf];B[if];W[lf];B[ne];W[me];B[nd];W[ld]C[This whole sequence B let you get away with too much]
;B[lc];W[md];B[li]
(;W[lh]C[Aristy: Hmm, it looks like I'm helping black to consolidate his gains on the bottom, but how else can I play here?

R> Well L5 a lot earlier would have been good, but failing that how about K5? or C8? or J13? or all three ;-)]
;B[ki];W[kh];B[ih];W[lm]C[Aristy: I felt that this was about as deep as I could go into black's area to reduce it. But I'm not sure if this was the correct move at the correct time

R> A bit too deep really, B could and should just chase it towards L11 etc...]

(;B[kn];W[km]C[This is good for you, B shouldn't have touched the M7 stone]

;B[ii];W[jh];B[hj];W[fg];B[gi];W[eg];B[mg];W[mh]C[Aristy: This was a tough choice. Either I stopped black from connecting to his group, which would mean the destruction of anything I had here, or allowed him to convert my upper stones into a heavy lump

R> This is the right choice I think, your stones are alive and N13 instantly dies .]

;W[ns];B[ms];W[ps];B[op];W[ks];B[ls];W[js];B[ep];W[eq]C[Aristy: I was ambivalent about this move. On one hand, I had to protect from black's invasion, but on the other, I kept waiting for an opportunity to play at L4 and put some pressure on black's stones. This opportunity never came :-(

R> B chose his timing well then, how much pressure would L4 really be?]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[do];W[co];B[ib];W[hb];B[jb];W[cc]C[R> Another -1 point gote move - play L4 instead of this if you want.]
;B[kp]
(;W[eh]LB[of:C][mi:B][qk:A][fn:D]C[R> ? This is a move on a neutral point, it doesn't affect the score, P14, N11

There are much bigger points on the board

A Is worth one point in sente as B will probably answer it.
B Is worth about a point in sente.
C Is Black's sente and worth about 2 points for B.
D Is sente, and worth a point.

If you get all of these points you are 5 points better off. See alternative sequence]
;B[fi];W[hd];B[qk]C[R> B is playing fairly well in the endgame, you need to use opportunities like R9 to take points away from B]
;W[sk];B[sl];W[sj]C[So this sequence ends in gote for you - B takes more points awya from you]
;B[of];W[ng];B[og];W[pe]C[R> Interesting, but I think P12 is safer]
;B[oe];W[oh];B[qc]C[R> B doesn't need this , and should press at R12 instead]

[ah:A][mi:F][hk:E][am:B][fn:D]TR[ga][ag][ao]SQ[ja][mj][al][eo]
C[R> Now you can gain some points, any of A through F look good

Squares mark potential points for B, and triangles are potential points for W.

So there are 7 points up for grabs, and you need to get the most of these points]

(;W[qi]C[R> ! Not necessary - another -1 point gote move, and B takes more points off of you

You really need to read and see if you need to play a move inside your own territory or not.]
;B[gm]LB[ia:C][ah:B][mi:E][am:A][fn:D]C[R> Well this doesn't really demand an answer, so any of A through E]
;W[gn]C[R> This is a neutral point it doesn't affect the score,and it doesn't _demand_ an answer.

So 0 points in gote not good];B[an]C[R> and B takes one of your points away]
;W[ao];B[am]LB[ia:B][ah:A][mi:C][fn:D]C[R> Now it's your turn to take a point, see how the points are running out?

any of A through D. C or D would be my favourite as you can play C and be sure B will answer, then you can take _another_ point too]
;W[fn];B[eo]LB[ia:B][ah:A][mi:C]C[R> One of A through C];W[ik]
LB[ah:A]C[R> OK Fair enough this takeas a point away from Black, but doesn't demand an answer like 'A' would]
;B[ij]TR[ga][ha][ia][ja][ag][ah][aj]C[R> Here is a good opportunity to understand the power of sente.

Which order do you play J19 and A12 in? Can you play both?

Consider the marked points, now move on a few moves]
(;W[ia]C[R> this is how you played];B[ja];W[ha];B[ah];W[ag]
C[Here you don't get A12 and J19 - see variation];B[aj]TR[ga]
[ha][ia][ja][ag][ah][ai]C[R> In this situation you have one of those points]
;W[fo]LB[mi:A]C[R>Only one big point left at 'A']
(;B[em]C[R> If B doesn't play here then you only win by 0.5 points]
;W[jo];B[jn];W[im]C[R> This move isn't urgent, but there is a bad cut at D3 which you cover much later.]
;B[jk]C[R> B should play at N11instead of here];W[mi];B[mj]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[he];B[fh];W[hf];B[hg];W[dq]C[R> What if B played here instead of H13?]

[mp][np][lq][oq][lr][mr]C[R> So here you win by 1.5 points which is a narrow margin. Black could have easily stolen this win from you.

In this game you gave a lot of points away in the endgame, so if you want to improve ou need to improve your endgame, and thet means understanding the importance of "sente" and "gote".

In a few places you make un-necessary moves which loose you points (-1 point gote), which means that B has sente to take even more points off of you.

See the variation after move 174.

Also Sente and Gote apply throughout the game, so look at the earlier moves
such as at move 8.

Having the initiative (sente) is very important, because you get to take points away from your opponent. If you can keep sente whilst doing this then you can take even more points away from them.

For this reason you need to do the following in your games: -

1) If your opponent has made a move - ask do you really 
     need to answer it?
2) If you are about to make a move - does your opponent 
     need to answer it?
  2a) If so, then is there a sequence involved, and who 
         plays last in the sequence?

Just these two things should if practiced help you to the next stage of your playing ability.

Hint: During the endgame, this is much easier to practice, so try it out in your next few games in the closing stages. Then try to start doing it earlier and earlier in your games.

When you've played a game - look at it afterwards - go back say 20 or 30 moves from the end, and examine your moves with the above checkpoints
in mind. See if you can come up with different orders which change
the score in your favour.])
