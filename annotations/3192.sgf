*Hi, 
you didn't ask me any question about the game so i'll comment it my way. 
hope it's alright.

I had put some suggestions for white as well, so that you know what to expect from white. 

in this game white didn't play much better than you at all.]

playing at A is one idea to go after white's thick group (white's f8 group still has no eyes). white wants to play at A himself. 

Attack a weak group to strengthen your positions and get sente to play somewhere else]

* i think black was better in the opening and played better until endgame (white had more control in end game) 
Midgame fighting is hit and miss for both, black missed a couple of chances.

both players doesn't like to keep their groups connected, which make things difficult. 

black is weak in life-and-death situations. i think you agree. :-)  Studying life-and-death problems help you get a sense of eye shape. good for killing and saving a group. 

hope my review was helpful. 
good luck.])
(;B[sp];W[rs];B[ps];W[qs];B[qr]))
(;B[jk];W[gh];B[hj]C[black has rescued M15 group and still gets white's center. 

black can win.]))
(;B[af]))
(;B[ie]C[now there is a good chance that black can kill white's center group. 

white is going to have a hard time making 2 eyes.

as far as i can see, white is dead and black should win the game. 

or at best white might live in gote and it's still a close game.  (Do you know the concept of gote and sente ? if not , look them up on the web) 

white has to answer so you can do whatever you wanted to do with k18 later.  
Or later play endgame move like R18, which threatens to kill white O17 group by cutting white off at n17. White has to answer. 
Then black plays S5 next. This should look promising for black. 
or play N17 directly if you r sure u can kill. 

Go is a game of choices and exchanges between two people if u are flexible and have a better control of the game. you'll come out ahead.]
