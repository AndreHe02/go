(;B[ro]LB[jp:C][qp:A][nq:B]C[i believe this is wrong. better b O4 ?

KKMD: It may be a good idea to deprive white of eye space. You have to be careful, though, as white will have opportunities to complicate things in the corner. I give in variation an idea of what could happen if white plays immediately at A. Then again, it is better to play like this when black already has an extension around B or C.]

LB[mq:A]C[KKMD: You almost loose a move, white can't connect. Locally A is way better.]
;W[fq];B[ql]LB[ol:A]C[wrong too. b N3 better

KKMD: Agreed. Anyway, locally R8 is not he best either, since A simply captures these two white stones.]
;W[jp]LB[cc:A][ce:B][cp:C][hp:E][cq:D][hq:F][mq:G]C[now white ahead in territory

KKMD: I don't think you can point out more than 10 points of sure white (or black, for that matters) territory ; A,B,and so on, are weak points you can aim at. I can only see spheres of influence, and in my opinion black is not behind.]

(;B[rj]LB[qh:A]TR[pk][ql][no][oo][po][ro][np][pp][rp]C[b S10 too slow. b O14instead buidling at the top ?

KKMD: I think S10 is the right spirit. Deprive white of eye space, make it run and only then try, while attacking, to turn the top into territory. But S10 is too close to your other stones, you're already overconcentrated in this area, there's no need to add more. I give some variations I thought of after A.]

(;B[kc]LB[ld:A][me:B]C[is it the right direction ? the reasoning was the following : chasing both  white M17 and Q14 groups with black O16 group would lead to a fight favorable to black, which turned out to be wrong :-(

KKMD: You want to build outside strength in order to attack the Q14 group ? Then why not attach right now at A (see variation) ? L17 feels bad because it seems to say that black actually enjoys having his own forces separated by white, it is rarely a good idea.]
