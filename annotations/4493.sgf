C[Dear reviewer, Thank you very much for review!   ^_^

-----

Hello, I am Usagi on KGS. I am pleased to have been given this chance.

As an overall observation, you played well, but you are far too concerned with saving one or two stones! You could have taken control much earlier and entered the middlegame with a comfortable 10 or 20 point lead (see variations). 

Also, even in the middlegame, it seemed you missed a few golden opportunities to decisively win the game. For example, n8 should be at n5!

Enjoy the review.];B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[op];W[mq];B[qq]

;W[mr];B[no];W[mp]LB[jd:C][pj:F][qj:E][cn:B][on:A][fq:D]C[usagi: Good. So far, you have played very well. Your next move, at 'A' however, is too early (please see variation "Hua Yigang, 8p - Wang Jianhong, 8p, W+0.25 (Komi 2.75)
2nd Bawang, Stage 3, 1995-11-07").

It is not neccessary to protect this area right now.

Note that black A is not sente. B is sente, and is therefore good for black, better than A. Pros have also played C in this position, due to black controlling the lower right quadrant of the board, C also feels good here. D, E and F are also okay, although I do not like that style. I feel you should be active when possible. Here, I feel B is the correct move.

Please see the vartiation for an example.]
(;B[on]C[usagi: overconcentrated. White will now take a large point in the fuseki.]
;W[rr]C[usagi: In the opening one must tread lightly as if walking on eggshells.

Here white has threatened two stones. However, black has protected in the center with P6.

I think black should move at K16 now. If we were to follow the professional game from before, it does not look as if white would have a good continuation. After all, black P6 is a move the pros play later on - it makes sense that giving up those two black stones is now a good idea ( see var )]

(;B[rp];W[nc]C[Is o16 better than r14?

usagi: I think r14 is best.]
(;B[qf];W[pb]C[usagi: The key here is not to push white UP. White made a LOW move and you must force him to remain low. Watch how this is done at R17 (see var)]

(;B[lc]C[usagi: this might be a bad move. Consider your thickness! See variation where black moves r17 instead.]
;W[ne]LB[ng:1][og:2]C[what about A and B here?

usagi: The key is not to push white up. See variation where black moves r17 instead of m17.

But, to answer your question, 1 or 2 looks good. The key is that in doing so, you seem to have changed your plan of m17...]

C[usagi:  Considering what should have happened (see variations) this is a disaster, although it does have its merrits due to your thickness on the bottom right. Paramount is if white is silly enough to capture those 2 stones :) Then, black A almost wins the game for you.]
;W[sf]C[usagi: VERY SMALL. White should move C14 instead. Who cares about 2 stones?

This idea "who really cares about 2 measly stones" is the major problem in the opening for both players, like S2 and S4 moves, and here too. 

This is the most important thing you can learn from this game.]

(;B[gc]LB[cg:A][dj:B][jj:C]C[Is A better than G17?
With A i create big moyo, right?
I tought even  amove like B and C.
What about B and C instead of g17?



I have an other question:
How I coud approach D4?
Maybe I did a mistakle there, may you correct it?

usagi: c6 best, see the variation for black c6 instead of this move.]
;W[cj]C[usagi:  Not taking this point may be the losing move.
Your moyo has been deflated. You could press down at E10 but white has already made enough territory to compensate.

I would have to say G17 is korigatachi. Why consolidate when you can expand? Here, white expanded his own space while you contracted. That is why white was in the lead.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[dn]C[usagi: 
Well, it seems that the play here becomes chaotic.

At all times you must play simply and properly, and then you will not be bogged down in useless fighting.

the direction here is that white gor C10 which was against blacks plan. Both white and black played many small moves in the opening, and did not take sente or big fuseki points.

Good luck! I will have a look at the rest of the game and provide some variations or answer questions, but the bulk of the review stops here.]

Well, I finished with questions.
Thank you very much for review!

usagi: to answer, it seems that either A or j4 is just running away and not making any points. It would have been better to not have made this group :) see variation where black moves B or C instead.]

;W[ll];B[mm];W[lm];B[kq];W[nk]C[usagi: White has made a terrible mistake.]

(;B[ml]LB[mo:B]C[usagi: Oops!!! You missed out here. You should have cut at B! (see variation).

Never make this kind of mistake if you can help it. If you must, then you must play with more byo yomi time.]

(;B[kd]C[Another interesting option is the pincer, because you will naturally make territory on the right side, and it is difficult for white to fight or do a double approach because you also have a stone at D16.

Pushing white "up" here is the only bad thing I can think of about this move, but perhaps it makes good enough shape with D16 to make it OK.. White will certainly move o15, if white moves at R17 now he might as well resign.]
