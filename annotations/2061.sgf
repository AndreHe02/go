C[HI !
THANKS FOR REVIEWING MY GAME !
THIS WAS A COMPLEX GAME IN WHICH BOTH PLAYERS MADE MISTAKES, SO IT WAS QUITE AN EVEN FIGHT.
BLACK'S MISTAKES IN THE FUSEKI AND EARLY MIDDLEGAME LOST HIM TIME AND PUT HIM WAY BEHIND IN TERRITORY, BUT HE FOUND THE ENERGY TO FIGHT BACK ULTIMATELY.
AS BLACK WAS IN BYO-YOMI MOST OF THE GAME, HE DID NOT PLAY THE BEST MOVES OUT OF HIS STONES.
COULD YOU POINT OUT IN YOUR COMMENTS WHICH MOVES COULD HAVE REVERSED THE STEAM OF THE GAME ?]

;B[ir];W[ip];B[kr]C[F2 WAS THE PROPER MOVE, WASN'T IT ?
IS K3 BETTER THAN L2 ?

RGW: Yes, it would be better for B to play F2 here to capture the two white stones and keep his own stones connected.  K3 is probably better than L2.]

TR[eq][fr][fq][fp][gp][dp]C[THIS WAS TOO EARLY I THINK.
THERE IS A WEAKNESS AT K2, WHICH MAKE ME THINK THAT L2 WAS BETTER AT K2 OR K3.
SHOULD I HAVE BEEN MORE PATIENT, OR DID I PLAY THE MOVES IN THE WRONG ORDER ?

RGW: Even if L2 were at K3, K2 would still work for W so that would not help B.  Yes, this is too early.  Since K2 captures the four B stones, B needs to secure them first, probably with a move at K3 since this would reduce the liberties of the three W stones.  If W then secures the corner, the marked B stones can then escape by attacking the three W stones.  Once B secures the stones on the H line, this move at C3 becomes deadly to W.]
;W[do]
(;B[jq]C[RGW: This is probably the best move for B.  B could make a trade (see the variation), but I don't think it is better for B.]
;W[eo];B[fn];W[ep];B[hn];W[jo]
(;B[mp]C[HOW IS N4 STONE ?
WHAT ABOUT M4, M5 ?
ANY OTHER MOVE ?

RGW: M4 looks more secure and puts more pressure on the W stones.  I think even L5 would work for B, but it could be dangerous.  (See variations.)]
;W[jm];B[mm]TR[fn][hn][fp][gp][eq][fq][fr]C[RGW: After the W move at K7, the marked B stones are looking very weak.  B needs to play somewhere around G8 before these stones get surrounded.]

;W[ek];B[fk];W[gl];B[in]C[WAS THIS BAD ?

RGW: I don't think this is bad.  It should make H8 or J8 more effective.]

[hn][in][gp][fp][eq][fq][fr]TR[ck][dk][ek][ej]C[WAS C8 BETTER ?
(WITH THE SECRET KNOWLEDGE THAT MY HIDDEN GOAL WAS D6 GROUP :) )

RGW: Your goal should have been saving the B stones marked with squares since, as I showed before, they could be captured by W if W plays at C7 first.  Since W failed to take advantage of this opportunity, either C7 or C8 for B saves the B stones by capturing the W stones marked with triangles.  The move at C7 is probably better since it does have an effect on the D6 W group, but it seems unlikely that those W stones can be captured.]

(;B[bm]TR[fl][gl][hl][hk][hj][hi][gj]C[RGW: B would like to play at G7 to keep the marked W stones separated, but this turns into a tricky fight for B and W.  (See variation.)]

(;B[bo]TR[dn][do][eo][ep][cp][dq][dr][ds][es][er][fs][gs][gr]
[gq]C[WERE C5 OR B4 BETTER ?

RGW: I think B5 is better since it gives B more liberties.  By attacking the marked W stones, B is in danger of losing his own stones.]
;W[bp];B[bq];W[cr];B[br];W[bs]C[WHAT ABOUT A2 HERE ?];B[co]
;W[dp];B[al]C[RGW: Yes, these are the W stones B needs to capture first.]
;W[mh]SQ[il][ij][jk][kk][ki]TR[hm][hn][in]C[I PLAYED QUITE BADLY IN THIS AREA

RGW: After W captured the three B stones marked marked with X's, the B stones marked with squares were weakened and could be attacked as W now does.]
;B[lj];W[mj]
(;B[lm]C[RGW: This move just helps W by forcing W to connect at M8. L8 at least has a chance of splitting the W stones.  (See variations.)  I don't see any good moves for B since there's not enough room for B to get two eyes and there is nowhere for B to run to.  M12 looks like the most interesting move to me, but I don't know that it will go anywhere.  B could sacrifice these stones and play perhaps at P8, but even this is unlikely to secure enough territory.]
;W[kl];B[mi];W[ni];B[li];W[nk];B[mf]C[RGW: This move is too far from the other B stones.  It would be more helpful at M13.]
;W[lg];B[oh];W[nh];B[of]TR[il][ij][jk][kk][lj][ki][li][mi]C[RGW: Giving up the marked B stones and grabbing territory could work, but W has too much territory at the top.  B needs to invade the top and secure the lower right corner.]
;W[ng];B[og];W[nf];B[kg]TR[il][ij][jk][kk][ki][li][mi][lj]C[RGW: The marked B stones are in even worse shape now that W has more stones in the area so this move is unlikely to help.]

RGW: I don't think so although B would have to be careful if he played elsewhere. (See Q17 variation for example.)  O7 would be more efficient than Q9.]

;W[jf];B[ig];W[jg]C[BLACK IS BEHIND, CAN HE SACRIFICE THE CENTER STONES TO INVADE THE UPPER EDGE ?

RGW: At this point, that is probably B's only hope because the top is too big to let W get it all.]

(;W[si]C[RGW: W seems to be ahead (not on the board, but because of captured stones) so this move is sufficient.  If W were behind, R12 would be better since it could kill this B group so maybe the move at T10 wasn't so bad after all.]

In any case, both B & W made a lot of mistakes, but your mistakes seemed to be more costly.  I know that playing in byo-yomi is difficult so this in not surprising.  Overall, however, not too bad for your current level of play.  Keep practicing and studying.]
