C[Dear reviewer,

Here's a game I played on KGS.  I was white.   Eventually it turns into a big fight which I win and he resigns.  Besides there probably being a countless number of errors made by both of us during the big fight which decided the game, I felt unsure about many of my moves before the fight began, mostly regarding whether I was playing the most important moves at the right time.

-Danny
I?ll try to see];B[pd]C[pinkFloyd7 [6k\]: aye
Danny [5k\]: hi];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]C[Thinking about the high-chinese opening]
;B[oj]C[perhaps a misclick :)];W[di]C[Got it];B[jp];W[jd]C[I wasn't sure whether it was better to play here or at K17.  With K16 I'm worried about an extension from his Q16 around N17 or M17, forcing me to protect my upper left or allowing him to crawl underneath - I decided to play K16 anyway.  Is this a stupid worry?

I?m not sure myself, but k16 looks better for building a moyo, which is the intention of the high chinese opening.]
;B[fq];W[nc]C[By ignoring his approach on my bottom left and attacking his upper right in the same way, I felt like I was eliminating the possibility of the extension that I was worried about.

good. but answering f3 would be also good.];B[de];W[qf];B[pf]
;W[pg];B[of]C[I thought this tsuke-nobi was an error for black because of my O17 stone.  I think it definitly turned out in my favor, but maybe that had nothing to do with O17.

this tsuke-nobi looks normal to me];W[qe];B[od]LB[qd:a][pe:b]
C[this is a bad move. a (r16) is the answer, if white tries to cut with b (q15) black would answer p16, w p15, b o16, w o15, b n17 and blacks territory is enough compensation for whites strength.]
;W[qd];B[og];W[ph]C[now white ist definetely leading];B[qc]
;W[pc]LB[oh:a]C[These was probably a little too aggressive... gave him a chance to attack my O17

before I saw your move, I myself  thaught about this cut. I would prefer a (p12) (more: I am sure, a would be better), but this way you?ll get the corner.]
;B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[ld]MA[dc][jd]C[so black has got a wall while you got a large corner and b makes such a tiny extension. very good for white. Bklack should use his strength by playing somewhere between the marked white stones.]
;W[lc]LB[fd:a][cd:b]C[why that? why start a fight near the opponents strength? a (f16) or b (c16) seems to me mandatory.]
;B[kc];W[jc]C[that?s an idea, but I would cut at l 16.];B[kd]
;W[kb];B[lb];W[jb];B[mc];W[fd]C[Is this move ok or is there something bigger or more urgent?  I'm looking to protect my upper left territory and put pressure on D15.


good move. it makes territory while attacking. imagine a black stone here]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[ch];W[ci];B[dh];W[ei];B[dn]C[I thought about my response to this move for a long time.]
;W[eo]LB[hq:a]C[I finally played here at E5, but felt very unsure about it.  Pincing at D8 seemed to overconcentrate my left side and abandon the corner... maybe the mistake was extending with E11 before?  should that move have been spent somewhere to prevent D6?

you?re right, d8 is out of question. if you feel weak here, leaning on the f3-stone would be the choice, but because of blacks weak upper left group the white d11-stones are strong, so your move e5 seems better to me, because it dont strengthen the black f3 stone. later you will have a good invasion point at a (h3).]
;B[en];W[fo]LB[fn:a][gp:b]C[I would hane at a (f6) but I am not sure. the f5 cut dont seems to be dangerous. white just answers with (f4 and b (g4)]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[do]LB[co:a][bp:b]C[a bad black move, has to be at a, c5, this way you get the atari at b (b4).]
;W[eq];B[fn];W[go];B[fl];W[cl]LB[eh:a]C[I liked how this turned out.  My left side group and lower corner group both seemed safe and his group in the middle looked heavy and in danger.

a good move, but i would prefer the e12-turn (a) first.];B[eh]
;W[fi]LB[gi:a]C[better jump at a (g11)];B[fh];W[gi];B[hm];W[bp]
LB[qq:a][nq:b][lq:c][qn:d][qj:e][io:f]C[I felt like there was probably a more urgent or bigger move somewhere else, but I wasn't sure where and for some reason i was really tempted to play here.

why not? this move secures a big corner and let the option to connect your d11-stones. good. other moves that come into my mind, are: a (3-3invasion) b, c, d, e, or f.]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[gc];W[gd];B[ec];W[fc]LB[ed:a]C[uups? why not a (e16). nothing will happen. e18 if you are unsure and dont want to risk anything.]
;B[db]C[Horrible misread on my behalf.  I think maybe F17 should have been at E18.

now black is back in the game. but white is still leading in my opinion]
;W[eb];B[dd];W[da];B[bi]LB[qj:a][in:b]C[Could black have done more damage to white on the top or was he right to move elsewhere?


he was right to play elsewhere, but a or b seem bigger to me. b is an urgent move.]
;W[bj];B[bh];W[nq]LB[io:a]C[I completely overlooked the cutpoint at C10 and didn't notice it until way later... luckily he didn't notice it before I did.

c10 is not so damaging. propably a (j5) would be more dangerous for black.]
;B[lq];W[qq]LB[pn:a]C[I think this turned out pretty bad.  Allowing him to cut down at Q3 and kill O3 gave him a lot of potential territory because of his M3, K4, Q4, Q3... what would have been better here?

what about a (q6) instead of r3? 
now you can see that o3 wasnt the best choice. the following sequence normally is sente for b and this is indeed not what white wants.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn];B[qo]C[a bad aji keshi move which eliminates the option of black s5 (for example if black has a stone on r8. r5 is not urgent because white would never play r5 himself before endgame.]
;W[ro];B[pn];W[qm];B[qj]LB[in:a][hp:b]C[a big move, but a (j6) or perhaps b (h4) are urgent.]
;W[pl];B[om];W[io]C[good!];B[jo];W[in];B[hq]C[Was this a good move for black or should have blocked me from getting into his big center with K7?  I have a hard time judging the values of moves.

h3 misses the point. blacks e6-group has no eyes and by attacking this group white will destroy blacks potential on the right side. Now you can see the importance of a black move around j5 instead of r10.]
;W[jm]LB[gk:a]C[i would play a (g9), cause it eliminates the c10 cut and  forces black to induce whites journey into the right side. but nevertheless the situation is not so good for black.]
;B[ik];W[jk]LB[ii:a]C[same comment as before: a (j11) seems better to me. now you strengthen black and your d11 group becomes weaker.]
;B[ii]LB[hj:a][il:b]C[doesn?t that leave a cut with white a and b?]
;W[hh];B[jj]LB[il:a]C[still there is the cut with a.];W[kk]
;B[kj];W[ek]C[Here is where I finally decide to cover my C10 cutpoint.


the cut was not interesting cause you could have cut.];B[bm]
C[black should eliminate the cut.];W[bl]C[... and white should cut.]
;B[cm]C[much to small. even if there is no cut.];W[jg]LB[ln:a]
[os:b]C[Let us count:
white : 8 points lower left + 10 lower right + 15 points upper right + 15 points upper left + 5 points left side = 53 points or more

black: 12 points upper left + 15 uppre side + 2 prisoners = no 30 points, so black needs almost 25 points on lowr side, which he cannot get if white plays a and b.

;W[il];B[jn];W[nk];B[km]C[I think this move saved me.  Could black kill white if he didn't start with L7?]
;W[jl];B[hl];W[ml];B[ol];W[oh];B[hg]C[I was anticipating this, but wasn't too worried about it because I felt that I could live with my white group on the left side... was this correct for me to think like this or was H13 a killer move?]
