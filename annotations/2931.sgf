General Comments:

To get stronger, a good way to practice on a 9x9 is to cut or seperate as many of your opponents groups as possible.  Throw in tesujis will often kill most small groups.  This is all good practice to learn how to live in many situations.
(see variatoin C at move 2)];B[gd]LB[dc:B][dd:E][ee:A][cf:D]
[cg:C][dg:F]C[A:  Although not really a bad move, it will be difficult to play on a 9x9 when played by white.

B: Peeps a small weakness in black's opening move.  G8 can by played as the follow up.

C, D or F: are strong corner moves, each with their own benifits.

E: is kinda big, but can come in handy,  Beware of a potential 3x3 invasion.]

(;W[ee]C[This is a difficult move ot play if you are playing white, since it does not make much territory.   As a beginner, I recommend staying with corner plays.
