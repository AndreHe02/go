C[Hi, I'm Stephan Carpenter, I play black in this game against the trial version of WinHonte. I haven't played online for some time, but those in my go club think I am around 9-kyu. Personally I don't know... I think my opening in particular tends to be weak. Although I won this game, a great many of the points seem to me to have come from tactical victories in positions where I didn't deserve them. I think I tend to bully tactically sometimes, especially when I find myself in an unfavorable position.

I have a hard time in particular seeing if a tactic I played out was actually good when I played it... Comments on this in particular would be helpful. Also sometimes it's a bad positional choice to win a few stones tactically, any examples of that would be appreciated.

I played the opening mostly by feel, but any comments on how I should play differently in general would be helpful.

I think my endgame is ok, but people who know better would probably disagree so feel free to comment. of course.

>Hi there. My comments will be designated with a ">" beforehand - I've left yours in so you can read over your questions.

>This was definitely an interesting game. You seem to think though your moves quite well.]

;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[qj];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]C[WH likes these sequences a lot. It is obsessive as black about defending the cut at R15 (by playing R14 immediately) but I try to put off defending it... is that reasonable early on, or is it just too problematic?

> I'd call it problematic. See, not protecting the cut means you're depending on a ladder... I'll show you what I mean.]
;B[ci]C[I felt white would make an extension toward this stone here, but he didn't..

> An extension is big, but not huge, I think. Extending to the bottom right is probably bigger, but my opening is a bit weak, so a stronger player may contest me on that.]

(;W[nq];B[oq];W[or];B[pr];W[op];B[pq];W[nr];B[oo]C[I also considered the cut at O4, but I felt I could turn around this stone, and cut white off and expand at the same time...

> Good plan. This works quite well with your other stones on the right. I'd say b is leading to this point.]
;W[np]
(;B[no]C[>Should be n6, I think.];W[mo];B[mn]C[I felt that my attacking possibilities from cutting at N4, would be better than his from cutting at Q5, so I could defend later.]
;W[lo];B[kq]C[I had some thought here that because of the cutting point at M4, I could squeeze out a meager base here in the fifth-line territory he was carving out, or perhaps escape with some portion of my attack group... I think this might be positionally bad, but I felt his territory was getting too big, so... Was this ok? What should I have done to keep his territory in check, or can I expand my territory faster?

>> Thus far, b is far ahead in terms of influence. Because b is ahead, invading was probably a bad idea. I would have either played M6 or defended the cut at q5. An extension to c8 would also be big.

>l3 just gives w a target to attack. If you don't absolutely have to jump into a deep invasion to get a chance at winning, then why do it? L3 is a heavy stone, and b will have its hands full defending it.]
;W[jp];B[lq];W[ln]C[It might not be super obvious, but I think he cannot let me cut like this.

>> W letting b cut is a very bad idea. W should connect and thus solidify a big side.]
;B[mp];W[db]C[This makes me wonder if I should have played in the corner instead of playing C11 earlier.

> C11 was a good move. W's offering you large influence in exchange for relatively small life in the corner. B should be dancing. Play right, and you'll get a nice, thick wall to dominate the rest of the game with.]
;B[eb];W[dc];B[ed];W[ce];B[df];W[bf];B[bg];W[be]C[I seem to have contained him... I didn't see it at the time, but my little stone around L17 looks to be a little weak...

>n7 is urgent, and L15 is also pretty urgent. N7 is what I would play - L17 isn't in dire straits yet.]
;B[dd]C[This move is trying to open up some tactical possibilities, but it seems a bit wasted now... Maybe I should have waited for the position to make something possible?

>d16 opens up ko threats, but at this stage, it's neither big nor urgent. n7 is the move to play right now, I think. W ataris and b's influence toward the right and centre will be severely damaged.]
;W[bb]C[Now it all looks solid.

> It is, I think. B has a ko threat at c18, but that's it.]
;B[cl]C[> N7 would have been better.];W[cn]
(;B[ir]C[Here I was trying to reduce the potential big framework that looks to be forming between A6 and M6, it helps that it looks like it helps my cut be successful, but when I play E7 later, it works so well, I think maybe I should have played that to begin with.

>N7 now. This is an endgame move, and you're still in middle game.]
;W[ih]C[How to answer this?

> You have some decent thickness to the top left. Push the w stone against the thickness and attack it while making profit on the right. Let w live small while you make big territory.]
;B[jj]C[This looks remarkably silly since it doesn't solidify territory, but I believe the idea was to solidify territory when the stone tries to run.

>Exactly the right thinking.];W[mm]C[>And there's the atari I was worried about.]
;B[nl]C[good?

> There's still some bad aji there, but I think this is a decent response. p8 may be a bit safer locally, but it would cause even more damage to the strength of the tengen stone. I'm not sure.]
;W[nn];B[on];W[me]C[In a moment here, I find myself in a tight spot on the right... Any ideas where I played poorly would be helpful.

>L15 would be a good idea now. L17 is now in urgent danger.]

(;B[jr];W[gr]C[> Again, L15.]
(;B[hr];W[hq]
(;B[gp]C[This is a bit of a questionable threat, the idea is not so much the cut at G3, but the play from above... I wonder if this is not a real threat and should be ignored(ish) with E7 or something.

> W should pincer at j17, so this should be at L15. Sorry to keep harping on it, but given the current board situation, it's the only move to me.]

>If w has a chance to play l4 and k3 later, then o1 would turn the situation into a 3-step ko, and b has fewer ko threats than w. Playing it safe was probably best.]
;W[dm];B[el];W[en];B[gm];W[hn];B[gn];W[hm];B[mi]C[Heh, that was still bothering me... Since whites stones were getting closer, that might have been a good thing...

;W[jb];B[kb];W[go];B[fo];W[ho];B[fn]C[I was a bit worried about G8 starting a battle in my territory which could be costly, but I think G9 would have worked well there.

C[I felt that this move was huge, and white should have definately connected here instead of whatever else.

> If this was a human opponent, I'd be asking why they didn't resign here.]
