C[Dakre: Hello... Thank you for taking the time and commenting on this game. I played white and i think i was ahead 'til the early middlegame but i did some serious mistakes which made it a close game and a win for black... some of them are already spotted but more severe are the ones, which are not... ;) thanks for helping me with them in advance... and feel free to comment on anything ;)

Comments: Andre Bergholz (2K, marked with AB)
AB: Ok, I'll try my very best... :-)];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ed]
;B[oc];W[qj];B[qh];W[qn];B[oo]LB[po:A]C[AB: A little strange..., Q5 would be more normal.]
;W[om];B[jq];W[kc];B[fq]C[AB: Seems a little too small for me. The upper left corner is most interesting.]
;W[fp];B[cj]C[AB: Ah, no, that is not possible. Black cannot ignore F4. White G3 would be too painful. Better not to play F3 in the first place, just C10 instead.]
;W[gq]C[AB: Very good!];B[dn];W[ce]LB[cc:A]C[AB: I have the impression that this is a mistake, because the corner is left open. The outside is already neutralized by the two black stones, so if Black now invades right away at C17, White will be left with very little. Taing the corner with C17 yourself would have been better.]
;B[cg]LB[cc:A]C[AB: Consequenly, I think this move is not that great and should be played at C17.]
;W[ke];B[kg]C[AB: Unfocused.];W[oh]LB[qq:A][rp:B]C[AB: Ok, but White does not really have worry about any Black mojo. Fixing the upper left corner is bigger. A move in the area of R3/S4 is also very big.]
;B[jo];W[rd];B[re];W[qe];B[pd];W[rf];B[rc];W[se]C[Dakre: probably something like Q14 would have been better?

AB: No, the move you played is the only move. If that move doesn't work, the problem is before. Here, it is afterwards.]
;B[pg];W[of];B[pi];W[pj];B[og]
(;W[qg]LB[rg:A]C[Dakre: I played this to secure the connection underneath at s12 and make it miai to connect to the left or the bottom while attacking... but sad that i forgot about this plan later :)

AB: Resisting (see variation) seems impossible. A Black atari at 'A' prevents the connection (variation after next move), but White can live in that case.]

(;B[nh]C[AB: Big.];W[oi];B[ni];W[nj];B[ph];W[eg]LB[oj:A][ng:B]
TR[nj]C[AB: A terrible mistake! Connecting at 'A' is absolutely necessary. With the connection you do not just save two stones, but the whole balance of power is completely different. With the two stones in place Black can be attacked, there is the aji around 'B'. Without it, Black is strong and White's position becomes thin, the marked stone serves no longer any purpose.]
;B[rh]C[AB: Risky, wants everything. Just take the two stones.]
;W[oe];B[oj]C[AB: Terrible for White.];W[rq];B[ok]C[AB: Black is clearly ahead now.]
;W[cl]C[AB: Good. But the right hand side is in trouble now.]
;B[dl]
(;W[dk]LB[dm:A]C[AB: In 99% of the cases it is better to wedge at 'A' first.]
;B[cm]
(;W[ck]LB[el:A]C[Dakre: i am not sure if this was the right time because it definetly weakened the corner :/

AB: Weakening the corner is unavoidable, it is the price of the invasion. Here, it was however better to atari at 'A' first as it is absolut sente. Later, Black can ignore the atari later, because you already gave in with C9. Good lesson about timing here.]
;B[bm];W[el]C[AB: Too late, though maybe Black should still answer, it is big.]
;B[em];W[ei];B[eq];W[dq]C[AB: A clear overplay. If Black E4 now, White will collapse.]

(;B[fm]LB[ep:A]C[AB: Weak, E4 is the only move. After E4 the game is over (see variations).]
;W[ep]C[Dakre: this made me feel better ;)

AB: Absolutely.];B[ek];W[dj]C[AB: Good answer.];B[fl]
(;W[bo]C[AB: Not so big as both Black and White are virtually alive. This was a good opportunity to fix something on the right hand side (see possible variations).]
;B[ld]C[Dakre: Did not see this before... probably i should have tried harder to save my ponuki :>]

(;W[kd]LB[nc:A]C[Dakre: i played this one :/

AB: This is important for your overall position. But it's true that the group on the right is in trouble now. I came up with another idea: the attachment at 'A' (see variation).]
;B[le]C[AB: Not really proper, but now I don't see any clear way to save the white stones (though it looks like there could be something, because they can almost make two eyes locally).]
;W[hf]LB[mb:A]C[Dakre: probably too defensive :/

AB: Yes, unnecessary, 'A' is much bigger and aims at saving the White group. Defending the right side is also more important.]
;B[mj]C[AB: Tiny. The white stone is completely uninteresting and Black is alive anyway.]
;W[hn]C[Dakre: Here i wanted to split the e7 and the k3 group to prepare an invasion in the n3 area or to take advantage of the almost dead d6 group... but black did not like this plan ^^

AB: It is true that Black's center influence is getting big, so reducing is good. But I don't see much prospects for an attack. On the contrary, White still needs to do something about the right hand side.]

(;B[rl]C[AB: Good. Maybe even a more severe attack is possible (see variation).]
;W[ql];B[rj];W[rm];B[pm]LB[rk:A]C[AB: Overplay, I think, Connecting at 'A' is better.]
;W[pl]LB[rk:A]C[AB: Just capture 'A'.];B[pn];W[rk]C[AB: Good, Black's attack was finally not very well executed.]
;B[hq];W[hl]LB[gr:A]C[AB: Answering at 'A' is big.];B[hj];W[gk]
C[AB: Risky, White's stones are weaker than Black's.]
(;B[go]LB[gp:A]C[AB: Better start with the atari at 'A' (see variation).]
;W[gn];B[fo];W[gp];B[ho];W[hp];B[io];W[iq]
(;B[lc]LB[fj:A]C[Dakre: seems bigger than j3

AB: Probably, but J3 is very big, too. In any case, I think White should save his centre group with 'A' first, and conversely, Black should play there as well.]
;W[km];B[mk]LB[fj:A]C[AB: Black seems to be obsessed by capturing the single white stone O10, which has virtually no strategic value. Big mistake again. Perfect opportunity to attack at 'A'.]
;W[kn]C[AB: White's centre group is still attackable.];B[cc]
C[AB: ...and of course the 3-3 invasion here is big.];W[dc]

(;B[db]LB[cd:A]C[AB: I think Black 'A' is better.];W[eb];B[bb]
;W[da];B[ca]LB[ea:A]C[Dakre: fight the ko? or is there another way to handle this?

AB: Well. Black is going to live no matter what, I suppose. Instead of fighting the ko you may connect at 'A' right away (see variation).]

(;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[ea];W[fb];B[lp]C[AB: Too lose, doesn't help against K2.]
;W[rb];B[sc];W[qb];B[qc];W[ob];B[nd];W[nb];B[lb]
(;W[kb]C[Dakre: i hate myself for this move :> should have saved the upper right...

AB: No, your move is ok, the upper right white group is dead anyway.]
;B[sb];W[mb];B[la];W[ra];B[pb];W[pa];B[fj]C[AB: Well, now the group in the upper right is a ko. But still this attacking move is probably better, one could say "Finally!"]
;W[ij]
(;B[bj]LB[gj:A]C[AB: Premature. The center attack is the important bit. Just connecting 'A' is good enough.]
;W[bl];B[fh];W[eh];B[fi];W[hi];B[di]C[AB: Black totally messes up this promising attack. In the end he looses both sides, unbelievable. White is the one who should be in trouble.]
;W[ej];B[dh];W[bh];B[fg];W[ff];B[df];W[ef];B[gj]LB[fk:A]C[Dakre: any chance for black to live on the left?

AB: Black must play 'A' here. No, the group on the left is dead.]
;W[fk];B[gl];W[hk];B[hg];W[ig];B[ii];W[hh]
(;B[ol]LB[ik:A]C[Dakre: and again a point i hate myself for :)) but you're always smarter ->after<- the game :>

AB: You have already been lucky as hell in this game. Besides, Black should not give up, he can start a new attack with 'A'.]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[qr];B[pr];W[js];B[ks];W[is];B[kr]LB[lr:A][ps:B]
C[AB: I'm not sure, but I think 'A' protects against the hane of 'B' as well.]
;W[ji]LB[ik:A]C[AB: Does not really protect against 'A'.];B[im]
LB[ik:A]C[AB: Too timid, 'A'!];W[hm];B[jm]LB[ik:A]C[AB: Encore :-).]
;W[kl]
(;B[jj]LB[ik:A]C[AB: 'A' still works (see variation).]
(;W[ih]C[Dakre: and a serious mistake again... this gave black the chance to cut and build big territory with it... probably the variation would have been better

AB: Yes, mistake. But as you saw, Black could have done better a long time ago.]
;B[ik]LB[jk:A]TR[kl][km][kn][om]MA[fk][gk][hk][hl][hm][hn][gn]
C[Dakre: i felt that the ko would be too big

AB: Oh, no. Once, Black gets to play 'A' all the triangularly marked stones are dead. Now that's big. When you play 'A' yourself, you save those stones, but lose the seven other stones. A better deal for sure (see variation).]

(;W[ii];B[jk];W[ki];B[qp];W[rp];B[qo];W[ro];B[ka];W[ib];B[ia]
;W[ha];B[kf]C[AB: Don't play J19 if you don't plan to connect it.]
;W[ja];B[jf];W[ie];B[je];W[jd]
(;B[bf]C[AB: Big mistake, hurts the corner and gains nothing. Just the simple endgame is good enough (see variation).]
;W[ad];B[ac]C[AB: Not possible. Must connect.];W[bc];B[fn];W[gg]
LB[ab:A]C[AB: Mistake. Killing the corner with 'A' is better. The value of the ko threat is about 26 points (the two groups of stones). The value of the corner is almost as big, plus White will get it in sente as Black has to follow up his threat.]
;B[bd]C[Dakre: and again i was too afraid of the ko giving life to the side when i loose :>]
;W[ae];B[bc];W[ri];B[rg];W[pc];B[gm]C[AB: There is no real ko here, as White connecting the ko is sente.]

(;W[gh]C[AB: Definately connect the ko (see variation).];B[pb]
;W[od]C[Dakre: i should have fighted the ko to at least get something to compensate that...

AB: Yes, you have to play more flexibly. You could have easily ignored the ko threat. The loss of the stones would have been more than compensated.]

AB: Well, most of these points were Black's privilege, so there is little you can do about that. Here, for example, Black can get even more in sente by playing 'A'.]

[rl][rn][rr][rs][sk][sl][sm][sn][so][sp][sq][ss]C[Dakre: close game ;) i'll never again be so generous in wasting single points... they can make you win the game :>

AB: They indeed can. However, I suggest you keep the big things in mind first. Black did deserve to win, because even thoug he made some tiny moves around the O10 stone and his attacks were not severe enough, he has a very solid style. You left your groups weak, especially the ones on the right and in the middle, so they were targets of attacks. So, also look after your own weak groups. Also, you could improve in the area of ko (that's difficult, I know). But Black was not afraid of kos, so you as the stronger player should not be either. You could have gained from both of the last two big kos, play more flexibly, don't cling on to every one of your stones. That is too greedy as approach. One cannot have everything, that is just plain impossible. Ok, if you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask me (Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com).]
