[MAFU\]
Hello! I'm very happy that you like to review my game. I (5k) was playing black against a stronger player. I guess he is around dan strength. The game was rather even, but my mistakes accumulated and he won with a nice lead.

*Hello, I'm the reviewer, all my comments are going to begin with an asterisk. This seemes to be quite a chaotic game, I hope I'll be able to pinpoint the important mistakes you have made.]
;B[oc];W[qd];B[qo]MA[qh][qi]C[* This is a nice strategy (have you been studying Shusaku's games?) because now Black's follow up move around X is both a pincer and an extension.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[pe];B[qi]MA[oq][qj]C[[MAFU\]
i think i cannot clean kill q3, so i played here to get territory, attack q15 and strengthen r5.

* I like this move, now if White continues at P3 this stone will form a good shape with the wall at the bottom. I think you might also consider playing it one line lower, at R10.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[cd]C[* White's playing chaotically, abandoning his stones in the middle of a sequence maybe in hopes of confusing the opponent.]
;B[nq]C[[MAFU\]
i think this is bigger than the empty corner or l17

* It's hard for me to say if it is bigger, but I definitely like this move - it's thick and certainly quite huge. Now the question is - if White doesn't respond and tenukies will you spend another move here to kill the corner? Obviously, it takes some courage for White not to respond here...]
;W[rp]C[[MAFU\]
is b s5 sente?

* Yes, a s far as my reading ability goes. Hence it's a must move, double sente.]

(;B[eq];W[ro]C[* Now, that's a pity White got here first and the first setback for Black]
;B[qn];W[rn];B[kc]MA[qm][qi][eq][nq]C[* You _must_ answer at R7. White is crawling on the 2nd line and helping you build strength that plays well with your E3 and R11 stones. With every move like S6 White gains 1 point and you gain so much power. Black deserves this power because of his thick, strong move of O3. It's so good for Black!

* After you tenuki the situation changes completely and the value of your previous moves at the bottom drops drastically.]
;W[qm]MA[qi]C[* Now R11 starts looking aloneish and your O3-R6 formation suddenly becomes cramped. This is very bad, I can't stress it enough.]
;B[ec]MA[qn][qo]C[mafutrct [-\]: sweet child in time *sing*

[MAFU\]
i am unsure about the health of r11. but i though this move is bigger

* You might consider helping R11. Notice that the importance of Black R5 and R6 has now almost comepletely disappeared and they should be treated very lightly.]
;W[df];B[do]C[[MAFU\]
should i have played around g16 instead?

* This irregular enclosure is not recommended as far as I know but it can't be considered a bad move. It's risky because it makes it easier for W to invade the corner and the bottom area is too big to be sure how much territory Black is going to have there.

* At the top, you could consider C17 instead of G16];W[er]
(;B[ch]C[[MAFU\]
i guess this was premature. answering the probing move seems more important

* Yes, especially that you can't hope to really hurt White at the top. Not answering the probe (which was BTW a bad move in my opinion, because it let's Black take a very big corner) is very bad.]
;W[fq];B[fe]C[[MAFU\]
since i did not see a good move in the lower left, i decided to continue the attack on c16 while building territoy on the top and building an anchor if r11 has to run

* I think that D3 at the bottom is still preferable. If I was to attack the corner, I'd first take White's base with C18. As you'll see later, F15 is quite a loose move and doesn't affect White much (and doesn't protect the top territory).]
;W[qg]C[mafutrct [-\]: oh


[MAFU\]
i thought f15 is quite sente, but white refused to answer

* It wasn't sente enough, apparently :)];B[pm]C[* I believe this is a bad approach, White's double hane in response is powerful. R11 should be treated a lot more lightly now, White has invested so many stones on the right side already that he begins to deserve to get it. Still, he can't catch it easily so you shouldn't worry much.

* Instead, D3 or continuing the attack in the top right seem better.]
;W[pl]C[[MAFU\]
i did not see this move. looks very nice for white

* Yes, now while attacking you position in the bottom right White gets the chance to attack R11 ona large scale.]
;B[om];W[ol];B[oi]MA[om][pm][qn][qo]C[* Now Black is forced to fight on two fronts, never a good idea. Note how bad the marked stones look, surrounded by White's and short of liberties and  how a White move around K3 begins to look dangerous for the whole O3 group.

* You should look at it like this: you started a struggle with Q7 and then you were forced to abandon it, leaving your stones cramped and ineffective. That's a sign that you shouldn't have been starting this fight in the first place. That's also what I meant when I said that R5 and R6 are to be treated lightly - they do nothing and lack liberties. You should be willing do dispose of such a burden.]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[lb];B[lc];W[nb];B[md];W[nc];B[nd];W[kb]C[Meepy [-\]: that was the best fuseki ever
mafutrct [-\]: it was fun^^


[MAFU\]
i thought this will is a mistake, but with r13 in place, this becomes reasonable.]
;B[ob];W[ma];B[oe];W[jc];B[rc]C[[MAFU\]
since white got k17, i wanted to get a good result on the right in exchange

* Yes, I like this move, White will be forced to struggle and probably strengthen your two stones below.]
;W[qc];B[qb];W[rd];B[rb];W[ri];B[rj];W[rh];B[qk];W[ql];B[pf]
;W[rf]C[* Q13 is a must, you connect your stones nicely and can swith to the left side. This whole sequence is a moderate success for Black, I guess, I still wouldn't have allowed White K17 though.]
;B[qe]C[[MAFU\]
i was going to kill, but i totally misread the semeai that follows the white cut at p16, so this move is just bad. should have been q13 i think]
;W[pd]C[mafutrct [-\]: reads: semeai, ko, death. no idea which order and for whom :D]
;B[qf];W[re];B[qh]C[* You should still play Q13 instead, this is very bad and is going to cause you a lot of trouble]
;W[pg];B[of];W[od]C[mafutrct [-\]: guess death for me
Meepy [-\]: meh, who needs reading

* Now, you can live at the top and be cut to pieces below, or connect below (with some bad aji left) and die at the top. It's hard to decide because with White K17 already in place your wall won't be very effective. The game already became very hard for Black.]
;B[og]C[Meepy [-\]: it'll get played out eventually :)
mafutrct [-\]: ......sure. by me  XD];W[ph];B[pi];W[pb]C[Meepy [-\]: this spot seemed kinda important]
;B[dr];W[fr];B[dq];W[iq];B[fp]C[* This move does nothing, L3 is much better]
;W[kr]C[* I'd play M3 instead];B[eg]MA[jc][ol]C[[MAFU\]
finally i was able to play here. i think this move was very big

* Yes, that's the natural follow-up to your previous moves in this corner. The centre looks promising for Black, unfortunately White K17 and P8 may make getting it difficult.]
;W[dc];B[eb]C[mafutrct [-\]: die!];W[ed]C[mafutrct [-\]: or at least live smaller]
;B[fd];W[db];B[jd]C[[MAFU\]
if w f17, is was going to sacrifice the 2 stones in sente];W[kd]
;B[ld];W[ke];B[je];W[kf];B[ic];W[jb];B[oh];W[rg];B[ig]C[[MAFU\]
i thinkblack should have attack on a bigger scale here, like j12 maybe

* Yes tt's hard to say, you could also try a move around L11. If  White gets out here the game's over for Black.]
;W[kh];B[kj]C[* That's good, White has to struggle now.];W[li]
;B[lj];W[ih];B[jg];W[jh];B[kg]MA[ij][lg]C[* M13 is better, it spoils White's shape and helps to protect the O15 cut. You could consider a move like J10 also.]
;W[lg];B[lf];W[mf];B[le];W[mi];B[mj];W[ij]MA[ne][nj]C[mafutrct [-\]: woops
mafutrct [-\]: phew


[MAFU\]
here i thought white is quite out, and i was going to try to gain territoy on the left

* It's a very, very hard game for Black now, White is quite safe and Black can be cut at O15 and O10 and the O3 stones don't look healthy either. The left side isn't going to be enough]
;B[gj];W[il]
(;B[km]C[[MAFU\]
n10 and o4 seemed a bit weak, so i added this move. i guess this was just hallucination.

* Not at all, reinforcing is necessary, see variation.];W[jn]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[ho];W[fm]C[[MAFU\]
i did not expect this move
i was going to force white to connect or to cut him if he doesnt. but this move kind of prevented all this

* White is complicating things, I'd play K7 as White, connecting safely and aiming at attacking. You have to cut and fight now]
;B[el];W[em];B[dm];W[dl];B[ek];W[dn];B[cm];W[cn];B[cl];W[eo]
;B[co];W[ep]C[[MAFU\]
i did not expect this move. i thought white will play b6 instead

* The game's over, I think you last chance was to fight after White F7. White's safe and you still have groups to settle in the centre. Not to mention that you're behind territorially.]
;B[bn];W[nm];B[en];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[dn];W[gm];B[mg]C[[MAFU\]
i dont remember why i played this. looks very small and bad

* Yes, White misses an opportunity]
(;W[kp]C[* Cut instead];B[mn]C[mafutrct [-\]: hm lol
mafutrct [-\]: :D];W[nr];B[ll]C[[MAFU\]
i guess this is the vital point. if white played here instead of o2, i am reading 2 gote eyes and a ko at o2 for 1 additional eye, so b alive in ko. is this correct?

* It seems that White might be able to kill without ko if he plays M8 instead of O2, but the variations are complicated, ko is definitely possible]

i guess h12 is bigger

* I don't think so, White B13 is more that 10 points in sente]
;W[po];B[on];W[hh];B[gg];W[rl]C[[MAFU\]
this white move was not needed, right?

after the game i realized the g5 would have worked. too bad :(

* Yes, but my count says you'd still lose the game by 6.5 points]
;W[hq];B[tt];W[tt]C[mafutrct [-\]: thx
Meepy [-\]: thanks



[MAFU\]
well, white won by 25.5 since white was a few stones stronger, i was happy with this result.

i think my fuseki and yose were ok, but i lost many points in the figths in the upper right and the bottom mid. is this correct?

Thank you again for looking at the game!

* The biggest mistakes in your game were, I believe, letting White get R7 and failing to play Q13. After the struggle in the upper right the game was already very hard for Black. Also, the Q7 hane was a mistake in direction and got your bottom group into trouble, it barely stayed alive later. Also, in the upper left corner you spent 2 more moves than White and then he lived with a big corner anyway, something must've gone wrong with this strategy.

* You tenukied too often in crucial moments and it seemed that your game was quite chaotic and lacked consistency. You also missed the opportunity to fight back when White made the strange move of F7

* Overall, it seems that White "deserved" to win, being a couple of stones stronger, still, you can learn a lot from your mistakes :)

* Thank you for reading and good luck!])
