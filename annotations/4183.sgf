C[This was one of my most interesting games to date.  I thought I was doing pretty well.  At g6 I was thinking that my opponent had made a very weak group and so decided to attack.  I was pretty sure the double atari at H4 made that a failed attempt.  Later, I tried for a cut by starting a ko battle at h5 which turned out much better than I thought it would.

Still, his lower group was well connected so I pretty much gave up on capturing it.  As the game wore on he gained a huge amount of territory in the center and he killed my corner group, so I was falling behind.  Then my opponent made a huge mistake by playing at d7 instead of d8.  He basically invited me to have a ko battle.  At first niether of us realized just how important this ko battle was, but it dawned on me finally that winning it could win me the entire game, which it did.

The thing is, the only reason I one was because of that ko battle.  I need help improving my middle game and just tips on how to make my play more solid in general.]

;W[dp];B[dj]C[I won't say too much about the opening because you've asked me to focus on the middle and because as a middle-kyu player I'm hardly an expert on fuseki.

This move seems to be focusing on the left side.  I may have been inclined to play either the corner enclosure at e17 or something around j16 for a Chinese style opening.

Even if you make an enclosure, you still basically have sente.]

[gq][cr][er][fr][gr]C[I have a problem with a tenuki here.  The shape that black has made in the bottom left seems very incomplete.  There are many ways white can cut these stones to pieces.  

Some ways are better than others, but I believe white can split black by playing any of the squared points.  (Various examples are played out in the variations.]

(;B[pj]TR[jd]C[This doesn't seem very important at this point...there is a weakness at the top.

White can split the black stones at the top by playing between them...I think instead, black should play to connect those stones.  I would probably play k16.  It strengthens the black group.  And by doing that, it attacks both the o16 stones and the e16 stones.]

(;B[cm]TR[nq]C[This leaves a big weakness behind....in most cases you'd want to play something like n3 here, unless there is something that's even more important....

In any case, attacking white here is probably not the best idea.

Two problems:
1.  The same weaknesses at the bottom....if you're going to squeeze white against the bottom, the bottom needs to be solid.

2. If you really want to hurt white, you don't touch him, just squeeze.

TR[gp][cq][fq][dr]SQ[kb][hc][lc][gd]C[Take a look at the weak stones I talked about at the bottom....triangled.

Do they look anything like the squared stones at the top?

These unconnected diagonal stones leaning on enemy strength is a problem in this game...just like at the bottom, white has many ways to pick on these stones.

So at this point, even though black has more real territory, he also has a number of weaknesses that white can exploit in order to make up the difference.]

(;B[fh]LB[kd:A][le:B]C[This move doesn't really help either of black's biggest weaknesses, the group at the top, or the cutting points in the bottom group.

Rather than playing on the left, black may want to consider strengthening his weak group at the top with A or B, both of which constitute an attack on white's stones around o18.  

This is another case in this game where all black has to do to keep pressure on white is tend to his own safety.

He can still kill the group on the left.  He can also pick  on the group at the top.

Black is still ahead in real territory, but has many weaknesses that white can utilize.

A will kill the side group.
BCDE are all different ways to attack the group at the top.
F attacks the weakness left behind by black when he tenuki'd after white Q2
G will create another set of weak stone leaning.

Look at the variations to see many ways white can narrow black's lead.]

In closing, black took a lot of what looked like territory early in the game, but left many weaknesses behind.  By taking a few moves to consolidate his own territory and make it safe, he would have won the game easily.  As it is, it was only a misplay by white late in the game that allowed black to live.

So in answer to your opening question, I would say you may want to consider playing more defensively for a time...really consider whether a group is safe to leave behind or whether it needs another stone to be safe.  You tenuki'd many times in this game away from a group that still needed help.  In most cases your groups could have been safe with just one more move at a key moment, thus saving you the headache of white attacking them later.

Even if you're overly defensive for a little while, it may be good for you to try that style for a while and then reapproach a balance between tenuki and defense.]
