C[Hello! MY KGS username is Meso (2kyu) and I'll do the review for your match. First of all, I'm terrible at French so I have to write the review in English.

I'll try to be as neutral as possible, answer the questions you wrote and also make my own comments.]

(;W[qo]C[& Usually White invade aroud R10, but I don't like it look too easy for black (see variation)

Yes. The variation feels bad for White. Playing at R10 is small for White. It only helps Black to grow the lead.]
;B[qk]LB[pk:A]C[is it right place or better R8 ?

I think the pincer/extention is at the right place. It could also be at A. Black seems to have gotten a comfortable start for the game.]
;W[qq]LB[no:A][oo:B][op:C]C[is it right answer for W?

I would jump towards the center with A, B or C if I were White. It doesnt mean that the marked stone would be bad.]
;B[qr];W[pp]
(;B[rq]C[It might be better for B just to extend at A. With S3 Black is too concentrated to the corner. 

(see variation)];W[oq];B[qp];W[pr];B[qq];W[op]C[&what about P4 ? Black got a small solide corner so white has to got some thickness. but with P4 black can easily invade the bottom and all white thinckness will get wasted . All this is probable because R5 move I suppose.

P4 is the right move for W here.];B[iq]
(;W[kq]C[&wrong direction no ? (see variation)


No. This is the right direction. (see var.)

It is very important to create safe bases for your every group in fuseki. In that way this is better. 

If you have no weak groups when the game enters to the middle game, you have much beter chances of winning the match.]
;B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[cn];B[fc]
(;W[fd]C[we both think this is right answer for White to F17. Is it the better one ?

&so F17 is probably a mistake, do u agree ?

I think the move at F16 gives Black good chances to create a great moyo to the right side (see var.)

I think W should make a tight pincer (var.)];B[gd];W[fe]
(;B[ec];W[dc];B[jd]C[Here I chose 4rth line instead o 3rd (K17) because of shimari on upper right corner. Is that right ?

The 4th line is correct. Playing an extra stone on the 3rd line would make Blacks position too low.

The 4th line gives better chance for moyo.];W[cg]C[is it right place or D14, D13 better ?

D14 seems better than C13];B[ok]C[this began a moyo tactic. Is it all right ? (not too slow?)

&look soft no ? Is omewhere around L5 better ?

P9 is a good move for moyo. Without a strong right side creating moyo would be pointless.]
;W[fn]LB[ge:A][en:B]C[& I like this one :)

A is very big move for both sides. It create a magnificent moyo for Black and playing there W can create a moyo and reduces the size of the black moyo.

F6 is an unique move, it's quite a loose move, giving Black a chance to attack and cut White in two.. I'd prefer B to it.]
;B[jj]LB[ge:A]C[this continue moyo tactic (At least I got one) is it alla right

The move around center is Big for black. If black got to play at A now, he would win for sure]
;W[er]LB[ko:A]C[A is more essential. The White group is surrounded by Black influece and it isn't perfectly safe. After A White would also have better chances to attack the Black group.]
;B[io]C[here I prefer trying to escape than making a base... not sure it was good.

I think this move is the only move, it would be helpless trying to live small. It is better to jump towards the center.]

White cannot make any big invation moves here so A or B would be O.K.]
;W[mi]C[&So I move here

This will be cut];B[lj];W[oi]TR[mi]C[is it right to ignore the peep ?

&I hate peep... when I'm not the one doing it :), so usually I try to resist

The peep is effective, if played correctly, black can get the whole moyo 

I think White's plan is to fight and creat two eyes in Black's moyo. It is a risky plan, almost a sure suicide.]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[nk];W[ll];B[nh]C[is that best continuation ?]
;W[li]C[White'd be dead...];B[ni]C[isn't L10 better ?

..if Black played L10 or L11. L10 is a must for Black. now white can invade and destroy a big part of black's moyo.]
;W[kj];B[oj];W[lk];B[nj]LB[lg:A]C[is it right to connect. Black can take back one stone and anyway White is connected.

Black shouldn't connect, it does him no good. He should've played a keima at A, getting at least a lead in territory.]
;W[ki]C[&look very good for black....];B[ig];W[ge];B[hd]
(;W[ih]C[isn't White M14 better ?

It's OK to attack Black stones 

but it might be beter to invade at first (M14) if black answer to it, White can attack Black's stones to the right.

If Black ignores White's M14, his territory will be greatly decreased. (var.)]
;B[hh];W[jh];B[hf]LB[gg:A][gi:B]TR[ig][hh]C[I don t think it s a good way to connect. If I played H13 here... (see end of comment on move 103)

[lf]C[is snap back too small ?

It's ok to snap. After the move White must save his/her stones (triangle stones). if black manages capturing these stones his moyo grows big.]
;W[mg];B[ng]C[what is better O13 or G12 ? or else ?

G12 is much bigger the marked white stones are in bad shape, so not playing O13 wouldn't be so bad.

Note: F12 works also];W[gi]LB[gh:A][hi:B]C[sure this is big move

Pushing through at A is big for Black., it's more essential than connecting with B.]

This is odd. Capturing with P2 is better. P2 isn't the biggest move at the moment, but Q1 just feels wrong. 

Black should save the capturing later (there isn't any danger in the Q2-stone)]

[ss]C[any other comments ?

Black got the lead in the very beginning on the right side. The formation black created with his/her three first moves is a difficult one for the opponent to answer. it's certain that the game ill be decided with moyos after that.

The game was decided in the center when black cut the white invading stones. But through many mistakes White got the chance to make it close again. In the end (with komi 6.5) Black would've won by 0.5 point. Very close game!]

Black is in no great danger because of the marked space. He/she can easily escape towards the center.
