C[Gnoll [27k\]: hi
HikaruSama [24k?\]: hi


I play many pointless moves that result in dead groups, try to save dead groups, and don't think enough. Please be patient with my bad playing.

As a few beginning comments I would like to say:
Take some time and learn a few opening moves and their meanings.  It will allow you to deal with nonstandard opening moves in a positive way.  Also on the same idea, make sure you know what your opening moves mean before you play them that way you can play the rest of the game accordingly.  I would recommend doing some life and death problems online for free.  www.gobase.org has a daily one that you can do (as well as a lot more).  This will help you to learn to read ahead and visualize moves to come and think about your move before you play it.  And one problem a day doesn't take much time for the good benefits.
Also I must say that I am not the greatest, if I say something and someone else has better input please feel free to correct me.  We are all learning and I will not take offense at being wrong.  Make sure to tell both Gnoll and I if you do find something better.  Or if, Gnoll, you find something through someone else or have any questions, please feel free to email me: wardjm@gmail.com]
;B[pc];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[eo]C[What is a good way to handle this?

When you play D3, you have my variation in mind as an ideal placement.  If you're opponent allows you to take it, do so.]

C[is S19 more important here?
S19 is extremely important.  If black were to play there next, then you lost everything you just worked for and black gained the corner and influence towards the top and right.  You end up with a little floating group that isn't doing much right now.]

So as a few ending comments:
Keep in mind how each of your moves will get you more territory and worry a little less about surviving and killing.  They will take care of themselves if you are securing territory.  Take a moment to look at the whole board status and see if any corners are left uncontrolled.  It is probably a good idea to play there if they are open.  Also take the time to evaluate your estimated territory compared to your opponents.  If ahead, play it safe (but not too safe).  If behind, go ahead and take some risks and use that time to learn what you can and cannot get away with.]
