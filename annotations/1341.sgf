C[
To Reviewer,

Thanks very much for looking over my game. I am especially interested in improving my opening since t hat is the part of the game I am having the most difficulty with.

Regards,

LB[dq:A][cj:B]C[Did White block in the correct direction? I  believe so because blocking the other way  would have made h3 over concentrated.

white should block at A.....
by the way,if white have stone at B ...white  can block in this direction<c4>]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[go]
(;B[bp]C[Was B4 necessary? Was it bad  because it  strengthened White?

it's not necessary....black should  play this  move in the middle game...not in  the opening
this move is helping white
...see the variation];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]
(;B[ci]LB[fc:A]C[As Black I felt the need to  counteract white's  wall - a move here (or a little  closer to the top)  by white would have been too  good to allow.  Is this correct thinking?

i think it's not good because white  have very very strong wall in the  lower left
A is better
..see the variation];W[cg];B[cl]C[black is weak because it's near  the white's wall too much]

yes];B[eh];W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[cj];W[fj];B[dh];W[bh];B[gi];W[gj]

no ...because black can got the moyo]
(;B[gd]LB[ji:.][qe:B][gd:0]C[This seemed awfully slow to me in reviewing  the game. Where could black have played  more powerfully? I was afraid of the cut at this  juncture, severing my left and top apart.

it's too slow ..i think B is very great move
