C[Hello,



I took black in this game. It was a head-ache inducing game, because my playing style is large territories and whole-board attacking/ large fighting. Everything in this game just felt solid, and I'm not really strong enough to handle the endgames of these types of games. But since I need to play this way anyways, I'm hoping for some tips on better shape, direction of play, and large endgame, or anything else that might come up.



Please excuse a couple of strange spots, I sometimes have trouble getting all the moves in exactly the right order when recording.



I guess that overall, I just feel somewhat uneasy playing this type of game, and having a good review will definitely help me improve.  Thanks for your comments.

;W[no];B[fq]C[I'm not very sure what I should do here. Should I play the big point at p16? Is there a better point to enter?

 

klin: Where to play depends on your style and idea.  Since you have chosen L17 (Chinese style), P16 is not urgent.  R10 is a possibility.  F3 is also important.]
;W[ql];B[ol]C[Would p7 give better shape?



klin: Yes, P7 is the usual play.];W[qo];B[po];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm]
;B[om];W[qi];B[nn]C[klin: O6 is kind of slow.  Play at P3 can prevent the cut implicitly.  Since you chose P8 instead of P7, you should have prepared the cut.  Look at the shape now, P8 is not at the best position.  If you want to play O6, at least peep at N4 first.  If white connects, then play O6.  You can get a sente and make white heavy.]
;W[kq];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[cl];B[ep]C[This seems like it's too good for black? But somehow I feel that I was unable to take advantage



klin: Yes.  White's mistake was the last move, should have played at E4.]

C[This move seems a little odd to me, but I'm hoping to reduce white possibilities on the left while trying to create a moyo



klin: L15 looks better.  In a earlier move, P16 probably should be at P18.]
;W[le];B[nb];W[lc];B[lb];W[kd];B[jc]C[klin: This move has to at at K16.  K17 very bad.]
;W[jd];B[gi]C[This move seems strange to me. But I didn't want to invade and be attacked



klin: This move is OK.  The problem was K17.];W[dj];B[id];W[ic]
;B[jb];W[gc];B[lf]C[A mistake, I'm sure, now I really feel like I've wasted an opportunity. What was I thinking?



klin: Well, fighting now may not have advantage.];W[ie];B[jf]
C[klin: K14 is a meaningless move.  J14 gets sente, then play somewhere else.]
;W[gk];B[ij];W[jl];B[il]C[I guess I couldn't resist, 



klin: If you want to attack, you need to do some preparation.  For example, play at N4 first.  It is late now.  You should have played N4 before O6.]
;W[im];B[hl];W[hq];B[qk];W[rk];B[pk];W[rl];B[cm]C[I feel like i'm not really interested in cutting at k7 because center will be small anyways. Is there a better point for reducing left side?



klin: Left side not worth playing now.  You can Q13, then Q12.  If white responses to both, cut at K7.  You can get a good center territory.]
;W[bm];B[bn]C[klin: B6 should cut at B8.  It is gown hill from this point.  I don't even know how to comment on your following moves.]

One of the reasons I'm not sure is because my endgame is completely terrible, so there is very little logic behind it. Does it seem that black could have lost a lot of points in these last few moves?]
