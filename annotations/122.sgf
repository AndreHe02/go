Result: black wins by resignation];B[cp]C[Hi Cristiano,

The syntax of my review will be as follows:

B stands for Black
W stands for White

points not yet occupied at the time of the comment will be refered to with their coordinates in lower case(e.g. d4 for the lower left star point)

points already occupied at the time of the comment will be refered to with their move number (e.g. B1 for Black 1)

UR = Upper Right
LR, UL, and LL accordingly.

Var = variation, of course

One more thing: I did not know about the result while reviewing the game, nor about your respective strengths.

Enjoy go !!!];W[pd];B[dc];W[pq];B[fq]C[The ogeima shimari (big knight's corner enclosure) has a generic weak point at d3. It is OK to play it, but you should play future moves with that weakness in mind. In particular, when W becomes strong at the left side, a defensive move like d4 or f5 becomes appropriate.]
;W[de];B[ci]C[Very good. Combining a pincer with an extension is a positive approach. The extension works particularly well with the ogeima shimari. Look at the variation to see why B7 takes into account the weakness of the ogeima very well.]

(;W[ge]C[I'd prefer f16, but this is not bad.];B[fd]C[:-(

This is tipically a move that strengthens the opponent. The niken-tobi (two space jump) has a weakness, because it is easier to cut than a one space jump (ikken-tobi). After the B9-f15 exchange, that weakness no longer exists and both B7 and B9 end up weaker than they were. Please look at the var to see why f15 is so good.]

(;W[gd]C[:-(

White should welcome the invitation to connect at f15.
Please look at the var.];B[fe]C[OK]
(;W[cg]C[There is a proverb that says: At the head of to stones: hane.
Here B and W are struggling in the UL corner to connect and cut. White should definitely block at f14 to make the best of the situation.

This is the kind of move you should play without hesitation, whatever the outcome may be.

 See the var.];B[ei]C[This move builds a moyo, but the fight at the UL is still more urgent. If B13 at f14, white is cut in two, and Black clearly takes the lead.]
;W[cc]C[Still at f14: this is the vital point for both !!!]
;B[dd];W[cd];B[dl]C[Same thing: don't leave the front. Play at f14 to connect your stones globally and cut the opponent's]
;W[pk]C[You'll agree by now that this and every subsequent move should be at f14, so I won't come back to it anymore.]
;B[md];W[kc];B[kd];W[jd];B[ke];W[jp]C[Good global feeling.   However, one must not permit
Black to make ideal shape at m17];B[qf]C[Good global feeling as well.

However, making ideal shape at m17 is better.];W[nc];B[lc]C[Yes ! This makes very nice shape. If ever he gets to play f14, Black will have all the power on the goban.]
;W[rd];B[of];W[fo];B[ep];W[fc];B[ec];W[gc];B[ff]C[Well, here we have it. Very important move.]

(;W[dn]C[Overplay. I suggest that you still focus on the UL corner, which has not been connected to B7-B13 completely. Look at the vars.]
;B[qn]C[OK. Black is strong everywhere so playing on a large scale is a good idea. Personally I'd play on the 4th line.]
;W[qo];B[on]
(;W[pm]C[Better at q5. It is a matter of shape. See var.];B[pn]

Black is happy with his iron pillar, separating two rather weak formations.]
;W[np]C[OK]
(;B[jc]C[The white group can indeed be attacked. Still, I would continue at the right side, for example as in the var.]

(;B[nd]C[j18 is more urgent: see var];W[oc];B[nm];W[dq]
(;B[cq]C[Safe move. If B51 at d4, difficult calculations follow.]
;W[eo];B[dp];W[qi]C[+ This move defends the white group, and as such reduces the influence of the black pillar.

- However, white has been constructing small groups all over the goban, which will soon turn out to be a problem.]
;B[jj]C[Moves like this are difficult to assess, but when you look at the overall position, black is globally connected and strong, whereas white has weak groups spread over the goban, one of which will surely die.]
;W[gp]C[Good move, connecting groups
globally];B[lq]C[:-(

B57 invades an area that does not really belong to white.
The LR corner is weakened by black's pillar, and the lower side is open at the left, since the presence of B5.

B57 gives White the opportunity to play at m4, and become strong.

If you play here, play at m4 yourself, to attack the white group at  the left on a large scale.

One line makes a big difference !];W[lo]C[Direction is good, but the double keima leaves cutting points.
m4 is better];B[lp];W[ko];B[ir];W[jr]C[Very good.

[ip:b][kp:c][lr:d]C[OK for white.

Black takes only a few stones while White gets strong and B17 gets weak.

By the way, I reckon you noticed that black cannot cut at 'a', because Wb, Bc, Wd follow.]

Black won the game and has full credit of victory. The reason he won, is that he gave priority to strong groups. From time to time, he missed a key point to take full advantage of the strength he built, but overall he kept his groups well connected and white's groups split up.


White shows that he knows about good shape, eyespace and how to make a group live. However there is an important rule in go  with respect to your groups:

FIRST connect (globally). If you can't connect THEN make life (locally)

If you look at the end of the game, you'll see that white has six groups, whereas black only has two groups. That is often a strong indication of who is going to win.

If you see that you have too many groups to save, then try to figure out which one you can afford to lose. That one you sacrifice, and in the process of sacrificing, you will gain something in return.

If white manages to connect his groups on a large scale, I am sure he will give black a tough rematch.

As you can probably see, I enjoyed reviewing your game. Hope it serves you well.

C[Now all groups are stable and the endgame begins. Let's count hte score (including captured stones):

White:

UL: 5 (it's weak)
UR: 10
Centre: 15
LR: 29
komi: 5,5

total: 64,5

Black:

Upper: 36
Left: 5
LL: 28
Right: 5

total : 74

So black has an advantage of 10 points. A good endgame, however, can easily catch up with that difference. At a glance, 'a', 'b' and 'c' seem to be the largest endgame points. (all from black's perspective)]
