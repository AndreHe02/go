Looks a bit timid to me, the vital point for the corner is c3, but you
seem to be playig a moyo style game, so you need to fill the gap
between c16 and d5

My personal choice would be c10 or c11, because it fits in with another joseki, please see variation]

This kick just makes W stronger. Playing at 'A' also bars W from the
edge, without the side effect of making W stronger];W[dg]C[R> W has increased in strength - so it's not an effective attack]

TR[pj]C[was I right to make him crawl like that?

R> Yes, it's only 8 points, and look at your lovely wall :-), and W's poor little stone. This is terrible for W.

bear in mind the variation shown earlier too.

At
the end of the day "being right", has more to do with your strategy. If
you're not sure about descending to S9 in the variation then playing
like this is perfectly acceptable.

Remember it's a game about surrounding territory and not about capturing stones.]

R>
Not a big point right now, you've got a big wall on the RHS, and W is
fighting for life in the centre, if you kill that you earn many more
points, however you should make territory whilst doing so. Your stones
at the top won't die so this isn't urgent.

Could you please tell me how to improve my play?

R> A few ideas:-
1)  In the opening think about how your stones work together (i.e. the bottom left)
2)
When you are forced to connect or take some stones - think about the
bad aji left behind if you just connect  *i.e. the ladder in the bottom
right*
3) Be consistent in your strategy (*top left when you played D15)
4) Try and keep sente for as long as possible (endgame). The person with sente gets to take the biggest points.
5) Don't rely on mistakes - read ahead - top left and bottom left
6) In the endgame keep an eye on the potential territory, and the balance of that territory.
