C[S> It looks like white spent much of her time struggling to live and making small inroads into black's territory. Let's have a look at your foundations, and then work on principles of necessity.
--
S> My comments will all begin with this S> marker (S for Scartol, my KGS username).]
PL[B];B[dq];W[pd];B[cd];W[pp]LB[ed:A]C[S> Notice that your opponent has chosen some pretty advanced opening moves -- it's doubtful that he knows how to use them appropriately. (For instance, A is a great move for white.) Therefore, studying joseki and knowing what the best moves for you are in situations like this can help you take advantage of fancy moves made by an opponent.]
;B[kc]LB[nc:A]C[S> This is a pretty timid move by black. A is more usual, since it's dual purpose (it approaches white while expanding black's top moyo). There's no immediate need to respond up here, but keep in mind that he's a bit nervous about over-extending himself (something you can use later).]
;W[cn]LB[do:A]TR[pp]C[S> Given the position of the marked white stone, this move should be made at A. With the move made here, black gets to make a big wall which can be used against the marked stone.]
;B[do];W[co];B[cp]
(;W[ck]C[S> Meanwhile, white has to scramble to make a small group. (It may be better to aim for the top, as in the variation.)]
;B[hq];W[dc]LB[ec:A][ic:C][df:B]C[S> Too close. A is better, and it has the extra advantage of C as a follow up when black responds at B.]
;B[cc];W[dd];B[de];W[ee];B[df];W[gd]C[S> Another small base for white. Notice that you already have two tiny groups, while black is lazily stretching out across two big corners.]
;B[ch];W[di]LB[mc:C][qj:A][nq:B]C[S> This move doesn't do much. It's good to keep access to the middle, but there are more urgent moves elsewhere. Now would be a good time to reinforce your own position on the right, with a move like A (best), B (to prepare for the coming invasion on the right, although black would do well to attack the top stone), or -- better than B -- an aggressive move like C which also sustains the top right corner. Use that black stone's isolation!]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[dh];W[dj]C[S> Don't bother saving one stone at this point in the game when there are such important moves to play elsewhere! (The proverb says: "Play the moves you have to play before the moves you want to play.")]
;B[nc]C[S> Now black gets the jump on this corner.]
(;W[oc]C[S> While this makes the black group heavy, it also neglects the right side. Notice how black manages to make a nice solid double approach, while white scrambles for life. See the variation for a better way.]
;B[nd];W[qc]LB[pf:A]C[S> This move screams out: "I'm going to lose the corner! I just know it!" A is the best follow-up move to the attach stone at P17.]
;B[qf];W[qi]C[S> Not bad, but notice how small and crunched white is in the top right.]
;B[ph];W[qh]LB[pi:A]C[S> Wrong direction. A is best; make a strong moyo and force your opponent to take a risk.]
;B[pg];W[pm];B[nq];W[qq]LB[lq:B][pq:A]C[S> Again -- this move reeks of desperation. A is better, since it threatens an attack at B.]
;B[or];W[pj]LB[kq:A]C[S> This isn't too urgent. White MUST invade somewhere around A to keep black from making a huge bottom territory.]
;B[nf];W[ic];B[pe];W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[od];W[ob]C[S> White makes good shape, but notice how black is pushing white around here -- white needs to use her sente wisely.]
;B[jb];W[ib];B[ni];W[kq];B[lr];W[lq]LB[fq:B][kr:A]C[S> Again, white should play at A. The main goal here is to separate and attack black; this move says "I need to keep access to the middle" -- which is good in general. But at this point, white must be willing to take more of a risk. Playing at A threatens to split black up with the goal of chasing (probably not killing) the O3 group; and it also threatens an attack at B.]
;B[kr]C[S> Now black gets to link up, and the white "invasion" hasn't really done much (except give white another vulnerable group to worry about).]
;W[iq];B[ir];W[ip];B[hp];W[lo];B[no];W[lm];B[nm];W[nk];B[ol]
;W[ok]LB[pl:A]TR[qh][qi]C[S> A is more urgent. White worked hard to make that area on the right -- her biggest on the board. Protect it! The middle group will be okay on its own. (Notice too how vulnerable the marked white stones become later.)]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[qm];W[pn];B[qk];W[rl];B[rk];W[rm];B[pk];W[oi]
LB[oj:A]C[S> Just connect at A. This move gives black another forcing move (which he uses straightaway), and this stone becomes redundant.]
;B[nj];W[oj];B[pi];W[nl];B[om];W[lj]LB[qj:A]C[S> Aieee! Connect at A! If black cuts these off, he makes 20 points without breaking a sweat.]
;B[fh];W[ef];B[eg];W[if];B[li];W[nh];B[oh];W[mi]C[S> Nice one.]
;B[mh];W[mj];B[qj]C[S> Ouch. While getting those two stones was good, this move was worth five times as much -- look at all the other territory he gains just with this one cut.]
;W[lh];B[ki];W[mg];B[ii];W[jj];B[ji];W[kj]LB[cb:B][fp:A]C[S> It's really hard to make any territory in the middle. While white does okay here, it's more urgent just now to reduce at A or B.]
;B[ij];W[ik];B[io]C[S> With one move, black erases any points white may have earned here.]
;W[jq];B[hk];W[il];B[in];W[mr];B[jr];W[mq];B[oo];W[oq];B[nr]
;W[po];B[kn];W[ln];B[hm];W[hl];B[gj];W[fk]LB[dn:A]C[S> Not aa very useful move. A is better.]

;B[cl];W[bl];B[bk];W[bj];B[bm]C[S> Double ouch. Another ten points for black.]
;W[ak];B[ao];W[ah]C[S> A good move.];B[bi];W[ai];B[bg];W[ag]

;B[ie];W[hf];B[je];W[ge];B[ke];W[ld];B[jf];W[jg];B[kg];W[kh]
;B[ig];W[jh]C[S> Saving one stone to give up two? I don't understand.]
;B[he];W[ih];B[hg];W[hi];B[hj];W[fi];B[gh];W[nb];B[mc];W[lc]
;B[mb];W[lb];B[la];W[ja]C[S> Good eye.];B[ma];W[ka];B[rd];W[qd]
;B[rc];W[rb];B[pb];W[qb];B[lf];W[mf];B[me];W[na];B[of];W[jm]
;B[km];W[kl];B[ko];W[jn]LB[cb:A][sf:C][pr:B]C[S> This move is worth zero points; if it does anything, it forces white to repair any defect that may exist in her position. A, B, and C are all more urgent -- and any move which gains even one point is more useful.]
;B[jo];W[op];B[np];W[mp];B[qs]C[S> Ouch. Five points at least for black.]
;W[pr];B[ps];W[qr];B[rr];W[rq];B[ro];W[qn];B[rp];W[sr];B[rs]
;W[sq]C[S> How urgent is this move?];B[rn];W[ss];B[os];W[qp]
;B[sl];W[sm];B[sk];W[sn];B[so];W[qm];B[sf];W[se];B[db]C[S> Big move for black.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[sp]C[S> Definitely unnecessary. Even when black surrounds all the outside liberties, white's eye guarantees life.]
;B[gc]
(;W[hc]C[S> Slow down and don't retreat if you don't have to. See variation.

S> I'll end my review here. You seem to have the same problem I had for a while -- invading early and often, resulting in a lot of small, vulnerable groups that you have to go back and protect. While it's good to break up your opponents positions early in the game, be sure you do so in a way that solidifies your own as much as possible. Also, don't forget that you MUST let your opponent havee SOME territory. If you try to get everything, you'll end up with nothing.
