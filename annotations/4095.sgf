C[Hi,

Thanks for taking a look at this game. Though I, as black, won, I do not feel like it was because of a good setup but rather because of two large white mistakes. I have asked some questions at the places I felt that black was not looking good. The situation where I felt most behind is characteristic of many of my games, so I have tried to explain my thoughts as much as possible.

Thanks.

Erik:
Hi.  Thank you for letting me review this game, it was interesting as you have a quite different style than what I myself play.
The main reason that you fell behind was that you allowed white to easily erase the influence you gained from playing p15.  Strength is there to be used, otherwise it is wasted.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[ec];W[de];B[gd];W[ci];B[kc];W[po]
C[erislover: Here, in hindsight, I think black chooses the wrong joseki. Is the two space high pincer better in this position? Or is that simply a matter of style?

Erik:  As far as I can see it's a matter of style.
Though if you feel that the extension from r10 to r14 hurts your game to an unacceptable degree you really only have two choices.  Either play a joseki that takes the side yourself, or extend q16 to prevent white from extending the other way.]

(;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[np]C[erislover: I know O3 or P4 are joseki but I am not a joseki addict. My idea was less to make any territory than it was to get into the center as quickly as possible. Wrong thought or wrong way to accomplish it?

Erik:  Not totaly a  bad thought, but the influence gained by being on the fourth line is more than lost due to the weakness in the connection to q3.
Usually the best way for white to punish this move is to use the placement at p3 to establish himself along the bottom.  This should of course not be played immidiately, white can be happy if black has to go back and spend another move to cover this weakness.
All in all more than the extra influence you might be gaining from playing faster is lost due to the weakness at p3.]
;W[qj];B[fq];W[jp];B[cq]C[erislover: The K4 pincer does not seem to put a lot of pressure on F3, so it seems that by invading now I will get the larger corner possible from this joseki while retaining the option to pull out F3 if I ever need to. With an open skirt on the right and the wide-open center, I felt that this was a reasonable line of play for black at the time I made it. That thought changes in a few moves but it is not clear whether this is the wrong move or whether a later one-space jump to C8 is the wrong move, or whether I am being pessimistic and they are all ok.

Erik:
When invading the corner in this position you are sacrificing f3.  F3 will lie far to close to your opponents strenght for it to be reasonable to expect to be able to draw it out unless your opponent makes a mistake.
It is still a good move though, as if your opponent cuts you will get a large corner, and there will be a lot of aji left in f3.
But, personally I would play the pincer at c6 in this position.
Jumping out with f5 becomes bad in this position, since the weakness at p3 makes it difficult for black to attack k4.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[em]
(;B[cl]C[erislover: In my mind, the only urgent situation was to avoid getting shut in. But it is not clear to me wether this or C3 was the wrong idea, or whether neither really were and I am just being too pessimistic.

Erik:  The approach towards your corner is simply so big that you should allow white to shut you in here.  But this is far from a lost game.]
;W[qf]C[erislover: When white approached here, I felt my stomach sink. The normal responses away felt slow and a pincer seemed completely unreasonable. After what seemed like a good corner invasion, I now felt extremely behind on influence. So I played kosumi, hoping to make miai of the followup press at Q13 or the jump L15 for fixing my shape, and in any case getting some influence. This felt like the turning point for black, do or die. I did not like my position at this point at all, and any of the earlier choices (not pincering Q5, the C3 invasion, the C8 jump) seem like they could have prevented this even though each seemed to me to be completely playable at the time. But even if I did not jump at C8, I don't think playing here would have been high on my list of moves anyway.

Erik: 
I think the only outrigh mistake you have made is o4, which white failed to take advantage of.
That beeing said the area around r14 really should be high on your list.  It's the last corner-approach; And it's an extension for both white and black.
M3 is also important.

I would consider tenuki in order to get m3.  

Locally p15 is good from a moyo building viewpoint.  But, white should respond to p15 with r17, and the only interesting way to block would be with q17, this leaves white with quite a solid chunk of territory.
Also, since white has r10 he might choose to play p14 or o13.  Trying to build his own mojo.

You could also play r16 to close the corner, but that would likely induce p14, letting white develop faster than black.

Q14 is maybe also playable, but I feel that r10 then is slightly too well placed for white.]

(;B[oe]
(;W[lq]C[Erik: M3 is very big, it expands whites area while reducing black.  
It greatly reduces black's options as to how he can use f3.  
And it aggravates black's weakness at p3, unless black protects, white can now cut.  Furhermore, black m3 comes close to removing the weakness at p3, and is likely sente.
But, it is not big enough to allow q13.];B[pg];W[qg];B[ph];W[qh]
;B[oj]C[I use this pattern now and again and I have a hard time knowing whether taking the shape point at Q11 here is better than this cap/jump, but since the idea behind the P15 kosumi was to get some influence back this felt more consistent than Q11. I also did not want to encourage white to ruin my chances to play S8

Erik:  P10 is better.  Q11 would be meaningfull if white would have to answer by submissivly protecting the jump at r11.  As it stands however Q11 would be answered by Q10, and then p10 would have a high priority.]
;W[dc]C[Erik: The joseki dictionary I am using states the difference of this and c18 as 20 points, although that includes white decending to d18.  Played as sente like this the value is likely a bit smaller.]
;B[ed]
(;W[md]C[erislover: My thought was only to use this invasion to fix the three spaces between L17 and the E17 group. I had seen an invasion at this point or the J17 area as miai for a while now and did not want to waste a move fixing either of them because of this reasoning.

Erik: 
You are too timid, why build a wall if you feel this area is still invadable.

I personaly feel that the corner invasion at R17 is what white should be playing, although black would then take sente to play f13.

If I as white feel that I absolutely had to reduce this mojo then l15 is the place to start.
If you had somehow played l15 before n16 I don't think n16 would have accomplished much.  J17 would be likewise limited.  So I would say that l15 makes both possibilities much harder to accomplish.  I can't think of when you would get to play it though, and the corner invasion at r17 would of course still be availiable.

This invasion is too deep;
As black I would kill this white stone, which should secure the win.]

(;B[ke]C[Erik:This is too lax, you are letting white escape too easily.]
;W[mf]
(;B[mh]C[Erik: This forces him to escape.  That would be OK if you where actually building something in the process.  It would be better to leave this unplayed and play the s8 invasion as a probe, then look to maksimise the damage from the weakness at s8 and the running group.  If you have to play a move here, o12 is better shape.]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[kg];B[if];W[jh];B[oc]C[I wanted the miai of connecting under or taking the corner. Passive?

Erik: 
Your group is not under threat.
But this prevents r17 so it's good.
I think it might be better to take the corner with r16.  But that would allow him p17, So I am not sure.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[jj];B[rl]C[Since I could not get another nice forcing move from the K12 group to make me any stronger here, I felt this was a now-or-never invasion.

erik: Yes.];W[rn];B[pl];W[ok];B[pk];W[pj];B[ol];W[nk];B[nl]
;W[nn];B[oi]C[I thought this move would make miai of N6 or N9.

Erik: As long as you remember the forcing move at n8 and m8 after n9.  But there is a cut at p3, so the position is difficult, for both sides.]

;W[lo];B[jm]
(;W[jo];B[im];W[hn]C[erislover: Now white is ahead by maybe 12 points. I count black around 60 and white around 72. I took some time here and only came up with what follows. My thought was that white could not solidify the center with black poking in at three places so I would find points elsewhere. 2 minutes to come up with this move so if there is something better then this might be a key point in how I look at the endgame and where I need some improvement. From here on out time-per-move gets unreliable as both my opponent and I gave each other additional time to play.

Erik: White's chain of stones in the center still lacks eyes.  So h12 might be an interesting point, to make it difficult for white to connect, this would also severly reduce white's possibilities in the center.  But s17 is very big, and has a big sente follow-up if white does not respond.]
;B[rc];W[qe];B[no]C[erislover: Yet another long thought for an internet game and I realized white could be cut off here.  

Erik: Can he?  I think you would need another move here before the cut would work.]

(;W[mo]C[Erik:  This is obviously not a move.];B[on];W[oo];B[om]
;W[gg]C[erislover: By a rough estimate I felt white was still ahead if I did not get into the center immediately.

Erik:  territories in the center is smaller than they appear.  You where correct in your earlier assesment that he would not get much here.  Still, if you give it to him, he will get it, so now is indeed to time to start reducing the area.
And the place to start is with h13  Also don't forget b10/b9, this double sente point is quite important.
Don't focus to much on a single area.  The best way to reduce the center is with h7, threathening to break into the bottom.]

(;B[ek]C[Erik: This looks needlessly risky.  There is always a weakness in the knight's move.  And white might decide to fight here.]

;W[hf]C[Erik: allowing this is totally unecesarry.];B[ge]C[erislover: Now I feel that it was black's game to lose. While I am glad I turned things around, it seems that white had the advantage going into middlegame and it was only through my opponent missing the cut of O5 that I really came back in the game. Eventually I make a very non-threatening peep that also allowed me to cut off the original N16 invasion that led to a resign. If there is anything to learn from this game, it seems to me that it would come from earlier, but if I knew all my weak points then I guess I wouldn't be submitting this game for review so maybe something interesting follows.]
