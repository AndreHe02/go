C[[Xif\] Hi my name is David, I played as white in this game and my brother played as black and thank you in advance for reviewing this game. Could you please point out any wasted moves or overplays you see.

[Bruinfix\]  I am David's brother and I also would like to thank you for reviewing the game in advance.  Any mistakes you point out that I made would be really helpful to me.]
;B[pe]C[AC: Hi, I'm Eoghan, occasionally known as the Acid Casual.  I don't play anything like as much as I used to and I was never all that good so don't take everything I say here as gospel.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[qj];W[ci]C[[Bruinfix\] this is an opening stratagy that I though of about a day before and I wanted to try it out.  Is this an okay opening or is it bad?

AC: Seems okay to me, although white's opening (known as the low Chinese) is more orthodox.  I might have played R9 instead of R10, expecting more pieces to played in top right.]
;B[jd];W[nq]LB[jp:B][oq:A]C[AC: I'd try a pincer here - otherwise white can quickly develop the lower side.  And the standard responses to the pincer look good for you.]

(;B[oq];W[lp]LB[pn:A][np:B]
(;B[pn];W[no]C[[Xif\] Is thes a bad move? I feel that maybe securing territory in that corner might have been beter or maybe attacking at P2.

AC: I think this is a poor choice - it does nothing to increase your territory and black's position here is already strong enough that he can ignore your move and play a big move elsewhere. Somewhere around H3 makes more sense to me.]
;B[nr]LB[mq:B][mr:A]C[AC:  Moves on the second line you can typically save until the endgame unless they are necessary to secure your position.  I think either securing the top right corner with Q17 or approaching one of the white corners would be a better choice here.]

(;W[mr]LB[mq:B][pr:A]C[AC: A small overplay for white here - now black can cut at N3.  N3 would have been safer for you.]

(;B[pr];W[ns]C[AC: This is an endgame move - better to defend your position with O4 perhaps.]
;B[or]C[AC: You could afford to give up that stone and play elsewhere.  Losing it costs you next to nothing.]
;W[nn];B[np];W[mq];B[om]C[[Bruinfix\] The sequence form 21-25 seems is favorable to black right?

AC: Well, on the one hand white is pushing you along the fifth line which means big territorial gains for you, but he does wind up with a pretty serious wall  and he should be able to make it tough for you when you invade the lower side.]
;W[nm];B[ol];W[nl];B[ok];W[mp];B[fq]LB[co:A][eq:B]
(;W[co]C[AC: This is very defensive for white - in this position you should be trying to push black towards your wall.  I would E3 instead.]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[dq];W[cq];B[iq]C[[Bruinfix\] This move was for me to create a base and attack the white stones

AC: You are wise to establish a base with strong white positions on either side of you.  However you shouldn't expect to gain much from attacking the white stones on the right - it is very difficult to attack large groups.]
;W[jq]C[AC: This move isn't such a good idea.  In general, when you attach to a stone, you wind up making it stronger.  That would be okay if you were desperately fighting for eyespace for your group - then attachments are a common tactic.  Here I think you are better off to try to seal black in on the lower side with a capping move at e.g. J5.]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[ip];W[ir]LB[hr:B][jr:A]C[[Bruinfix\] On my brothers move white 38 I thought it was an overplay but when I tried to take the stone he ended up being safe.  Is there a better variation I could have made?

AC: I would simply H2 - then he must defend.  After that you can play elsewhere.

Already white has done you a favour by giving you an easy outlet to the center instead of sealing you in.]

(;B[jr];W[kr];B[kq];W[js];B[jq];W[lq];B[hr];W[is];B[hs];W[ks]
;B[dh]C[[Bruinfix\] Since I like how my invasion turned out I decied to make a reduction on white

AC: White's position is thin enough that you should be thinking in terms of invasion, not reduction.  But white goes along with you very nicely - he kindly crawls along the third line and allows you to build a wall.]
;W[ch]C[AC: I would be inclined to play around C14 instead - where is black going to go ?]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[df]LB[ce:B][cf:A]C[AC: As a general rule of thumb, once you have three stones in a line, it's safe to jump, so here white could consider playing C15 to pull ahead of black.]

(;W[cf];B[de];W[ce];B[fc];W[ed]C[[Xif\] Could you comment on that move not too sure if it works as a good move.

AC: This is fine - splitting moves like these are essential in many attacks.  The key is that the D15 group has no base and sooner or later will have to run.  Typically now you would hope to "lean" on the stronger of the two groups that you have split in order to gain strength to attack the weak one.  The variation on the next move should show what I mean.]
;B[eb]LB[db:A][fd:B]
(;W[db];B[ee];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[dd]C[AC: This move does you more harm than good.  Better to make shape and start your getaway by playing e.g. F13.]
;W[ec];B[gb];W[cd];B[ff]C[[Bruinfix\] I didn't like how this turned out here.  White is atacking both of my weak groups and each defending move is making me in a worse situation. Was Black 57 an overplay that caused this.   And when I do get in this situation what should I do to minimize my trouble

AC: I agree that this has turned out badly for black.  The one-space diagonal jump at black 57 is certainly what allowed white to push through and perhaps playing at F16 or even G16 would have given better results. 

Once things start going wrong in this fashion you have to make an honest assessment of how much it's going to cost you to lose one of the groups and whether you can regain lost ground by playing elsewhere.  In a case like this where the upper side group is more or less secure, you might consider playing elsewhere  to see if subsequent developments improve things for the D15 group.  Often if you force things in a difficult situation it hurts you even more.]
;W[ge];B[gf]C[AC: This move is not a good idea - you are still pushing white against your top group.  Playing F12 instead would give the D15 group an eye and escape potential to the right and below.]
;W[he];B[hd];W[hf];B[gh];W[gg];B[fg];W[hg];B[fi];W[ej];B[gj]
;W[fk]C[AC: This classic attacking style from white - don't attach to the stones you're attacking, but keep pushing them and expand your territory by doing so.]
;B[gk];W[fl];B[gl];W[gm];B[di];W[dj];B[fm];W[hm];B[fn];W[em]
;B[en];W[dm];B[dn];W[cn];B[ep];W[ho]C[AC: This looks overly aggressive to me and white should be prepared to abandon this stone if things start looking sticky.]

(;B[hn]C[AC: This is a strange move - all it does is make the white position stronger.]
;W[in];B[gn];W[im];B[go];W[io];B[hp];W[jo];B[fj]C[AC: this move isn't necessary at this point - it's far more important to move out again with, say, J11.  The whole group is still in severe danger of capture]
;W[ck]C[AC: This doesn't seem urgent - why not attack with H11 or invade the top right corner?]
;B[el]C[[Bruinfix\] This move was made to early it should have been a ko threat later.  I wasn't thinking when I made this move]
;W[ek];B[dl];W[cm];B[do];W[cp];B[hh]C[AC: and black escapes - I don't think you can prevent from him either running to the right or forming a second eye.]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[jj];B[il];W[jl];B[hk];W[hl];B[ji];W[ki];B[jh]
;W[ii];B[hj];W[ih];B[ig];W[if];B[jg];W[jf];B[kg]C[AC: This move would be better spent securing the top-right corner - the middle group is safe.]
;W[li]C[AC: A bit slow - why not N10? Why not Q17 for that matter?]
;B[nk]
(;W[mj]C[AC: N9 better.];B[mk];W[lk];B[ml];W[lm];B[ll];W[kl]
;B[mm];W[mn];B[nj];W[mi];B[ni];W[mh];B[ng];W[mf];B[mg]C[AC: Trying to block here is pointless - black must realise that white can just steam into that big hole directly above N14.  Defending with N16 is better, I think.]
;W[lg]C[AC: Nice tesuji from white here];B[lf];W[kf];B[lh];W[le]
;B[ld];W[lg];B[hi];W[kh];B[nf];W[me]LB[nc:B][nd:A]C[[Bruinfix\] This is probably the start of why I lose the game.  I had the territory but I lost a lot here because I couldn't stop him.  What should I have done differently?

AC: In fact you did not have the territory...there was a gaping weakness in the upper right  which should have been exploited a long time ago.  

In order to keep as much of it as possible, you need to fall back a little - make a loose net of your stones: don't attach to white directly.  And accept that you will not get to keep it all.]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[mc];W[kd];B[kc];W[lc];B[lb];W[ld];B[jb];W[je]
;B[ne]C[AC: O17 might defend this area better - if he pushes in at O15, P15 stops him dead.]
;W[nc];B[mb];W[pd];B[oc];W[pc];B[qd];W[od];B[nb];W[ob];B[qc]
;W[nc];B[qb];W[id]C[AC: here again, you have to accept you're going to lose a couple of stones - sacrifice them to save more territory]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[dk];W[kb]C[[Bruinfix\]This was a miss read of a co threat here I thought I had the group captured when I made this move. When it didn't happen I thought it was very strange.  Just to explain my wierd movement here]
;B[cj];W[bj];B[ei];W[cl];B[ka];W[ib];B[kc];W[hc];B[gc];W[kb]
C[AC: now you have the choice - save the G18 stones, or the N18 stones.  I think N18 is the better choice.]
;B[hb];W[ja];B[ic];W[la];B[ha];W[oc];B[oa];W[na];B[pb];W[pa]
;B[oe];W[ma];B[qa];W[oa]C[AC: saving the G18 stones costs you almost as much as letting them die - white's push through at O12 winds up being worth 20 odd points.]

[rs][ss]C[[Bruinfix\] I would just like to say thank you agian for reveiwing the game

AC: The difference in scores at the end of the game is about the same as the difference in number of captives on each side - territory is close to equal.  I think it's fair to say that had black looked to defend the top right earlier you probably would have emerged ahead. In fact, but for that major error towards the end of the game, I think it's safe to say the positions would have been reversed.  

White missed the chance to kill the black group in the middle and and didn't manage to build much territory in the attack - the last two thirds of the game seem to be about white trying to erase black's potential territory, having fallen behind early on.

Attacks are not usually about killing.  If you're confident of making a big kill then by all means go for it - it should prove decisive.  Otherwise you attack when it offers some benefit - usually because it allows you to build territory.

Minimising needless moves and developing awareness of when you can afford to play elsewhere is crucial - should you be dickering over a couple of points territory in the middle of the board or are there bigger moves elsewhere?  Tight games are decided by small efficiencies in play, by realising that this extra defensive move is actually unnecessary or that group x is safe and you should play elsewhere.]
