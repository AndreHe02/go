C[krv: I'm playing black here.
I don't know surely which moves are losing.
Please make accent on 'intuitive bad' moves (like bad shapes, overextend or too small extend, bad yose etc.)
Thank you for your time.

z -- Hi.  My name is Bill, "zinger" on KGS.  I'll do my best to answer your questions.  My comments are preceded by z --.  

Because you are so close to me in rank, inevitably some of your ideas will be better than mine.  For this reason, please consider my comments and variations only as suggestions.  Examine them for yourself, and consult a stronger player if you think it is warranted.

Also, this is my first review for the GTL.  Please let me know what is most and least helpful about this review - the feedback will help me make better reviews in the future.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[qj]
(;B[qh]C[krv: I like here also R8 like in vars. Is this correct?

z -- I am not qualified to distinguish between R12 and R8.  Objectively, I think both are good moves.  My own preference would be R8, since the expansion of the lower side appeals to me.]
;W[qn]
(;B[ql]C[krv: Is this correct?

z -- I cannot call it bad.  However, my own preference is R4.  This would take territory, and white will eventually have to defend his 3-space extension.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pp]
(;B[po]C[z -- this is a mistake.  S3 should be played first - see var. (from Ishida)]
;W[op]
(;B[qo]C[z -- but if black plays S3 now, it's not so good.]

(;W[oo]C[z -- white can try S3 instead.  See vars, and think again about why black should have played S3 earlier.]

(;B[pn]C[z -- White gives black a break.  S3 in sente should be played first.  Last chance !]
;W[qr]C[z -- again, this should be at S3.];B[iq];W[kq];B[fq]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[ch]C[z -- I suggest adding a move to the bottom group.  White K5 next would take territiory while attacking.]

(;W[cj];B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[fc];B[jd]C[z -- I would say this is "intuitively bad", the sort of thing you had asked about.  The upper side is unimportant to both players due to white's strong, low position at D3 and F3.  If you wish to expand you top right, P12 or P11 would be better.

Also, you have two weak groups on the bottom and left.  They cannot be killed, but white can profit by attacking them.  Notice that white H2 or B13 would make either group just about eyeless.  That means that white moves on the outside of these groups, such as K5, F6, E11, or F15 are practically sente.  

It might be wise to defend with E12 or J5.  Note that these moves not only defend, but by making black stronger they help prepare invasions such as C8 or C3.]
;W[oj]
(;B[oh]C[z -- a peep first at Q9 would prevent what comes next.]
;W[pl]
(;B[pm]C[krv: or R7?

z -- admittedly, this situation is a little awkward.  Your group here is not entirely alive, and is in danger of being shut in.  Maybe you can try R9 - see var.]
;W[ol]
(;B[jj]C[krv: Is now time to play tengen? I like moves like this (now it almost connect three groups, two of which are week).

z -- It's good that you realize those groups are weak.  However, I don't really see what this move accomplishes.  It is too far from your bottom and left groups to effectively defend them.

White can now choose between good moves at K5 and E11.  I think black should defend one of these threats instead, with E12 or J5.]

(;W[rl]C[z -- white can do this anytime, no need to rush things.]
;B[rm];W[qk];B[qm]C[z -- poor black, living so small where he should have had an advantage.  Plus, white could continue here and really scrunch black up.]

(;W[of];B[md];W[qf];B[mg]C[z -- oops, black needs to prevent the link up at S12.  R13 is one way.  S13 is another.  Try some variations on your own and see what works the best.]
;W[rh]
(;B[ri]C[krv: S13 makes difference?

z -- well let's see ...];W[qi];B[rg];W[ph]
(;B[sh]C[z -- black should play R13, linking to the top.];W[qg]
;B[pg];W[rh];B[rk]C[krv: Seems like to win ko at R12 is impossible or too hard to me? Thus I establish Q6 group, is this correct?

z -- well, what if white plays S10 now ?  I think I would just play a normal move elsewhere.  Maybe later fighting the ko will be more appealing.  And if white fills it, you get sente again.]

(;W[qh];B[rj]
(;W[og]C[z -- this is much too small.  White's group is in no danger here, and even it gets in trouble, it can capture a stone on the right edge anytime - see vars.]
;B[ge]C[Z -- too thin, leaves a big weakness at F15.];W[hc]
;B[id]C[krv: can I skip this move?

z -- if you are trying to make center territory, you need to do something here, or white can break in easily.  Maybe try something that fixes the weakness at F15, such as E16 or G16.  White might decide to answer, in which case you get sente.

However, it will be hard to make center territory with the bottom group still weak - white will be able to attack it, and make strength to break up the center.

I would try G16, which looks like it has good followup if white ignores.  If white answers, you can defend the bottom.]
;W[ej];B[el]C[z -- I don't think this does much.  At best, it provokes white to play C8, which removes the aji of a black invasion there later.  There is also the danger that white will answer at F6 - with black's bottom group still weak, it might be difficult to get a good result.]
;W[cl];B[fn];W[ko];B[mn];W[mp];B[jm]C[krv: Unsure where to place this stone around K7. May be K6, J6 or J7? Or somewhere else?

z -- In this area, I would choose J5.  

Also, by answering N6 passively at N4, white has given black a chance to reactivate his right side group with O7.  I would do that.]
;W[io];B[ml]C[z -- what does this accomplish?  I think black should answer on the bottom.  White could come in at H2 now.]

(;B[im]C[krv: Can I skip J7?

z -- See next comment for one idea.];W[gi];B[gh];W[fg];B[ei]
;W[fj]
(;B[hj]C[z -- this would be better at F14, a nose tesuji which captures white's two stones.  The difference to the game looks like about 15 points.]
;W[fe]C[krv: Surprise to me. How to protect now?

z -- I see no way to connect now, so black will have to live locally on the left.  The difference in points between this and the previous variation is large, maybe as much as the margin of victory.]
;B[gd];W[fd];B[eg];W[ff];B[di];W[dj]
(;B[dg]C[z -- B12 instead looks like it also lives, plus has yose value.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bf];W[hg]C[z -- wrecking black's center.  White is now comfortably ahead.  A quick estimate:

white:  left 25, bottom 15, right 5, top 20 = 65

black:  left 5, bottom 10, right 10, top right 15, center 10  = 50

So, not so much as I had thought.  Perhaps black could still win with a superior yose.]

;W[sg]C[z -- clearly too small.];B[ib]C[krv: Seems like this is yose move and I play it to early?

z -- Well, the yose has already started.  I think this move is worth playing now - but not for the reason which happens in the game.  See comment and variation next move.]

(;B[gl]C[krv: Is this move good?

z -- In the calm of a review, it looks like black can connect at F5 for an extra point or two.  I don't see anything white can do.  In a game, however, it is not easy to see all this, especially if one is short on time.  I would almost surely play this move in a game.]

(;B[kl]C[z -- oops !  Black misses his chance to end the ko.  The ko is worth 8 or 9 points; with this move, white threatens to take back at most 4.  So black profits 5 points if he ends the ko instead.]
;W[lg];B[eo];W[do];B[lh];W[ep];B[kk]C[krv: Can I win ko at M13?
Is better to lose ko and play E5?

z -- when white follows through on his threat, black loses about 13 points in this area.  The ko was worth 8 or 9, so black loses 5 points.  That's 10 points different than if black had gained 5 points by ending the ko after white's previous threat.]

[ho][io][oo][ro][so][hp][op][pp][rp][gq]C[z -- I will try to make some general comments which may help you.

I think your game is good.  You watch the whole board and don't seem to get too attached to one group of stones or local fight.  I can suggest three points for possible improvement:

1.  Try to find beneficial forcing moves which can be played, before making the move you really want to make.  For example, twice you missed good peeps which would have helped defend your positions.

2.  I think you are a little too willing to leave your weak groups as they are.  Go back and look at the position after move 29, see your two weak groups on the bottom and left, and look at how many moves they were left that way.  Remember, just because your opponent cannot kill your group, does not mean that he cannot profit from its weakness.

3.  In the yose, try to stay focused on plays which keep sente, and resist the urge to answer your opponent's gote moves.  Sente is king in the yose!

I hope this review was useful.  Good luck :)])
