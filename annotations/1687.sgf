C[I must apologize for submitting a (relatively) quick, short (only 157 moves) and won game, which goes against all rules. First I essentially play on the Internet (this is a game from KGS), where such a time control may not seem so short (29min10s + 50s byo-yomi * 5). Anyway, there is a good reason why I submit a short game. I think I indentified, with some help, two problems of mine :

- I create myself a lot of weak groups in the beginning, then often tenukis when they are attacked, and the game becomes a mess.
- I don't know how to attack a group while making profit. Either I kill a huge group and I win, or I don't succeed and I lose, that is pretty frustrating. So, most of games don't go until yose. Concerning this issue, I kept some lines typed by the players during the game.
I chose this game because I find it quite representative of my usual play, "do or die". So, yes, I won, but I'm dissatisfied with this kind of wins, which are due to mere luck.

So I mostly want to know how I could have properly attacked. Of course, any other comment will be gratefully welcomed. Note that I tried to annotate all the moves that seemed abnormal to me, so if you see a extraterrestrial move which is not annotated, you know what to do :-)

Comments added by "Niall" 2k*, entitled "NM".];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[pj];W[qf]LB[nc:A]C[It seemed strange to me that white puts a stone where it can be easily attacked. I if were white, I would rather play at A for instance.

NM: I agree.];B[qe]C[NM: Good. Take advantage of Q10.];W[pf]
;B[nd];W[nf]C[Weird again, I thought. Not even trying to establish a base.

NM: Doesn't seem optimal to me, but I think it's playable. There's a lot of open space out there ...]
;B[qh]C[So I prevented any further change of mind. Here I was quite happy.

NM: Good];W[qn]C[Wow, more and more weird, that surprised me. White has a weak group, does she want an other ?

NM: I agree.];B[qo]C[NM: This is fine, but I think I would have been more inclined to play R8.]
;W[pn];B[np];W[rk]TR[pj][qh]C[That was unexpected. Since I wanted to avoid any idea of boshi upon the marked stones, I tried to escape lightly.

NM: I agree. I would suggest N10, N11, or P8.];B[og]C[NM: That is not really escaping lightly! It is perfectly playable, because it leaves your opponent heavy, but it weakens somewhat your Q16 stones.]
;W[of];B[mj];W[dj];B[fq]SQ[nf][of][pf][qf]TR[pn][qn][rk]C[I didn't know how to handle the marked stones so I delay a move in this zone, but I think there might be good urgent moves ? Especially the squared stones seem very weak and uneffective to me.

NM: This is very difficult. I think that your play is all right - of the two sides I would be more inclined to play F17, but it's a matter of taste. But unless you make a
mistake W can't link her two groups, so you can afford to play tenuki, knowing that your Q10 stones are in no danger. Still it would do no harm to attack, and I
think that on balance my choice here would be L16.];W[lq];B[iq]
C[NM: A good courageous move. Another, more cautios possibility, would have been to play N3 first.]
;W[lo];B[nn]C[I was looking forward to make a third weak white group.

NM: Hmmm, I don't like this - what do you do if W plays P5? I would play N3 first, then you can jump. But my choice here would be
a really large-scale attack: O7, followed if W links up by S5. You have a lot of profit in the corner, and W still has difficulty making eye space.]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[po];B[qp]C[NM: ... which had the effect of strengthening B ...]
;W[rh];B[qi]LB[rg:A][ri:B]C[An awful move ! Why did I not cut ? It seems simply A or B would have been effective.

NM: Yes, that is a terrible move. As you say, either A or B works.]
;W[ri]
(;B[rg]C[What did I think ?

NM: This is silly, but the two sides are I think definitevly linked - unless you're willing to sacrifice your Q10 group
(see variation).];W[rf];B[qg];W[sg]TR[nd][pd][qe]C[A bad exchange for black I would say. Aji-keshi, and the stones white added don't help the marked stones.

NM: Absolutely. Not so much aji-keshi, but more letting two weak groups link up and become strong.]
;B[mr]C[Taking territory and attacking as the same time, I like this move.

NM: Yes, it's good. But I think I would play something like K17 - it's bigger and more urgent.]
;W[oo];B[no];W[oq]C[NM; ???];B[op];W[mq];B[nq];W[lr];B[nr]C[NM: Not urgent. Only worth playing because of how weak it leaves the W M5 group. I am still itching to play K17.]
;W[io];B[kp]C[I thought white was a little too thin. Maybe I tried too much.

NM: This is terrible. Tactically this attack doesn't do much for you, neither strengthening your group nor weakening W's. Strategically it's wrong - you're attacking
on too small a scale. At this point I would suggest F5. If you really insist on attacking these local stones, then K4 is the way.]
;W[jp];B[jq]LB[kq:A]C[Here A is probably better, but I can't make up my mind about the continuation, what do you think about that ? Is that overplay ?

NM: See my comments earlier.];W[ko];B[fc]LB[rn:A]C[Maybe A instead ? It seems to be urgent and sente.

NM: No, this is much better. S6 is not absolute sente, though it threatens to take 4 more W stones. If I were W, I would answer S6 at M17, and I think I would be ahead then.
Still I prefer K17 or L17 for B here - your Q16 group needs some help.]
;W[fo];B[dr];W[cq];B[kq];W[lp];B[ho]C[Trying to get out... failed.]
;W[hn];B[ip]C[NM: At this point you should have played G5.]
;W[jn];B[jo];W[in];B[kr];W[ls]C[Here I muttered a prayer for the life of my bottom group then went elsewhere. Not sure I was right.

NM: You were.];B[cf]LB[df:A][dg:B]C[Perhaps it is locally more adequate at A or B, to reduce white moyo ?

NM: Yes, I like D14 better. Or maybe F10? Or C10? But this isn't bad.]
;W[df]TR[fc]C[Here I thought white was not doing so well, because the marked stone made the following joseki not good. But I feel I couldn't take advantage of that.

NM: It's quite playable for W, at this stage. But in fact in this position I would have played E15, reckoning to attack one of the stones severely.]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[cd];B[ci]C[Woops.];W[cj]C[Of course, I just helped white perfect his moyo, silly me.

NM: You wre never going to be able to reduce it all.  In fact, W should really have played E17 at this point.]
;B[eg]LB[de:A]C[Should I have tried instead to cut immediatly at A ?

NM: Yes, I think that would have been much better. W cannot block you, and so has to play E16.]
;W[fd];B[gd]C[NM: However, the good think about this for B is that you've managed to strengthen the F17 stone.]
;W[fg];B[ei];W[ej];B[fh];W[gg];B[fj];W[ec];B[fe];W[ed];B[ge]
C[NM: I don't like this. Joseki possibilities are F18, G17, or G15 - but the strength in the centre that G15 gives you isn't much use here, and invites a splitting attack. Of the three joseki moves,
I would go for G17. But in fact I think my choice here would be J16, which concedes a few points, but makes the splitting attack much more difficult.]
;W[jd]SQ[nd][pd][qe]TR[fe][gd][ge]C[I would say good invasion by white. Both marked groups are threatened.

NM: Yes., especially the G16 group.];B[hf]C[NM: I would prefer J15.]
;W[hg];B[if];W[ig]C[NM: W is heplping you surround her.];B[jf]
;W[md];B[mc]C[NM: Good answer.];W[ld];B[ff]LB[jg:A]C[About this move, read further comments between the players :-)

A was a lot safer I guess. Nonetheless, I am the one who has problems with weak groups now ! How typical of mine.

NM: Yes, A would have been lot safer, and you're then threatening O15 followed by N14. But this is quite fun too!]
;W[jg];B[kg];W[ij]C[NM: W should have cut at L14.];B[fk];W[el]
;B[lf];W[ng]C[NM: Terrible. W MUST play N15.];B[me];W[ne];B[nc]
;W[le];B[mf];W[hc];B[gc];W[ke];B[kf];W[lc]C[NM: At this point I would play K18, and I don't think the W group can live. See variation.]

(;B[re]TR[mc][nc][nd][pd][qe]C[Phew ! I'm not sure white had no time before to turn against this group, though I couldn't find when precisely.

NM: No, I don't think W ever had the chance to - but she could have developed it. So yes you were lucky.]
;W[hb]C[NM: I think  that now W can either live or link up - though F18 is sente for B and very big. But B still has to make sure his G17 group lives.]
;B[hi];W[ji];B[kh];W[ii];B[kj]C[Now I breathe freely.];W[nk]
C[Strange. I still can't find out the purpose of this move.

NM: It's not the main subject of discussion at the moment. I think W is trying to take the R12 group - I would let her, and take her G13 group..]
;B[nj]C[NM: L8 would be better];W[ml];B[ok];W[ol];B[sh]C[My killing genes were at full alert at this time :-)]
;W[si];B[se];W[sf];B[pl]
(;W[qk]LB[om:A]C[I was expecting A (see variation).

NM: Yes, it would have been better.];B[om];W[nl];B[pk]C[NM: If at this poitn W plays Q10 I think she lives.]
;W[pm];B[rn];W[rm];B[so];W[ql];B[qj];W[rj];B[sl]C[KKMD [7k\]: why the hell do all my games resume to a giant tsumego ?
KKMD [7k\]: It's always the same scheme.];W[mh]C[erichan [6k\]: because you don't like sharing
KKMD [7k\]: I felt I was behind
erichan [6k\]: so your opponent has to do the same
erichan [6k\]: ends up in a fight
erichan [6k\]: you could've connected your groups
erichan [6k\]: but you decided to kill me instead
erichan [6k\]: it was you who started this fight ;-p

This white move frightened me, I think the moves on which I spent the most time are my two next.]
;B[ki];W[oi];B[ni];W[oh]C[erichan [6k\]: see?
erichan [6k\]: again
erichan [6k\]: ;-p
erichan [6k\]: you can connect but you prefer kill :)
erichan [6k\]: but I understand this way of playing and maybe here is the best for you ^^
erichan [6k\]: dunno though ;-p];B[pg]C[KKMD [7k\]: well, now that would not be very moral to step down :-)
KKMD [7k\]: You won't have me alive !
KKMD [7k\]: But I wish I could play differently for once. I just can't.]
;W[cr]C[For now I think the game was over for both of us, morally if not on the board. So, although a maybe difficult tsumego position arises, none of us spent many time thinking about it.

NM: If W had played M9 then J8 here, there would still have been something to discuss. It's not clear to me hwo the semeai finishes.]
;B[er];W[hr];B[gr];W[is];B[ks];W[gs];B[hq];W[gp];B[gq]C[erichan [6k\]: ok thx for the game :)
KKMD [7k\]: Can you kill me ?
erichan [6k\]: I doubt it
erichan [6k\]: you have too many liberties
erichan [6k\]: if your group were completely covered maybe
KKMD [7k\]: OK thanks for the game
erichan [6k\]: you other group on left side is not well either
erichan [6k\]: but no way I can win if you survive on bottom
erichan [6k\]: well, thx, see you next time ^^
KKMD [7k\]: bye

I have nothing to add to that. I still think erichan was right, I see no way to kill, now or before.

NM: No, the B  G2 group lives. And the B D13 group should live too because of the threats B can make to kill G13 ...]
