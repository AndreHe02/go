C[Eule: Things I am most interested in:
- Did I miss any "bigger" moves in the opening?
- Why did my attack on the white group around S13 fail. (too strong group/mistakes on my side)?
- I tried to attack in places and at times, when I thought I would benefit from building thickness, was this successful or did I fail?

j: Eule, I think you played a good game, and you were ahead until the last moves. The thickness building approach I think is very good. The opening was ok.

I think you should try to:

- avoid the automatic answer mechanism.
- take your time to think... the attack on the S13 group was very important, and you both left the group undefined too much time. First to play is tipically who wins.

Anyway, I believe you are very well on the way to lesser kyu. If you have any questions, please let me know.

I've been impressed by the game of both of you, very good for your rank.

jaime];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qn]C[Eule: too paranoid?

j: :-) probably not, but a little bit complex. R5 is a more standard enclosure. Anyway, good.]
;W[gq];B[ce]C[j: there is a rule stating that you should extend in front of a shimari (corner enclosure). Yours is not "standard" (Q3 - R6), but I'd say L3 seems good.   C15 is a sound move anyway, good if you don't want him making a big moyo.]
;W[pc]C[j: odd move... I'd prefer C10 or an attack on your C15 (i.e., C13)]
;B[qc];W[oc];B[qb]C[Eule: too paranoid?

j: this time, maybe! This move is better left for later, stealing his eye space. How about R14?]
;W[bd];B[cn];W[bo];B[bn];W[jq]
(;B[lq]C[j: good. See var for a tricky move (I prefer yours, incidentally; this trick should be left for later)]
;W[ld];B[ne]C[j: maybe too jealous. I still prefer R14 or R13]
;W[pj]LB[ci:a][di:b][ph:c][qh:d][qj:e]C[Eule: would it have better to move at a,b,c,d or e next instead?

j: well, er, depends on what you want to do. Playing a or b will help your left group, but will pose no problem for white on the right side. If you want to attack Q10 (don't try to kill it, mind you, it'll prove really hard!) WHILE making territory, c or Q8 (remember to attack from the weakest side) will do the trick.]
;B[nc];W[nb];B[od];W[mc];B[nd];W[ob];B[pl]C[Eule: abcde question still applies here

j: actually, VERY GOOD sequence, as he answered your upper move, you've solidified your top and now you're attacking from the correct side. Perfect!
BTW, I think he should have left your upper move (O17) unanswered, or at the very least not played P18 in order to keep sente!]
;W[qg];B[qj]C[j: contact moves are not very good for attacking, but, honestly, this white group is very light...]
;W[qi];B[rj];W[ph];B[ko]LB[ci:a][di:b][hc:c]C[Eule: a,b or c better?

j: I really like your L5. However, a or b are good and needed moves. I'd left c for later. A possible sequence could be Black B, white C, Black E16 pressing...]
;W[hc];B[cd]C[Eule: now that top is gone for invasion, I wanted to build thickness to strenghten left side

j: good idea. The top is still prone to invasion, F17, even K16, but you should gain thickness before.]
;W[cc];B[be];W[bc]C[j: white should not answer here, but tenuki (maybe E15, D10...)]
;B[ed];W[fc];B[nk]LB[cj:a][dj:b][en:c][in:d]C[Eule: better to build left side at ab or to also strenghten left side by expanding at c/d, because white R13 group is too strong already?

j: I prefer b; it makes the most territory. A seems too timid. C too ambitious. The worst one, IMHO, is D. Your move is ok, but b seems bigger.

White R13 group is strong, but prone to being killed after your move. However, as before, it's better to think in making territory while attacking rather than trying to kill (unless obvious or necessary to win!).

Also picture white playing each one of the moves: I really think white b is the worse possibility.]
;W[dj]C[j: big problem. Your opponent's key point is your's.]
;B[cj]C[Eule: would there have been a better defensive answer?

j: pfff.... now, you're clearly behind in territory, and you don't have good chances of killing this white stone. You must devise a viable strategy, if possible.

As an idea: defend (this move seems good enough to keep some territory), keep sente and launch an all-or-nothing attack on Q12. As an alternate approach, depending on your strengths, try to invade the C3 corner, or to reduce it drastically (as previously noted in a var.).]
;W[ci];B[bj];W[dh];B[co]C[Eule: build thickness again

j: maybe you should have done this prior to C10, but I'm not absolutely sure...]
;W[bp];B[cp];W[cq];B[md];W[lb];B[og]LB[pf:a][qf:b][qe:c]C[Eule: should this have been at a,b or c?

j: ok, now you must look for possible future white eyes to destry. I like P11. Anyway, attacking from the left. Keep in mind you have T13 to destroy his base, so you must avoid an scape to the open...]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[qf];B[le]C[j: this kind of moves you should think twice; it helps him making secure territory...]
;W[kd];B[jf]C[j: nice, but sente?];W[bi]C[Eule: should I have tried to avoid this in time by B11 myself?

j: no, I think it's ok. You can still chase him to the open by playing C13 (no eyes for white there). However, you must keep attacking R13!!! It's your best chance.]

(;B[oi]C[Eule: threaten white group whilst building thickness to middle

j: perfect! But I think it's time to S13 (see var)];W[pi]
(;B[ip]C[j: Good move, but not its time. Now it's your best chance to kill the R13 group. How about S12?? (see var)]

;W[fq];B[do];W[dq];B[dk]C[Eule: did I make any serious mistakes in the following fight or was this already overplay?

j: it's ok, give your position (IMHO). But you made a mistake, I think... see later]

;B[ge];W[hh];B[fg]C[j: error! But too late; I can't see a way to scape. G15 was nice, but F13 should have been played before.

A normal sequence follows.];W[fh];B[gh];W[gi];B[gg];W[ho];B[in]
;W[gm];B[fn];W[hn];B[io];W[im];B[jm];W[il];B[ji]C[j: very good. Your managing to make very difficult center territory. I would not say you're behind now. Time to count and take a decission.]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[jl];B[km];W[aj];B[ak]C[j: this is a mistake. You should not answer, and get sente to play elsewhere.]
;W[ai]C[j: same applies to him];B[jp]C[j: this move doesn't accomplish much and reduces your liberties. Better unplayed yet.]
;W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[cm];W[kq];B[kk];W[bq]C[Eule: obviously I could have attacked there ;-), but it have been worth it? Probably.

j: yes, I think so. At least 10 points..];B[rh]C[Eule: Did I make any mistakes in my attack here? Could I have killed the white group or was it alive already?

j: OK! At last! I *think* you can kill it!!];W[ri];B[si];W[rg]
;B[re];W[qk];B[rk];W[pk];B[ql]C[j: this is a problematic move; you can get short of liberties... better S8 and stop him later]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[qh];B[sl];W[sh]C[j: one eye...];B[sj]C[j: NO! You don't need to play this stone. It's very important to get rid of the habit of answering automatically. White T10 is just one point, but NO eye, and you're trying to kill.   Things get difficult now!]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[of];B[nf];W[rd];B[rc]C[j: now you're done. White has played beautiful here. If instead of T10 you played S16, white would be killed, and you'd win BIG!]
;W[rf];B[sd];W[sf];B[oj];W[kl];B[ll]C[Eule: was this overplay, because of the following attack? Probably...

j: yes, exactly as you say... too short on liberties there]
;W[lm];B[ln];W[mm];B[ml];W[jn]C[Eule: at this point I decided that getting more points in the moyo in the corner would justify giving up 4 stones more.

j: of course. You could still win, the game is close!];B[kn]
;W[jo];B[nm]C[Eule: stupid mistake follows - thought it would be a typical stairway situation :-(

j: :-)];W[mn];B[mo];W[lo]C[Eule: at this point I thought I had lost too much of my territory by the two mistakes and resigned

j: I think now he's ahead, but you should keep your nerves and keep trying, there are possibilities]
