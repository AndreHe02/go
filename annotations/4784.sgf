C[Hi guys. My name is Alfa and this is my game in pandanet.

I look forward to reviewing it.

P.S. i sent this game to a 1 dan friend of mine. he chipped in a few major  bits and pieces. He will be represented by an -I-.]

Because I can reduce my lose points (from 160.5 to 32.5 to 16.5).

Hope you can review my game.

Thanks before.

Well Alpha, i saw some really good points in this game. you played things out in your head very nicely, and acted when your opponent made a move that was lacking. I also noticed your a pretty passive player, and that can hurt you in the end. Overall, i'd say that the thing you need to work on most is your aggression. Get into more questionable situations, and watch how it affects the board and flow of the game.  I really enjoyed reviewing your game.       -Jordan-]
;W[tt];B[tt]C[The biggest question here is about life and death. pls help me.

-J- I really didn't see very many cases of life and death in this game. the biggest case was your top left group, yet you still managed to worm your way into life. just look to take two seperate points of territory. this is the pursuit of life and death.

Another example would be at move 40. Play through the variation.]
