C[Hi, I am Tobias a 1st kyu from the Netherlands. I hope you will enjoy my comments. If you like just send me a feedback.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[po]LB[cf:A]C[Tobias: Maybe White should have better played around A. 
Now a black play at A is very urgent]
(;B[qo]C[Tobias: In my eyes this might be your first mistake in this game.  The situation screems for a pincer. 
Your choice of joseki gives the initiative to white in exchange of some solid territory in the corner but your stones are not working together.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[nq];W[qi]
(;B[qg]C[Tobias: This one is another reason why you got behind in the game.
Ok, you can call this move sente but sometimes a move is bad even if its sente...]
;W[oi]LB[nc:A]TR[qg]C[Tobias: White answered like expected but white will be happy to be forced to make this move. whites position is strong now but your upper right corner still totally open.
The marked black stone is a wasted move cause it doesn't take the corner nor its working together with F17.
Imagine white would have played now at A, black would have his hands full answering that on the right side cause R13 doesn't help]
;B[df];W[nd];B[oc]C[Tobias: See what I mean? cause of R13 there is no chance playing a pincer or the upper left corner]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[de]
(;B[dc];W[ge]C[Tobias: Good for black! White is "pushing the cart from behind"]
;B[hd]
(;W[di]LB[cc:A]C[Tobias: Too early... now black can punish white with A :)]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]LB[fo:C][ip:B][hq:A]TR[nq]C[Tobias: This move gives white the chance to move in at A. 
The marked black stone is very strong so you can play at least at B but maybe even better at C.]
;W[cf]C[Tobias: white is too much afraid]
(;B[ng]LB[ld:A]C[Tobias: Bad shape!! 
You cannot really expect to catch O16 with it. 
I would have played A (see var.)];W[kd];B[jc];W[pe]C[Tobias: White is punishing the bad black shape]

(;B[qd]LB[qe:A]C[Tobias: Too passive...
A is the only move here (see var.)];W[qe];B[oe];W[pg];B[qf]
;W[pf];B[re];W[od];B[nf]C[Tobias: Bad! you just creating a heavy group which will give you a headache the rest of the game. This is strenghtening the eyeless white group on top (even if its sente)]
;W[qh];B[nc]C[Tobias: Perfect!];W[md]
(;B[lf]LB[kg:A]C[Tobias: Too heavy. A is better]
(;W[je];B[if]LB[jg:A]C[Tobias: Overplay. 
A is good enough];W[jf];B[ig];W[jg];B[oh]LB[mi:A]C[Tobias: A is better]
;W[ph];B[ni];W[ih]
(;B[he]LB[nj:A][ql:B]C[Tobias: Too slow. 
A is much better cause of B white must react];W[nj];B[mi];W[jh]
;B[mj];W[nk];B[kj];W[gh];B[fn]C[Tobias: Good!];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo]
;B[go];W[eq];B[gm]LB[gn:A]C[Tobias: A is much better connection here]
;W[hn]C[Tobias: You see...];B[hm];W[jn]
(;B[fr]LB[gn:A]C[Tobias: Way too slow. Putting pressure on white is important now]

I tried to use opponents weakness but it seems that he used my weakness even better :) Anyway I lost this game by quite a margin. Hope you can tell me what I should have done better.]
