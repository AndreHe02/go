C[I am tomjk and I play Black.

Hello tomjk, my name is James and I am  IGS *1dan. I hope my comments are  useful to you.]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[tomjk [9k\]: Here is Italy :)];B[pq]C[<tomjk> I plan to play the low chinese opening ...]
;W[dc];B[qk];W[di]LB[jc:B][jq:A]C[<tomjk> now "A" or "B" are biggest I  think.

[James\] You've played the low  chinese, so to maintain balance the  point above 'A' or 'B' is more normal.]
;B[jq]C[<tomjk> thinking now over it, it seems K17 was maybe bigger, because it was the lower side of the white chinese opening.]
;W[nc]
(;B[kc]SQ[dc]C[<tomjk> I choose to pincer this way.  Playing at M17 seemed to close to O17  and left white to play K17. K17 seemed  to far from O17. So I choose this move.

[James\] I think it is better not to pincer  here. See variation 2. The pincer  invites a corner invasion by white but  there is a problem with this in the low  chinese (see variation 3). Also, black  should not make a low pincer with the  marked stone on the 3rd line.]
;W[gc]C[Not a good move by white! He should  invade the corner.]

(;B[ke]SQ[kc]C[The marked stone is not in any real  danger. Black should take the  opportunity to attack - see the variation.]
;W[qc]TR[kc][ke]C[<tomjk> now the question is where to block? R16 seems bigger in prospective territory, but leaves white to settle easily in the corner. Blocking at Q17 seems to be too close to the two marked stones.]
;B[qd]LB[pj:a]SQ[kc]C[<tomjk> I choose to go for the bigger  moyo ;-)

[James\] As before, black's attempt to build  a moyo is hampered by a weakness at 'a'.  As black has played the marked stone I  would block in the other direction. Your  play would be more suitable for the high  chinese, where the mid-point stone is  better placed for moyo building.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[nd];B[ne];W[ld]LB[me:a]C[Black absolutely must play at 'a'. It is the  vital point for shape for both sides. When  white gets to play here in the game it  becomes very difficult for black to retain  good shape.]

(;B[kd];W[me];B[nf]LB[pf:A]C[<tomjk> vital point for black seems to be at "A".]
;W[mf];B[ng]C[<tomjk> black has no choice but must  continue here. Else, see variation ...

[James\] Definitely!];W[rd];B[mg]SQ[qk][pq][jq]C[<tomjk> I think it was more important to  push here for white. So I bend now here :)

[James\] No, black should block white's  incursion. Remember the marked stones  are on the third line so white will have no  trouble controlling an attempt by black to  build a huge moyo. Also, this move does  not connect with black's top-side stones.]
;W[qe]C[White ruins black's right side...];B[pf]C[<tomjk> I play the vital point.]
;W[qf];B[qg];W[pe];B[oe];W[rg];B[rc]C[<tomjk> I plan to cut rhrough at P17 and capture the O17 group or the two Q17 stones or the S16 stone (depends on the answers from white).]
;W[re];B[oc];W[ob];B[pb];W[qb];B[nb];W[pa];B[mb];W[qh]LB[ce:B]
[de:C][ge:A]C[<tomjk> small move, I get the chance to  do something with the left white moyo. I  am not sure how deep to invade. I  considered "A", "B" or "C". What is the  best I don't know... "B" and "C"  will need  black to live small on the side (deep  invasion), "A" uses the strength of the  black wall around L16.

[James\] I agreed with you at first, but the  more I look at this move the more I think it  ruins black's coordination. I think it's  bigger than it looks.   Assessing the position generally now -  black's capture has made about the same  territory as white has taken in the top right  corner. Black has thickness but it is  nullified by white's marked stone in the  top left. The big thing here is that black's  framework doesn't work properly  anymore.]
;B[ge]C[Too close to black's thickness. I think  black should play in the bottom left.]
;W[fd];B[ef];W[cf];B[cg]C[<tomjk> this seemed possible after  white's responses ... but maybe an  overplay?

[James\] I like this play - it's forceful and it  threatens (and carries out...) the  destruction of white's rights side.]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ee]C[White absolutely must cut as black's next  move demonstrates...]
;B[eg]C[White now has a territorial lead (but not  much) but black's thickness it very good.  Black is winning now.]
;W[qm];B[qo]C[<tomjk> I decided that the black stone at  R9 was not in imminent danger, so I  played the shimari.

[James\] I agree];W[qn]LB[po:a]C[<tomjk> strange move, what is the best  response here? It doesn't seem to  threaten anything?

[James\] Just play 'a'. Black makes  territory and white just becomes heavy.  Black should be thinking about playing on  the left as soon as possible - a move by  black will rip white apart!]
;B[ok]SQ[qk]C[Remember you intended to leave the  marked stone to survive on its own - I  think that was the right way to play.]
;W[nm]C[<tomjk> hmm, maybe white prepared to jump out, ahead of black?]
;B[oo];W[ro];B[qp];W[rp];B[rq];W[on];B[mp]LB[no:a]C[<tomjk> now Black seems to be ahead in  territory, needs to reduce now the left  white side.

[James\] The shape move is 'a'. It's  generally good to stop the opponent  making a tiger's mouth shape (this is  covered superbly in Rob van Zeist's most  recent articles in his Magic of Go series  on the internet)]
;W[no];B[np];W[po]C[<tomjk> small move again, black get's another chance to make a big move elsewhere ;-)]
;B[dl]C[<tomjk> the plan was to chase the white  stone at D11, but maybe here not the best  move. I think now black F3 looks better.

[James\] I think this is fine. Yes, black was  right to leave the bottom right.]
;W[fi];B[fe];W[bf];B[de];W[ed];B[bg];W[ce]C[<tomjk> I played this sequence to get the wall facing the two white stones stronger]

(;B[gg]LB[cj:A][fl:B][cn:C]C[<tomjk> here this is an error. I should  have played now "A" and then "A" or "C" -  see variation.

[James\] Yes, it's an error - it's too  cautious. Black should think big at this  point, he's thick all over the board. Black  'B' looks good to me - white has nowhere  to go.]
;W[ck];B[cl];W[hi];B[co];W[cp];B[fq];W[do];B[cn];W[fo];B[fp]
;W[bp];B[bk];W[cj];B[bj];W[bi];B[bm]C[Black's play up to here is much too  cautious. making a small life is not the  way to use all that thickness around the  board. Thickness in one part of the board  allows you to play quickly and freely in  the other parts - don't worry about the life  of your stones when you are that thick,  just attack, attack, attack!]
;W[gn];B[fl];W[ek];B[en]C[<tomjk> wishful thinking that white would  connect at E5 ... ;-)

[James\] Even if white were to connect  black would not have achieved anything. I  think black should just connect - white's  middle group is not safe yet.]
;W[el];B[dn]C[<tomjk> better at E7 for eyeshape?

[James\] This is fine - you can see how  black suffers for not having connected  against white's peep.]
;W[fm]C[Black should ignore this and play  elsewhere - white cannot kill the black  group. Sliding into the lower left is big.]
;B[em];W[gp]
(;B[gq]LB[eo:a]C[Black should cut at 'a' first. This would  make miai of entering the lower left corner  and possibly killing it, and breaking  through white's surround. See the  variation.]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[eo];B[lk]C[<tomjk> I decide to reinforce my two weak stones and later aim at pulling out the F8 stone (if possible).]
;W[il]LB[hb:A][af:E][ih:B][ph:G][rl:F][ip:D][dr:C]C[<tomjk> ... not possible ;-) Now I don't  know anymore where to play. What is the  biggest play now? The moves "A" to "G"  come to my mind.

[James\] It is difficult to know where to go  here. White's groups are largely safe.  Perhaps 'B' is good to make a central  territory.  'E' is gote. 'G' doesn't achieve  anything much.  'C' is big and 'F' is also  big. At this stage it's really a matter of  counting up the value of each move - not  something I am very expert at!]
;B[op]LB[rl:A][ln:B]C[<tomjk> I played here to keep white to one  eye, aiming to attack this group, only that  white can live with "A" and also can jump  somewhere to "B", so this move is too  small ... :(

[James\] I think this move is OK - white  probably needs to answer it so it should  be sente.]
;W[lm];B[hc]C[I think your original point 'A' is better  locally.]
;W[hb];B[hd];W[oi];B[pi];W[ph];B[oj];W[qi];B[ni]C[<tomjk> better to resist at Q10?

[James\] no - this move looks right at this  point.];W[pj];B[pk]
;W[li];B[mi];W[ji];B[kh];W[ki];B[jo]LB[ip:a]C[Better is 'a'. I think playing on the top side  is most urgent here.]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[iq];B[ir];W[ll];B[jm];W[jl]
(;B[ho]LB[ib:A][ig:B]C[<tomjk> not urgent now, better at "A" then  "B" - see variation.

[James\] I agree that 'A' is the biggest  point. After that I think a play in the bottom  left may be bigger than 'B'.]
;W[go];B[hn];W[hm];B[im];W[ig]C[<tomjk> no good for black, white ruins the  territory of black :(

[James\] Precisely!];B[jf];W[jg];B[kg];W[if];B[ie];W[hf]C[<tomjk> this cost black about 8-10 points

[James\] This move is small for white.  White should enter at the top.]

tomjk [9k\]: very close result !
sishi [9k\]: thanks for Italy man
tomjk [9k\]: good game
sishi [9k\]: wait next chance

[James\] Overall your play is good,  although a little too cautious. Don't be  afraid to play on the fourth line in the  opening, particularly if you want to build  moyos. Stones on the third line can be  pressed down and are not ideal for  large-scale play. Also, try to use thickness  more effectively - you made it skilfully and  could have wrapped up the game  immediately!
