C[Reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to review my game, I greatly appreciate it! I'm particularly interested in my general strategy, fuseki and tesuji.. If you see anything that jumps out at you, I'd love to hear your comments.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jj]C[What do you think of this fuseki?

T: A very interesting move. In fuseki you can try different things, but you need to be consistent. Try now to get the most out of your stone in the center.]
;W[qf]LB[pj:A]C[T: Here, for example, it would combine well with your stone to play a pincer around A.]
;B[nc];W[pi];B[dj]LB[qk:A]C[This seemed big for white, so I took it.

T: I think that the most omportant thing now is to attack the weak white stones on the right side - e.g. at A which exploits their open skirt. Your tengen stone will play a useful part in the attack.]
;W[qn]C[T: Important for white.];B[qo]LB[qe:A][pf:B]C[I wanted to take this corner so I could attack the left corner and extend towards this corner.. Good idea?

T: No, this stone is not so good. It strengthens white's wide extension. Better invade directly or simply make a corner enclosure to see how white defends.

Compare this move with B A, W B - this is a good exchange because W's extension is small here, he becomes overconcentrated.

On your attacking plans, see later on.];W[pn];B[nq];W[jc];B[cf]
;W[cd];B[fq]LB[qe:C][pf:D][cl:A][cn:B]C[T: Now this is the wrong direction to approach the star point stone. Your left side stones have a weakness around A so you should protect them by playing at B. Your lower right corner enclosure is already strong so it needs no additional support.

But your opponent made a mistake so you got your approach anyway.

By the way, the C-D exchange should be played now. It is a good exchange for the reasons I pointed out before. If you don't make it now, your opponent might run into the corner in sente.]
;W[dq]LB[cn:A]C[This seemed especially bad for white.. I was looking forward to punishing this.

T: Yes, and you should do this by playing at the crucial point A immediately.]
;B[iq]C[T: Your position is low here, everything on the third line. Another reason for approaching from the other side.]
;W[fp]LB[cl:B][cm:A]C[T: Now this is a really bad mistake. If W plays A or B now, he has a good position.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[cn]C[I wanted a low position to turn into a nice wall to support the D10 stone]
;W[co];B[dn]C[T: Excellent for B.];W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[ch]LB[dh:A]
C[T: You can even play at A. Please check yourself that a cut is not possible.]
;W[je]
(;B[qe]LB[aa:B][qe:A]C[I figured white in the upper middle and R14 could push me into the corner and live small.

T: Totally correct - this move is urgent now. See the var.]
;W[pf];B[pk]C[I wasn't so sure about this to start, I wanted to try and reduce this framework.

T: In my opinion, this is the best move now. You should think of it as an invasion, not only a reduction.]
;W[qk]
(;B[ee]LB[ee:A][ql:A]C[I took a minute or two to think up this next sequence.. I wasn't totally sure how white would react but had to try.. I totally expected white to fill here, then put pressure on the K17 stone

T: You should continue your invasion by playing A although it leads to difficult fighting. See the var.]
;W[de];B[gc]LB[ge:A]C[T: This invasion seems too deep. A looks good here. If W replies correctly, the B stone is in danger of dieing.]

(;W[fd]LB[fd:A][ge:B]C[T: This is a mistake (provoked by you). The var. shows a much severer attack.]
;B[gd];W[fc]LB[fe:A]C[T: A is better.];B[ge];W[fe];B[gf];W[ih]
LB[gh:A][kh:B]C[Not sure how to respond to this

T: A safe way would be to run out at A. But perhaps W will get a moyo then by playing at B? So the cut you played seems reasonable.]
;B[if];W[jf];B[jg]C[this cut seemed ok for me];W[ig];B[ie];W[gg]

(;B[kg]LB[jd:A][kg:A]C[I was worried about my G15 group, is it safe.. how best to save it?? Or should I be on full attack mode now?

T: Well - isn't this full attack mode? A seems to be a safer move which exploits the main weakness of W. Were you sure you could fight your way out? If not, this is too aggressive.]
;W[le];B[id]LB[kc:C][jd:A][kd:B]C[Seems like a waste now.

T: Well - it is sente because of the cutting possibility Black A - White B - Black C. But it doesn't help Black much.]
;W[jd];B[fg]C[I figured I could try and push my way out];W[ff]
;B[hg];W[gh];B[hh];W[hi];B[hf]C[time to fight];W[ji]LB[ii:A]
C[T: This is a mistake as it leaves the possibility of black sente moves. If W had played A, you would not have been able to capture any w stones (check this!).]

(;B[ki]LB[gi:B][ki:A]C[I looked at my black group and thought I could make life, so I figured I would put pressure on these stones

T: No, you can't live! See the var. for the next move. But due to W's mistake, there is a way to get out. See var.]

(;W[gb]LB[gb:A][gi:A]C[White wanted me to respond, but didn't consider my next attack

T: If W plays A, you are dead!];B[gi];W[fh];B[fi];W[eh];B[hj]
C[eureka!];W[od];B[oc];W[pe];B[qd];W[nd];B[ql];W[qj];B[oj]C[Maybe this should be at S8 or P8?

T: No - Q8 is the move now which separates the w stones. P8 does not separate the white groups. S8 leaves a cut.]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[pm];B[oh]C[the next few moves are just to try and harrass white

T: I don't think W is obliged to respond as he is strong here.]
;W[ph];B[nf];W[oe];B[me];W[md];B[lf];W[og];B[oi]LB[nh:A]C[T: Why not A? You are strong here so you can afford some cutting points.]
;W[kf];B[lg];W[mc];B[re];W[rf];B[mb]C[T: This is too early to play gote endgame moves. The b moyo can still be developped.]
;W[lb];B[nb];W[mn];B[lp];W[nk];B[ok];W[gq];B[gr];W[go];B[hp]
;W[kj];B[jh];W[li];B[ii];W[nh];B[ng];W[mi];B[nm]C[This move took a minute or so to read.. I was hoping to connect to either the center or lower corner...  should I have thought about this earlier or is this ok?

T: The continuation shows that B is not in real problems so it's ok.]
;W[nn];B[mm];W[lm];B[ll];W[lo];B[kl]C[I figured this would hem in the center stones and further my lead]
;W[kp];B[lq];W[kn];B[jl]C[seems lik ea waste now, maybe I should have played E2? or S5?

T: Yes, it's not important. B15 and L3 are very big too.];W[fl]
;B[dl];W[kq]LB[er:A]C[T: This is a big move. B should answer at A to make the life secure.]
;B[np]C[T: Not good, probably you thought this was sente?];W[om]
;B[nl];W[fr];B[ho]LB[hq:A][er:B]C[seemed important to try and connect to the center

T: You can first capture at A. If W does not answer, you have no problems after B.]

;W[bq];B[bp]LB[ar:A]C[T: W's move was a mistake - you can punish it by playing A.]
