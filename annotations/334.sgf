C[wild : Thank you very much for reviewing this
game. I played white. Generally, with every move I could feel that my opponent is a class
better than me. He seems to be able to guess my intentions. I hope that you can point out my
mistakes, especially in my opening.];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp]
;B[pe]
(;W[jc]LB[ed:A][ec:B][fc:C]C[The move in the game is not a bad move (splits upper side)
However, there is a proverb: don't give your opponent two shimari.
So, A and B would be alternatives.
Also consider C. This move can't be pincered as severely as A.  Variations show some possibilities, but i'm unsure which is best.]
;B[hc];W[mc];B[he]C[black is quite ambitious]
(;W[cj]C[Perhaps you should defend the upper side group now. it's becoming weak.]
;B[je]
(;W[me]C[wild : I think I have seen w N15 in books before but I'm not sure.

Are there any better response to B K15?

N15 seems good i think.  an alternative in variation];B[qn]

(;W[qj]LB[np:a][nq:b][pj:c][pk:d]C[wild :

Is a w pincer here appropriate? I felt that if W had responded  at 'a' or 'a', B can reply with
'c' and then later attack W upper group and reap profits on the right side.

The pincer is not so good.   If you play a pincer, i would prefer c or d.  A high pincer can run away better if it gets pincered itself.

Moreover, white has still no territory and black a shimari and a moyo.  so black could answer whites pincer by taking the corner (see variation)

And the other possibilities?
a or b is not so bad i think.  White seems not to be in a position to fight with a weak group on the upper side.]

(;B[on];W[np];B[mn]
(;W[lp]C[the problem is that you can't keep running, even on the fourth line.
black get a cosmic moyo then.];B[qh]TR[qj]C[wild :  I felt W is in trouble now. The upper
group is still weak and now W has marked stones to worry about. What's W's best response here?

white got territory on bottom. so you shouldnt expect to make territory on right side too.
when in trouble:
1) Play lightly
2) make the situation easier to handle (e.g. by connecting groups, pressing on black etc)

Variations contain some attempts to show the idea]

(;W[mj];B[mh]C[white seems quite eyeless];W[ib];B[rp]
(;W[qq];B[kj]TR[rp]C[wild : Could I have ignored B's marked stone and jumped to L10?

that's a possibility (see variation). but gives black a big corner and a chance to destroy white's only secure territory]
;W[qe]LB[rh:a]C[wild : With this, I was hoping to create some sente at the area around 'a' so that I could create some eye space.]

the variations try some things]
