C[gonovice 23k*:  Game I played as black and lost
final score should have been w 96 b 83
if white had not forgotten to close an area

I am looking for any and all help preventing and stopping invasions

Many Thanks

Roger Allinson-French];B[qo]C[This is not a very usual move for a 23k* player but there is nothing wrong about it, of course.

I have been told that the usual way is to learn first 4-4 josekis, then 3-4 josekis, 3-3 josekis and only then 5-3 and 5-4 josekis.

Anyway go must be fun and this way you may get an advantage.]
;W[dd];B[pd]C[Good move

After r5, the upper right corner is more valuable than the down left corner.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[qf];B[rd]C[gonovice 23k*: was this the best move or would r11 or r12 or q12 have been better?

I think that trying to get the corner with s16 is not good now because you leave too many holes in the corner, r17, q18 so you dont secure the corner yet.

The usual answers would be:

Extension in the upper side:
o16, o17, n17

Or probably better pincers:

r12 ,r10, q12, q10];W[qi]C[white secures a base for his stones.]
;B[ql]C[R8 is small now.

when you have a corner enclosure like q3-r5 you must play at k3-k4 at the FIRST opportunity. Right now it is the biggest point in the board for both players.

r8 is a safe extension from r5 but dont put much pressure on white group. r9 would be a stronger attack.]
;W[cj]C[Not bad for white but i still think, k3 is bigger.]
;B[mc]C[same commentary.];W[gc]C[same commentary];B[jc]C[Again]
;W[jq]C[At long last ¡

Look at the whole board now, black has two, more or less, secured corners while white have almost half the board. Of course, he is open many invasions, so his territory is not secure but when black invade he will make territory while attacking.

Black has made a slow and restricted opening.];B[cn]C[First invasion at one of the usual points.]
;W[fq]C[As white have a stone at c10 i think he should have played at c5 then extension at f4.

This way he lets black get a base in the corner.];B[cp];W[cq]
;B[co]C[I think the proper move here would be d5.

black is now heavy and it is a good target for white];W[do]
C[I think that white d3 is probably better, making territory while attacking.

Black has now the option of playing b3 which makes a living shape

Look at the variation.]
(;B[cl]
(;W[cg]C[White defends his left side but he is still open to a c17 invasion.

I think that e10 would be better because if black invades, he could get a very good moyo.

 Look at the previous variation.]
(;B[mq]C[In my opinion it is a move in the right direction, but m3 threating an invasion at h3 would be better.

Anyway, a direct invasion at c17 or attacking white at p14 would be more active moves

The c17 invasion leaves white  with very few points so it is really big.   Look at previous variation]
;W[em]C[Not bad idea for attacking but  as i have told before, black can live playing at b3.

So it would be better for white to play first b3, and then if black dont defend e7.]
;B[of]C[Very good idea and good move.

White only weak group is r14-r11 and black should attack it not for a killing but for getting territory or strengh of both.

Of course, if white dont defend, or dont do it properly killing would be nice for black.]
;W[oh];B[lf]C[This move only try to make territory so it is not good.

Remember a good move must do at least twice of:

Secure a group
Attack a group
Make territory
Destroy territory];W[he]C[Not bad but again small.

c17, b3, k5, b9 better moves in my opinion.];B[je]C[gonovice 23k*: was this move too weak j13 better? or o8?

This move is not weak, in fact it is over strong, it makes black overconcentrated.

j13 it is not bad for reducing white future territory there

O8 is a good move for making a black moyo.

But again, i think that the moves i put before, especially c17 are bigger now]
;W[mh]C[White is not clearly alive yet so he must reinforce his weak group]
;B[kh]C[This is a good attacking move blocking white];W[hh]
C[Black has a chance to attacking white.

I like s12 move, look at the variation]
(;B[jj]C[gonovice 23k*: I'm not sure of this move it didn't gain territory perhaps 09 better?

Maybe you are too worried about just making territory.

Of course at the end of the game the player with more territory wins but usually the territory is made while attacking so you must think more about attacking, not just for killing but for getting strengh, territory or both.

Anyway, k10 indirectly attack the white group so it is not bad.]
;W[hj];B[nk]C[not very bad, but passive.];W[oj];B[ok];W[pk]
;B[pl];W[qk];B[jm]C[gonovice 23k*: I think this is where my problem started I think L7 would have been stronger

There is not a big difference between k7 and l7, i think both are playable, but it depends on where do you want to get your territory.

I think that black posible territory is on the line n3-n9 but maybe you thought you could get all from the line n3-n7.]
;W[jo];B[lo]C[gonovice 23k*: m6 better?

I think m5 is good enough but when you play moves like this you must be aware of the weaknees at l6.

M6 give white m5 option, but both are reasonable for black and white players.]
;W[kn]C[White must play at l6]
(;B[km]C[gonovice 23k*: last review I read showed the mistake of a m7 type move allowing a 2 way cut perhaps it would have been the move here

Anyway having made this move I now do not know how to stop whites invasion

I have no clues at all ... please help

Please look at the previous variation to see how m7 would have worked for black.

Usually when you try to stop an invasion you must retreat a bit so contact moves like l7 dont work

White have two open doors to your territory and you are just closing one, l7, and letting the other, m6, open wide.]
;W[ln]C[White of course goes in.

Right now, i dont see any way to get many territory here for black unfortunately.

Remember, many times the question is not how to get out of the problem, but to dont create the problem before.]

(;B[kp];W[lq];B[np]C[Forcing at m2, then p4 is better than o4.

Usually it is bad to make your opponent play moves like p5, o4 is an empty triangle also.]

C[Mistake by black, white could have killed the m8-l8 stones]

(;W[nj];B[lj]C[gonovice 23k*: now I should think about reducing white territory but I think it is too late

Yes, white is clearly on the lead now];W[rl];B[rm];W[rk]
(;B[rf]C[I think that a monkey jump would be better.

Look at the previous variantion.

Anyway there are much bigger points, b3, c17, b9, e8];W[rg]
;B[qe];W[qg]C[gonovice 23k*: is it possible to sucessfully attack white on right hand side I think r11 prevents it

Now it is too late, i have pointed out some posibilities for attacking before.]
;B[cc]C[Very very big point. it should be played before.];W[cd]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb];B[bd];W[be];B[bb]C[gonovice 23k*: would a16 be better?

No, the usual moves after a c17 invasion is hane and connection. b17 is the proper move for black]
;W[ad];B[bc]C[If you played  the previous move at b17 and white then hane at a16 you would have stopped him at a17, so this is a two point lose for black]

;B[ce];W[de];B[cf];W[bf];B[df];W[ef];B[hf]C[gonovice 23k*: perhaps h18 better?

I think h14 is an overplay by black, white could cut at j14.

Look at the variation]
(;W[gf];B[ig];W[hg];B[if];W[id];B[jd];W[ic]C[Very small.

B3, b9, d9, t7, k19 (another monkey jump) much bigger.];B[il]

;B[bj];W[bi];B[bk];W[dk];B[bh]C[I think this is a black overplay]

(;W[ch]C[Anyway white must though he was ahead so he played safely avoiding big problems.

 Not a bad strategy but you must be real SURE that you are ahead enough to give away these points.]
;B[bg]C[B13 is a bad move because you fill your own liberties so white can kill with a12.]
;W[dg]C[Better at a12];B[ai];W[ci];B[bq]C[this is a very important point, now not for living but very big in terms of territory for both players.]

(;B[qm];W[ro];B[rp];W[sf];B[re];W[fa];B[da]C[gonovice 23k*: been caught by playing e19 before

That is the hard way to learn go, being killed, but it is the most useful because you will always remember it]
;W[jb];B[kb];W[ia];B[pg];W[ph];B[so]C[gonovice 23k*: should have played this earlier ... lucky white didn't see it

Yes, but as you will notice later, you have exactly the same weakness at other part of the board, so it is even.]
;W[sl];B[sn];W[og]C[gonovice 23k*: invaded again and couldn't stop it

Yes you could stop it, but you must give the q13 stone, look at the variation]

(;B[pf];W[nf]
(;B[mg]C[gonovice 23k*: trying for a cut

Not the better option, look at the previous variation.];W[oe]
;B[pe];W[ng];B[ne];W[mf];B[lg]C[Instead of connecting you should have played at n15 keeping the top territory.

It is very important to know which stones are important and which are not.]

;W[hk];B[ji]C[When white filled your liberty you had to defend as you would see later.

Anyway it is small, because it is only one point in gote( gote means you lose the iniciative in japanese).

Keeping the iniciative, called sente in japanese, it is very very important through the whole game, but especially at the endgame.]

No chances];W[ep];B[fo];W[go];B[ho]C[gonovice 23k*: hoping (I know I shouldn't) for a lucky attack on j5 group]

gonovice 23k*: Thankyou

As a final comentary:

I think that you must try to "read" a little more ahead but most players, except maybe pros must do it.

You must try to see when a stone must be saved and when must be sacrifized.

Try to dont play contact moves, some times do make a proper defense you must give  some space.

Anyway, for you level I think you have played quite well, no  big blunders, dead groups and so on

So try to play often and review your games. This way you will achive the experience you dont have now.]
