C[Hi Xachriel.  Thank you for submitting your game for a review.  I hope that you'll find my comments helpful.  I'll precede all my comments with 'Sirkut>', the name I use on go servers.]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[dp];W[pd];B[jq];W[je]C[Sirkut> This is an agressive move by white.  It exerts only influence towards the center and does not claim any territory.]
;B[fc];W[ed];B[fd];W[fe];B[ge]TR[jc]C[Sirkut> To make this invasion secure quickly while not encouraging white to build up too much strength against you, you should quickly extend from your two-stone wall with a 3-space jump.  See the marked position.]
;W[gf];B[ee];W[ff];B[ec];W[dd];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cg]C[Sirkut> This has given white a very good position.  At this point it is best to leave it alone and seek compensation someplace else.]

;B[cc]C[Sirkut> Very well played, but I have to say that you got lucky.]
;W[gd];B[ca];W[he];B[gc]
(;W[hb]C[Sirkut> This is a simple mistake.  See the variation for the appropriate way to handle this invasion by black and save most of white's mojo by making a small sacrifice..]

;B[hd];W[ge]C[Sirkut> This is a wasted move by white.  White now still has a good wall facing his corner stone which he could use to create large moyo.]

;B[qn];W[ka]TR[ql]C[Sirkut> Wasted move by white.  A more typical response would be to play the marked position at R8 to match blacks claim of corner territory.]
;B[ma];W[lb]C[Sirkut> Both of the last moves are end-game moves.  There are much larger parts of the board with many more points to gain elsewhere.]
;B[cn];W[gq];B[gp]TR[dq]C[Sirkut> It is tempting to try an fence your opponent in, but by doing this you actually give them strong, concrete, territory - in exchange you get influence which doesn't guarantee points.  D3 would be a much safer move that would give you large solid points in the corner while leaving white in a tight squeeze.]

(;B[ei]C[Sirkut> Running here is very risky because you have nowhere really to run to.  Instead take your time and count liberties.  The white group at B5 has 3 liberties, as does the black group next to it at B6.  This means that if black plays first he should be able to kill the white group.  That would be a much easier way to stay alive.  See variation on the previous move.]

[is][js][ks]C[Sirkut> Thanks again for submitting this game for review.  I think the two of you were a good match for each other.  Unfortunately, other than the one that I made up, I did not see a ko in the T19 corner that you asked about.

My greatest advice is to try to not fight so much.  You'll notice that you'll do better when you do not play right next to your opponent's stones and instead look at the larger board.  The fewer stones you use to kill your opponent, the more territory there'll be left to capture.  So before thinking about how to directly respond to and attack your opponent, think 'where can I get the most territory with the last amount of effort?'  

Thanks again for submitting this game.  I wish you fun and luck! :)  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.]
