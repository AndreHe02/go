C[Dear reviewer, In is game I was black and I lost by 7,5 point cause of a lot of distraction mistakes.
I have few questions about the game, but I would like if you some suggests to improve.  ^^

Thank you very much!];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dq];B[cj];W[cl]LB[ce:D]
[de:C][cf:B][cg:A]TR[cj]C[How  i can anwer to  white 6?

Well, actually I looked up B5 (black nr.5) on gobase, and found it to be a move that caused Matsumoto Tokuji 80% losses, usually white would play C or D immediately...

But to answer your question, I think everything is okey, maybe C is a little questionable, judge for yourself

(;B[ce]LB[cg:A]C[A = variation]
(;W[cd]C[I think this move is bad, only strengthening black, you should be very satisfied :)]
;B[de];W[fd];B[dl]C[is this move good?

Well it rules out any invasions later on in the lower right corner, and seems a weird shape....]
;W[dm];B[dk];W[em];B[ic]LB[fc:C][hc:B][iq:A]C[is the right direction? or I shouol play on the lower side? (around A)

I think that depends on style. But in any case B15 should be at B white must answer C.]

Giving up the stones is 25 points, more or less, but the center is at least 30 points... so I think A might be enough, to keep the game simple, and still win]

No more comments from here on.

You did very well in the opening, and had loads of oppotunities to just finish the game, unfortunately you didn't.

I hope I supplied enough comments, that u understand! but please send me a message if you have questions.!]
