Hi I'm Carlo, a 15K from Italy, this is my first review
for GTL, so if there is anything not clear ,including my english :-) , please contact me.



My rank on KGS server is 24k, and I played as black. I'm glad if the review could be more on the white side bcoz im also weak as white.]
;B[ee]C[I still dont know what are the advantages starting with B e5 on 9x9 rather than 4-4, 3-4, or 3-3 point.

Well, I haven't a clear comprension of "fuseki" on 9x9 too, but  it seems to me that the power of e5 is it's polyvalence, a stone like e5 work's well in a great number of scenarios giving you high flexibility, it also assure you the connection betwen your stones making them powerful

On the other side it doesn't garantee any territory so give  to W the chance of "play first";
 it would be after the early moves that e5 will shows it's strenght because it work's on the power struggle not on the territorial one]
;W[cc];B[ec]
(;W[dg]C[
Pherhaps this stone, after W1 is over-concentrated on left side, this give a chance B to define immediatly the territoy, whith advantage]

(;B[cg]C[
This move look's strong, but IMHO there are less conplicated way's to archive advantage, see variation]
;W[cf];B[dh]
(;W[eh]C[
This move leaves too many cuts, this  enphatize the power of e5]
;B[df]C[im not sure in this move, whether i should atari with d4 or e3 or somewhere else?]
;W[eg];B[ce];W[ch];B[bg];W[gf]C[
Now B has only to hold the position];B[ci]C[
little, i think the struggle is aruond g7];W[di]C[
 idem];B[bh]C[

 g7 or g6 seems to be more urgent];W[bi];B[ge]C[this is also where i thought i make a mistake. bcoz white will take that corner upper right.

In my analisis the c3 stone is dead, so you can simply contain w whith g6and you win]

 i think it's better h5, see variation];W[hg];B[hd];W[if];B[ie]
;W[he];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[ie];B[gd];W[bd]C[the most important part for me. can white live in upper left area?
im not good at making a group in d corner alive, and often get crushed whenever i played as white.

I can't find a way to live for W.  I have the imprssion that W needs to play B6 and D8
in order to live, but there are no ways to make any of these stones sente.]

even d8 does not works];B[db];W[dc];B[be];W[ca];B[eb];W[ac]

This is a dead shape])))
(;B[he]TR[hg]C[ h5 seems to me as needing a reply as h4, otherwise h3 is a strong invasion, and it doesn't leaves you whith a weak stone

 Work on yuor feeling whith such quiet sente moves,
 sente it's different from attacking, it means just " needing a reply", so yuo have not to go for complication to hold sente.]

(;W[gg]C[
Playng light W can hold the balance.]
(;B[eg];W[df];B[ef];W[eh];B[fh];W[ch];B[gh];W[ge]C[
whith great complication])
(;B[df];W[ce];B[eg];W[hd]C[W can live in each corner and the game goes on]
)))
(;B[fg]
(;W[ce];B[gc]C[B wins])
(;W[gc];B[cf]C[
W still have no corner completely safe, B can always make double sente attacks, i think this cuold be enough to win easily.]
)))
(;W[eg]TR[cg][cf][gf][gg][he][ce][hf][bf]SQ[gc][gd]CR[df][dg]
C[
 Now W has triangles as good moves and squares as ambitios moves, depending on where B plays   B has almost all the triangles as interesting move's and the circle's too

I think the game is somehow balanced]))
