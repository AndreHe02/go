C[Hi.

This is a game I played some time ago, when I started to play in IGS (I've also modified the ranks). Now I look at it and still can't unserstand why I lost so big. As there weren't  any big groups dead, and I was already behind in yose, I guest my direction of play must be simply wrong. It's hard for me when to leave a zone and switch to another thing. I'd appreciate comments about that.

Thanks


For the record, I was playing white and I'll mark my comments with pajaro:]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qe];W[pn]C[pajaro: maybe this is the first mistake. I don't have a clear idea of what I must try to get during fuseki.]
;B[qn];W[qm];B[qo];W[pl]C[this looks too small, and makes no attempt to retain sente.  So far
you've forced black to secure his corner, and lost sente, for  a tiny
but safe group.];B[qh];W[qj]C[pajaro: As black should have played O4 instead of R12 (according to joseki) I guess that R10 is wrong. Perhaps, something around O4 myself?

Territory at R10 definitely looks small, but without R10 hopeless,
so white had to answer, and black has gained a lot.  I think R12
was OK for black.];B[oh]C[this is questionable though.  Black is making some
territory but relinquishes sente.  There are bigger
fish to fry.];W[np]C[pajaro: I played O4 after the R10-P12 exchange. Better not play it?

o4 is ok, it's the follow up that is flawed];B[oq];W[nq];B[nr]

This is unnecessary for white.  Both white groups should be ok
without this move, and it doesn't advance white's position except
to connect the groups.  Black is free to attack and reduce the  combined group.  I think J4 (or something near there) wold have
been a better choice.];B[fq]C[good (even if obvious) move for black.]
;W[hq]C[pajaro: is this pincer good here? Maybe too close  to the white wall?]
;B[fo];W[dn]C[i think it would have been better for white to continue on the other side, perhaps
at h5.  Build territory on the side, and puts as much pressure on black.  Black
is still free to attack both the corner and the side.];B[dr]

not the right place to respond - m5 would be my choice.];B[cj]

(;W[ch]C[Mistake - you have to respond on the inside, maybe c9,
or your territory is toast.];B[ej];W[ek]C[wrong - black is out.  You have one last chance to protect the lower
left side, and this doesn't do it.];B[dh];W[cg]C[looks passive, try d13]
;B[bl];W[dj]C[definitely wrong, you can't separate black this way]
;B[di];W[dk];B[ci];W[ei]C[what are you going for here?  Surely not the 1 black stone.  There's an entire
side still open!];B[eh];W[fj]C[pajaro: I took this black stone to get a good way out to the center.

The center is still wide open and  your group could still make eyes
on the side.  It's more important to make eyes, and keep black eyeless,
than to escape into the center.  The only exception would be if the center
was already enclosed, and in danger of becoming black territory.]
;B[bn]C[very good for black.  Black now has a base, and white has nothing left.]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[co];B[fi];W[gr];B[eo];W[do];B[ep]
(;W[jd]C[pajaro: instead of this, playing f2 would make black eye in e3 false. But is it worth doing it? Can black really be in danger?

Black around D11 is so strong, white around c13 is in danger.    The problem with playing this
loosely is that black can likely develop an attack on the white corner.    Simultaneously, an approach
from the side forced white to respond and builds a huge black territory in the top right corner.

All things considered, this move is likely to result in white occupying the top side while
black owns both corners - a disaster for white.];B[cc];W[dc]

;B[lc];W[jc];B[le]C[black has made a huge corner - enough to win the game all by itself
I think.];W[jf];B[ff];W[fe];B[gf];W[ge]C[pajaro: like in the lower side, I'm using my thickness to surround territory. I know I musn't do this, but what can I do?]

White needs to pay attention to loss of sente, and making each move serve
several strategic ends.  You must live AND make territory AND prevent black
from making territory AND kill black stones, in that order of priority.   Secondarily, you need to think in terms of where a natural probe-response sequence
will leave black with overwhelming influence.  Black made his big gains when white
responded naturally (and in the only way possible).  The flaw was in positioning white
stones where they could be pushed around to such great profit.]
