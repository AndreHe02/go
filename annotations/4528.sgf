C[kilroy [1k\]: hi

Hi, i was hoping you could give me some tips on my fuseki and middle game, I would like to know how to attack black better, i seemed to have failed. I would also like to know which exchanges do nothing for me

Basti: There wasn't much of a fuseki as the middlegame began more or less at move 5.

To attack your opponent you need to be in a strong position but you did attack when you weren't and ended up being the one under attack. (moves 12,16 and 66)]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[ep];W[pc];B[pe]C[Joseki choice? i didn't want to waste one of my bioyomi chosing, and i didn't think of anything better after the game

Basti: I think your move is ok.];W[pd];B[qe];W[oe];B[of];W[ne]

;B[nf];W[me];B[kc]C[here i though i had to be agressive, attack to make you safe, but i can't let black get all the territory

Basti: You can't attack your opponent from a weak position.]
