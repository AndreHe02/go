C[I got killed in the middle of the game. What are the wrong moves that I did?

----

*X*: Hi, pleasure to be reviewing for you.  Hope I can be of help, although my specialty is fuseki and whole board analysis, not fighting and life-and-death.

My comments will be prefixed by *X* for "Xopods" (my KGS username).  Hope they'll be of use.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[df];W[qf]C[dont know what to do with 5

----

*X*: Black 5, although a valid beginning to a joseki, is not very common, at least in amateur games.  Without checking my joseki dictionaries, I suspect that if you wanted to answer locally, something like F16, G17 or some kind of loose pincer like D10 would all be acceptable.

It's not very severe, so tenuki is okay.  HOWEVER, this is the wrong direction to approach Q16 from.  O17 provides some long distance support for D17, especially if Black Q14 and White K16 follow.  Mistakes in direction like this are very common among kyu-level players.]
;B[nd];W[qn]C[*X*: I would almost consider this a trick play.  If Black plays O3 or O4, then Q10 becomes ideal for White.  But Black should play on the point of symmetry at Q10 himself, and attack both White stones.]
;B[qk]C[is this a good move?

*X*: Right idea, wrong move.  You need to separate the two White stones, so this move is good in that sense.

The problem is the point you chose for it.  Two space low pincer to the low approach to hoshi is almost always wrong (in fact, it's the ONLY pincer that isn't joseki... all high pincers are joseki, and 1 and 3 space low pincers are joseki).  Q10 is the right move, in my opinion.  

Furthermore, it's bad because it lets White make a base for the weaker stone by playing R11.  If you're not going to play on the line of symmetry, then you want to play closer to the weaker stone, e.g. at R12.  But I still like Q10 better, because it prevents both stones from making an ideal base.]
;W[rd]LB[qi:a][nn:b]C[shouI be playing somewhere like a or b?

*X*: "a" is the only move.  Makes a base, and puts pressure on the Black pincer stone.]
;B[qh]C[is that good?

*X*: Yes... it's the right move for Black, and shows why S16 is wrong.]
;W[fq]C[*X*: Definitely NOT the right time to tenuki.  You can treat R6 lightly and look for a way to sacrifice it, but playing R17 to stabilize the top right White group is EXTREMELY urgent.]
;B[jq]C[*X*: This is big, but R17 is still the only move, for either player.  If White gets it, it steals all the Black corner territory while setting the White group... if Black gets it, he gets a big corner and leaves White's stones eyeless and surrounded.]
;W[qq]C[*X*: Two stones in danger in the top right, one stone in danger here.  Locally, this move is okay, but the top right is more important.]
;B[qp];W[rp]C[*X*: Q3 first is better.]
(;B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[ql]C[*X*: UGH!  Black can seal you in, and probably kill.  You need Q3.  Besides... with the position R6 is in, you should be treating it as if it was kikashi.]

(;B[pl]C[*X*: No.  Hane in response to contact is usually good, but here it gives White too much sabaki potential.  Play solidly, at Q9, and White has nothing.]
;W[pm];B[pq]C[*X*: No.  If you were going to try to kill the corner, you should have done so immediately, instead of exchanging Q8 for Q7.  White should let you have the corner and destroy your position on the right side.  Hane-counter hane is NOT the time for tenuki.]
;W[pr]C[*X*: But White answers.  White should abandon the corner and cut at Q9.  Destroying your position on the right and threatening to connect his weak groups is worth WAY more than a small corner.]
;B[qr]C[*X*: Clearly wrong, as the continuation shows.];W[rr]
;B[or];W[qs]C[*X*: White lives easily, when correct play would give a ko to kill.]
;B[rl]C[*X*: I like Q9 better.];W[ol]C[*X*: Right.];B[qm]
(;W[on]C[*X*: Too solid.  Think about it: why should White want to save ALL those stones?  They aren't doing anything.  They should be treated lightly.  White should be playing sabaki.  Black should O7 now.]
;B[nm]C[*X*: Good.];W[om]C[*X*: Well, I guess if you were going to start playing solidly, at least this is consistent.  But this position should be REALLY painful to you.]
;B[no]C[*X*: No.  O11 or thereabouts.  Threatens to kill White top right with R17, and also attacks the ugly White dumpling you've created.  One or the other would be bound to die.]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[mm]
(;B[mo]C[*X*: Too easy on White.  See variation.];W[lm];B[cn]
C[*X*: I know I've said it three times already, but R17, for the love of god!]
;W[co];B[dk]C[*X*: Ugh.  Acceptable responses to hane-tsuke, from most to least common are nobi (D6), ikken tobi (E6), or counter-hane (D5).  White at D6 is too powerful to allow.]
;W[cl]C[*X*: Ugh.  White's immediate reaction should be D6, without even thinking about it.]
;B[bn]C[*X*: Wrong way.  D6 is still THE move.];W[bo]C[*X*: White should D6.  I'm sounding like a broken record.]
;B[dn]C[*X*: At last!];W[dl]
(;B[el]C[*X*: Ordinarily, C9 would be bad shape, but here I think it's sort of your only option, since it makes miai of hane above or below the White stones to connect/escape.  This hane lets White cut off your three stones.]
;W[ek];B[dj];W[em];B[fl]
(;W[fk]C[*X*: Argh!  White throws away his chance.  White must D7.  See variations.]
;B[dm];W[de]C[*X*: Really odd move.  Would be an ordinary shimari without Black D14, but keep in mind that orthogonally or diagonally adjacent stones COMPLETELY change the meaning of a move.]
;B[cd];W[ce]C[this is the part I got killed

*X*: This shouldn't work for Black, I don't think.  Might be able to live in the corner, but White will profit more with correct play.]
;B[dd];W[ed];B[cb]C[*X*: This move is ridiculous.  C17 and you're fine!]

(;W[bd]C[*X*: Terrible move!  Why would you force your opponent to connect his stones?  This should go against every instinct you have.]
;B[cc];W[eb];B[bf];W[be];B[cf];W[ef];B[fc];W[ec];B[fb];W[fi]
;B[fe];W[ee];B[fd];W[eg];B[qc]C[*X*: Finally!];W[bl]C[*X*: This is probably actually a good move.  The continuation is actually very complicated, though, and I'm not sure what the proper result is.  Looks to me like White wins.  However, you and your opponent deviate from the main line very quickly.  See variation for one possible result.]

(;B[en]
(;W[fn]C[*X*: This is absurd.  F7 is the only move worth thinking about.]
;B[fo];W[gn];B[cq]C[*X*: Man, you really like it complicated, don't you?]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[bp];W[cr];B[br];W[ds];B[ao];W[rc]C[*X*: Good.]
;B[kc]C[*X*: S18 first.  Don't let White live so easily.  Other than that, this is a good move.]
;W[ic]C[*X*: Too deep, too close to thickness.  Should die with e.g. Black at K15.]
;B[jd]C[*X*: This is good.];W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[hd];B[he]
;W[ie]C[*X*: Doesn't work.]
(;B[je]C[*X*: No.  You MUST cut.  See variation.]
(;W[hf]C[*X*: No!  Why do you insist on forcing your opponent to connect his stones?  This is completely the wrong direction.  See variation.]

[bk][dk][bl][cl][dl]C[*X*: Very wrong.  C9 is the critical move for life and death of ALL the marked stones.  See variation.]

;B[ad];W[il]C[*X*: The game is over.  White should resign. No further comments.

Overall comments:

a) Both players are very weak.  Usually GTL assigns games to reviewers about 5 stones stronger, but these players are definitely not 7k, more like 20-something.  Unless the policy has changed, either this game was assigned to me by accident, or the person submitting it misrepresented the ranks of the players involved.

b) At this stage of your progress in studying Go, you need to learn basic tactics.  Very fundamental errors are being made, like forcing the opponent to do things he wants to do anyway, like connecting weak stones... I recommend The Second Book of Go, and the Basic Instinct page at Sensei's Library: http://senseis.xmp.net/?BasicInstinct]
