Hello Isabell

I'm MightyHika, a.k.a Mighty or Hika or MH, you pick one ^_^
my comments will be marked with a -MH- before them

playing stronger players is good, but it helps to play people your level too.

don't forget to check out my final notes at the end

MH];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[nc]TR[dn][dp]
C[-MH- It's ok to tenuki here, but white has to be careful with black C8. that's the weak point of the marked formation.]
;B[qf];W[jd];B[cf]
(;W[ch]LB[cl:A]TR[ci][di][cj][dj]SQ[dn][dp]C[-MH- this pincer is ok. but i would go somewhere arround the marked triangles since against the formation of D4-D6 black has an awkward move at C8

See variation at c11];B[cl]LB[eh:A][cj:B][fn:C]C[-MH- black takes advantage of white's formation. i dont find it easy to deal with C8, but one thing is for sure: when dealing with invasions such as this, you ought to avoyd touching the invading stone(s).

i've considered A, B or C for white];W[dk]C[-MH- as i said in the comment before, you dont want to touch invading stones. by touching them, you're only making them stronger]
;B[dl];W[el];B[em]C[-MH- you shouldnt push black to where you're weak, namely, D4 afnd D6]

(;W[fl]C[ see variation];B[dm]C[-MH- D4 and D6 are starting to get under some pressure. white's corner is in danger]
;W[fo]TR[el]SQ[dm]C[What did I do wrong with d7? >_<

-MH- yes, the marked exchange did weaken d6. you have to think before playing. try to see what's going to happen when your opponent answer your move]
;B[fm]C[Isabell [-\]: Hm. I'm a goner. :)];W[gl];B[gm];W[il]
C[-MH- you're going the wrong way here. you should be more concerned about those three stones at the corner.

if you feel like adding some stones to the F8 group, i'd start at E10 or so]
;B[hm]LB[ij:A][hl:B]C[I should've connected at this peep, shouldn't've I? It caused me trouble later on.

-MH- yes, since you playd j8 you should protect your investiment at A or B]
;W[qn];B[pl]
(;W[on]C[Instead of going here, I should've tried r3 or r4 to try to get *something there*.

-MH- maybe going to R3 is a good follow up to R6, Q8, but p6 isnt bad either.

see variation];B[np];W[nl];B[qo];W[qm];B[hl];W[fj];B[hk];W[ej]
;B[bj];W[bh];B[go];W[dr];B[fc]
(;W[ee];B[db]C[I know there's a joseki with this one but for the life of me, I couldn't remember it.

-MH- E15 is a mistake.  see variation];W[cb];B[cc];W[dc];B[bb]

(;W[cd]C[-MH- this is a mistake. C18's sacrifice aims for the upper side.
see variation];B[ca];W[bc];B[cb];W[be]LB[pb:B][qc:C][pk:A]C[-MH- saving one stone is very small at this point. there are bigger moves, such as Q9, Q18 or R17. Plus, if you want to save that stone, better to just go B16.]
;B[ac];W[bd];B[pb];W[qk];B[ro];W[pg];B[qg];W[qh];B[co]
(;W[cn]C[-MH- white cant play that way. see variations];B[bn]
;W[bm];B[do];W[cp];B[bo];W[ep];B[fp];W[bl];B[bk];W[en];B[eo]
;W[bp];B[er];W[br];B[fn];W[pi];B[gd];W[hb];B[fb];W[hd];B[ge]
;W[hi]C[-MH- this moves doesnt accomplishes much. maybe you should aim at locking up black's top-right corner and try to build some influence.]
;B[nd];W[mc];B[nf];W[nh];B[ld];W[lc];B[lf];W[mo];B[mp];W[he]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[ef];W[df];B[eg];W[dg];B[gg];W[hg];B[gh];W[gi]
;B[di];W[ci]LB[hh:B][ji:A]C[-MH- you cant connect D13 group with E10 group after black D11. you shouldnt play at C11, best to just conect your weak group with A or B]
;B[dj];W[eh];B[cj];W[dh];B[ei];W[gj]TR[gi][hi]SQ[fj]C[-MH- this is a dull move. you needlessly made the bad shape of the ugly triangle and remains the push/cut at H12. this move should've been at H12 or K11]
;B[gb];W[jg];B[ll];W[ed]C[Was this move really needed?

-MH- sorry, but i dont know if that group can actually be killed. Maybe would be best to play A16 to secure life.]

-MH- Well played. some advices: you have to realize where you're weak. you should fix your weakenesses and attack your oponnent's, not the other way around. be careful when you're pushing the enemy. attack with a purpose. if you can kill, kill, but only chasing can be very profittable, if you know where to chase to.

you should work on your connections too. if you're not careful, you can get a weak group floating around the enemy's backyard.

Hope comments were useful, and good luck
