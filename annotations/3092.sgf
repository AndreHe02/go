;B[dp]C[Reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to review my game, I greatly appreciate it! i think My opponent is strongger than me, i know it because i had some game with him before this  ,and i lost them all. so, it was my first time i can beat him. ^_^

but it was lucky i think, i had interesting way to make my lower right alive. beside that, i think he took the lead from start.]

(;B[cl]LB[dk:A]TR[dd][de]C[i am not sure about this fuseki , cause it feel like i play in wrong direction. what do you think? is a move around F4 better?

- I think you did the right thing. Because the marked stones are high, the side is very big for white. A more distant pincer might be better though. See variation, for advantages and disadvantages. Do not get me wrong, the C8 is the most popular pincer and is probably just fine here, but maybe worth taking a look at  the D9 alternative.

- A move around F4 might be ok, but I think that is too easy for white. Because of those high moves at the top again.]
;W[cq]C[- This is indeed the biggest move for white probably. I think this was most likely to happen. And personally now I would have been more satisfied if my C8 stone was at C9 or D9. it would have been better balance.]

(;B[dq]LB[ip:C][jp:A][kp:E][iq:D][jq:B][kq:F]TR[cp]C[- Important mistake here. This is a move that should only be played with a stone around A-F. Instead black should play the marked position.]

(;B[mq]C[i keep play it simple, and try to make solid wall with sacrifiecing K2 group.
your comment??

- here you are sacrificing too much. K2 is not just 6 points. Cuttingstones are usually very big. When those stones are killed, the weak K4 group will become a very strong attacking group. On top of that your f4 group will become a weak group.]

C[i realize from now, that two ko(s) that my lower right group have make them allive.
interesting i think. little comment maybe?

- Yes this is a typical double ko situation. Very rare, and unconditional alive in 99% of the games. ==> not always, since there can be 2 double ko situations in a game. In that case there could be repetitions of the game which are not allowed according to the rules I think. Example see variation. But that kind of situation is hardly ever seen in games, ofcourse.]

(;W[ml];B[ll];W[qr];B[sq];W[sm];B[sk];W[rq]C[he still takes the ko, looks like he have way to kill my lower right.
are my groups really alive unconditionally??

- Yes pretty much unconditionally. Chances are small to have a 2nd double ko in this game.]

i think the game still close and hard to decided who lead.

- Hmm, I do think black is leading, also black still has sente. ... on the other hand, the e7 group is worth attacking while taking away the J14 territory .

I hope my comments was useful. See you on kgs maybe.
