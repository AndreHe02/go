My own thoughts on this game, is I got the upper-hand and in the last 100 moves, I lost by myself :) I think I played very poorly.]

* Yes. W should have played P16 bebore F18.];B[od]C[* Usually, a move like P16 wants more influence on the right side, while P17 gets the corner. In this game, I think P17 is a better choice since P16 leaves N17 very good for w.]
