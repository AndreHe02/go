;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[ce];B[jd]C[This move is probably in the wrong area. You are playing closer towards whites strength, making whites low opening pay off. A better idea might be to play F3, so that if white merely defends, she will be overcompensated. Another aspect is sente/gote; this move is very passive, and gives white the opportunity to decide where the game is going to go next; you have given up most of the benefit of having the starting move.]
;W[qj];B[qg]C[This is a good move, gives you a wide corner, with potential for much territory.]
;W[qm];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr]C[This is probably too early. There is no hope for putting pressure on white's left group yett, and the actual points gained is not worth much.]
;W[cq];B[kp]C[Might be one step closer to the white stone.]
;W[cj];B[hp]C[This is definitely too close. If white wants to run, she will welcome close moves like this, that invite fighting. A better idea is to run out with F7, securing access to the center, or simply H5, locking down the side.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[gp];B[ho];W[fp];B[gq];W[eo];B[fn]C[Here the position is magnificent for you; you have the whole bottom edge, balanced by whites left edge, but then you have bigger corners, and more opportunity to pressure white's right-hand group.]
;W[hr];B[jq]C[This is a technical blunder. The correct response is J2, so you do not lose a liberty in the race between H2 and F3. I would say if any single move cost you the game, this did. Too much wasted opportunity and territory.]
;W[eq];B[jo]C[This is also too close, and probably the wrong focus entirely. At this point you are behind, and you should welcome a fight between whatever white would potentially try from J4 and your H5/F5 group. Perhaps merely sente, play Q17]
;W[hd];B[ic]C[There is no reason to play along the edge here; white already have a low stone at D17 making sure there is no danger of any weak white group, and the points gained by you playing there before white does is only worth it towards the end-game.]
;W[hc];B[if]C[This is a slow move. You are slowly building a mojo, but white expands her own at the same pace, and you are behind.]
;W[pc]C[Very big move, you should have considered playing there yourself at some point. Your best bet is to build a solid group so you can better attack R7.]
;B[oc];W[qc];B[qd];W[ob];B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]C[This is too small. If white plays R15 you can press her to the edge with Q15->14 then S13. Right here you can attack white's right group instead.]
;W[nb];B[mc]C[Again very small, and letting white keep sente when you desperately need it yourself.]
;W[po]C[White is kind and gives you a chance to become more solid]
;B[oo]C[This is too close to the white stone (white welcomes fighting, she wants to strengthen the group) and the point gain is again worthy of endgame only.]
;W[pp];B[pq];W[qo];B[rp]C[White can now follow at S5 and have life for her group.]
;W[on];B[no]C[This is again small; it does not matter if white threatens the P5 stone, or reduces the 4-space-wide territory you have by two lines.]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[nj]C[White should now feel secure in life or escape.]
;B[nh]C[You are following white again when you have sente moves elsewhere; instead press white on the left edge, before returning here.]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[ph];B[pg]C[You can see how this is bad shape for you. The Q13->R14 stones form an empty triangle. Better is R12 yourself, and if white invades, you counter-invade and gain more.]
;W[qh];B[pn]C[This move does nothing. If you want to press at O7 and P8, do so without this move first. White can just play Q7 and your stone is made harmless.]

(;W[qn]C[Not optimal by white, but it does not matter.];B[nm]
;W[om];B[ol];W[pm];B[ml]C[This is too loose; you are giving white too much opportunity for threats. Play the safe O8 instead.]
;W[lj]
(;B[pl]C[This does little for you; white has easy ways to block you off and in so doing secure more eyespace and territory. Consider instead O11, to make a grab for the center.]
;W[ql];B[oj];W[pj]
(;B[ok]C[Play instead O11 as in previous variation.];W[nk]
(;B[nl]C[Another opportunity to play O11, but with a different likely outcome.]
;W[ni];B[sn]C[Much too early, this is an endgame move, that should in any case be at T7.]
;W[ro];B[so];W[rm]C[White is kind, and gives you an opportunity to play elsewhere. White could have played something like K10 instead, ignoring the tiny potential territory along the right edge.]
;B[sm];W[sl]C[Again you should play elsewhere. The three stones are not worth much compared to other potential moves, especially along the left edge, disturbing white.]
;B[qq];W[rk];B[rh]C[Another premature endgame move. White is already alive thanks to Q6 and S8]
;W[ri];B[sh];W[si]C[The two stones are worth little, this is still endgame territory; leave the area and move elsewhere.]
;B[sf];W[ej];B[gf];W[fe];B[ge];W[fd];B[gd];W[gc];B[ff];W[ef]
;B[em];W[dm];B[el];W[dl];B[mh]C[Very small.];W[li]C[...But white unnecesarilly answers]

(;B[ee]C[This is unnecesarry; play the move you are aiming towards: E13. The E15 weakness has to be taken into account by white anyway, and will be a better future weakness if you do not explicitly play it out.]
;W[ed];B[eg];W[df];B[eh];W[ch];B[di];W[ci];B[dj];W[dk];B[ek]
;W[fj]C[Horrible by white, who should abandon the single stone and extend from M10.]
;B[hj]C[Too close! You do not have to take white off the board, only make sure he does not connect. K10 secures a much larger territory.]
;W[dh];B[ei];W[gj];B[hi]C[The single stone is unimportant, white cannot hope to live anyway. Extend your area with K10!]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[jh];B[jg];W[ih];B[hh];W[jj];B[ik];W[ij];B[jk]
;W[kk];B[kl];W[ll];B[lm];W[lk];B[jm]C[This is the wrong place to protect. Too many loose connections makes you voulnerable. Just connect solidly at K8 or even H9; white cannot do anything within such a solidly black area.]
;W[ig];B[jf];W[hg]
(;B[gh]C[This is being too kind on white. See the alternative.]
;W[gg]
(;B[hf]C[This link is not as important as the F13 one.];W[fg]
;B[fh];W[hk];B[gk];W[hl];B[fk];W[en];B[gi];W[ib];B[jb];W[id]
;B[jc];W[ha]
(;B[ir]C[This is the wrong order of threats; make white connect within what is her own territory, before you make her take your groups off the board.]
;W[fr];B[go];W[gr];B[mb];W[na];B[ja]C[This can be ignored by white, there are bigger endgame plays.]
;W[fb];B[ia];W[hb];B[ma];W[pa];B[op];W[kg]
(;B[lf]C[Again you are being too kind with white. Block directly, white cannot capture O12 because of the N11 liberty]
;W[kf];B[ke];W[kh];B[dg];W[cg];B[ii]C[Gote move, play sente moves first.]

[qs][rs][ss]C[There are a few items that repeat themself in this game.

You tend to follow white around, and to give up sente too easilly. Try to look for moves and move sequences that will end up with white playing last, and you getting to play elsewhere first.

You tend to play too close to weak stones that you could capture/chase; you should always attack from afar, and only play close when you are defending or playing out a tactical sequence.

You probably need to work a bit on estimating the score, or perhaps just play a bit more risky when you are behind. You fall back and give up points multiple times in this game, where you could have stood your ground and fought. Even if you can't read something out, if you always play on the safe side, you cannot catch up.

As for the right hand side group, you should have attacked it sooner, and not let white have the first move. You had a good setup for chasing white and in so doing building territory, but instead white lives by threatening you.


Hope this is to your benefit, that you learn something from my advice. Please don't assume that I am right on all points. Though I have done my best, I am an amateur not that many stones stronger than you, and make mistakes. Feel free to ask further questions by email if you are unsure of a point I make.]
