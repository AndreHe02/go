RE[W+17.50]

C[Dear Reviewer,
I am abennun, playing Black in this game.
I lost by 17.5 points. I played the 3-in-a-row fuseki. The opponent first invaded my territory and reduced it minimum, and then secured his part of the board. Since it happened more than once in my game, I would like to get your professional help. What I ask you is to tell me:
1. Did I manage his invasions correctly?
2. Did I approached his territory in the right way?
3. What other points in my game should be improved?
Thanks!

z -- Hello!  My name is Bill, "zinger" on KGS.  I'll try to help as best I can.  My comments are marked with "z -- "

However, since you won't be likely to get "professional help" from myself or any 1k player, I suggest you receive my comments with a critical eye.  Seek advice from a stronger player, if you think it warranted, and by all means tell me if my thoughts turn out to be wrong.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[qd]C[z -- looks normal so far.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[mc]C[Black response is not according to the standard joseki. In the following sequence Black took over the corner, but White has established a strong group in the upper part of the board. I do not know if Black should be satisfied with the results.
What do you think?

z -- without looking forward, I would say that taking the corner and giving white strength contradicts the spirit of the san-ran-sei fuseki.  Black should try to confine white and build a moyo on the outside.]

(;B[oc]C[z -- a proverb: don't push in if you're not going to cut.  I suggest M16 instead, pursuing the goal of sealing white in.]
;W[ob];B[me];W[ld]C[z -- white gets the key point.];B[md];W[kc]
;B[lb];W[kb];B[nb];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[qb]C[Is this good enough for Black?

z -- I would call this result equal.  But, black could have gotten a superior result with M16 earlier.]
;W[qm]C[Now comes a White invasion. I am not sure about Black next move. Is R9 better?

z -- I think R5 is best.  Black's stone at Q10 is well supported by the black thickness above, and so needs no help.  Whereas, the Q4 stone is all by itself.]
;B[qo]C[z -- correct, I believe.];W[rj]
(;B[qk]C[Is this the correct way, or R11?

z -- I think black S9 would be better than R9 or R11.  See variarions.]
;W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[pm];W[pi]
(;B[rm]C[z -- not big enough at this stage.  Black should continue building outside strength with P11.]
;W[qj]
(;B[qn]C[z -- this should be at P10 - there's no reason to let white give atari there.]
;W[rf]C[White has managed to secure a bigger territory than I would like him to have...]
;B[re];W[oj];B[pk];W[co]C[z -- as white, I think I would move to reduce black's thickness instead of making this shimari.]
;B[le]C[Initially I though this forcing move is good because it builds some options for Black in the center, but apparently the presence of the White group there nullifies this options...

z -- Perhaps, but black can still unsettle white with S12, so this might be useful.  In any case I don't think it loses anything.  Next the focus should be around K4, a play in this area would be very big for both sides.]
;W[la];B[pg];W[qg];B[jq]C[z -- good direction.  I would choose K4 instead (after K3 white has possible future reducing moves at K5 or L4), but this may be just a matter of taste.]
;W[pf]C[z -- this white move is unimportant and should be ignored.  It does not threaten to cut through at O16 because black has a snap-back.]
;B[oi]C[z -- good move.  Also K5 or L6 could be considered - black would build a large territory that white could not easily reduce.]
;W[oh];B[ni];W[og]C[z -- now the cut is threatened.];B[mh]C[z -- good !  This contains white and makes the cut unimportant.  Black has a good game going.]
;W[kq]C[Now comes in the second invasion.

z -- this feels like a desperation move.  White is losing his nerve in the face of black's moyo.  Capping at K5 is better for white.]
;B[jp]C[z -- good];W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[z -- don't touch what you are attacking.  Q3, Q2, or P2 would be better.  Also turning solidly at L3 looks good, if black doesn't mind letting white live.]
;W[kp];B[ko]C[z -- good];W[mp]
(;B[or]C[Now I think that M5 is better than this move for Black. White will leave, but very small. With P2, in contrast, White gets a much stronger group.

z -- I agree, M5 would be much better.  It's not even obvious that white can make a live shape.  I put in a variationor two, but they are not thought out thoroughly, just ideas.]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[ln]
(;B[jo]C[z -- L7 is the only move for black here.];W[ll];B[jk]
C[z -- odd shape - leaves a potential split by white at K8.]
;W[mr];B[np]C[z -- this doesn't accomplish much, other than losing sente.  I don't think black should be trying to kill white, but rather to confine him as much as possible, and keep sente.  Tenuki is possible: F3, C14, or K15 look like good points.  Peeping at L7 first also looks possible, but white might ignore that.]
;W[no];B[op];W[km];B[jm];W[nm]C[z -- I think white could tenuki here.]
;B[kl];W[mk];B[lm];W[mm];B[lk];W[ml];B[mj]C[White does not make many points, but erases most of Black moyo and ending in sente...
Was the last Black move a slack one?

z -- in this context I think it is.  Certainly, it would be annoying to have white poke through here with M10, but white's next move is too big to allow.  Black needs to play on left side first, maybe C14, D10, or almost anywhere over there.  I like D10 best.]
;W[dj]C[This is a large point... How should black invade the left part of the board?

z -- it is difficult now.  Black's thickness from K3 and up is mostly wasted.  Black could try invading at D8, but this doesn't threaten white much - it only splits.  Worse, a white hane at L15 is starting to look very big.  Maybe black should just dive in at C17, and hope that his own central thickness can nullify white's.  Even then I would not be optimistic as black, however.  I'm really not sure, you might run this position by a stronger player.]
;B[di]C[I select to start a contact fight, but I am not too happy with the results. White has a strong presence in the bottom left part , and or the top White has a strong group also. What is the best move?

z -- see previous comment.];W[cj];B[ci];W[ei]
(;B[eh]C[z -- turning at B10 instead might give black a better chance.]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[ch]
(;B[bi]C[z -- this gives white alot of profit.  Perhaps bending around at D14 is better; white could not connect underneath.]
;W[cf];B[fi];W[ej];B[cc];W[dc];B[ce]C[z -- interesting !];W[df]
;B[de];W[ee];B[cd];W[cb]C[z -- white could also connect at E14, let black live in gote, and secure the top side for the win.]
;B[ef];W[bh];B[ed];W[fe];B[fd];W[ge];B[db];W[ec];B[bb];W[eb]
;B[ca];W[fh]C[z -- too greedy !]
(;B[fg]C[z -- missing a chance.  G17 is much bigger.];W[gh]
;B[gg];W[hg];B[hh];W[gi];B[hi];W[gj];B[hf];W[ig];B[if];W[jg]
;B[gf]C[Should Black play G17, giving up E13 group and capturing E17?

z -- black should have done so earlier, when it cost less in the center.  Right now, I'm not sure.]
;W[hd];B[jf];W[ij];B[hj];W[hk];B[gk];W[fj];B[ik];W[hl];B[ii]
;W[jj];B[ji];W[lj];B[kk];W[gm];B[dp]C[Now I start a contact fight on the bottom left, trying to reduce White territory the to minimum.
In my calculation, White is already leading, so Black is in a bad situation...

z -- I agree, white is ahead, perhaps 20 or so points.  There is a big endgame play for black at F18 ... but a white play around G4 would also be big.

Objectively, I think black cannot win, so starting a ruckus is as good a plan as any.  Of course, this should not work, but we are amateurs after all ...]
;W[eq];B[ep]C[z -- in the spirit of the last comment, pushing in at C4 might be better - if black pulls something off, he might have a chance again.]
;W[fp]C[z -- too greedy.  white C4 is an easy win.];B[fo];W[gp]
;B[go];W[ho];B[hn];W[gn];B[hp];W[eo];B[fn];W[en];B[fm];W[fl]
;B[em];W[dm];B[el];W[dl];B[io];W[ek];B[ho]C[This is the most I could do, and clearly it is not enough. I think White leads by 30 points at least, and what happens from this point is Black effort to reduce this lead. The final result is only 17.5 points, but there is no real danger for White's victory. Your comments on the yose are welcome as well.

Thanks!

z -- I think more like 20 points.  Still a probable loss, but a strong yose could make it close.  I did sprinkle some yose comments, and a summary at the end.]

C[z -- too soon for one point gote plays.  Better points include T8, two points in sente; H7-J8, 3 points or so in sente; or P6, 2 or 3 points in gote.  There may be others.]

;W[gd];B[lm];W[ga];B[km];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[z -- I think you played a good game.  I found only a few points where I could say with certainty that your play was inferior.  It was hard to see a pattern to your mistakes.  Perhaps inconsistency: you should try to make individual moves that fit the overall strategy.  In this game you chose san-ran-sei, which announces goals of speed, strength, and moyo.  But some of your moves contradicted this theme, playing on the inside instead of the outside, for example black 13, 35, and 61.

This game was not easy to comment, I think for two reasons: first, you and I are quite close in strength, perhaps too close for me to be reviewing your games.  Second, you played the san-ran-sei moyo-building fuseki, which I consider a weakness in my own game.  If you feel shortchanged for these reasons, feel free to submit the game to GTL again and request a stronger reviewer.  Hopefully they could accommodate such a request.  If you do, please alert me, I would like to see how a strong player's thoughts on this game compare to my own.
