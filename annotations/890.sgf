C[HI I'm Andrew.
I've only been playing Go for a bit over a month and a  half and am not actually sure what rating I am.

This game, I was playing black.  I've never seen a  game that makes a shape quite like this one. I lost by  4.5 points and I think it's because I was playing it safe  for some moves where I should have been more  agressive.  anyway see what you think, Thanks in  advance for your  review.]
;B[de]C[If you play the 5-4-point you go for outward influence and give the corner to your opponent. This is ok if you know how to play it, but as a beginner you should usually try to make some territory in the corner as it is easier to play.]
;W[dq];B[qd];W[op];B[oc];W[cc];B[ec];W[ce];B[cf];W[hc]LB[jc:a]
[gb:b]TR[cd]C[unsure here wether to play at a or b

I doubt either would be useful. as for b it doesn't do much. You neither get eany territory nor influence, nor is there a real threat for the white stone. A play on a would probably leave a weakness at M17, so you don't gain much either. Since the top left corner is quite unsettled you should probably play there, maybe on the marked place.]
;B[gb]LB[hd:a]C[White can too easily get out - even with a black play at A.]
;W[dd];B[be]C[Your stones are too much separated and you don't really have a chance of getting the corner, so E16 would have been better (at least safer).]
;W[ed]C[If white had played correctly you'd be in deep trouble, since your two groups are now separated.]
;B[fd]C[I moved here to prevent any possible connect with  the other white stone..

You should do this already to prevent loosing your stones];W[fe]
;B[ee]C[I thought the atari'd stone can wait];W[ef];B[cd];W[df]
;B[dc]C[Here you won the corner due to some mistakes by white.]
;W[cg];B[qo]LB[oo:a][po:b]TR[qq][qp]C[in my mind the top left corner was settled for now..   would a better move have been a or b?
As I stated earlier the 5-4 point gains influence and doesn't claim territory. In this case you gave your opponent the corner, which is too big when he has the 5-4 point. The marked points seem to be the usual points to play.]
;W[qq];B[oo];W[nq];B[mo];W[ck];B[pj]C[I think I tend to make big strategic moves if I see the  other player doing the same, very re-active. :-(

Playing the big points can hardly be bad when your opponent does the same.]
;W[do];B[kq]TR[kp]C[Perhaps I should have gone for the handicap point?

I am unsure, what is the best move, this one seems somehow strange. From the course of the game (see move 61) I think L4 would have bee better. But the idea of decreasing your opponents territory seems good.]
;W[hq];B[jd]LB[hd:a]C[here I intended to threaten a cut at a

Since this can be prevented it is not really necessary. I think because you played so high your opponent could invade in the end.]
;W[he]C[here I debated wether to cut or to extend into the  centre..]

(;B[jf]C[I'd seen this sort of thing in text books so I figured it  had to be good.  :-)

Builds a moyo on the right so it looks good.];W[hg];B[jh];W[bf]
;B[ce]C[Even if white wins the Ko the loss is small. Better play somewhere else.]
;W[ig];B[jg];W[ib]C[now what? connect or attempt to prevent a base....]
;B[jc]LB[lb:a][kb:a]C[good old iron pillar - perhaps a would have been  better?

I think this is where I lost the game?
Looking at the result, yes. You need to play on the second line. Probably L18.]
;W[kb];B[jb]TR[lc]C[I knew white would go under, but I wanted to reduce  any potential territory.

I don't see how this reduces territory. Something like M17 would have served your purpose better.]
;W[ja];B[hb];W[ic];B[hd];W[gd];B[id];W[gc]
(;B[fc]TR[mb]C[it would've been better to play N18 to prevent your opponent's next moves. Losing one stone is not really important compared to the result on the right.]
;W[na]LB[mb:a]C[Here I debated wether to attack this forming group of  stones or try and expand the top left. - in hindsite I  should have attacked at a?]

(;B[gf];W[ge];B[hf];W[gg];B[if];W[ff];B[lp]C[I felt the need for some re-inforcement here, could I  have been mre agressive?

This is why L3 was probably not good. With L4 in place you might have used that move to attack at J11 for example]
;W[hj];B[jj];W[hl]
(;B[jl]LB[il:a]C[perhaps a would have been better...
maybe here I had a chance to redeem myself?

Doesn't make much of a differnce (see variation)];W[in];B[jn]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[im];B[jm];W[mc];B[md];W[nc];B[nd];W[qb]
(;B[oa]C[This was really silly....  but what's the best move?

See variation, I think this might work.];W[ob];B[pb]C[cut my losses]
;W[pa];B[pc];W[rc];B[rd];W[ld];B[rp]C[top can wait, I saw potential for break through down  the bottom as soon as white get's a free move.

No, there is not really a chance for white, Since white had to answer (you could've taken the corner otherwise) this is not really a problem]
;W[rq];B[le];W[kd];B[mf];W[af];B[pp];W[lr];B[kr];W[ls];B[mq]
;W[pq];B[np]C[ooo, look at all the pretty black tigers.... :-)]
;W[oq];B[mr];W[nr];B[so]LB[sp:A]C[What was that for? This can wait until your opponent moves at A.]
;W[ir];B[ko]C[this was a passive defensive move, is ther an attack  somewhere that would have been better?

This is about 1 point so almost everything is better. Maybe T3 or N1 (taking the group at M1)]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[iq];B[qc]C[threatening to split.];W[rb];B[sc]
C[That one was gote, you should have played at T3 first.];W[sb]
;B[sd];W[ae];B[ad];W[bg];B[ii]C[here, I was at a loss, I knew my middle stones needed  reinforcing, but I desperately wanted to attack  somewhere, because I could see that my teritory was  about the same size as white's.. yo've got to hate  komi...

Still you should have played N1];W[hi];B[ik];W[hk];B[ke];W[ie]
;B[je];W[kc];B[ns]C[What do you do if white plays N1? So better play N1.]
;W[os];B[ms];W[ha];B[fa]C[necessary...];W[js];B[ks];W[qp];B[po]
;W[sq];B[sp];W[ih];B[ij];W[jr];B[il];C[And so at the end, neither side is game to try and  invade and live in the other side's large teritory.  it's  probably one of the emptiest games I've seen...

You mostly lost due to the mistake in the top right, but I guess that won't happen to you again. Otherwise you'd have probably won the game, so it isn't so bad.

How'd I do?

Not bad, just keep on playing!
