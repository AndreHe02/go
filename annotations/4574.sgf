C[odif: Dear reviewer, this is a game i played on kgs.If you could help me improve my game with any useful tips, In the game there was quite a lot of fighting, it seems that all my games are like that and i often end up chasing a dragon and it will often turn out that it becomes a winner takes all situation, I don't know if it is my style to play like that, because it is the thrill of the chase or what.

I have included a few comments and questions along the way.
Thank you very much for taking the time to review my game.

catch22: Hi, I am your reviewer for this game. In this game you had the tendency to leave a little bit too much weaknesses in your own position, some of which were punished by Black, but not all. Maybe you should be a bit more patient. Make sure you are strong enough before attacking. Furthermore, when you attack, carefully choose the direction of play, so that you will benefit from the attack, even if you don't kill. Anyway, enjoy the review. I hope that you will find my comments useful.]

(;W[cd]C[odif: not sure of this move,it allowed him to pincer my corner.my intention was to take the corner and rob his stone of a base

catch22: I don't think there is anything wrong with this move. As you said, it takes the corner, and robs the black stone of its base. It is the follow-up where you went wrong.]
;B[fc]
(;W[cf]C[catch22: This is not good. It is a contact play, which tends to strengthen the position of both players. This is not what you want. Your corner is already strong enough, so you want to keep the nearby black stones as week as possible. See the variation for a better way of playing.]
;B[cg];W[de];B[ef];W[fd]C[catch22: Another contact play. By now it is probably the only way to prevent being enclosed, but you are doing Black a large favour by making his stones stronger.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[ge];W[ff];B[bf];W[ce];B[dh];W[ci]C[catch22: This is better. It destroys Black's shape. Black would have liked to play here himself.]
;B[fh];W[fg];B[eh];W[dl];B[fq];W[hq]C[odif: i dont know what to do here, maybe tenuki, i am looking to play 017 at some stage to try and generate an attack on g16 group maybe my pincer would be better on j4 or k4. My d8 stone would be better elswhere like c6 maybe.

catch22: This move looks okay to me. I think it is better than playing at the left side instead (e.g. D6). If Black then plays K4 he has build a large moyo on the the right side.

If you want to attack the G16 group, you should play directly at or around K16. If you play O17 instead, you would invite Black to play L17, strengthening the group you wanted to attack.]
;B[cn]
(;W[dn];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp]
(;W[cm]C[catch22: This is not good, as it lets Black play at D5. White should have prevented that by playing at C5. See variation.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[co];W[fo]C[catch22: This is not so good. Black gets a large corner, and the weakness at E6 is also a drawback.]
;B[ep];W[fp];B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[gq];B[ds]
(;W[bh]C[catch22: I think White should start the attack from the outside instead. If White does not play at B12, Black can only make one eye at the side anyway. White could instead play H13. See variation.]
;B[hh]
(;W[gg]C[catch22: This creates an empty triangle. A typical example of bad shape because it is inefficient. Occassionally it is correct, but you should always check first if there is not a better move.

The two variations show which moves you should consider first. In this case, jumping to H14 seems best.]
;B[gk];W[gh];B[ej]

(;W[bg]C[odif: better to capture e6?

catch22: At first sight I would say yes. Capturing the B14 stone is not worth that many points. Although it guarantees the safety of the white stones at the left, these were not under serious threat anyway, and capturing E6 would also help them.

Letting Black play F6 is very bad because it gives White a weak group to worry about. This also means that White cannot continue the attack at the Black group, because White needs to worry about his own group first before he can think about attacking again.

However, there is an additional complication, which makes the B13 move worth a bit more. See the variaton. Despite that, I would still connect at F6.]
;B[fn];W[io]C[catch22: Playing at H5 instead is better shape.]
;B[ho]C[catch22: Good move by Black. It gives White bad shape.]
;W[hp];B[gp]C[catch22: Bad follow-up by Black. This is a needless throw-in, which not only loses a point, but more importantly means Black loses sente.]
;W[go];B[hn];W[mp];B[gn]C[catch22: There is no need for Black to make this exchange now. This move is Black's privilige anyway, and should be kept in reserve as a ko-threat.]

(;W[il]C[odif: i was hoping to link to the group above.I was caught by the trick play

catch22: Strictly speaking, it is not a trick play by Black, but a nice tesuji instead. A trick play is always a non-optimal move, which tempts the opponent to make a mistake, but when dealt with correctly, gives an inferior for the one that played the trick move.]
;B[jl]C[catch22: A nice tesuji by Black.]
(;W[ik]TR[jn][in][io]C[catch22: White cannot save his three marked stones, see variation.]
;B[im]C[catch22: Instead of playing here, Black could also play at H2 and catch eight white stones instead of three, and still link up. 

Anyway, given the fact that Black can still play at H2, he is clearly ahead.]

(;W[hf]C[catch22: This move induces Black to strengthen his stones at the top left and is therefore not good. Better to play at or around K16. See variation.]
;B[jd]TR[hf]C[catch22: The H14-K16 exchange has clearly been in Black's favour.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qn]C[catch22: White is spreading himself thinly, but as he is behind, it may indeed be good to try and complicate the game.]
;B[nq];W[rp]C[catch22: This is a good move, as Black now has to worry about his two stones here.]
;B[lq];W[kr];B[mq]TR[fr][gq][hq][hp][gp][fp][fo][go][eo]C[catch22: Although Black can link up this way. White should be happy, as he is basically forced to save his stones at the bottom now (before Black played N3, the nine marked stones were still up for grabs).]

(;W[gs];B[no]C[catch22: Black is a bit too cautious here. He should simply tenuki. Black is in no danger here. If White tries to pull out these two stones, Black can just chase them. They don't really have anywhere to go.]
;W[ld]C[odif: here i tenuki, the marked group is not alive,after the loss of k8, i tried to take sente]

(;W[qq]C[catch22: It may very well be necessary for White to play here, in order to rescue his stones here. However, allowing Black to capture at T9 is bad. This means that White made a mistake earlier on. I think that before playing R9, White should have simply directly played at R3. Now White has unnecessarily made Black stronger.]

;W[ms];B[np]C[catch22: Although Black will have to capture these stones eventually, he should wait, and play moves that are worth points first.]

(;W[ok];B[oj];W[lm]C[odif: this is better?

catch22: Yes, the variation in the game showed that you could not prevent Black from linking up anyway. Furthermore, you also ended in gote, in order to create a second eye. 

So although you still end in gote, at least you do not let Black capture three of your stones. In fact, you may not even have to play at M7. I do not see how Black could then capture these stones and/or destroy the eye in the center.]
