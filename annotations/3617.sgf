C[Hello reviewer,

I played this game as black on KGS. My comments are marked with "biomorph". B won the game by 19.5. Nevertheless, both players felt after the game that it good have been the other way around as well.

I have made some specific questions. I would also appreciate any general comments, especially on finding the biggest plays and any endgame errors.

Thanks in advance for reviewing this game.

I hope you enjoy the review and learn something from it. Please remember that it takes a far stronger player than I to make consistently sound judgements in go.]

(;W[jd]TR[ld][md][le][me]C[M16 is better shape. The group is safe, but White might need to defend if Black plays on one of the marked points later.]
;B[pn]C[The Black positions on the top side are tight and end with third line stones. It will be difficult to build a moyo from them. Thus I would prefer to play around K3. After such a move it will be difficult for White to develop his hoshi stones effectively.]
;W[np];B[ne]C[This seems overconcentrated, there is plently of open space on the sides, and Q6 stone looks a bit lonely. Play elsewhere.]
;W[pl];B[qj];W[om]C[biomorph: Was WP7 correct?

It's hard for me to be sure, but it doesn't seem like it can be the best move. There are some tactical problems with it (as your variation shows), and the Q6 stone is rather light, as the corner is still open to invasion.

On the other hand, W can't just let B connect under. P9 is one standard move in this shape.]

(;B[rl];W[qn];B[fq]C[biomorph: Wrong direction?

I think the direction is okay, but it's safer to hold back to J3 or K3.]

R3 might work better, but I think reducing the W moyo is more important than grabbing the corner right now.]

;B[dh];W[ai];B[io]C[biomorph: I think B went here too deep.

It would seem so. Normally you want to either make life quickly or play on the boundary line. Of course, the score may dictate otherwise.]
;W[gk];B[fj];W[fk];B[jq]C[biomorph: How to play light in this situation?

This attachment may be a viable choice, but I think your follow-up was a bit heavy. However, White let you get away with it by grabbing some stones instead of attacking the whole group.]

Understandable. However the W bend as played in the game is rather painful as well. The lack of good alternatives may mean that B's F3 kakari was indeed a mistake.]
