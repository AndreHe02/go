C[Dear Reviewer,
Thanks in advance for commenting this game.
I tried to play as serious as i can in this game, but as usual I lost my concentration during the game.
I mostly think that I already counted deep enough and that there is no more I can do.
(Of course I know there is, but I don't know what)
And so i loose my concentration, by being annoyed of waiting for my opponents move and at mostly half of the game don't count at all anymore.
So I'd like to get some tips on what to think about, when having read out the local situation.
(I guess this is more like a mental than a go-problem, but maybe you can help though)]

LB[dj:a]C[After the game saym told me, that I should have tenukied here to play this sequence.

JH : It is possible to attack directly the other corner as suggested butwhite will probably pincer at "a" instead of playing as suggested in the variation.]

(;B[dj];W[ce];B[jd];W[qf];B[oe]C[My idea was to build up a moyo on the top side, which i think of now to be a bad idea.
But i can't explain, why so I'd like you to.

JH : Building a moyo on the top is not possible as white has a shimari in the uperr left corner. SO 15 is a bit strange.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pg];W[qg];B[ph];W[hd];B[qh]C[This sequence seems ok for Black.]
;W[nq]LB[qm:a]C[What should black have played here?

I did not want white to get the lower side so i tried to squeeze him.

JH : the lower side is not important as the stone at 10 is so strong. You should of course play on the right side. "a" for example]
;B[lq];W[pn];B[qq]LB[np:a]C[Rather a difficult move. Playing at "a" is usual]
;W[no]C[Should i have cut now?];B[qn];W[qm];B[pm]C[look difficult for black]
;W[on];B[qo];W[pl];B[iq]C[Was this move necessary, or could I have afforded to play K13 and after that C13?
35 is ok];W[ch];B[ee];W[fd];B[eh];W[om];B[cd]C[I think i counted right here, but maybe I'm mistaking.
JH : looks good];W[dd];B[cf];W[bf];B[be];W[de];B[bg];W[df];B[cg]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[bh];B[af];W[bj]C[How should black continue here?
I made the upper left corner group safe and tried to kill the weak white group then.
Should i have palyed for influence?
JH : No living is better];B[bc]C[C17 is better];W[bl];B[bm]

No. After you can connect or play the ko.];W[re];B[ln];W[jn]
;B[mm];W[lo];B[nr]C[This move was the last good threat i saw for that group.]
;W[kp];B[or];W[kq];B[mr];W[lr];B[mq];W[ad]C[This is not good for white.]
;B[bd];W[ak];B[bi];W[ai];B[aj];W[ds]C[I could have only lived in the corner with ko, so i was not sure wether i should sacrifice them or try to play it.
I then sacrificed because i didn't want to have the burden of ko in the corner and a ?weak? group in the middle.

Ok. you cannot win 2 ko anyway];B[ah]C[I think i played well from here, but i think you can offer me some ideas to play better here.]

I intended to play at j13, but maybe this was better xD];W[kh]
;B[kk]C[141 is not good.  But it is difficult to attack white because he is so strong on the south.]

OK. White will live in the corner and Black is lost.])
(;B[el]C[Would this have been better?
Or could I have won the fight and made a reading mistake?
JH : better I think]))
