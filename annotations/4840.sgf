AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[Hi. My name is Alfa (22k?) and this is my game against 19k+ player in IGS.

At the end I win by 1.5 pts. This is really close game.

I'm not very good at playing handicap game. So please help me.

AM> Dear Alfa, my name is Anton Maslo, I am around 12-13k on DGS, and will try to provide some helpful comments for improving your strength. Please don't take them as being too critical - I only wish to help you improve.]
;W[dj];B[pj];W[jp];B[cm]C[I think I should take K16

AM> I think you are right, K16 is the biggest point on the board currently, while the stone at D4 does not seems to be under an immediate threat.]
;W[jd];B[mc]C[AM> It may be better to approach the white stone from the upper-left corner - around G17. If white responds to this move by extending to N17 or the like, black will have an option to attack the white stone at D10 by playing around C13 - this will cause white to escape to the centre, all in sente for black.]
;W[ed]LB[dc:A]C[AM> I share your confusion about this move, it is very unusual, perhaps because it is wrong. What I would do in this case is try to play as solidly as possible, looking for opportunities to utilise a weakness in the opponent's formation. A move that sounds good in this situation is D17, for instance - it is directed to defend a corner, and it is below the white stones (on line 17, instead of 18) - so if white attempts to enclose from the outside, there is plenty of room inside. Yet I've never experienced moves as E16 before, so you may want to ask around again, if you see this happening more. The general strategy is still good - play reliable moves, don't allow yourself to be forced into uncomfortable situations, and look out for weakness in the opponent's stones.]
;B[ee]C[AM> The move at E15 is not too reliable, in my opinion, yet it is a good idea as well - don't let white to enclose your stones in a corner, while putting pressure on white stones.]
;W[fd];B[fe]C[AM> Probably would be better to play at D17 at this time - to threaten the base of white stones while getting the corner.]
;W[ge];B[fg];W[he];B[ff]TR[ee][fe]LB[dc:C][dg:B][dh:A]C[AM> This is making an "empty triangle" shape (marked stones), which is not a good idea unless you are really forced to make it. In this case, I think it is unnecessary - black could have played 

Nicer shapes would be D12 or D13 (putting pressure on the white stone at D10), or still D17. Please note that there does not seem to be any threat to white cutting at F14 right now.]
;W[df];B[de];W[dg];B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fb];B[eb];W[ep];B[eq]
LB[dq:A]C[AM> This is a good response, which seems to work (looking at how this continued). I would prefer to play D3, as it safely encloses the corner for black, and still forces white to defend its base at E3 - black wins sente in this case.]
;W[eo];B[do];W[fq];B[dq];W[en];B[dm]LB[bj:D][el:A][jb:C][mp:B]
C[I don't know what I was thinking bout.
I don't know the reason for this move.......

AM> This happens. If you wanted to separate the white groups, E8 seems to be a good move. Otherwise, black could take the chance and secure more area on the right, by playing around N4 (just an idea). There also nice sliding attacks at K18 and B10, yet these could wait until the lower right corner is more shaped.]
;W[op]C[I'm troubled by white's move attacking my stone like this. Please tell me what to do or prevent it

AM> I agree, this is troubling, and almost looks like bullying. Just keep your head cold, and play reliably, while waiting for the chance to strike back.]
;B[oq]LB[po:A]C[AM> In this situation I would play Q5 - because there is another black stone at Q10, it seems logical to try to connect to it, and extending along the 4th line is not bad at all! Yet P3 is okay as well, especially since white responds at O4, accepting the threat.]
;W[np];B[pq]LB[po:A]C[AM> I still like Q5 better, though Q3 avoids intrusion into 3-3 point at R3.]
;W[nq];B[nr]LB[qm:A]C[AM> Okay, please forgive my criticism, yet this is one of the obvious mistakes in your playing style. There is no need to make this move now, the sente could be spent with a much higher result elsewhere (R7 is good in the current situation). Please think about what you gain in this case - several points along the 2nd line (6 points, if I am not mistaken), yet white's reponse (N2) forces you to make another move (P2), so that these points are not lost. This fight over 6 points should be delayed until later in the game.

In other words - before attacking, stop and think about what you plan to get from this attack. Some attacks, even when succesful, are not worth it if started too early in the game.]
;W[mr];B[ns]LB[or:A]C[AM> Two points here: a) This is too small, just play somewhere else, find a bigger move, and b) P2 is more reliable - it meanse that any further moves by white in this area will be gote for white. Yet point (a) is more important - let white take the points, and take much more elsewhere. Go is the game where one has to give points to the opponent - while making sure that opponent gains less than you do. The first golden rule of Go is "The greedy never wins". You are not greedy, yet you should always think about "should I give something here to my opponent, so that I can get more myself?".]
;W[ms]C[AM> White is making the same mistake - this is way too small to worry about right now, white is risking that black will ignore the threat (which, black does not ignore it, and wrongly so).]
;B[or];W[po]C[AM> This is where black looses because of starting the attack at O2. Please rethink this and be very careful. Initiative is more important than points (as long as it brings you more points). I hope you find this helpful and learn from this example.]
;B[qr]C[AM> Why not R5? There is no threat of white invading the corner any more, so taking more territory is priority, not survival of the group.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[qn];B[ro];W[rn];B[sn]C[AM> Again - too small. And a side-effect of this move is that white builds a wall, from which it can attack towards the top.]
;W[rm];B[so]C[AM> This is a waste of move, white does not threaten anything.]
;W[sm]C[AM> And, a waste of move by white...];B[fr]LB[mj:C]
[qf:B][rj:A]C[AM> Same comment applies - this is too small right now, the area at the upper-right corner is not yet secured by black. I would play S10 (to prevent white sliding under the black stones) or R14 (to secure the corner), or even N10 - to start a moyo, and take initiative in the central area of the board.]
;W[gq];B[gr];W[hr];B[hs]C[AM> Too small, and, as you could see two moves later, the stone at H1 would need to be sacrificed not to loose a bigger group.]
;W[is];B[gs]C[completely mistake.

AM> Indeed. And a mistake made while trying to gain almost nothing - which makes it even more painful.]
;W[er];B[em];W[dn];B[cn];W[fm];B[fn];W[fp];B[gm]LB[fl:A]C[AM> I would actually play at F8, this puts high pressure on the white group on the left side, which has no base and is still very fragile. Yet your approach also worked - you managed to erase the white moyo almost completely.]
;W[fl];B[gn];W[fk]TR[fn][gm][gn]LB[gk:A]C[AM> Here you can see that white is concerned about the group on the left side - if that group had a base, white could put more pressure on marked black stones by playing G9, for instance.]
;B[hl];W[fi];B[gh]TR[fn][gm][gn][hl]LB[hg:B][hh:A][kl:D][km:C]
C[AM> I am not sure of the purpose of this move - bolder moves are possible at H12 and H13, yet I would recommend strengthening the marked black group by playing around L7 or L8 (L8 seems to be better, since it brings the group closer to other black stones, though it lacks any feeling of attacking the white stones).]
;W[eh];B[gi];W[im];B[il];W[jm];B[kl];W[km];B[ll];W[lm];B[mm]
;W[mn];B[nm];W[nn];B[om];W[on];B[ml]C[AM> This move is not necessary, the cut here turns into ladder, which ends at the black stone at Q10.]
;W[lc];B[ld]LB[md:A]C[AM> I would prefer a more reliable move at N16 - it leaves no cutting points, and indirectly strengthens the upper-right corner for black (though it can still be invaded).]
;W[kd];B[lb];W[kc];B[mb]LB[mb:B][md:A]C[AM> I think this decision is wrong. There are two cutting points, at N16 and N18, which one should you defend? Definitely N16, since it works towards the outside, which black obviously hopes to turn into territory later. N18 is very small, and there is no risk of cutting there at all. If white threatens to cut by playing O18 - then it will be acceptable to play Q18, giving up the small number of points on the upper side, while securing the corner fully, and all of this in sente.]
;W[kb]C[AM> Mistake by white - it is more important to do something about the right side before it is too late.]
;B[md]LB[le:A]C[AM> Not the best way to close this cutting point - extension to M15 does more towards the black's goal to enclose as much territory as possible.]
;W[le];B[mf]C[AM> Good, this is a strong move with direct purpose of getting territory.]
;W[lf];B[lg]LB[mg:A]C[AM> This is not a good move, since white will most definitely play at N15, creating a weakness in black's shape. Knowing this, black should play N13.]
;W[me];B[ne];W[kg];B[kh]LB[lh:A][mg:B]C[I know this is a bad shape. But I took this move cos I was afraid white will got into my area which I was creating

AM> You know that this failed, so it was not a good move at all - since it leaves a double-cutting point at N13. Black should at least try to make it safer by playing at M12. Though I would recommend saying goodbye to the centre "territory", and play reliably at N13.]
;W[mg];B[lh];W[nf];B[oe];W[nh];B[of]LB[pg:A]C[AM> Playing at Q13 would be better at stopping white's advancing.]
;W[og];B[pg];W[ph];B[qg];W[jg];B[jh];W[ig]C[AM> I would say this is a mistake by white, there are much bigger points on the board - B9 and B14 to enclose territory, R12 to continue the attack on the right side.]
;B[ih]LB[bf:C][bj:A][qh:B]C[AM> Black should ignore the small moves by white and play elsewhere: B10, or B14, or R12, all for obvious reasons, which I stated earlier. Attacking moves should be played before the defending moves, especially if you can check that they can end in sente for you.]
;W[hg]C[AM> Getting smaller and smaller....];B[gg]C[AM> And this is a waste of move - black stones are connected anyway, no points from white are stolen, and no points for black are gained.]
;W[gf]C[AM> There isn't a smaller move on the board... this is just one point in gote! Don't ever make moves like this until the very end of the game, and rejoice when your opponent makes such moves :)]
;B[ho]C[I try to reduce white's area. Please tell me about my move. I think it succeed cos of white responses.

AM> True, white responded, so this was a succesful attempt. Yet I would call this very risky - what you get (or, to be correct, steal from white) is much less than what could be gained by the moves I mentioned earlier (they are still all valid). White should ignore this move and play elsewhere.]
;W[hp];B[io]C[AM> White should not respond to this move right now. Play bigger moves before it is too late.]
;W[ip];B[jo];W[ko];B[go]C[AM> A wasted move, this gains nothing and takes nothing, and is gote.]
;W[fs]C[AM> And, white wastes a move too.];B[gk]C[AM> There are still bigger points on the board...]
;W[fj];B[gj]C[AM> This has a meaning - it makes white move at G8 less severe - yet still this is a smaller move than what could be played.]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[qj]LB[bk:A]C[AM> Finally! Though I understand that this is not good for black. And B9 is bigger for white.]
;B[qi];W[qk];B[pi];W[pk];B[qh];W[oh];B[ni]LB[mh:A]C[AM> N12 is the eye-stealing point in white's shape. Though black does not need to make these moves now, you should take bigger points (sorry for repeating this again and again, yet I can only see how you are risking to loose the opportunity).]
;W[mh];B[mi]C[AM> Too small.];W[nk];B[mk]C[AM> Still too small.]
;W[nj];B[ok];W[oi];B[li];W[oj];B[ol]C[AM> Now, if the black stone was at N12, white could be disappointed.]
;W[pl]C[AM> This move by white, and the following move by black are both very small.]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[rj];W[rk];B[sj]C[AM> Remember - S11 is better, if you wish to play gote here anyway.]
;W[sk];B[ri];W[ce]C[AM> Unfortunatelly for black, white got to play here first. Both sides had plenty of chance to do it up to now, though.]
;B[cd];W[be];B[bd];W[ae]LB[bj:A]C[AM> By this move white invites black to play elsewhere (and I would play at B10 if I were black).]
;B[ad]LB[bj:A]C[AM> This is a good move, since white A16 would requite black to play B18, yet the chance to play at B10 is of higher value right now.]
;W[cg];B[cj]C[I know this is dangerous, but I wanted to reduce white's area. I don't really know what to did. Pl help.
And why white responsed it at C11? notC9

AM> I am glad you took this step. I would prefer to play one line lower - at B10, yet C10 seems to work as well. I suppose white was worried about possibility of C9-B9, and I cannot see a way out of this for white, that's why C10 is a good move (unless I am wrong and there could be a way to punish it). Good job at taking the risk!]
;W[ci];B[ck];W[dk];B[bi];W[bh];B[ai];W[ah];B[bj];W[dl];B[cl]
LB[dr:B][fa:A]C[AM> Better to make bigger moves, like F19 (it is sente), or D2.]
;W[el]C[AM> Very small.];B[dr]C[AM> Good, though perhaps it would be better to play the sente move at F19 first.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rc];B[rd];W[ob];B[nb];W[qb];B[oa]
;W[sb];B[ra]C[Is this right?

AM> This is perfect. It is too bad that you let this group live by a later mistake.]
;W[pb];B[pa]C[AM> No need to make this move, the white group is already dead.]
;W[qa]C[AM> White either does not notice that the group is dead, or hopes that you will make a mistake. There are two possible ways to respond here:
a) (best) Ignore this completely and play sente at F19. If white plays O19 - you throw in a stone at P19, and white group is still dead.
b) O19, which is too passive and not necessary, yet it will show to white who is in control of this area :)]
;B[sd]C[AM> No, there is no way for white to get one more eye on this side, so this move is wasted. It does not give life to the white group just yet, though.]
;W[na];B[sc]C[AM> Sorry, but this is wrong. To kill white you should have played at P19, this move steals the second eye.]
;W[oa];B[ma]C[AM> A waste of move - white group is already alive, so this does not take any points for black and does not steal any points from white (and is gote).]
;W[ka]C[AM> White should close from the other side - E19, for instance, since F19 is still a sente move for black.]
;B[nd]C[AM> A waste of move. This move should be made when white plays at M19.]
;W[rb]C[AM> A waste of move by white - even if black plays S18, there is no need to respond, since taking the stone at T19 will leave black in atari, and white can retake all three stones by playing at T18 again.]
;B[fa]C[AM> I am glad you got to play this move :)];W[ga];B[ea]
;W[gb];B[gp]C[AM> Waste of move.];W[jl];B[jk];W[jn];B[in]C[AM> Waste of move, and a one that ends in gote for black - since white H7 requires black to play at G8. D1 is a better move right now, and then the only remaining point is H12.]
;W[hm];B[gl];W[hh];B[hi];W[eg]C[AM> Waste of move, D1 is the last point (which white could use to create a good ko fight).]
;B[fh]C[AM> Waste of move.];W[es]C[AM> White should have played D1 here, it is 2 points difference, and also a chance to start a ko fight (though there does not seem to be much to fight for).]
;B[ds];W[ef]C[AM> Unnecessary move.];B[tt];W[tt];TB[aa][ab]

And like I said I'm not very good @ handicap game, so please help me to play better in a handicap game.

Thanks in advance.

AM> I am afraid I have to agree - white made very many mistakes. Yet you could punish white for those even more - if you were a little more careful.

Summary of main points where you could improve:
1. Pay attention to value of the moves. In this game very big moves were left until the end, and very small moves were played at the beginning. Generally, don't play on the 2nd line if you can make big advances on the 3rd line, and don't play on the 1st line in the first portion in the game (unless it is necessary to survive).
2. Don't always respond to the moves by your opponent. Sometimes they are wrong. Sometimes they are there to scare you. Take a good look at the whole board and decide whether you want to play along, or take initiative elsewhere.
3. Be careful with greed - sometimes you need to give something in order to gain more (this also covers the points 1 and 2 above).
4. Cutting points - look out for them. Don't let the opponent create too many cutting points in your shape, and use the cutting points that the opponent has, or, to take it one step further, create cutting points in your opponents shape.
5. Try to be more in control. Take initiative. Lead your opponent around. Even if you make mistakes this way - you will learn more from such mistakes. C10 is a good example - it was a brave move, and it brought good value.

Sorry if my comments are too critical, please remember that I only try to help. Do not hesitate to comment or ask me questions. Best of luck with your further way of Go!

Anton Maslo])
