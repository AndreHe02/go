C[     Seems like B got a very large lead, W managed a significant     tactical success in the late middle game but still lost by a large margin.          So what happened?         (In fact I can spot a lot of similarities between this game    
and some of my own, I often seem to find myself    
in W's position so maybe I'm the wrong person to    
comment ;-)   


Summarising, I see  


1). W's first reducing move was badly placed. The game was

almost unrecoverable after that.



2). B was able to cut W into several small groups, by the time each

had lived B had plenty of compensation.



3). W played a defensive move when given an outside chance

of getting into the centre. Had W estimated the score? If so then

he could not play this way.];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[cd]C[I always wonder whether W can get time to make     sense of this formation. I think W needs to have a     specific reason for playing this way.          I doubt he will get a chance to make a Chinese fuseki     of his own.          So I wonder whether a 4-4 move is better?          However I do see professional games where this     is played so my only question is what plan W has.     Provided there is one - no problem.]
;B[kq];W[cn];B[cl];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[bn];B[em]LB[em:a]
[ed:b][ci:c][jo:d]C[So far pretty much out of the book.



Problem for W is that he'd like to play both B and C

and will not get the chance. (Well actually in this

game he does, but to no great benefit.)



Anyway for now the focus is on 5. The

books say that B would like it to be higher but

it's still OK. W needs to stop B playing around D.]
(;W[op];C[So I think this move is the first cause of W's problems]
FG[];B[oq]C[B wants t make sure W gets no base so this seems fine.]
;W[nq]C[W 2 seems natural but is difficult to follow up.];B[pq]
;W[np]LB[lo:a]C[This connection simply gives B a target.          Alternative is some form of light move for example A.           trouble is Black will be able to grow the left moyo.]
;B[qn]LB[qn:a][qo:b][po:c]C[Patient. I think this is good though D might be better, more     territory will accrue as W is chased out               Other moves leave a severe weakness at C.]
;W[qj]C[I think that this really is asking for trouble.          The W group has no base and is difficult to sacrifice.     I W has to jump out - weak groups need to get to     the centre.]
;B[ko]C[B is happy];W[on];B[pl];W[ln];B[kn];W[lm];B[km]C[It's just so hard to see how W an recover after this.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[ol]C[     The 14-15 exchange seems to help B.          Would just 16 be any worse?]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[ok];W[nl];B[nj]LB[lk:a]C[B has done the right thing in getting out to     the centre.          How sure is W that his group is     alive? I would be concerned about     being shut in by a move around E.          I suppose that W has to assume that     it is alive if the game is to be playable.          But in which case how do we feel     about 6+18?]
;W[ed]C[This seems to leave B with another nice attack];B[qf]
C[Very nice. W 22 here seems much better, quite big     in it's own right and makes sense of 18 and 6.          Tough to know how to answer this.]
;W[pf]C[

I agree with this, not because I like the result after

any of the standard josekis that could follow but because

anything else I could think of looks worse.]
(;B[qc]LB[pg:a]C[Not sure why B did this. A normal hane at F shold     end up extinguishing 18 and 6. B end up with a huge     side.]
;FG[]
(;W[qg];B[pc]
(;W[oc]LB[qe:a]C[This seems like it should be an overplay, there     seem to be so many cutting points. A is probably     the honest place to play          However W needs something a little unreasonable     so I can sympathise with the urge to pplay here.]
;B[od]C[B does not yield];W[nc]C[MY first reaction was that this is dangerous, but W     manages to spoil B's shape.]
;B[pe];W[qe]C[Nice place for a stone.];B[qd];W[rf]
(;B[of]C[Difficult to find the right move to get out into the centre.          Philiosphy of leaning aganst the strong group seems     reasonable but the shape is not nice.]
;W[og];B[ng]
(;W[oh]MA[nf]C[Too slow. If B simply connectsall his problems are over.     W territoty here is unimportant. Need to be thinking about the     fate of 5+3]
;B[lc]C[This may be an overplay. B should o try to simplify.     Simply connecting does allow W to settle his group     or make territory but not both.]
;W[jc]C[Good idea];B[ke]LB[md:a]C[Thin, patch up solidly then you can fight later with

more confidence. B looks better]

;W[kc];B[gd]C[W grabbed a lot of B territory but lost quite a lot of his    own and B is getting useful thickness which    prevents W threatening to build a large territory    on the left]
;W[ci];C[Seems like the right place.]FG[];B[ei]C[This is very good, nakes the previous W moce look dubious

but I really cannot see anything I prefer for W.];W[dg];B[fg]
LB[lk:a]C[Natural but B is growing faster than W.        I think A may be sente for B, if it is then W needs    to play around there now.]
;W[he]C[W has got to get into the centre this seems like a good    point, just possible that some hack against 32 and 33 may

become interesting.];B[hd];W[ll]C[Yes, this is urgent];B[kl]
