C[It was a close game. I think, there wasn't obvious  mistakes at the local level.
In some cases I pointed out my observations, at least what I've seen.
So probably I lost due to small things and/or some wrong higher decissions. Could you point these to me? I wasn't able to spot these points.
Thx, Radu

z -- Hi, I'm Bill, "zinger" on internet Go servers.  I'll do my best to provide helpful comments.  My comments are marked with " z -- ".  But remember, I am also a weak amateur.  So be sure to consider my comments and variations critically.

z -- considering the final margin, there are naturally many opportunities for small improvements to change a loss to a win.  There were also some large mistakes by both players, that more or less cancelled out.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[do];B[dq]C[Perhaps it was too early...

z -- this is fine.];W[fp]
(;B[cp]C[z -- The normal joseki is to play at C5 (or sometimes F3).  Black can also switch elsewhere.  C3 is not normal; white's response at C5 is obvious and good.  Compare the variation.]
;W[co];B[fr];W[ce];B[ee]C[z -- interesting !];W[bc]
(;B[hc]C[z -- I think this is the wrong direction.  Because of the position in the lower left corner, the left side important.  I would press at D14 or jump to E13, to reduce white's potential on the side.  

z -- Also, H17 looks too close to black's two stones to be fully efficient.  If you extend in this direction, it would be better to go all the way to K16 or K17, because that would also be the right extension from Q16 - a double purpose move.]
;W[dh]
(;B[kd]C[Still is a big gap between 4x4 stone and the this move. So maybe another option should be considered. Like r10? Or k4?

z -- I think at this point I would move out the bottom left group with G3.  A move at K4 would not relate well with the F2 stone.  R10 isn't bad, but R6 would be better - when the area is wide open, an approach is usually bigger than a play on the side.

z -- L16 seems inefficient: too close to H17.  You should not fear a white move in this area - rather, you should welcome it as a target for attack.]
;W[qf]C[Is this a mistake of W?

z -- This move looks normal.]
(;B[nc]C[z -- this is a joseki move, but here it is too close to the L16 stone, making it inefficient.  I think black should choose a pincer - perhaps Q11 or R12.  This is the normal idea when a side extension such as L16 is in place.  See variation for one idea.]
;W[rd];B[qh]C[z -- interesting!  Black is behind in influence, so going for the outside feels right.  There is a ladder involved which favors white here (see next comment and variation), but I still think this is OK.  Unfortunately, the game showed that black didn't know how to follow through after this move.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[Was the answer required? Should I make tenuki?

z -- this move is a mistake.  Consider what your moves mean.  R12 said: "I am not interested in the corner territory.  I want a position on the outside."  But Q17 says:  "I want some profit."  These moves contradict each other.  If you wanted the territory, you should have played at R17 instead of R12.  If you want the influence - see the variation.

z -- In addition, after this move the two stones Q16-17 are practically breathing down the neck of O17.  This is very overconcentrated and inefficient.  Think of it this way: if Q16-17 and L16 were already there, the position looks good as it is.  Would you play in between at O17?  Probably not - it would be almost like passing.  This means that a whole move has been wasted.  Compare the current position to the variation at move 17.  There, white also took the corner, but black has a stone at Q15 instead of O17.  Doesn't that look better?]
;W[of]C[z -- now white has got the profit of R17 and also moved out.  This is too good.]

(;B[qn]C[z -- oh my.  Black should hold back to R9 - at least it makes a base in an area that is dominated by white.  After this move, a white invasion in between R12 and R6 is too good to allow - black would be split apart.]

(;W[nq]C[z -- white lets black off the hook in a big way.];B[pk]
C[z -- and black gets an even better position as a result. But this should not have happened.]
;W[iq];B[ck]C[z -- very bold, but this may be possible.  I would have chose D10; this would also split white's side, and make it a little easier to run away.]
;W[ci];B[ek];W[pi];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[ok];B[pl]C[I am 3rd and 4th line. Why W keeps walling me?

z -- white is performing what is called a "leaning attack."   The plan is to get some stones facing out toward the center, which will help when attacking the black stones at C9-E9.  He is willing to solidify your territory to accomplish this.]
;W[ol]
(;B[rp]C[z -- this is big, certainly.  But it is gote - white will get to play first on the left side.  Black's group is alive without S4, so black should play G9 instead, to make the group there safer.]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[pm]C[z -- this is off target - it should be at Q6, or just at G9.  Because of this, black gets a second chance to get G9.]
;B[qm];W[pn]
(;B[ql]C[z -- this is unnecessary.  Black should play G9.  White can't do anything to the right side group, even if R3 was not available to black, which it is.]
;W[gk]C[z -- ouch !];B[fl];W[gl];B[fn];W[dp];B[gp]C[z -- interesting, but it shouldn't work.  It's hard to find a good move for black here.  Perhaps I would try G7, and then later run upward where there is some help available, maybe with E11.]

(;W[fq]C[z -- somewhere in this sequence, white should cut black's F6-G4 stones.  The ladder to the top right favors white, and C3 is available.  I don't think black should be able to both keep the corner and seal white in.]
;B[gq];W[er];B[eq];W[gr];B[ep];W[fs];B[fo];W[fr];B[cq]C[z -- good move.  White has been tricked.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[ho];B[hn];W[in];B[im];W[jn];B[hl]C[W has a large moyo in right down. Could I invade? Where?

z -- well, you already got more than you deserved by capturing the D5 stones.  Now, the black group which should have been weak and under attack (E9 etc) is instead surrounding a large territory !  So I think you should be satisfied with this result.

z -- as to invading, I would say:  the question is not "could I invade?"  but rather "should I invade?".  To answer this, you must estimate the score.  So: black has about 25 in the lower left, 15 on the right, and 30 at the top = 70 total.  White has about 12 in the top left, 8 in the top right, and perhaps 45 at the bottom = 65 total.  Which makes it an even game with komi.  Plus, white's stones at G8-9 are a burden, while black has no weaknesses.  So there is no need to invade.  Keeping pressure on the G8 stones and aiming for R3 looks like a good plan.]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[ej]C[z -- white should play L8 instead.]
(;B[fg]C[Is that too slow? Maybe in opposite side...

z -- this isn't exactly bad - it builds some potential area at the top.  But the situation at L8 is much more important.  When stones are pushing against each other like this, it is hard to turn away.

z -- Alternatively, black could cut white with F10.];W[me];B[md]
;W[kf]
(;B[ph]C[z -- this doesn't accomplish much, as the game shows.  L8 instead would reduce the bottom, and at the same time make an anchor for reducing the area around O12.  It's the key point.]
;W[oh];B[pg];W[og];B[pf];W[qe]C[Is W living? How could I kill?

z -- white's group cannot be killed.  In fact, white might even be able to tenuki, instead of R15.  Try it out.]
;B[qb];W[rb];B[qd];W[rc];B[pb]C[ z -- this is gote: black cannot kill white, as the game shows.  So black should play elsewhere.  L8 still looks good.]
;W[jd];B[rg];W[rf];B[sf];W[se];B[sg];W[ra];B[jc];W[id];B[ic]
;W[ke];B[le];W[lf];B[ld];W[kl]C[z -- very big !];B[jk];W[kk]
;B[ne]C[z -- this is small.  White could ignore it.  K10 and R3 are bigger.]
;W[mf]C[z -- white decides to answer.];B[oe]C[z -- again, black should play elsewhere.  This move is almost a pass - it makes only 2 points, at P16 and O16, in gote.]
;W[jj]C[z -- big.];B[hk];W[hj];B[ij];W[ii];B[ik];W[ji];B[hi]
;W[gj];B[gi];W[fi];B[gm]C[z -- this allows the capture of the stones at G11-H11.  H13 instead would make good shape.]
;W[gh];B[if];W[hf];B[hh]C[Was it a mistake? Or the link outside is more important?

z -- yes, a mistake: because white can capture these stones in a bent ladder.  Since black can't do anything here, tenuki must be right.  R3 looks biggest.]

(;W[gg]C[z -- white is too kind.];B[fj];W[ih];B[fk];W[hg];B[hd]
;W[he];B[qq]C[z -- good];W[pq];B[qr]C[z -- good];W[pr];B[bo]
C[z -- this is unnecessary: if white tries to attack by playing here, black can connect at E5.  Instead, B18, B10, and D2 look like good points.  I would play B10.]

(;B[de]C[z -- black misses a chance here - C13 can be played, which at least steals more territory from white, and may even kill the C11 stones if white isn't careful.]
;W[bf];B[cg];W[bg];B[fh];W[ch];B[eg];W[dg];B[df];W[cd];B[ge]
;W[ff]C[z -- oops];B[ie]C[z -- good.];W[ig];B[je];W[qa];B[pa]
C[Final moves. Lost at 1.5 points.

z -- a close game indeed.];W[al];B[am];W[ak];B[sr];W[rs];B[nf]

;W[dd];B[ed];W[gf];B[gd];W[di];B[eh]C[z -- why not E10 ?];W[jh]
;B[ds];W[hr];B[ej];W[es];B[pe];W[re];B[tt]C[z -- one more technical comment, just because I think it's cool.  There is an intersting technique left in the bottom right for white; black can prevent it by playing T3 instead of passing.  See variation next move.]

------------------------------------------

z -- In this game, there were some stragetic errors and some reading errors, by both players.  Of all my comments, I would most emphasize these points for improvement:

1.  Work on your reading.  This is the most important.  Better reading at moves 43, 117, 121, 133, 161, and others might have made a difference.  There was also some good reading - move 185 was nice.  Try to build on that.

2.  Recognize key points in pushing battles.  The situation at L8 was ignored by both players for 30 moves.

3.  Don't squander sente on small moves (moves 85, 103, 105, for example).  Let's say we estimate 10 points lost per move at those times:  that's 30 points.  I find this bad habit is the hardest to break, and I still make moves that are too small in every game I play.  But reducing the amount of them will help.

I hope my comments have helped.  Good luck!])
(;W[sq]C[z -- this gains white one point.  After capturing, black must eventually play S6.  So black loses 2 points - T4 and S6 - while white loses only the one prisoner.  So ...]
