AB[dp][pd][dd][pp][pj][dj]C[Hello, my name is Nathan and I will review your game.  I will try to precede my comments with my initials NA-

NA-First comment.  I think you two may have underestimated your stengths.  You both play decent moves and I feel I may not have as much to offer as you might hope.  Anyway, I will try my best.

Both of us have been playing for around three months.  Andrew is about 20k, Nikki is about 25k.

Andrew: I thought that my opening was not particularly strong, and that my attacks were not very well timed.  When my approaching stones came under pressure on the top, I struggled to secure bases for my groups--is this more a problem of technique, or attitude?

Nikki: I thought that in the midgame, I didn't respond in a timely way to urgent pressures. I made some mistakes, and then struggled to keep white's invasions in check.]
;W[fc]LB[cf:A][df:B][ec:C][fd:D][hc:E][jc:F]C[Nikki: I didn't know how to respond to white's approach here. White used it several times in the game and I always attached to the approaching stone.

NA-This is the most common approach to a 4-4 stone.  I've labeled some of the most common replies here as A-F.  Hope you can see the marks.  Of course each one has different meaning.  A is a more defensive approach while E is an attacking move.  While I could write out a description of each one you could easily look them up.  By far the best is to try playing each one and see what happens.  They are all reasonable replies though in different situations some are going to be better than others.  This advice is for you to get better and learn more about the game.  On the other hand, I will say that if what you want is to win, then acceptable strategy for black would be more often to play something like A or C.  The point is that these are the simplest and easiest and that is what black should be striving for.  Because white is at a disadvantage to begin with in a handicap game they will have to try to cause complications to "trick" black because white will be able to rely on sup
 erior reading skills.  If black plays simple and strong moves then this will not work and the force of the handicap stones will carry through to the end of the game.]
;B[ec]LB[cf:A][jd:B]C[Andrew: I never know quite how to deal with this attachment when approaching a hoshi stone.  I think that extending is a good response, but I always get confused in the follow-up moves.

NA-the commonest reply is what you play. this is because it is natural to extend when the opponent attaches, that's just a rule of thumb.  Black most often plays something like C14 to take the corner then white will extend to K16.]
;W[fd];B[hd]
(;W[hc]C[Andrew: Best response to this I could think of, but I started to worry about the life of this group at this point.

NA-yah this is a pretty aggressive reply by black.  My temptation would be to jump out to F14 though playing at H18 probably would also have been better than this because it would have left you more free to make eye space on the edge.  Without sufficient eye space your group is weak and ineffective because your attacks are always held back by worries. I show one variation where I try out one possibility for that.  I'm not saying the sequence I am showing is the best for either side.  I just want to show you that white should be able to live and get out even if black continues playing super agressive against the one point jump.  Basically it's just another option to consider.]
;B[ic];W[hb];B[ib];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pg]C[NA-this is more normal for black, though for some reason I remember that a dan player showed me that this was a bad move.  They recommended R14 for example instead.  I think essentially the point is that there is still alot of space on the right side after this move so blacks move isn't as effective as it may at first seem.]
;W[kc]C[Andrew: Should I have cut at J16 right away?  I felt like I was ending up with two weak groups.

NA-Yah, I think your f & h stones are probably too weak to just leave there.  The cut is a good way of fighting.  On the other hand, see my comments about handicap games at the beginning.  You caused black to respond to defend the corner.  Now you have another group here to try to push the black j stones against.  The cut would be more threatening now.  It's true though that against an equal player you should really try to avoid making multiple weak groups especially right next to each other because they are too easily played against one another.]
;B[jd];W[kd];B[je];W[qc]C[Andrew: Seemed like good timing for the 3-3 invasion.  Maybe not.

NA-As per the comments before this it seems to add another weak group is probably a bad idea.  I think that because of the the p17 stone and the outside white stones though this will probably turn into a more complex fight than the standard 3-3 invasion.  That again might be good because you should be trying to complicate things and capitalize on the fact that you are better at reading out fights in a handicap game.  Another aspect of playing in handicap games is playing light.  That means starting lots of little projects that you can afford to sacrifice by themselves.  That's pretty much what you are doing so this is good as handicap game strategy and bad as regular strategy.]
;B[qd];W[ob];B[jg]C[Nikki: I jumped out toward the center here, but I don't think it's the biggest move I could have made.

NA- I like this move, and this is because it does two important things.  First it defends your j & k stones by jumping out toward the center.  Secondly it keeps white seperated and threatens his groups particularly the f and h stones which haven't really made life yet.  Efficiency is critical in go and moves like this that have as many functions as possible are almost always the better moves.  You are also taking sente- which means initiative.  You are causing white to answer you.  You are taking control of the game which is of course where you want to be.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[df]C[Andrew: This felt awkward.  Too high?

NA-I think so.  Problem is that 4th line is generally geared toward influence but this isn't going to happen in the situation but this stone could easily by cut by a black play at e15.  I think if you played c14 you would have more real threats against the corner and side and you might still be able to connect to the other group.  Space is getting tight though so you could easily lose both groups either way.]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[ce];W[eg];B[dh];W[cf];B[fg];W[ff];B[eh];W[ef]
C[NA- Well done to both connect your two groups here and to cut off blacks corner.  Now a play by white in the corner will be very scary for black.  I think an interesting practice problem would be to take this situation and try different white moves in the corner and see if you can kill black or not given the best moves you can find for both sides.]

;B[ae];W[cb];B[ag];W[bd];B[be];W[bc]C[Andrew: Retrospectively, C16 would have killed this group.]
;B[bh];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[jq];B[lq]C[NA-Perhaps this is alittle wide.  It invites complications by white I think.  I think this is essentially the right idea though. Maybe N3.]

NA-Yah, I think this is too deep.];B[cm];W[nf]C[Andrew: Realized that I was behind if I let black secure the center, and focused my attention on reducing it.

;W[br];B[dq];W[cr];B[ap];W[er];B[kr];W[jr];B[ke];W[nl];B[nm]
C[NA-The cut bp7, wp8, bq8 works so this is uneccessary.  The knights move (the jump that white made) will never work in this close proximity to black stones unless there is some special circumstance with some white stones around.  Simple and big. Black would have won the game.]
;W[ol];B[pl];W[om];B[kb];W[lb];B[ha];W[ga];B[ia];W[fb]C[NA-Black should be sealing the middle now instead of playing for small points at the edge of the board.  The situation in the o3-9 area is very pressing.  None of these last moves were.]
;B[gc];W[gb];B[gd];W[nn];B[no];W[mm];B[mn]C[Nikki: Would playing M7 instead have allowed me to stop white's push here?

NA-It would have helped to at least.];W[nr];B[mq]C[NA- You don't even really need to defend this stone.  Imaging white spends 3 moves capturing this black stone at o3 and you spent 3 moves sealing the huge center territory.  Who would win?]
;W[lm];B[km];W[kl];B[ll]C[Nikki: I feel like this mistake was very costly. Where should I have played instead?

NA-this isn't actually too bad if it was followed by wm9,bk8, wL9, bk9 for example because then this black stone would be sacrificed so that you could play these moves to seal your territory that is still pretty large with forcing moves.

Black had played a very good handicap game up till around this point in the game and just kind of gave in and let white take alot of territory away.  Black had won this game by a very large margin if they had played to prevent this white incursion that basically just ends up ruining the whole thing.]

NA-Yes.  The unfortunate part is that there were many simple opportunities before this to seal this border but yes, given the situation now, black should.]
;B[jk];W[hl];B[el];W[hi];B[fj];W[ek]C[Andrew: I was proud of this move--it threatens to connect up to the stone at C8, and also the cut at F12.  At least I think it does.

NA-The cut was there as soon as you played h11.  The rest of this game is pretty straightforward.  I have written some general comments at the last move.]

;B[ep];W[as];B[tt]C[NA-Well I want to compliment you both I think you both played an interesting game.

To black.  I would say the biggest thing that would make you alot stronger is just looking for the biggest moves on the board.  You played very well deep into this game and had a huge territory that was yours.  At that point you divereted to make some moves at the top.  If you had used those moves to seal up you would have won.  Of course this is always alittle easier to see after the fact, but I think if you make that a priority you will win alot more and drive your handicap down. 

To white.  It is more difficult for me to comment your game because your style is of course cramped by the handicap even if you do win and in order to win you have to play kind of crazy.  I would warn you to be careful if you are serious about go to remember to keep handicap strategy seperate from normal strategy in your head.  I think there is some danger that successes in handicap games with poor strategy can reinforce bad habits.  I think this happened to me because I taught a bunch of my friends how to play and so I was stronger than them all.  I won alot using bad technique and I think it spoiled me!

Other than that I will guess that reading situations more would be good for you.  Remember you can do this when you are giving a handicap just to practice even if you are actually going to play a crazy move.]

Perhaps he can squirm out of this situation but probably not given best play by white and even if he did, it would be at the cost of a very large black center territory even after the o14 reduction.  (Trying to verify whether this group is absolutely dead or not would be good practice).]
