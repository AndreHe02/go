charleslee:  Hi reviewer.
  I am black and set my rank 13k.
I think I was leading the whole game, but I was lost at the end.


Joerg:
I don't think so (see move 110). Look at the score: you lost by 20 points and that's big. You can't say that the few endgame points you lost made you loose that high. My opinion is, that White had a good lead most of the game. The upper side was big all the time and so was the bottom left corner. Maybe you misjudged the situation because you thought your center moyo would bring a lot of points? Always keep in mind that a moyo (and also territory in the center) looks bigger than it is. The key of this game was the lower right corner. You should have defended there earlier and take a good lead. Instead you ended with a weak group. But it was not a bad game, you surely  improve if you make your weak groups safe at the right time. And remember that territories easiest are made in the corners, then at the sides and only after that a territory-oriented play in the center would be ok. Keep also in mind, that a play where both players could expand their territory is more urgent than simply making some points elsewhere. In the endgame try to play the bigger moves first.  ( :-) Sounds easy. ) I notice that you defend a single stone in gote instead of taking bigger points. (For example 191) Don't be too concerned about single stones. Offer them as a sacrifice. Your opponent will have to play another move to catch it, so you could play another move elsewhere. Another good way of improving is trying to count territory during the game.

in additon the three black stones here are totally outnumbered and in danger, so that attacking the two white stones severely will be nearly impossible without making the group safe first.]

(;B[qh]C[2. at the 61th move, do I need to defend at r12 or attack p12(the white stone)? If defendence is better, how can I attack this white stone?

I think this move is ok. (VAR is maybe slightly better).  It gives you territory and connects the three black stones around P10 to the upper black group. Moreover white has to bring out his P12 stone now, before you cap it.]

;B[fe]C[In relation to the moyos this move is good. It expands your moyo while flatting out White's.]
;W[hd];B[hf];W[jl];B[hk]C[Not good.   At this point you have to seek live in the corner with the bottom right group.

There was a miai in the corner. Life or move out. With the white move 70 your movement into the center is no longer easy. So you should have played in the corner.

miai: "Two  points  which  accomplish  the  same  result; if        deprived of one, the other must be played." In this case the result should be a living group.]

;W[id];B[ne];W[me];B[jj]C[3.at the 97th move, it seems that I should put in Q17 instead of K10 ?? I am not sure because K10 maybe can get more points?

That's right. Play in the corners first. To make center territory you need much more stones. The play in the corner is much bigger than K10.

First, White still can reduce by a play around K12.  Second, by playing in the corner you make sure that White is not possible to make territory there himself. It is important that you are the first to play where both players could make points. Therefore a play in the lower left is big, too.]

It was not necessary to let White in that much, that's true...   Defend earlier, don't waste your time with small moves like M6.   I found that developping reading skill by solving problems is a good way to improve.]
