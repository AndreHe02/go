============
Hi Sean,
My name is Avi, 4K on IGS from Israel.
Thank you for the opportunity to review your game. I am not a very string player, so take my comments with a grain of salt and do not hesitate to disagree and send me back your comments. My style is to comment only on the main points - anyway, I do think a person can learn more than a few vital points from each game. 
My comments will be preceded with "A:".];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
;B[qk]C[*I opted for the Chinese opening];W[po];B[qo]C[*not sure if this was the right direction since it cut off my r9 stone,  or if it was right because that stone offered back up

A: There is nothing wrong in what you played.];W[qn];B[qp];W[rn]
;B[ro]C[A: Although there was no bad effect later, I do not like so much this move, because of the empty triangle it creates (s4).]

;W[fd];B[kc];W[pf];B[qf]C[*I think this sequence was bad for black, wasn't sure how to respond to this attack, seemed to cost me quite a bit

A: I would prefer here R15 or R13, but it may be a matter of taste. In any case, I do not think the sequence was bad for black - I will refer to it later.]

;W[sj];B[si];W[rl];B[ri];W[rk];B[pk]C[A: The result is that both Black's groups are secure, and on the other hand both White groups are stil insecure. You could take advantage of it to gain a lot of profit!]
;W[ic];B[gc];W[fc]
(;B[hc]C[A: This is a wrong response. J18 would be much better.]
;W[id]C[*this invasion usually works, well, but he didn't respond as most do and it took me off guard and i botched it]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[fb];W[eb];B[kb];W[hb];B[cc];W[cd];B[gd];W[gb]
;B[ge];W[ia]C[A: The result is that White has become stronger, but more importantly he has access to the center - compare it to the variation shown for Black #55.]

(;B[bq]C[A: The correct invasion is C3, see variation.]
(;W[cq]C[A: This is wrong response of White - the correct response is C2, See variation. The outcome should be a weak Black group enabling White to attack to take advantage of it.]

C[* probably should have been playing bigger moves than trying to catch the white chain, not sure if i'm correct, but the triangled spots seem fairly big to make the big moves

A; It seems to me too late now, because White can simple play T15 and he has 2 eyes.]

A: Summary:
It was a close and interesting game indeed.
Your main weak points are identifying the opponents weak groups and attacking them. This manifested itself clearly with the White group on the top right.
Apart from that, you should improve your overall looking of the whole board - your invasion on the top should have brought you a lot points if done properly.
I suggest you read Michael Redmond's "ABC of Attack and Defence" - I am sure this will improve your game a lot.
Thanks again for letting me review your game, I hope it is useful.]
