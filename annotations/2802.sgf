C[To the reviewer:

I have been playing go for almost 4 months now. I seem to have hit a lul in=
 my progress however, I find that in most of my games something major tends=
 to die on either my side or the opponents side, this game is a bit of an e=
xception to that, what I am looking for are general pointers as to what I s=
hould study next, comments on which points are big and what I missed, Sever=
e Tactical errors,  and things I should look for in games which I seem (to =
you) to be missing. My openning play tends to be a bit weak as I have yet t=
o read any books etc regarding fuseki/joseki so pointers here would be appr=
eciated as well.
Thank you.

- Limpin on KGS];B[qd];W[ec];B[cp];W[oq];B[eq]C[this feels a little slow.  Not bad, probably, but it seems like what kind of enclosure you want to make here might depend on what happens in the adjacent corners -- so I would want to approach white first.  Also this move is pretty slow -- with komi black usually wants to play aggressively.  Still, can't be too bad a move.]
;W[cj];B[po]C[I am not quite =
sure if this was a good idea

This type of approach move is territorially very weak.  Black is playing for outside influence.  Not exactly consistent with the low E3 move you just made.  R4 would probably be the more standard approach in this corner.  Q5 is not too bad, though it would be better if black had a stone in the K16 area first.

I think the more important issue is that the left side is very important now: both sides have played in a way that makes it big.  C17 is tempting to me, to prevent white from getting a big territory by enclosing at C16.]
;W[qp];B[pp]C[This is black's first real mistake.

Black helps fix white's bad aji with a move like this, and black gains nothing.

WIthout this Q4 move, later on black would have a lot more interesting threats against the corner.

Omit the Q4-Q3 exchange and just make the move you really want to make.]
;W[pq];B[qo]C[R5 without Q4-Q3 exchange would be a LOT better.]
;W[rp];B[pk]C[This settles my black group for the t=
ime being, I am afraid of my opponent playing L3 because that would make me=
 get a bit of an enclosed feeling in my corner


L3 is not a good move at all.  White's corner is alive, black's corner is alive, so L3 is only taking a few points of territory.  The left and upper side are much bigger by far!

Even after white L3, black still has J3 AND C8 both ... so unless white gets THREE moves in a row, black's corner is not at all crowded.

So don't be afraid of L3!

Q9 is a fine move.];W[od];B[pe]C[This is not a joseki I recognize.
The proverb says "answer the cap with a knights move" so if you want to play this direction I would expect Q14.  Or maybe R14, but with Q9 high ...

Hm.

Actually, since white has S4, black should not try to play the right side at all, since white can invade too easily.

Therefore black could answer P16 with a pincer at N17 or M16 ... the UPPER side is the important side here, where either player could make a lot of territory.  The right side is not important.]
;W[qc]C[I chose not to respond to this because I didint have an=
 idea as to what to do here.

This looks too big to leave.  S17 seems like a good answer.  Or you could try to start a fight with Q17 but that seems too aggressive.

If Q15 had been in the correct direction in the first place, you wouldn't have this problem.]
;B[cd]C[This is pretty good, but the corner is big (white S16 for instance).  Also I feel a little cramped because of white C10 so I might play C17 here?]
;W[cf]C[seems like wrong direction for white.  More natural to let black extend to C12 or C13, because then white gets to extend to C7 and prevent black's corner enclosure from doing its work.

Now black C8 is a great move, expanding black's corner and threatening C12.  That's why I don't like C14 for white.]
;B[ed]C[I don't think this is a good move when C10 is on the board.

Actually I'm not sure there is a good move with C10 on the board, so maybe I was wrong to criticize C14 ... I thought black could settle himself pretty well with D17 and aim at C12 later, but maybe D17 is not enough for black to really get settled after all.]
;W[fd];B[ee]C[I'd be more inclined to try to settle in the corner with D17.]
;W[dc]C[The sequence that follows this is a b=
it to my disadvantage I think];B[fc]C[This cut looks like an overplay.]
;W[gc];B[cc]LB[fb:A][dd:B]
(;W[fb];B[ce];W[dg]C[It feels like white got to play on both sides, and the C12 invasion potential is gone now, so C8 is no longer a good move for black ... black has lost a lot.

Still, settling your group here is pretty nice.];B[mc];W[rd]
C[This feels slow now.  N17 is the important stone, white should play O18?]
;B[re];W[pd];B[qe];W[rc]C[Too slow!];B[ob];W[pb];B[oc];W[pc]
;B[jc]C[white locally has only one eye in the corner so this is a great success for black.  If white gets surrounded, white has to spend a move in the corner right away!]
;W[nd]C[another very slow move for white.  Black is strong enough on this side.  White wants to lean and invade at R11 area maybe?  Hm.]
;B[qh]C[Nice exchange for black.  Black should be ahead now.]
;W[nc];B[nb];W[lb]LB[mb:B][lc:A]C[I should have just =
connected here i think. During the game i thought that I didint want the l1=
7 sequence because i was planning on attacking whites d17 group altho this =
looks alot less possible now

Attacking white's D17 group!  It has a ponnuki!  There's no way.  It would take 3 or 4 moves in a row to put it in danger.

You should be thinking about defending yourself, and perhaps enclosing white's upper right corner group in sente.  C14 group is much more attackable than D17 group, too, and you are more likely to gain by attacking it (starting at C8).]

(;B[lc];W[mb]C[this is a big loss.  Now black's group is a bit thin and white's group has two definite eyes so enclosing it will no longer be sente.]
;B[kb];W[oa];B[ke];W[nf]C[Now white is definitely alive so black has nothing to gain.]
;B[cl]C[Big point for black!];W[ej];B[jq]C[Black is getting a lot of big moves now, but the top group is a little unstable still...]
;W[bp]C[Was my response correct here, and did i make a mistake playing c8 to far =
from the c4 group ?

C8 was in the right place, and white is just probing to see what to do next.]
;B[bq]C[answering this way says you value the corner more than the outside.  If you want the outside, you can play C5 but then white can live in the corner in gote.]
;W[bo];B[co];W[cn];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm];W[bl]LB[bk:B][bm:A]
(;B[bm]C[Big mistake.  See variation.];W[bn];B[bk];W[am];B[dk]
C[the exchanges on the side just helped white get eyes.  If you want to play D9, just play D9 without B7 or B9 first.]
;W[ck];B[dl];W[dj]C[If you're going to end up with THIS result, you should have played C5 in the first place instead of B3.]
;B[jo];W[no];B[np]C[I dont know why i p=
layed this move

Hoping to cut off white O5 .. doesn't look like a bad idea to me!  Except it just doesn't work.]
;W[op];B[nn]C[With white O14 and E10 on the board, is this a big direction?  You might do better to play N4?]
;W[oo];B[on]C[with white S4, O14 on the board, these moves don't help you much.  F9 area is bigger.]
;W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl]C[can white jump instead of pushing?]
;B[rk];W[qj];B[rj];W[mn];B[db]C[When you come to a point like this, where you think about playing away, ask yourself the three questions.  In fact you can ask them at every move if you want!

1) where are my weak groups?
answer: top middle, mostly.  Top left maybe a little weak.  Right middle might get weak if white could do something with the R10 stone.

2) where are the opponent's weak groups?  answer: none, they are all definitely alive (this is a sign that you have probably made some mistakes earlier on!)

3) where is there a lot of territory to be made?
answer: black's bottom left territory could get a lot bigger.  Other than that, some small bits here and there are about it.

So, strategically, what to do?  Make a move that enlarges your bottom left area while not hurting your top groups, or make a move that helps your top groups while not hurting your big territory potential.

D18 seems OK as a defensive move, helping this group secure life and not messing up your bottom area by running out.]
;W[eb];B[bf]C[connecting at C18 to make life seems more sensible to me!]
;W[bg];B[df];W[cg];B[eg]C[now you are coming out in a way that seems pretty likely to end up hurting your bottom area.]
;W[eh];B[fe];W[ge];B[hd];W[gd];B[hb]C[now it's like your two groups are fighting against each other: you strengthen one, white's group gets stronger, so the other gets weaker.]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[da];B[gf]C[My attack turned out badly and left me worrying about  both of my groups.=

Yes, attacking a ponnuki was a bad idea.];W[he];B[hf];W[ie]
C[any time you force the opponent through a narrow gap like this you should feel very bad.]
;B[fh];W[fi];B[la];W[na];B[oh]C[what does this move do?

Does it strengthen a weak group of yours?  Maybe a little -- if you are playing this because you are worried about the R10 stone attacking you, maybe.

Does it attack an opponent's weak group?  Not really.

Does it make territory?  Maybe a couple points?

Seems like a move around G8 would be a lot better for territory.

A move around L13 would be much better for defending your groups.

Always remember the three questions, and make sure you move addresses question #1 most of all (though if you can defend your weak group by attacking an opponent's weak group, all the better, and if you can make territory while doing that, even better!)]
;W[if]C[now your two weak-ish groups are split in half and white looks likely to chase you right into your moyo, destroying the territory potential there.]

;W[jr]LB[ir:A][kr:B]C[A good probe by white, I think.  Hard to answer.]

(;B[ir]C[This was a bad response I think, It l=
ets my opponent get away with making territory at my expense  I think L2 wo=
uld work fine?


L2 probably works but then white can crosscut and in the confusion maybe link up to the F11 area.]
;W[kr]LB[iq:B][kq:A]
(;B[kq];W[lq];B[lp];W[mq];B[js];W[lr];B[hp];W[fl]C[seems like white got everything here: reduced the bottom area AND got sente to play the big move at F8.

White should have an easy win by 10 or so points by now.];B[fm]
C[again, count: how many points does black get from this?  maybe 10.  Is there anything bigger you can do?  Anything sente?]
;W[gm];B[gn]C[same problem: g6 still leaves f6 to be fixed, so just fix the weakness first, THEN cut G8 later, or if white also fixes, then you get sente.]

Yes, look at what happens when white takes it, black almost has to play A16 since otherwise white plays there and takes away another eye and threatens B15 too ... black A19 is not as big a threat as white A16, so the ko is a tough one for black to choose.]

Hopefully you can give me some hints that will help me get stronger.
Thanks alot.
-Limpin

I hope some of my hints are useful!

The main one is to make a move not because it "looks pretty good" but to look at the WHOLE board, identify where
1) you have weak groups that need help, and then
2) your opponent has weak groups that you can use, and finally
3) where big territory is to be made.

Your opponent didn't get weak groups in this game -- so you had some early mistakes to allow that.

You mostly did a good job taking care of your weak groups before they got in serious trouble -- good!

But you often made moves in directions where neither side could make much territory.  In the early game, look where both groups have high stones (4th or even 5th line) -- that is the big area.  Later, look where you can extend far from a strong group, or where you can squeeze your opponent's weak group.

I hope my comments help you!  Thanks for the interesting game to review.]
