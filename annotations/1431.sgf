My
comments in this SGF file are what I was thinking during the game, or how
I interpreted the results of certain actions.  I'm not asking too many questions.
 Please add your own comments at any point !  Thanks !

PJK - 4k :
It was interesting game!  Petertje, I don't comment all moves but I tray
to show you same direction of may game concept.];B[dd];W[pd]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[qf];W[mc]LB[rd:a]MA[nd][nc]C[I
believe this is a bit of an overextension, but I play it regularly when I
think B will go to 'a'.  Black indeed plays there, so it works fine.

PJK: I prefer O16 , O17 as more solid sharp.  You have sam bad aji but this move give you quick develop.]
;B[rd];W[qc];B[qi];W[gc]MA[fc]C[PJK:
 F17 is better point. The top is not good direction to BLACK and invade in
top-left corrner it will be to difficult. You've strong then BLACK in top]
;B[cg];W[jd];B[ic]C[This is just a preview :-)  It's one of those games where nobody is allowed to make any territory.

PJK: Is very bad move! Give WHITE combat power.]
(;W[jc]MA[id]C[PJK: The J16 better see variant];B[id];W[ib]
;B[hb];W[jb];B[hc];W[gb];B[ha];W[ge]TR[gc][gb]MA[fd]C[Looks
okay for W.  B can take 2 stones (triangled, cfr. variation on the next move),
but then W reinforces toward the corner, which allows a strong attack.

PJK: What about F16 ?]
(;B[if];W[gg];B[je]MA[fd];W[dc]TR[jd][jc][jb][ib]SQ[gc][gb]
C[I'm
trying to use my wall & potentially make territory in combination my
two stones (squared) too.  I don't see a threat to my 4 stones (triangled)]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[de];W[cb];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd]TR[ec]C[PJK: E17 big sente and next B16.]
;W[ec]C[I'm happy.];B[ke];W[pf]C[I'm applying the principle: "first jump out, then defend".

PJK: "Contacts move is not good!"];B[pg];W[of];B[md];W[nc];B[lg]
;W[ng]MA[jq][jp]C[Idem:
I first jump out.  Anyway, I don't think I need to defend my top R group
at all, I think it's more than alive as it stands.

PJK: This is good move to separate 2 black groups , but 
if black play tenuki will be ahead (K3 or K4)];B[nh];W[mh];B[mg]

[oh]C[The
cut (at 'a') is gote, so I can run out with my 3 triangled stones.  But it
wouldn' be a great situation...  Cfr. the variation to the next move.  Maybe
the connection is better ?  (the sente connection at 'b')

PJK: "a" is good soild move. BLACK must play thickening move (ex. R12) or you'll take a lot of points!]

[rb]C[Defending
the cut & leaving some aji.  I'm quite proud of this move !  Please tell
me if it's as good as I think it is.  The only problem I see with it, is
that it takes away the possibility of attacking the R side B group.  But
I don't need to kill everything, do I ?  :-)  (Not that I would mind)

PJK: Is not good move in my opinions. I think that P13 is better! let's count points after P13:
W = 4 (left top) + 13 (righ top) + 0,5 = 17,5 
B =  8 (Left) + 6 (center) + 3 ( right) = 17

And Black must play move to secure R14, S16 or give WHITE big corner.]
;B[rg];W[dj]C[No more urgent moves, so I play a big move.];B[bj]
;W[bi]TR[gg]C[Does
the combination that follows always work ?  Isn't it better for B to live
in the lower part of the right side & leave my white stones weak ?  W
will also need to defend the corner later...  Cfr. variation to the next
move.

PJK: Yes, it goods.]
(;B[ci];W[cj];B[bh];W[bk];B[ai];W[cl]MA[jq][jp]TR[dp]C[I'm happy.

PJK: Yes, but what you think about K3? You should develop your 4-4 point.]
;B[fq];W[dq]SQ[li][nj]TR[fq]MA[hq][hp]C[This
move puts me ahead in (potential) territory, so I can permit playing quietly,
defensively and solidly.

PJK: This is not so good move. :-(
Black have good influence in center and you give more then take.]
;B[ip]SQ[nj][pp][li][fq]C[PJK: Good! Is example how use central points.]
;W[qq]LB[mq:a][kq:b][qn:c][ql:d][nq:e]C[Approach
moves at both sides (eg. 'a' or 'c') would give B a nice pincer which also
works as an extension of his group (at 'b' or 'd' respectively), so I decided
to go 3-3.

PJK: I suppose so "e" O3 is better. Now you give black strog sharp.]
;B[pq];W[qp]
(;B[po]LB[kp:a]SQ[nj][li]C[He's being generous !  Maybe his wall is a bit stronger this way, but I can still enter around 'a'.

PJK: No, black have good point on top! and you go to black wall!]
;W[qo];B[qm]MA[qh][ko]C[PJK:
???];W[qn];B[pm]LB[pn:a]C[Very bizarre.  If he wants a solid wall (as the
previous moves made me think), this is inconsistent.  I immediately played
the pierce at 'a' to keep his wall weak.];W[pn];B[qh]C[Okay, sente & reinforcing his R side group.]
;W[og];B[on];W[or]LB[kp:a][oo:b]C[I
played this as a preparation for a reduction move around 'a'.  Plus, it has
a bit of aji for the cut at 'b'.

PJK:You build black strong wall  :-<];B[pr];W[qr];B[ps];W[rm]
LB[qs:a][rl:b]C[I
think this makes 'a' and 'b' miai: I can either live in the corner, or just
nearly miss the corner but make plenty of eyes on the side.]
;B[qk]MA[kp]C[PJK: small (];W[kp]LB[lp:a]C[Feels more severe than 'a'.]
;B[mq]LB[in:a][fo:b]MA[mp]C[I expected a move like 'a' or 'b'.

PJKL: N4 is better];W[mp]C[I first want to reinforce before attacking his group to the left.]
;B[np];W[lq];B[mo]
(;W[iq]LB[hq:a]C[I felt 'a' would reinforce him (cfr. variation)

PJK: Yes];B[hq];W[jq];B[hn]MA[hp]C[Funny move !  I can still cut !

PJK: in this situation solid connection is the best way - H4]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[ho];B[io];W[go];B[fo];W[gn];B[fn];W[gm]
(;B[jn]TR[iq][jq][kp][lq][mp]LB[cn:a][dn:b]MA[hr]C[At
this point I saw the disadvantage of the cut I played.  B can reinforce himself,
and my triangled group is under pressure.

Now things get really interesting
:-)  I hadn't calculated this variation so far ahead, so I didn't know if
the problems for my bottom group would be bad.  I was a bit unhappy with
this situation, though, but I still saw plenty of possibilities.

I
was also a bit worried about my bottom L area of influence.  When B runs
out with his bottom R group, then his influence allows an invasion or a serious
reduction, I think.  For example, 'a' or 'b' look nasty.

PJK: First
black H2 is better see var.];W[hr]C[I first reinforce in case I need to go
for eye space.  I know it goes against the principle of "first jump out"
that I'm such a fan of :-)];B[gq];W[mr];B[lp]LB[nq:a]MA[sm]

well, I would've liked it better had he played at 'a', but I shouldn't count
on him making my life easy :-/

PJK: Tray count:

W = 4 (left top) + 13 (righ top) + 7 (right) + 8 (down )
+ 17 left  + 0,5 = 39,5 point
B =  12 (Left) + 6 (center) + 10 ( right) = 28 point
and same point in center.
Moreover black have weak group. then white was ahead.];W[lo]
;B[mp];W[kn]LB[jm:a]C[I expected him to extend to 'a', but...]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[km]C[Hm.  Looks a bit flimsy to me, so...];W[lm]
C[Banzai !  :-)];B[jl]LB[im:a]C[Ah, well, true.  But there's a serious weak spot at 'a' that I later abuse.]

;B[fk];W[ep]LB[hm:a][dn:b]C[This
was a very hasty move.  I should've calculated better and played 'a'.  That
would've ended all my problems.  I can then defend at 'b' or something and
win.

C[Though
I calculated until here, I didn't really see that these 2 triangled stones
would get taken so easily.  :-(  Well, it's not really a very big problem,
with my cut at 'a' and some luck if B enters the bottom L (around 'b'), I'm
still ahead.];W[hi]C[First some defensive moves here...];B[jg]

was also rather difficult to calculate ahead, but I'd calculated the variation
and saw no problem. (at this point, the SGF file has a variation that starts
with the same white stone !)];B[co];W[do];B[dm];W[cm];B[bo]
LB[bn:a][di:b]TR[do][dp][dq][dr][ep][fp]SQ[er][gr][gq][fq][gp]
[hq]C[A
bit different than what I expected.  In making my choice of defense (above
or below), I took these factors into account:

1) 'a' makes some room for my group and takes a liberty.
2) 'b' gives some interesting things.
3) the triangled group can capture the 6 squared stones in case of emergency.

So I went for defense of the group above, despite the fact that the corner might make things easier for him.]
;W[bn];B[bq]C[
At
this point, my opponent AWU (B) had to go.  He resigned instead of adjourning.
 I think he was right because of my lead in territory.  As far as the situation
in the bottom L corner is concerned, I calculated as shown in the variation
and saw no problem.

My estimate is now about 50 points for B, and
about 70 for W.  There's a lot of big endgame moves left, of course, but
I don't see a problem to win the game.];W[cq]C[B resigned here.]
