C[Hi, I've included a lot of variations as you requested. My suggestions:

- don't answer every move 
- look at  the whole board, at least when you can decide where to play, relax and look.

I hope this is useful for you.

(;B[dh]C[First problem I don't know a lot about theory... is it ok ? Can I have a little variant of what's possible ?

J: main problem here is  D15, I'd rather C15. I'll try any variations though :)]
;W[pf]
(;B[md]LB[ec:A]C[Here too ... Having a look to net commented games show me this response. Is there something else ?

J: Lots of, but this is quite ok. Maybe not in this game due to the presence of A (not too many points to be made in that zone)]
;W[pn];B[mp]C[So I did the same thing. Because I don't know more.

J: That's ok, we all  have to learn];W[kq]C[Here is a question.
1/ if i defend w make his shape more solid between d4/l3. I would like to avoid this without fear :-)

J: No way :) but you can defend gaining strengh in the corner and then attack q6]
;B[lq];W[kp]C[J: even  now your corner is open...]
(;B[qe]C[J: this is small... maybe  (see vars)];W[gp]C[I should have made a move her around g4 but I still don't know. Or maybe c6 to press him too.

J: C6 seems ok for me, but don't worry about the opponent making points, it's ok, just do more for yourself :)]
;B[cn]C[J: stiil works, 2 main chances. Main problem is if W pincers, your d15 stones could be in trouble.]

;W[bo];B[co];W[cp];B[bn]C[J: this is the second time W has "tenukied" after you play this move (before it was c15).  It's *not* urgent for him to answer, so take this into account.]
;W[qf]C[J: Time to invade or it'll be too late]
(;B[rf];W[rg];B[rd];W[qh];B[ro];W[bp]C[J: very bad GNU! :)]

(;B[om]C[I felt that this stone was weak (maybe I'm wrong) so i wanted to attack it. I should I have done ?

J: The stone is weak, but the S13 group is strong. Your corner's weak, too. I'd rather q8, maybe. From other point of view, you need points, so you can't avoid risks.]

;W[jr];B[mr];W[fl];B[dj]C[J: At least one  line wider (E10!)]
;W[ks]C[J: Don't answer this!!!];B[lr];W[qk]C[Mabe here I should have ignore threat l2 and   do r9.

J: R9 or R8 yes, long ago];B[gk]C[Again i did this feeling inspired but maybe i wasn't. The idea was that I wanted to reduce him.He was getting to big on bottom left.]

J: difficult to say; nice as you'll link it to your stones. I'm just not sure of the purpose. Maybe you can swallow M10!]
