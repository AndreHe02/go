C[I'm lietzang, playing white

D:  Hi Karl,  I'm Darrell.  I have reviewed your game.   Quite a fighting game!   I understand you've been waiting quite a while.  I hope you still want the review.  If you have any questions, just email me back and I will try to answer them.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[cp];W[pp];B[qq]C[No idea how to deal with 3-3 to my 4-4.  Remembering what membrane said, I think I just should have fought it with the idea of getting thickness.

D:  Yes.  Variation 2 here is the most common followup on the 3-3 invasion.]

;W[fd]C[very good.  You figured out the line of play for yourself.]

[mb]TR[qi][qh]CR[oe][og]C[very good.  Black has two weak groups now (marked).  Your last move makes it hard for black to live on the right side.  You have some weaknesses around the red dots that might become a problem though.]
;B[qk];W[rk]LB[pk:a][pl:b]C[Good idea, but I think you would do better to move at 'a' or 'b'.  In general, the way to attack a group is to first surround it so it can't run away, and *then* attack it's eye space.]
;B[pk];W[pl];B[ri];W[rj]LB[ok:a][oi:b]C[again, same logic.]
;B[oh]C[where to connect here?  I choose p13 to preserve p line group.

D:  I agree.];W[og];B[si];W[nh];B[oi];W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[ni]
;W[nj];B[mj];W[ok];B[oj]
(;W[mi]LB[mh:a][ng:b][oe:c]C[A move at 'a' would be better.  Right now, you have cutting points at 'a', 'b' and 'c'.  A weak group with many cutting points is a real liability.  Look at variation 2 here.

The most common error in weak go playing is leaving too many cutting points during a fight.]
;B[lj];W[li];B[nk];W[pj]C[should have filled.  thickness important.

D:  I agree.];B[ol];W[qj];B[om];W[ok];B[pk]C[plus the sequence up to this makes my stones heavy

Yes, this was very bad.  Black's stones are all connected.  Two white stones are useless, and remaining group has many weaknesses.]
;W[qk]C[This move was completely unnecessary.  You just force him to get stronger and get nothing for it.]

C[this was a wasted move.];B[ml];W[eq];B[gq];W[cn]C[I think I was thinking pinch and get territory on line C.]

;B[en]C[good cut here by al, messed me all up];W[dp];B[co];W[fn]

;W[ch];B[cj];W[dj];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi]C[seems to have worked out ok]
;W[el]C[bad move, f7 better, this one seems to concede group at e4

D:  I rather like your move.  You are building a huge territory in the middle.]
;B[fm];W[lk]C[now you are trying to save a completely worthless stone.  This stone has no value because it does not separate two of his groups, strengthen any of your groups or take any territory.  Let it go.  You would *love* for him to waste a move to capture it.]
;B[kj]C[Instead, you are pushing him right into your big territory -- exactly where you want to keep him out.]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[jh];B[jg];W[ih];B[de];W[ee]C[I didn't think this ladder out totally......now that I do, I don't think I could lose any of them.....hmmm, wonder how I got it so wrong.]

;B[jl];W[km];B[nm];W[jj];B[nj];W[jm];B[hm];W[il]C[Wonderful.  All of a sudden, black's group on the right has no eyes again and is extremely heavy.]
;B[hp]LB[op:a][mn:b]C[Here you should just make a trade.  Let black kill the white stones on the lower left, and you kill his on the middle right.  Start with a move at 'a' to threaten his lower right corner and build yourself some strength, then close him in at 'b']
;W[ho];B[go];W[gn];B[hn];W[io];B[in];W[jn];B[jo]LB[ko:a][op:b]
C[even now.  Move at 'a', then 'b' and black doesn't have a chance.]

[ph:b][am:c][ak:d][cn:e][sh:f][sf:g]C[This move just costs you a point.

At this point in the game, it's "endgame."  Look for your sente moves.  You only have 'a' 'b' 'c' 'd'.  ('c' and 'd' are not sente actually)  These sente moves would be your highest priority.    Next look for your opponent's sente moves.  'e' 'f' and 'g'.  Moving here before him is your next priority.

Finally, any moves worth points but not sente for either player.  I don't see any of these (other than 'c' and 'd')]

 alhipkins 21k*: do you agree with seki at m2

an ok game for me, although sometimes I'm capable of more depth.

D:  Black wins by 3.5 points.  Very close.])
(;AW[mh];B[nk]C[Make a solid move.];W[ol]C[Another solid move.  Black's group has no eyes yet, and his group on top is very weak.  All of your cutting points are now cleaned up.  Black must escape...]
