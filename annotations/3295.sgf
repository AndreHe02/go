AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[hi, i played black (Creed - 22k) ) in this 6-stones-handicap game. I lost by a lot. Eventhough i should have resigned early in the game, we  kept playing to try stuff. I trust the reviewer to comment the main mistakes and point out the parts i can improve. I'm still 22k on IGS, wich means total beginner. And I'm french, wich doesn't help. But if possible i' dlike my review in english because i learned the game in America so i am more familliar with the english terms.
If comments on white's moves were possible i'd appreciate, but don't bother if it's too much of a pain. :-}
Thanks again for the review.

Llywelyn:

I hope this review helps.  I've tried to address the major issues, and show a lot of  variations.  Just as a word of warning--I use some korean terms in with the Japanese, I think I translated them all, but if you have trouble understanding something just email me and I'll translate.

Your post-game analysis was good, so just pretend you are reviewing in your own games ;)

Here are the three major issues I'd like you to work on:

* __Don't cling to your opponents stones, defend from a distance__    It seems like most of your moves were *right next* to the opponent's moves.

* __Tenuki, always an option__  Against anyone, but a stronger player in particular, do not allow your opponent to dictate the tempo of the game.  Let your opponent take a little in exchange for you getting compensation somewhere else.  Sure, you may get a local loss in one corner, or on one side, but in exchange you get a global gain by leveraging your other six stones.

* __Sacrifice__  You can't save all of your stones, you can't keep your opponent from making some territory or influence.  Be willing to trade a few stones to get a better position, be willing to sacrifice a few (or many) stones here or there.]
;W[fq]
(;B[dn]TR[jc][jd]C[Llywelyn: First, let's mention a principle of handicap games.

Tenuki early, tenuki often.

(son-ppaem in Korean).

W is at a severe disadvantage (between 60 and 80 points), so you can aford to give him one corner or side in exchange for locking down the rest of the board.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[fc];B[fd]LB[hc:A][id:C][df:B][hq:D]C[Llywelyn: I don't especially like the contact play of F16 here.  There is nothing really wrong with it, but it is just not my style.  I prefer any of the marked moves.

A is a nice, tight pincer that restricts W's movements. 

B is calm and peaceful, but gives you a great framework.

C is nice because it also can help to develop Q16 later while still keeping the pressure on F17.

D is a very powerful move that let's you chase W around the board to great profit.]

;B[cd];W[cc];B[jp]LB[gd:B][pg:E][cj:D][fj:C][pm:F][hq:A]C[Llywelyn: These are the points that I am looking at.

A is huge.  This  cuts away W's base and W cannot live locally.  Everywhere W has to run looks like it belongs to Black, and so you can profit *enormously* by chasing W all the way across the board, building on both sides.

B is also big since it makes any W plays to expand that group less valuable, while strengthening your own wall.

C/D are to lock down the area as yours.

E/F are just big plays,];W[qp];B[pq]TR[po]C[i thought extending here would good for the lower right part to strengthen my K4 stone...

Llywelyn: Right idea, but I think I would prefer the other direction at P5.]

(;B[pe]LB[fc:A][pj:C][qm:B]C[Because i read somewhere i shoukdn't get the corners in handicap games but build influence on the center, and later territory i blocked this  way. any comment?

Llywelyn: Don't rely on what you read ;-)

As a general rule, that is correct, but there is also a saying that "if one player has all four corners, black should resign."

In all cases, try to look at the whole board situation in deciding direction. 

Here There are a few things to look at. 

W's stone at A means that there isn't going to be much territory made or destroyed on the north side.  

B's stone at B and C will put a lot of restriction on W's movements.]
