RE[W+19.5]

C[Dear reviewer,

i just learned the rules and played only against people that learned the
rules from me (i like the game and try to inspire more friends to play
it to, but i'm not very successful with that :( ).

I have no idea of strategy in GO, so i wanted to play on the internet to play against more experienced players.

I commented this game by myself as good as i could. (I had black)

I wonder where my worst failures are, so that i can try to avoid them in the future.

Regards
Danny];B[pd];W[cp];B[cd]C[Minor point. Usually black plays upper left and lower left, then the left middle.]
;W[pq];B[jd];W[jp]
(;B[qi]C[This is a somewhat hollow move. You don't really make a stronger framework playing here. framework is territory you sort of control. Rather than making a minor grab right here, you should attack white. These two
points are good ones to try. Q5 is a little better than E3 though, as
you can run easily from Q5, but you can be boxed in at E3. There are
many other points to attack from, but these are the two that jump out
at me.];W[qc]C[As you didn't attack, white took the initiative.]

(;B[qe]C[i was not really sure how to defend against this attack.

You got the right idea, but this is too passive. It gives white a little
more breathing room. this is a fairly standard joseki(sequence of
moves)];W[pc];B[oc];W[qd];B[oe];W[re]C[at this point i realized, that he'll build a living group... (and had no idea how to prevent it)

It's very difficult to stop white from getting life this early in the game.
Unless he made a mistake early on, I don't think it would've been
possible];B[ec]C[so i started to secure my other corner.

Again, it is better to attack than defend. While it makes a strong defense for that corner, it leaves an ocean of territory for white to grab.]
;W[qf]
(;B[pf]C[my thought's where on the left upper side, so i missed that atari on R15 (shame on me :( )

Not really. Its a ko, so white doesn't hold that point. This is actually better than would could've happen. Check variation.]
;W[pe];B[od];W[qe];B[pg];W[qg];B[qh]C[And in this method, white didn't get so much territory, and that stone is alive, and you've made some real nice thickness.]
;W[ob];B[nb]C[good response. Still, these kind of moves are usualy reserved for the end of the game. White could've invaded somewhere else easier. Main point you need to get from this game. When your options are attack or defend, attack.]
;W[pb]
(;B[dg]C[same problem as before. I saw the upper right corner lost, so i tried to spread on the left side

Right idea, but too small. Any of the other 3 would've been better. C10's a
little small as well, but grabs a greaat deal of territory nonetheless]
;W[dj]C[White grabbed there now. Invading under hims still a viable option though]

(;B[ci]C[bad move. This way he just builds a wall down the middle. Gives you the corner on a platter, but he gets an edge plus puts pressure on your
stones.];W[cj];B[rg]C[trying to block his advance down the right side.]
;W[ph];B[of]C[i didn't play that on P12, because of K4 i would never catch Q12. Or was that a failure?

No, that was a good move catching that. S13 would've worked better at Q12, though.]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[oh];B[rj]C[there i saw a chance to build a living group.]
;W[oi];B[qk];W[pj];B[oj];W[pk];B[ok];W[pl];B[ql];W[ol];B[rh]
;W[nk];B[md]C[Again,
too small. O10 would've let you save those stones, but even if you
sacrificed them, theres still a lot of board to claim. Good job making
life on the right edge though.];W[nj]
(;B[fh];W[fj];B[gi];W[gj]
(;B[hj];W[hk]
(;B[bj]C[This is an ending move, worth about two points. letting white worm into your center cost you about 40 points.]
;W[ij];B[hi];W[ii];B[ih];W[jh];B[kg];W[hh];B[ig];W[gh];B[fi]
;W[jg];B[gg];W[kh];B[ei];W[ej]
(;B[bk]C[C9 would've been better, as white ignored you long enough to endanger his line of stones.]
;W[lg];B[kf];W[lf];B[mf];W[lh];B[ng];W[nh];B[mg];W[mh]
(;B[cl]C[A knights defense or a one hop would've worked a little better, as it gets more while still making a good defense]
;W[bm];B[dm];W[cm]
(;B[dl]C[Don't
be afraid of the opponent. That extension threatens D7, but has no
teeth. look what would've happened if he went for that one stone]

C[Nice
jump.];W[nq];B[oo];W[op];B[no]C[i was happy, that i spread down the
left side so far, but had no real idea, how to make something out of
it, to get more control towards the middle.];W[mp];B[mn]C[i feared to make wider jumps, so i took little (more secure) steps like this.

With stones right near you, that was a good idea. even a one hop could be cut off]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[ln];B[ml];W[mm];B[nm];W[lm];B[nl];W[ok];B[lk]
;W[mk];B[ll];W[lj];B[sf]C[too small again. You were worming into his territory so well. A one hop to K8 or K9 would've eaten another 5-8 points.more if he made a mistake blocking you]
;W[se];B[rf];W[na];B[ma];W[oa];B[mb];W[je];B[kd];W[if];B[he]
C[goo blocking point. J15 would've worked as well, but I think it works out the same.]
;W[hf];B[gf];W[ie];B[id];W[hd]C[pointless move for white.];B[ge]
;W[og];B[em]C[again, i don't know how to attack deeper into his territory, so i took those little steps again.

Again, a one hop would've worked well. Theres no way he could've stopped you.]
;W[en];B[kl];W[me];B[nf];W[ne];B[nd];W[km];B[sq];W[sr];B[sp]
;W[rr];B[pp]C[This could've waited till later. Its only worth 1 point, where your worming is doing a lot more damage.]
;W[fm]C[White stops your extending on this side, and saves a lot of his territory.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[op]
(;W[mr]C[i wonder why he did played to N2. Was there a chance for me to do some damage there?

See vairation. I'm making the assumption white just played "elsewhere"]

Not necessary. He was toast, just like H16];W[ic];B[hc];W[gd]
;B[gc];W[bi]C[i didn't understand his move on B11. Or was he just testing me?]
;B[bh];W[dk];B[ai];W[ek]C[pointless for white];B[ah]C[pointless. Even if he tried a13 or a12, just close him off]
;W[on];B[jj]C[ok, i saw no chance to get anything more out of this situation, so i started filling 'dame'.
I wonder, if i could build something living down in the middle in this situation, if i only would be better?]

[ss]C[You didn't do too badly in this game. The two main points you need to remember are:

1. Grab territory before you defend what you have.
2. Don't be afraid of your opponents attacks.

All in all, not to bad, Hope this helps your go. :)])

blocks. See it?];B[ck]C[And with this setup, you have a couple ways to
poke white. F4, C6, heck, even d11 threatens white while strengthening
black. You could even invade the lower left edge, which could easily
survive, as you have those two stones to help black.]))
