C[I'm Blake, 13k KGS, and I will be your reviewer for the evening.

All of my comments will be prefixed with "B:" to avoid any confusion.]

[cd:5][pd:4][de:A][df:D][pp:1][dq:3]C[B:  This seems to be an unusual reply.  When you play the 5-3 point (White 2), you are emphasizing influence towards the center and side, rather than the corner.  Instead of White 6, one of A-D would be preferable.]
;B[ci];W[dc]C[B: This is small right now.];B[dd];W[ed]LB[fe:A]
C[B: I don't really care for this move.  It seems slow.  I suggest a play at A instead.]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[ef];W[ge];B[fg];W[hg];B[gh];W[jh]C[B: It's odd to continue like this.  This area is settled; play elsewhere.  The bottom, for instance, is in desperate need of White's attention, to reduce black's framework (moyo).]
;B[qe]C[B: this is a very close approach.  A bit odd.]
(;W[pe]C[B: I would consider turning in the other direction (see variation).]

[jl:60][im:59][in:61][qn:37][jq:41]C[B: Many of the last 30 moves or so seem to have been largely "thank you moves."  That is to say, they don't really accomplish anything other than solidifying the opponent's frameworks.  49-55 are notable in this regard (Black is playing into white's wishes).]
;W[km];B[kn];W[lm];B[ln];W[mm];B[mn];W[nm];B[nn];W[om]C[B: more 'thank you' moves.]

;B[sn];W[sl];B[ro];W[cp]LB[cl:B][cm:A]C[B: bad choice for an invasion, I think.  You've left it a bit late, and this is too close to the D3 stone.  You can probably make small life somewhere in this area, but A-B may be better ideas than what was played.]
;B[dp]
(;W[do]C[B: I think that you can live without much of a fight after your opponent plays D4.  See variations for some ideas.]

;B[fn];W[em];B[gn];W[fl]LB[bk:B][ck:C][fk:A]TR[em][fm]C[B: This is an odd move.  Empty triangles are bad shape, as they are inefficient.  If you want to play a move like this, play A instead.  I do recommend that you fix up some eye-shape first, though, with a play at B or C.]
;B[ck]C[B: ...your opponent's good move is often your good move :)]
;W[bk]C[B: This contact play isn't really a good idea in this situation, as you will suffer from a shortage of liberties in the fight if black plays properly.  See variations for some problems you might run into.]

(;B[cl];W[bl];B[am];W[bj];B[bi];W[cj];B[dj];W[dk];B[ek];W[dl]
;B[ej];W[ai];B[ah];W[aj];B[bh];W[gl]C[B: This is the same problem we saw earlier; you have made an empty triangle, which is a very inefficient shape, when you have a good alternative (H8).  If you play at H8, you can't be cut, because you can connect to either K8 or F8 with one move after Black plays J8 or G8.  They are miai.]

TR[cc][ii][fk]C[B: It's a bit early to pass.  there are still points on the board, even besides the invasion later..  I have marked them.  Without playing these points, the game won't be scored properly.]
;B[jc]C[I was wondering if there was was any way i couldve avoided this invasion or reduced it's impact on my territory.

B: Well, I'm not sure you can actually kill the stone; you have a ton of influence in the area, but that is a -lot- of space in there.  I think you played too close, though.  See variations.

A good thing to remember is that an attachment doesn't really work as an attack.  It is usually used in a situation where you need to make small life, and you attach to an enemy's stone, because it has the tendency to strengthen both sides(!).  Keep this in mind.]

[ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[B:  I hope this helps.  Some general pointers:

* Don't be afraid to play away from where your opponent is playing.  Begin trying to see where you can ignore moves, where you need to _stop_ pushing the opponent, and so forth.

* Remember that playing close moves (connection, kosumi) may not be the best idea for beginning an attack.  The knight's move (keima) approach is very useful, as is the one space (ikken tobi) approach.  Close moves can be useful--don't get me wrong--but they do bring you under attack pretty quickly (and pretty directly).

* Both players in this game built giant territories and then tried to keep them all.  This is not the proper approach.  Feel free to build large territories, but keep in mind that you probably won't be able to defend the entire thing against attack--and plan accordingly.  Desperate, 'by the seat of the pants' invasions are generally _not_ the winning strategy you want to rely on :)

Good luck.])
