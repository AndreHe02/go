C[Dear reviewer,

Thanks by advance for all your comments ! I am not really 1d, so don't hesitate to say things that a 1d should know, they might be usefull for me !

I feel like having made many mistakes, but oddly didn't think to be that behind before move 139 which I guess is the losing move ...]
;B[kj]C[Things to watch for in this game:

1) Where is the profit?

2) Keep consistent with previous moves.

You lost this game because you didn't make good use of your center stones.]

White's P5 looks reasonable here, to reduce the center.
O4 would seem "normal"; O3 much too passive.];B[qq]C[This helps white to gain center strength.

-----------------------
The 3-3 point was the mistake.  White let you have a lot back by playing O3.  This way black has connected to the outside, and White is not as strong.

I would guess that this result has favored black overall, due to the potential to attack the white group.  But white does have the threat of playing S6 in the future.

-------------------------------------
It's a big point.  If white plays around here first, the M17 stones will be much harder to attack.  On the other hand, this wall is fairly far from white's M17 group.

I would say that white has chosen a good time to depart from the usual sequence.]

The position isn't finished yet.  Who will get to play B14?

I would play there now without even thinking  about it.  It yields sente for a moment, but White connects here, her groups are much harder to attack, and the center black stones much less effective..]

;W[oc];B[ka];W[oa];B[na]C[How has it turned out?

Compared to Position I, white has a potential eye at R17.

But the big difference is that white has sente in this position!
This is NOT a suitable position II, for a comparison.
Let's continue the analysis....]
(;W[fb]C[(White judges that his weak group is strong enough.)]
;B[gb];W[eb];B[hc];W[ng]C[Let's call this Position III.

White's shape is not as stylish as in Position I, but has some eye potential.  The H17 stone weakens white, but that was white's choice, not black's skill.

What has changed since the invasion at O17?  White has lost eye space on the side, and must run away, albeit with decent shape.

But where can black profit?  Note that the potential of the right side has decreased, due to O13.

I have to call the invasion at O17 a failure.];B[ph]TR[nf][pm]
C[If black had not invaded at O17, he could play this move at O14, which would make a much larger potential right side.

Then, due to the threat of invading at O17, white might well defend on the upper side, and black could also play Q7 or some such.]

------------------------------------
The attack is real -- white must take not to lose the group.  But the important issue is, where can black get territory out of all this?]

(;B[ll]C[This forces white to play L9 and cut black.  I hope she remembered to say "thank you".]

;W[rm];B[lo];W[lq];B[kp];W[ri]C[the tradeoff of "my" right side goes on ...
------------------------------------------------
1) the side was never "yours".
2) White is playing endgame moves while you play 
    middle-game moves.  You must make sure that you're
    right, by mounting a profitable attack.

C[here I give The 4 stones, making the two white groups definitely alive ... should I connect ? I guess so ...]
;B[jl]C[If there is a single "losing move", this is it.

Up to this point, you have a splitting attack on two white groups.  To let the two connect is to declare that you're quite satisfied with your profit from the attacks.
But you have no profit.  Your center stones have become weak, and the double cutting point at K7/M7 is a big threat.

Compare this position to the position just before the initial invasion of the upperside.  Teritories haven't changed much, while BLACK now has vulnerable stones.

Either keep white's stones separated or admit your strategy has failed.]
;W[pj];B[mi]C[but this result looked ok to me. I thought to make points in the center and getting some influence to prevent white from making too much territory on the left side ...
Is white really ahead ?
---------------------------------------
White has sente to play B14.  If she does, the territory is slightly in favor of black, but white has much more potential in the lower-left quadrant.

With the cut possible at K7, black doesn't really have much influence.

Summary: White should win easily from this position.

Reason: Black got no profit from the attack, while white got profit (4 stones captured) and security.]
;W[id];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ie]C[Now white is ahead on territory.]
;W[hd];B[bf]C[Here is I guess the losing move ... I should g14 it seems ... what to think about the position then ?


Black can't win a simple endgame, with G14 or any other move.

B14 is your only hope of winning.  Either play it or resign.]
