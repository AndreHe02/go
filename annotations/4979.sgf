C[buckyyowza: Comments by Mark Fyffe, prefixed with buckyyowza.  I hope you enjoy my review.

Hello, here i have just 2 questions.

1) It is in the beginning and i was asking my invading the corner was good

2) It is in the middle game and i was asking if invading with the touch move in the left was good. (My be not couse the invasion became an impossible escape

Thank you very much

(;B[bp]LB[cp:A]C[buckyyowza: Certainly not ;-)  Black B4 is a terrible mistake, costing many points in the corner.  White should exploit this play at C4 (see var for what black should have done).

Should i stop here?]

C[Was it a good invasion?

buckyyowza: yes, black was very lenient in fact.  See var on 19 for some more normal outcomes.  I would say that white is off to a very good start in this game.]
;W[ec]LB[pj:A]C[buckyyowza: very slow!  White should play a stone around Q10 now to couter black's growing thickness on the lower half of the board.]
;B[pf];W[nd]LB[qh:A][pi:B]C[buckyyowza:  Again, this direction of play helps black build a large moyo.  I would prefer a pincer response: R12 or Q11]
;B[pi];W[jc];B[ld];W[mf];B[jd];W[id];B[je];W[ie];B[kc];W[ic]
;B[jg];W[mc]LB[me:A][hi:B][oq:C]C[buckyyowza: This is nice idea, but black still threatens to cut at N15.  This moyo will be very difficult for white to invade if all of his thickness becomes cut off.  I would prefer a play at N15, H11, or P3 to either reduce or invade this large area before it becomes too sealed off.]
;B[if];W[kf]SQ[pi][fl][qp][kq]C[buckyyowza: it seems here that white is attacking black's group, but in fact it is black's group that is strong!  There are several places for this group to connect to, but white may be cut.  In general, attacking a strong group with a weak one doesn't work out so well ;)]

;B[rf];W[qf];B[qg];W[re];B[nj];W[ko]LB[hi:A][oq:B]SQ[jg][nj]
[fl][fp]C[buckyyowza: this cap does not work because it has no thickness to back it up.  This stone then because a weak group with nowhere to run.  The marked black stones all prevent escape.  Again, I will favor H11 or P3 to invade this area.]
;B[km]
(;W[jq]LB[hi:A][li:B]C[buckyyowza: yes.  I would not play any more moves in this area until there is something to connect to.  There is no eye space here so an invasion cannot hope to succeed without a mistake on black's part.  White's best chance is to push in with H11, M11, etc but this is still not big enough to counter black's huge moyo.  Recall that white created this situation by not making some urgent plays to prevent the moyo from being built between moves 30 and 34.

This was a bad invasion.

(;B[lr]LB[kr:A]C[buckyyowza: white can play snap back at L2 for easy life.  black can also play L2 instead of M2 to foil white's invasion entirely.]
;W[lp];B[kr];W[np];B[oq];W[op];B[pp];W[po];B[qo];W[pn]LB[ml:A]
C[buckyowza: white needs to move more quickly to prevent losing eye space.  N8 looks like the right way to run to put pressure on black's center and right side.]
;B[nn]
(;W[on]TR[pn][po]C[buckyyowza:  The empty triangle shape is almost always bad!  This is no exception.  Better to play at R6 and risk the cut.  If white can make either group live then the game is not bad]
;B[nm];W[qn];B[ql];W[ro]LB[lh:B][gi:C][rm:A]C[buckyyowza:  White is in a losing position through this entire fight: trying to make a weak group live by running in directions that force black to remove the potential to make eyes.  Black can even play S7 in response to this move to get sente.  White would be better off here to leave this ill-fated dragon alone and play moves like M12 or G11 to try and make more of a presence in the center, that might be useful later to save those lower right stones.]
;B[rp];W[so]LB[jn:A]C[buckyyowza: If black follows this with K6, then all of white's stones here are unconditionally dead.  Again, better to tenuki and play off of this aji later in the game.]

LB[kn:A]C[buckyyowza:  Along the lines of the empty triangle, you'll also want to avoid touching stones that you want to kill.  Here it is better to protect the cut directly at L6 - increase white's liberties while putting the same pressure on black.]
;B[lm];W[kn];B[jm];W[im];B[jl];W[il];B[jk];W[ik];B[gj];W[jj]
C[buckyyowza: White gets a very lucky outcome in this game! For the rest of this fight, black has many opportunities to just end it. I will try to point these out ;-)
Here, black can simply play J11, threatening a cut and preventing escape to the upper left.]

(;B[kk];W[hj];B[gi];W[gk];B[fk];W[hi]
(;B[hh]C[buckyyowza: this hane is a mistake - black must be forgetting that white is thick here.  G12 is much more effective.]
;W[gh];B[gl];W[hk];B[ei]C[buckyyowza: black gives white a gift.  This is better at F10 - sometimes the best way to protect against a cut is to put a stone at the cutting point.]
;W[fj];B[fi];W[ej]
(;B[gg]C[buckyyowza: black is feeling suicidal now. Best to play D11, then catch this stone in a net - see var.]

(;W[kb]C[buckyyowza:  Exciting game!  Since this game was pretty much one big fight, I don't have many overall comments to make.  Just this one: choose your direction of play more carefully in the beginning.  When your opponent is able to create huge moyos then the game becomes harder.  Beyond that, I'd say your ability to fight your way out of an impossible situation is not bad ;-)  I hope my commentary through the fight helps shed light on some tesuji you may not have been seeing before.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions about this game.

Ok the game was finished here.
