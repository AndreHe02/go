C[Thank you for reviewing my game.

I am relatively recent  to go. I felt like I was playing a good game for me. I was focusing on extending my bases toward the center and it worked somehow.

Please do not hesitate to comment also white's moves as well

Many thanks

pto: Hi, I am pto of KGS from Finland. I am aggressive player and I rely heavily on my intuition while playing. Usually my games end in resignation and in big captures. 

While commenting I don't use variations. Instead I point out starting points and other things to take into account and leave the variations for reader. So you still need to do some work yourself. 

Overall this game was solid. Both players avoided dangerous situations and took time to make their groups strong.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]C[pto: Ah, am seeing a kobayashi-fuseki. Happens to be my favourite ;-)]
;W[iq]C[pto: Pincer is one anti-Kobayashi technique. It is usually played at H3 though.]
;B[cn];W[co]C[pto: This is bad for white. It would be joseki, if both F3 and J3 were missing - and it would be best if white had already a stone at D10 to nullify the black wall. When played in this situation black will get the wall and black F3 is just about in the where is should not be (for white perspective).]
;B[dn]C[linka: I didn't know how to respond? what is the proper joseki?

pto:  This is absolute. Black gets nice wall to develop. And think how C6 would look if white played D6, surely this has to be very important point.]
;W[eq];B[fo]C[linka: I wanted to get territory + influence c6-c9

pto: I like this, even if it canot cut J3 from the corner, it is better that F4 which would leave nasty cut at E5. Now white has to do something fof J3.

Btw. do you understand that the comment you added here means roughly "I want everything"? ;-)]
;W[fr];B[ep]C[pto: G3 might have been sente and it would have made black stones a bit stronger.]
;W[dq];B[cj]C[pto: Now black shape at the corner is starting to be so strong that he could try to play more aggressively and approach the upper left corner. But there is nothing wrong in playing solidly like this it just looks a bit slow for me.]
;W[cg]C[pto: I usually advice not to play this long corner enclosure. These does not make that much more teritory than conventional enclosures, and they leave much more opportunities for the opponent.

Now there is two big point for black, One around K16 and one around R9.]
;B[lq]C[pto: This is the third large move, it is more solid than those two before but it might wase some potential on the right side. 
Perhaps this would be better at N3 to eliminate white O3. Either play solid moves or fast moves, but don't play semi-solid-semi-fast moves. You get usually worst from the two flawour.

Now white has to destroy the moyo before it gets more strength.]
;W[gq]C[pto: This is important point. If black plays here he can push white down and build a wall toward center. But it is not time for this just now.]
;B[qn]LB[qo:A]C[linka: is A better?

pto: If you want  to take corner - yes. Now black has two streched extensions from the Q3 stone. Not good.  This follows you solid style but here it is becomming already too slow and black is starting to be overconcentrated in the corner.

After this white will enter at the right side and he still has space to settle. All potential from that side has dissappeared. How about playing in bigger scale, R9 for example. After that white has no trouble-free moves left at the right side.]
;W[qi];B[qf];W[ql]C[pto: Now the weakness of R6 comes out. One entry point for white is R4, which is very close to connect to this white stone. Black corner is shaky. And when we connect this weakness to overlong extension to M3 anything can happen. 

Try some variations on white, throw one black stone to T19 and then invade in different locations around the corner. Just see how it develops.]
;B[jc]LB[gc:2][mc:1]C[linka: seemed like a good idea to play then 1 or 2?

pto: This was the remaining big point. And this is huge at this point. Both black and white have corner enclosures facing this location. Now white is seriously in disadvantage.]
;W[mc];B[gc];W[pb];B[qc]C[pto: And in this situation too, I would not have allowed white to settle so easily. Unfortunatelly in this situation it would leaed to mutually dangerous fight.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[qd];W[lb]C[pto: White has easily settlet his group, black could have had more proactive attitude, but that would propably have lead to weak stones for both players.]
;B[dc]C[linka: I went for territory on D17 because I didn't know which black group to extend toward the center

pto: I don't like this, but that is my personal oppinnion. Reason is that because white has long corner enclosure, there might be all kinds of trick. I might perhaps have played F17 instead of G17 and then aim at 3-3 invasion. But like I said, my style is aggressive and yours is solid. And solid style wins games more reliably.

But try it out, go back and test how F17 would work. You need this study if you some day happen to face me ;-)]
;W[cc];B[ec];W[cb]C[pto: Now white is stong. how many point is that black group worth? Does it have two eyes? How about white J18 followed by H16 or K18? And the most important guestion, who gained in these last four or five moves?]
;B[ed];W[de];B[ee]C[pto: Now it looks a bit better for black.]
;W[om]C[pto: This was one key point, but white could still take more aggressive attitude and dive deeper. Black is weak in that corner.]
;B[pm];W[pl]C[linka: I was afraid white could build something in the center so went for the cut

pto: Both black and white can access the center from several directions so there will not propably be much point in the center. Black would have needed G3 to build something at the center. This kind of cuts are really hard core trouble.]
;B[ol];W[ok]C[pto: White should propably just extend from P7. O7 perhaps. If black protects the corner white can capture P8 in geta and if black protects P8 white can attack the corner. Try some variations and remember that P7 can be sacrificed if that allows access to the corner. 

Key here is that by making solid extension white forces black to choose and can then act based on that.]
;B[nl];W[nm];B[ml];W[mm];B[lm]C[linka: oops, did not count liberties. Was in a rush to connect somehow with M3.

pto: No need for any rush, black can run towars upper and left sides.]
;W[ln];B[mn];W[ll];B[on];W[km];B[nn];W[lm];B[mk]C[pto: I hope black has plan how to resist R3, S6 and other attack agains that corner. Just try different white attacks and see how it goes. I think black is not in danger, but you should consider these attacks.]
;W[oi];B[mi];W[jj]C[pto: This is important for white. Without this, black could build a moyo in the center by threatening the weak white group.]
;B[kd];W[od];B[oe];W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[mf];W[le]C[pto: This was not good for white. Now black got strength to help the weak group. On the other hand black should not get much teritory at upper side after this.]
;B[nh];W[rg];B[rf];W[qg];B[pg];W[ph];B[og];W[lf];B[mg]C[pto: Here white got nice result. Black shape looks like a rat-tail: long and shallow.]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[bo];B[kh]C[linka: tried to cut white groups m14 and k10

pto: Cutting is allway good and this may and up building some teritory at upper side. But now white can push downwards and attack the lower right group and connect simuntaneously. And after white center has gained some strength that black group at the left side may become weak (cut at E6 for example).]
;W[hk]C[pto: Pretty slow stone, L4 would be more active and connect more steadily. It would also make E6 more dangerous.]
;B[df];W[cf];B[dg]C[pto: Usually white should not allow black to hane at C12.]
;W[hh];B[gg]C[linka: I wanted to keep some kind of a moyo there and stop white

pto: I would not call these moyos anymore, it either is or is not teritory. This area is open to two direction (M4 group and H12) so it is unlikely to be worth anything more than ten points.]
;W[hg];B[hf];W[kg];B[gh];W[hi];B[fj];W[hn]C[pto: White makes nice shape, but E6 would be attack that I would like to see.]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[ch];W[fp];B[bg];W[bf];B[ce];W[be];B[cd];W[bd]
;B[bh];W[fa]C[pto: Instead of this white should first push to left and reduce black teritory, perhaps G8 or F9.]
;B[db]C[pto: Usually F18 is good move agains monkey jumps. It requires that you have stone at G17.]

;W[lh];B[lg];W[ki];B[kj];W[eo];B[mp];W[qm];B[pn];W[kq];B[kp]
;W[kr];B[lr];W[jp];B[ko];W[jo];B[lo]C[pto: This was good result for black. Taken all the weaknesses in the corner, black has pulled it up very nicely.]

;W[ra];B[sb];W[kc];B[ld];W[md];B[ig];W[jb];B[ic]LB[lc:A]C[linka: was A better?

pto: It is sente that makes you opponent weaker. 

Black could protect this shape also by playing at H19. Try H19 and see what happens if black can play throw-in at E19. But black is only barely strong enough to do it.]
;W[ih];B[kg];W[ia];B[lc];W[kb];B[ks];W[js];B[ls]C[pto: Ah, end game sente. Good.]
;W[ir];B[sg];W[sh];B[sf];W[ri];B[kn];W[qq]C[pto: Too late, white should not have played P7 if he still inteded to invade.]
;B[qp];W[rq];B[rp]C[linka: or R2?

pto: This is better, I think white would live after black R2 because there will be many cutting points and white can try to connect . Try it out.]
;W[am];B[bl];W[gj];B[oh]C[pto: No, white attack is much bigger. Defend.]
;W[fk];B[oj]C[linka: could try to invade the white group.

pto: Risky idea, white could ignore this and play E10 now. Then guestion is whether white group at right lives or not. Good player goes through variation and determines based on that.]
;W[pi];B[jn]C[pto: White can limit black push easily even if he now plays E10, which canot be stopped easily.]
;W[ej];B[fi];W[jm]C[pto: Bad for white, Black can do only limitted damage but white E9 is huge.]
;B[ek];W[gi]C[pto: Thank you move. This is worh zero points.]

;B[gk];W[qa];B[fk];W[sa];B[rd];W[tt]C[pto: Life and death problem: black to capture. Try to find it out (see next slide for hints).]
;B[tt]C[pto: White has two weak points, N18 and P17, start from these. Try it untill you find it. And then go back to see how this shape was formed.]
;W[tt]C[pto: The conclusion. Black won. Both played solid and safe moves, both made some weak stones that might have collapsed agains stronger opponent. And both missed some nice posibilities. But on the other hand, both played a good and solid game.

However solid, I think black played one or two too slow stones. I don't like to do this, but I have to suggest that black makes experiments with a bit more aggressive strategy. But be carefull not to lose you solidness, it is really good thing. So try to play some aggressive stones at correct moments.]
