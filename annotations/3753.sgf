I think this is doable, However, the current siutation favors white anyway.]

(;B[oc]LB[ob:A]C[usually this move is an overplay, but black has support at J17. so: good move?

Defnitely, if W[a\], then B is better then playing at B[O16\].]

It is hard to say here. From the results, W is not bad.];B[ob]

Yes, I agree White here.];B[re]LB[rd:A]C[should B[a\].];W[rg]

(;B[rd];W[nh]C[what is the evaluation of this result? good for black or white? are there mistakes in the fight after white O17?


B get the corner while W has limited the potential of W. I think W is better due to the fault of B[S15\], B wasted 1 move.]

Yes, defnitely]
(;B[qn];W[pm];B[qq]C[is this a good choice for black, or rather (see variation)]
;W[oo];B[pp];W[op];B[rm];W[rl];B[rn];W[jq]C[This feels good for white, restricting black to the corner. But: black has some 10 points, and the aji of R8/S9.



This is bad for B.]
(;B[jh]C[Good move? Restricting white's mojo, and expanding black's? Or is the lower left corner bigger?


It is a OK move.];W[dr];B[dq];W[er];B[cr];W[gq]C[Please comment on mistakes, even when i don't ask questions :)

Sure, I feel Black made W thick in the right lower conner. The situation favors W.]
;B[cn];W[bm];B[dm];W[kj]C[Strange move? or OK?];B[jn]C[Now some difficult fighting. Black has a lot secure territory, white needs points in the center? Please comment on black K6 and the ensuing fight.]

This progress is OK for both parties.];B[hj]C[the rest is endgame. Thank you for your comment and time.



Overall, Both are playing quite good, but White is better. Black made several mistakes

1) B[D12\] too slow
2) B[S15\] wasted one move
3) In right lower corner, Black make white too thick.
4) B should not give up B[K6\].

Due to these mistakes, B lost the game to W. Otherwise, the story will be different.]

If play in this way, I think W is better.];B[pk]))
(;B[nd];W[pf];B[ng];W[ph];B[qp]C[or this?

This does not look a beter way to expand black moyo than the actual game. White has vairous way to invade into the Black territory, which is the only territory of B.]
