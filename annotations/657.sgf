C[To the reviewer: Thanks in advance for your comments. I am sure
they will be valuable to me and others how study this game.  I played black "cut" in his game and won by 1.5 points. The game
could have gone either way. Please provide comments as to how
black could have come out way ahead instead of having to play
a tense game all the way to the end!  I ask few questions along the way, so I would appriciate any
comments on those too. Thanks again. [cut\]];C[Igc2000 Generated Sgf File]

of F4?

;W[ed]C[I like to play the simple Joseki of E17,but did not want white
to play D16 followed by C15 so I extended to prevent the potential.
I do not think I followed a particular Joseki here. Could I have
allowed the variation and still reduce white's moyo?

klin: You don't need to be constrained by Joseki.]
(;B[cf]C[klin: This is a good move.];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[ci]
C[klin: B18 is big.  B can play B18 first.  After W J17, B can play some place else, or C11.]
;W[ic];B[qg];W[nc];B[ob];W[ne]C[I expected white to play O18 or P17. When white didn't I played
it myself but It looks small. What should black play after W
O15?

klin: B plays at O18 OK.];B[nb];W[mc];B[of]C[Should I have worried about W R15? Is P14 too defensive? What
is a good move instead of P14?

klin: P14 a little bit slow.  You can wait until W R11, then P14.  Now, you have choices of C8 or R10.  I like C8.]
;W[ck];B[fm];W[ek];B[bb];W[qi];B[rh]C[klin: S12 too slow.];W[ef]
;B[jn]C[klin: K6 slow too. B could play around K15.  If B wants to enlarge the lower side, at least plays at O7.]

klin: I don't think the dragon will die.  But you never know. :-)]
;B[no];W[ni]C[klin: W O11 helps B.  W could play at M12 and threat to kill.]
;B[nk];W[oj]C[Why did white play P10? Did I miss something here? I was more
afraid of L14 or something in that area instead of W P10.

klin: No idea.];B[hg]C[klin: B H13 should J7 aand gamble with the dragon.  It should not die with the help of W O11.]

klin: yes.];W[im];B[kl];W[nn]C[klin: W can give up the 4 stone here by playing at J3 now. If B plays J8, W can H8, then G7.  W would have won big.]
