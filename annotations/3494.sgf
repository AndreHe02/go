C[Hi Ian. I hope i can help you improve significantly by reviewing this game for you.

-Mark];B[pd];W[dp]C[KuroSama [?\]: hi
bloodhamme [?\]: hey];B[ki];W[pp];B[dd]
(;W[no]SQ[cc][qc]C[Black's opening is very weak and unconventional. For your level i suggest trying out assaults on the black corners, since both are positioned at 4-4. I recommend attacking at 3-3 to boost your knowledge about these potentially critical areas.

I have provided two interesting variations for 3-3.

when you get stronger you can look up on different corner assaults. For now, i believe exploring the 3-3 will help you develop a greater understanding of the concepts of Go.]

(;W[gp]C[Tip#1: Don't chase groups you cant kill. 

chasing after live groups will only frustrate you even more. In such situations you should play elsewhere. As it stands the game is still young. Both black corners are open. You should take theinitiative. Otherwise, i recommend playing at C4 to enclose your corner.]
;B[en]C[It looks to me like I have the T1 corner, but I could be wrong.

The southeast corner is still debatable. If black plays R3 (3-3 assault) he could actually take the corner from you and put your whites stones in jeopardy. 

See variation after the next move];W[de]
(;B[df];W[dg];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[jo]TR[jp]C[Here I made an attempt to connect my corners. Was this move too futile?

Tip#2: Keep the aim of the game in your mind ALWAYS. The aim is to amass territory, NOT to kill or connect. 

K4 would have been a better move as a connection AND as an enclosing move for the south side. Again, the game is still young. There are still big points left like K16 and R17.]
;B[bp];W[gq];B[cq]C[Black is starting to overpower me in the A1 corner.

Starting? are you kidding? He's dominating!

In such a situation, unless you KNOW you can plan a payback strategy, it's best to give up this local area for more important ones. Again, the North side (around K16) and black's remaining corner (R17) are still up for grabs.]
;W[er]CR[eo]TR[eq][fq]SQ[fr]C[Tip#3: avoid make empty triangles. They are inefficient in shape and are easy to take advantage of. The three marked stones form an "empty triangle" because the square are is empty. If it had been occupied by a black stone, it would become a "full triangle". Empty triangles are bad except in eye-making situations (see the circle area)]
;B[es];W[fs];B[ds]
(;W[fr]C[I figured I could still salvage the center.

You missed an important oppurtunity here. You could have gone D2 instead of F2.

so here's Tip#4: watch out for your liberties (and those of your opponent)]

;B[gr];W[ir];B[gs];W[hs];B[mo]
(;W[mp]C[Bad move. So here's tip#5: Watch your cutting points (and your opponent's)

playing at N4 lets black invade with O4 (as you found out). If you had played O4, not only would there be no weakness, but you've made good shape. (see variation)]
;B[oo];W[po]C[I should have concentrated on connecting the center.

I don't believe so. As it stands, i believe both of you are WAS too focused on the south side. Again, K16 and R17 (Yes, they are VERY big points...)]
;B[np];W[nq]C[Tip#5 revisited... (cutting points!)

Cutting points are very important in Go. It is often the difference between a close win and an outright resignation.

"It is not the blade that cuts; it is technique that cuts"]
;B[lp];W[mq];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr];W[nr];B[oq];W[ln];B[or];W[nl]
;B[ns]C[Ah, here I'm sort of making a connection attempt.

Tip#4 revisited: watch your liberties. liberties are what determine your life and death. 

At this stage, forget about connecting the 2 groups. They are quite strong on their own.]
;W[ok]C[Perfect. This is a perfect outpost for razing into the centre.]
;B[lm];W[ll];B[kr];W[kn];B[ls];W[jn];B[ee]C[OK, he decides to start on the A19 corner

...Which is EXACTLY why it is important to KEEP THE INITIATIVE! As in basketball, keep the ball on your own team. letting the enemy decide where you go is rarely good.]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[cf]C[I tried going for D14, but I realize I should have gone for the C16 cluster

Tip#4 revisited: As it stands the C16 unit has 4 liberties and your C15 unit has 3. In any race to capture, the one with the most libs wins. 

After black replies, white should take the West side with something like C10. (yes, i know it looks kinda wild, but this is how the pros do it :)]

;W[og]C[KuroSama [?\]: couple days];B[ng]C[bloodhamme [?\]: cool]
;W[nh]C[I concentrate on connecting the T19/T1 corners, but I lost track of that.

Tip#(i forget): keep the aim of the game in your head. 

the aim is to amass territory, NOT TO KILL OR CONNECT OR GET THE MOST STONES ON THE BOARD! (yep, it's so important i have to scream it :)]

KuroSama [?\]: good game


I don't see exactly where I went wrong in the corners. Thank you very much for your help in advance.

Well, here's a list to get you started:
Reasons why you lost:
1/You left too many weaknesses in the form of cutting points
2/You did not watch your liberties
3/ you were too focussed on one part of the board instead of the whole board.
4/ you were not concentrating on the aim of the game (amass territory!)

i recommend doing as many problems as you can at www.goproblems.com, starting at the 30k level, because i see that you are lacking some knowledge in life and death, as well as basic strategy and shape.

It was a very interesting game for me to review. Thank you for this oppurtiunity, and i apologise if i came across as a little rude :)
