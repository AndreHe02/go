C[I am white [David\].];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[nc]
C[W];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[cf];W[df]C[I know - contacting weak stone, but the player who helps me most often [an AGA 7-dan\] recommends this joseki any time opponent doesn't already have appropriate side extension in place.
JH :I will not criticize this move. But in order to improve you should not always play the tsuke-nobi or tsuke-osae Joseki.]
;B[dg];W[ce]C[I like this 4-4 family of joseki, so if it is not contraindicated then I play it.]
;B[ef];W[de];B[eg];W[cg]LB[fd:a]C[JH : Possible to play "a" also]
;B[ch];W[bf];B[cn];W[dn]C[B12 better?  This seems good for me (white).
Even if B12 is big, it is still a move on the second line for White : so, it is not that urgent]
;B[dm];W[co];B[en];W[do];B[cm];W[em]C[Maybe this should be B12?]
;B[fm]LB[fn:a]C[JH : Never see this atari ! Atari is often a bad move when you have 2 atari to play. In thi case, the nobi at "a" is better]
;W[el];B[fn];W[bh]C[C9 better?
JH : I agree C9 is the move. With 32 you help Black to get stronger]
;B[ci];W[ej];B[dk];W[ek];B[di]C[Black style is poor in this region.]
;W[gk];B[fp];W[fq];B[gq];W[eq];B[gp];W[po];B[qp];W[op]LB[kp:a]
C[JH : 45 is in bad direction as the wall on tthe left can become weak stones if white approaches around "a"]
;B[qo];W[oq]LB[kp:a]C[Is Q7 a better idea?
JH : Qè is not very attractive: Why noit amove around "a"];B[mq]
LB[pn:a]C[49 is too much : Why not simply play hane at "a"]
;W[pm];B[mo]LB[kp:a]C[Black is over ambitious ; may be Black "a" is enough.]
;W[qn];B[pr];W[or];B[ro];W[rn];B[rq]C[This result is clearly bad for Black. May be 49 was not good]
;W[rl]LB[nm:a]C[58 is your mistake : don't play on the second line and come out immediately  at "a"]
;B[rk];W[ql]C[60 too slow];B[qi]LB[jo:a]C[61 : Also slow. What about "a"]
;W[mr]C[Are you so afraids to die ?];B[lr];W[ms]C[This 64 is bad too]
;B[ls];W[nq];B[lq];W[ps];B[qs];W[os];B[rr];W[hm]LB[gd:a]C[Too deep?
JH : You should foresee the cut and see the shicho is not good. Play at 73 is better. Another possibility seems "a" as the black group is still weak.]
;B[hl];W[gl];B[gm];W[gi]C[P15 ladder break better?
JH : No good move here];B[il]C[77 : good for black];W[ij];B[hf]
;W[gc];B[jf];W[kj];B[kl];W[ge];B[gf];W[jh];B[bi];W[lm];B[km]
;W[ln];B[nm]LB[jp:a]C[91 looks over ambitious. Defense at "a"  seems possible]
;W[ll];B[lk];W[nl];B[ml]C[95 : Looks not good at first glance but it allows Black to close is side; so it was not bad]
;W[mm];B[mk];W[nn];B[kn];W[lo]C[I think white is slightly ahead at this point.]
;B[ko];W[lp];B[kp];W[mp];B[nk];W[ol]LB[qb:a][mi:b]C[106 : May be "a" or "b" s bigger]
;B[mh];W[lh];B[lg];W[li];B[mi];W[ne];B[md];W[mc]C[JH : 114  I think you should connect at 115]

LB[gd:a]C[JH 144  : May be playing at "a" is safer];B[hc];W[gb]
;B[hd];W[he];B[ie];W[jd];B[gd]C[Is it possible to kill B with F15 and E18?]

(;W[fb]C[White 152 is a loosing move. Indeed if you connect, black can take 2 stones but is dead]
;B[fe];W[ed]C[I think W can still win this game, despite the local loss.  True?]

(;W[jk]C[W174 - I wasn't paying attention and should resign here.  No further comments needed.  No komi so I count B ahead by a few points even if I had played K11.
JH : K11 is better. After it is finished. You are right Black is leading by 9 points.]
