C[rog[18k\]:
Hi reviewer.  I wanted to submit this game because I felt I played near my
best (no big silly mistakes that i can see) and it was an even and interesting
game so we both may be able to learn from how W or B might be able to approach
things differently.

We reviewed it briefly afterward and the relevant comments and variations are included.

Thanks in advance.

[lefrog\]
Hello reviewees, I think this was indeed a very good game, and I will try
to give you a few comments on it. Please, let me know if you feel that you
need more explanations about it.]
(;B[qd];W[dd]C[rog [18k\]: hi bishop
bishop [17k\]: hi

rog: i have been opening w/ low chinese but...


[lefrog\]
I think low Chinese would begin with a hoshi, no ? From the hoshi you can
then extend to one or the other komoku to set up for Chinese. (see var)]
;B[pq];W[dq];B[od]C[rog: this felt so slow

[lefrog\]
I think this is ok. It is said that having a corner enclosure is as big as
preventing your oponent from having one, and in this position, it certainly
looks nice.];W[po]
(;B[np]C[[lefrog\] Maybe here a pincer would be nice, as extending from the black shimari at the top.]

bishop [18k\]: here, joseki is R2 for B
bishop [18k\]: or at least, common joseki that i know.]
(;B[pp]C[[lefrog\]
This is not good of black. I've had it explained by a 1d [thanks to phenomene\],
because it felt not good, but I couldn't explain it properly. The continuation
gives white the 'hane at the head of 2 stones'];W[qp];B[oo]
C[here, it
looks as if white has done the hane at the head of 2 stones, very nice here,
as black will push white on the 4th line ('the line of victory'). black is
pushing from behind];W[pn]TR[po]C[ [lefrog\] See the variation for more
about thisshape and the problem it causes. "Hane at the head of 2 stones"
(delta) causes the 2 black stones a certain shortness of liberties. This
can be seen more acutely if white ever gets the move at Q2 ( later)]

(;B[on]
(;W[om]C[bishop [18k\]: i know this is overplay. sigh.
rog [18k\]: lol
bishop [18k\]: though i probably should've extended to O7 at some point.
bishop [18k\]: to keep things interesting. not sure when.


[lefrog\]
This was an overplay, all right. I think white should simply let black push
him (from behind !) on the 4th line, it is pure benefit.];B[pm]

(;W[pl]C[[lefrog\] here I think white did the wrong atari.]
;B[qm]
(;W[qo];B[ql];W[jp]
(;B[kq];W[jq]C[[lefrog\]
somehow, this black move reinforces white while not really securing black
(still open to n3, for example, which was played, and helped by the not so
efficient shape of the black stones. Interestingly enough, the white group
in the corner is not so strong. So the variations are possible. The l3 k3
exchange favors white.]
(;B[pk]C[[lefrog\] This is not necessary, and the right side is big. See variations for white R9]
;W[ck]C[[lefrog\] nice move.];B[id];W[do];B[fc]
(;W[ec]C[[lefrog\] here maybe it's time for white to do something else, in order to preserve his moyo (see variation)]
;B[cg]C[[lefrog\]this was weird. See variation]
(;W[cf];B[df];W[ce];B[fd]LB[dg:A]C[[lefrog\]
as black, I would not be too happy with this sequence. The cut at A looks
promising. And even before that... (see other variation at move 29)]
;W[mc];B[kc]C[[lefrog\]
this black move very good. pincers white and secures black. Has the 3 characteristics
of a good move : attacks the oponent, defends and takes territory.]
;W[me];B[nd];W[md]C[bishop
[18k\]: this felt heavy to me, but not sure best way to handle it. but anyway,
had P18 and escape to center.

[lefrog\] this was a very nice move for black]
(;B[pf]C[[lefrog\]
I find this move not really interesting. It doesn't pressure white, while
white does have a weak group and is running away. It is time to chase it.]
;W[mg];B[oh]
(;W[kf]C[[lefrog\] I wouldo frankly for it, like in variation.]
;B[ed]C[[lefrog\] If white answers it, it is good. Otherwise, it misses the right spot (attacking white group)]
;W[dc];B[de]C[[lefrog\]
This is another case of playing a move that makes the stones short of liberties.
It doesn't even threaten the cut at C16 which would not work. White could
play like this : (see variation)]
(;W[bd];B[eg]C[[lefrog\] very good move. Black must not miss this.]
;W[jj]C[bishop [18k\]: here, i didn't know what i was doing but didn't want to make it too easy for you.
bishop [18k\]: was hoping to make use of P7 at some point.
rog [18k\] This really made me think - took a while wondering how best to respond to this move

[lefrog\]
The way I see this move is making an immense white moyo. on the lower left
quarter of the board. I can't really judge it. It looks good to me. I don't
see what P7 has to do with the game. Having it captured or not won't drastically
change things. The drawback I see is that it doesn't attack black, but I
cannot really judge this move.]
(;B[fj]C[
[lefrog\] looks ok];W[fh]LB[ek:A]C[[lefrog\]
This move pushes black into white's moyo. I think some other move might be
better suited, like A];B[di];W[ej];B[fi]C[rog [18k\]: P7 is getting more urgent

[lefrog\] I still don't see P7 as important.];W[eh]C[rog [18k\]: Here i misread the ladder - didn't see the atari.]
;B[ei];W[dh];B[ch];W[dg]C[bishop
[18k\]: i really feel like you should be able to kill white here. but maybe
my first instincts were right :-)
rog [18k\]: i had planned on capturing
W but didn't see that if Black G12, W F13, B G13, W E15, (see variation)
so i had to settle for bad shape.


[lefrog\] See variation, white should be captured]
(;B[fg];W[gh];B[hj];W[gg];B[ff];W[gf]C[bishop [18k\]: forcing bad shape for black.

bishop [18k\]: anyway. i really wanted to cut black here. but then later screwed up on the left.
bishop [18k\]: okay.
bishop [18k\]: thanks for the game and review.];B[ge];W[ee]
C[
bishop [18k\]: i think this move (E15) is too small for white probably. since you tenuki.

[lefrog\] this is a very nice move. But black can't prevent white from connecting now.]

serve both purposes. Not sure if it's best.

cut in this area earlier (see variation).  The score estimate of the variation
look worse for B though.  Perhaps there's another possibility?

I would rather play here as this doesn't let white have an easy infiltration
move inside black's zone. ALl the same, it doesn't reinforce white while
it does help black. Now white might add a move unless he wants his stone
to be pincered, at A or B, which I think are playable as white must then
run away, and black might get strong enough to weaken the corner. An example
is in variation, but I really can't play against myself :)]
