C[I am white.  I won even without receiving komi, but it is still relatively close for my level.  In this game my main questions are on the best ways to profit from attack.  [Calvin\]]

C[Here I am trying to make black overconcenrated.];B[fp]LB[cq:A]
C[White now has protected the corner in sente.

The corner is actually far from safe.  As you can see there is plenty of room for black to cause trouble by invading at A.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[ph]LB[qj:A][qk:B]C[This shape is ideal for white, I think.  

It is solid, i would prefer A at B to cramp the shimari in the lower right more, but your shape is easily defended]
;B[qm];W[jc]LB[nb:B][kc:A][lc:1][rc:2][dj:E][oo:D][mp:3][np:C]
TR[nd]C[Here I wonder if I should have gone as far as A, aiming at the slide at B.  Looking at the game now, maybe a reducing move at C or D would be appropriate.  E is a big point, too, but I don't like to play that kind of single-purpose move.

I dislike both the point you chose and A, if you want to pressure black then 1 is the point.  combined with a push at 2 the black group is on shaky ground and will be forced out into the centre.  

Since 1 is the key point then the point to the left of your choice would make a good extension from your corner as it would allow the two point extension to 1.  Also a black reply at A would seem a little cramped given the high nature of the triangled stone.

An immediate play at 1 could easily provoke black 2, while black would probably ignore white 2 if played right now so I think that the extension is a good plan.  Black could also counterattack a stone at A or 1.

E is a big point but not urgent, as you surmised.  C might be a good reducing point, giving white a good chance to slice into the bottom, a play at D would allow for a lovely black reply at 3.]

(;B[kc]C[This attachment is bad style for black.

Yes, very bad move for black here.];W[kd];B[lc];W[jd]LB[fc:A]
C[Black cannot approach at A any more.];B[ci];W[cg];B[cl];W[dc]
C[I think this result is good for white.

It is good because the black group on the left is open to pressure.]
;B[lp]LB[cq:A]C[I think that now might have been the time to use the invasion at A.]
;W[jg]LB[bh:C][eh:D][ei:A][bl:B]SQ[ci][cl]C[It is also possible to attack black's group on the left in various ways, but this seems like a big point.   Looking at at now, maybe a cap at 'A' (E11) would work well.

Attacking the side group is much more urgent, A doesn't work terribly well, but i've outlined a number of points that you could consider, B and C reduce eyespace and solidify and expand your territory.  D is a good move that expands the moyo up top.  The knights move at D is especially effective since white has severe followups if black ignores it.]
;B[eh];W[df]LB[dh:A][di:B][ei:C]C[This is a bit timid and defensive, maybe.

Yes, the sequence White A, Black B, White C, cutting off one stone would be better and keep your moyo intact (although it would allow black the chance to solidify his shape and achieve safety)]
;B[gg];W[bk];B[bl];W[bi];B[bh];W[ch];B[bj];W[di];B[cj];W[dh]
SQ[gg][eh]C[Black settles, but the marked stones have been hurt.  This is my plan, though the execution is sloppy.]
;B[eg]C[This is a small move for black, I think.];W[dj];B[dk]
;W[fj];B[hi];W[ge]C[Now this territory can be defended in sente.]
;B[ij];W[ki]LB[kq:B][lq:A]C[I am not sure how to continue this attack.  This seemed reasonable enough.

I think it is better to chase him on the other side to build up strength facing the bottom so perhaps an invasion can be mounted around A or B.  It is hard to make territory in the center]
;B[il];W[hk]LB[jk:A]C[I think maybe the peep on the other side might build more, but black would connect sooner and the attack wouldn't last as long.  That is my thinking.]
;B[ik];W[gm];B[kk];W[mj];B[of]C[Black sees that I'm about to build territory here, I guess.  But this seems a little dangerous for black and small now because of his weak group.  I ignore this, trying not to defend territory in gote.]
;W[in]C[Still trying to surround black for lack of a better plan.]
;B[km]C[A good move.  This is not only an eye, but black is almost connected.  I don't think black can be killed at this point.  The attack on these stones hasn't gained white so much.]
;W[kn]LB[kp:A]C[I violate the proverb and attach to a "weak" group.   This is a dame point, as well.  I'll bet this is a very bad move.  

Not necessarily, the group is not so weak anymore and this gives a good followup at A]

;B[el];W[fl];B[bg];W[bf];B[ai]LB[em:A]C[An atari at A would be good kikashi.]
;W[pm];B[qn];W[on]C[I figure maybe I can get some ko threats against black's central group.  This is probably a lame plan.

This is good because when you are connected globally like this you are far less weak than when you have been split into several groups.  Connection is a basic fundamental, applying it is never bad reasoning (you won't really get ko threats out of it though, the group is pretty strong).]
;B[ig];W[if];B[ih];W[jb]C[I begin yose.  

The lower left corner is bigger as black can still (especially now) cause trouble by invading at the 3-3 point.]
;B[kb]LB[cq:A]C[should be at A];W[rc];B[rb];W[fr]C[now your corner is secure.]

;B[nh];W[rm];B[rn];W[rl];B[pp]C[I don't think there is anything here, but black must be paranoid.

yes.];W[ka];B[la]C[this was small and gote.];W[ja];B[le];W[kf]

(;AW[lp][np]AB[nq]LB[lp:3][np:1][nq:2][fr:A][gr:B]C[This sequence is troubling for black, it will be hard to keep white from breaking up the potential territory on the bottom.  It might be good to play at A first to secure the corner and further weaken the black group on the lower left before the invasion (if black replies at B then white can leave it as a forcing exchange and be happy that the corner is now secure)]
))
(;B[cq];W[er];B[bo];W[co];B[bn]LB[cm:B][bp:A]C[White can take the corner now by playing at A, but then black gets out on the left side at B.]
;W[cm];B[cp]C[The main problem here is that black has weakened his outside group and is easily confined to a small  corner.  It is not so hard to see an invasion on the lower side now.  Obviously the invasion is premature, but the corner is far from defended too.]
