;W[fr];B[de]LB[cd:D][po:B][gr:A][hr:C]C[It's common to complete the joseki by playing A.  White will not connect and tenuki.  But with a move at A, black's bottom is quite thick.  A move at B later will form a good moyo at the bottom.  Although white will not do it now, he can play C later to destory black's potential territory.

The kikari at D is the normal way to approach a corner.  The game move is a special kikari where you don't want white to develop the upper side.  The disadvantage of this move is that white gets a bit more than black in the joseki.  Since there isn't any reason to stop white from building up on the upper side, the kikari at D is better.]
;W[cd];B[ce];W[dd]C[white should have gone to b16 right?];B[ci]
LB[fc:D][fd:E][ee:A][ef:B][ff:C]C[A is the keypoint.  If white plays this point, he can build power.  For example, he can double hane at C to push black low.  Once black plays A, he has a good follow up at D.  So white has to defend at E.  Then black can make the game extension.]
;W[qi];B[qk];W[qf];B[re];W[qe];B[qd];W[rf];B[ok]LB[rd:A]C[Connect at A.  Not only it's worth quite a few points, it also deprives white an eye.  As long as white's right group is weak, he can't invade the lower side.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[se];B[mc]LB[qb:C][rb:A][oc:E][qc:D][sc:B]TR[rc]
[pd][qd]C[Now white makes his group alive in sente.   He still has the clamp at A as a big yose move.  If white resists at B, he can play C to E sequence.  Whether white can live or not depends on the surronding of the marked black stones (if white has some stones nearby later in the game, he can cut and fight).]
;W[po]
(;B[pp]TR[ok][qk]C[any better way to try and kill? although i think white has a bit too much room here, so what would be the best way of taking profit

Don't think about killing.  There's too much room for white to make a live group or run out to the center.  Since you already have two marked stones, the joseki shown in the variation is more common to attack the white stone.]
;W[oo];B[mp]LB[np:B][op:C][kq:F][mq:E][nq:A][oq:D]C[This is a bit loose.  White has the A to E follow up.  White won't exploit the aji right away, but if he has a stone at F later, he can make a group at the bottom.  Put it another way, an invasion move by white at F is sente because of this weakness.  So playing the game move at B is more appropriate.]
;W[np]C[This is bad unfortunately.  White makes black stronger and takes away the aji.]

;W[lj];B[kj]LB[qm:A]TR[ce][de][ci]C[only thing what i can think of that i should have gone to n12, that would have strengthened my weak group, right? or is there a better place

The game move is fine.  It forms thickness that goes well with the marked black stones.  Other than the cut mentioned earlier, the black group on the right isn't that weak.  For example, a move at A threatens to connect and make eye shape at the same time.]

Yes, c5 is the appropriate move.  But before c5, atari at e7 first.  Then the outcome of the game depends on whether white's d7 group can escape or make two eyes.  White has a huge lead after killing black's left group.  He can easily win the game by shallow invasions.  Instead, he cuts at d7 which is unreasonable.  Now black at least has a chance to win the game.]

It is very complicated.  With the white A to D sequence, white's lower group and black's dead group get into a capturing race.  I think black will win the race.  It really requires very deep reading to determnine if A is necessary for black.]
