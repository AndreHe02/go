C[Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game, and lost by a small margin.
I ask you to help me understand what went wrong - I thought I was playing "by the book"...
I recognize a small mistake in the yose, but this was too small to justify my loss.
Thanks!

Nathan:  I pointed out several mistakes in the game which I felt gradually lost you points, thus the game.]

LB[qq:A]C[At the end of this sequence, Black captured the lower right, but had to give up the area above it. I could not find a better option. Was there any?

N: I don't like this result for B - it feels quite overconcentrated and there is some bad aji left at A.  Move 29 at S6 would have been better.  The idea is if W tries to run out with his stones, you chase it and make territory along the bottom.]

A or B are other options.];W[eb];B[fb];W[ec];B[gd]LB[fd:A]C[N: simply connecting at A is best]

C[N: W has gained more than B has and W has sente.];W[kf]LB[kh:A]
C[This move also was a problem to me. I could simply block at around K15, but it seemed to me too submissive. At the end, I had to do it anyway... What is the correct continuation?

N: I think this is an overplay by W and A is the most severe response.]

(;B[in]LB[cg:C][ln:A][cq:B]C[N: I'm not sure what this move is trying to accomplish - W can play A to severely limit any centre territory.

Jumping into the corner at B is bigger.  You may also want to try peeping at C to probe W's response.]
