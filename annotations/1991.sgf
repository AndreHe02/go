C[Hello!  My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.

I believe your biggest mistakes in this game were moves that did not keep your stones connected.  The best way to work on this problem is to look for cutting points, as well as trying to read out positions when you play.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo];W[pf]
(;B[qh]TR[qo][pq]C[Is this pincer a good idea? or should I help top-right instead?

Ted: In this position, I would probably play at O16 instead.  After O16, you can let White play another stone on the right side, and then respond with K3 or K4.  Extending from the marked stones to the left is better than extending upwards.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[de]C[Ted: I think you still need to play another stone at the top, in the area of O17.]
;W[gd];B[dj]C[Ted: This extension is too far from the D15 stone.  I fear that you're begging White to try to split the two stones.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[jd]C[Ted: I have a feeling this extension is also too far from the two stones at Q16/R17.]
;W[ef];B[df];W[ee];B[eg];W[fg];B[cn];W[bf];B[bg];W[cg];B[dg]
C[Ted: Atari from the other side.  White can't escape if you play the atari at C12 instead.]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[bh];B[bi];W[ag];B[dh];W[fh];B[eq];W[ep];B[cq]
;W[dp];B[jq]C[Ted: I really think you need to play another stone in the bottom left before you can play at K3.]
;W[fq];B[fr]C[I think this is bad, should I have played d3 instead?

Ted: Absolutely.];W[dq];B[bp];W[er];B[co];W[cr]C[Ted: Consider yourself lucky.  White should have played B3 here.]
;B[bq];W[br];B[ds]LB[mc:A][ql:C][mq:B]C[I think this was lost move, don't really know for sure.. Perhaps g2 was better?

Ted: D1 is definitely not a good move, since you can't kill anything.  I think G2 is only nominally better, since saving that one stone isn't very big.  In fact, I think I'd look at playing in an entirely different part of the board right now.]
;W[gr];B[ar];W[cs];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[hr];B[ir];W[hp];B[iq]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[in];B[jn];W[np];B[nq];W[op];B[oq];W[pp];B[qp]
;W[mp];B[fn]C[I played f6, and I think the idea was good, though I'm not sure if this was the best.. perhaps f5 would have been better?

Ted: If your idea was to attack the stones on the bottom, it's not really worth it.  I think, however, that F6 isn't that bad a move, for an entirely different reason.  It serves to jump out toward the center from C6, which gains some territory for you.  At the same time, it stops White from doing exactly the same thing.

Other options still include playing around N17, or putting pressure on the White stones in the bottom right.  The point isn't to go all out to kill the group, but to make White defend it, during which time you should be able to make more territory on the side.]
;W[fo];B[en];W[gn];B[gm];W[hm]C[I have no idea what I should have done in this situation.. please advice]
;B[im]C[Ted: I think the simple G8 would have been better.]
;W[gl];B[fm];W[il];B[jm];W[jl];B[kl];W[mm];B[om]TR[qo]C[Ted: I like the idea of putting some pressure on the White stones, but beware that here, White can play Q6 to try to cut the Black stones.  P6 might be better for attacking the White stones.]
;W[lm];B[oj];W[km];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk];W[nk];B[nj]C[Ted:  Oh dear.  You're just asking for White to cut you here!]
;W[lk]C[Ted: White is more than happy to oblige by cutting you.]

C[Can I save the group at topright? or is it lost? I don't think I handled it good..

Ted: I think P18 is the best try to make two eyes.  For White to play at P18 would be what is called the "Eye-Stealing Tesuji", and is a move to be aware of.]

(;B[nc];W[oc];B[pc];W[ob];B[ne];W[md];B[mc];W[pb];B[mg];W[mf]
;B[me];W[ld];B[le]C[did I take the wrong side here? Should I have tried top take top? (play m17 instead of m15)

Ted: You're behind now, so I really think you should play M17, with the intention of trying to create a stable group at the top.  However, White can attack on the first two lines thanks to the P18 group.]
;W[lc];B[nf];W[of];B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[li];B[mi];W[ki];B[jg]
C[k13, perhaps not far enough? is j13 or h13 better?

Ted: I think I'd look at playing L15 here, to keep connected to the K16 stone. Note that if White plays L15, the four Black stones are in atari, after which White can then play L16, keeping everything connected.]
;W[kd];B[ke];W[jc];B[ic]C[this was bad, I think j16 is better.

Ted: Correct.  Again, you're not keeping your stones connceted]
;W[id];B[lb];W[qa];B[hg]C[I jumped, think it was worth sacrificing k16]
;W[je];B[jf];W[if];B[hf]C[h14.. I think now j13 is better.. not sure..

Ted: I think you're right, although I have to admit that over the board with the clock running, I probably would have made the mistake of H14 myself]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[ie];B[gj]C[attempt to connect];W[hh];B[gh];W[hi]
;B[ii];W[hj]C[Could you please advice me here, I had no idea what to play...

Ted: Sadly, I don't think you have any good options left.  White is already ahead, and is threatening to cut into your territory with a move like F8.]
;B[gk]C[Ted: This is probably the best idea, since it prevents White from playing F8.  But it's still defensive.]
;W[hk];B[fl];W[hl];B[gi];W[fi];B[ej]C[was this good defence?

Ted: Yes.  It's your nest move that's a problem.];W[gg];B[gf]
;W[ff];B[dd];W[ed];B[ec];W[cc];B[gc]C[I tried a little invasion at top, was there a way to live?]
;W[fc];B[hd];W[he];B[hb]C[I was thinking about KO.. but don't think in this situation it was good, playing h17 seemed like the end of my "invasion"]
;W[hc];B[jh];W[kh];B[ij];W[kg];B[kf];W[on];B[pn];W[po];B[qm]
;W[ai];B[jj];W[jk]C[Ted: White should have played at B10 here.]
;B[aj];W[fj];B[ah]C[lost 4 stones in next moves, but it got me 4 stones and terrytory instead .. so in the end I think I would make profit, right?]
;W[fk];B[bg];W[be];B[af]C[I guess I should have played at e9 instead

Ted: Correct.];W[ek];B[dk];W[el];B[dl];W[em];B[dm]C[profit gone, and loss.. now =/]

;W[ae];B[nn];W[no];B[oo];W[mn]C[didn't expect such a gift =) only wanted to take some terrytory from white]
;B[mo];W[ei];B[sg];W[se];B[eo]C[gote .. bad move I guess ?

Ted: I think most of the remaning options are gote, but play one that at least gains a point, like J1 or A14.  E5 is a dame point.]
;W[is];B[ho]C[played here.. it's not a loss, and it's sente.. i'm always trying this, and hoping for mistakes, perhaps a bit too ambitious]
;W[hn];B[hs];W[ag];B[kj];W[lj];B[is];W[af];B[fb]C[new attempt to make life at top.. but I'm still wondering if there was a way.. I don't think so now.. but not sure

Ted: There's no way to make life at the top now unless your opponent makes a big mistake.]

;W[dr];B[ao]C[think it was necessary, not sure

Ted: The simple connections at B5 and A3 are probably better; I believe you're going to have to make both of them in any case.]

Ted: Correct!];W[an];B[bo];W[bm];B[bl];W[al];B[ak];W[ik];B[lf]
C[I think this was very urgent move at this time..

Ted: You don't have to play it until White fills in the remaining liberty at K11.]

(;W[mb];B[lb]C[Ted: Note this move, often called a "clamp".  The reason why a clamp is often good is that in many cases, White can't respond by playing on the first line; after White connects on the third line, Black is able to connect by playing under.]
