C[Piotr: Thank you for doing the review of this game. I played black, and I were especially grateful for your comments on: 1. opening (did josekis I took were right to fit the whole board situation?), 2. when did I start loosing the game (in the end I was some 35-40 points behind, although I thought I was controlling the game at least for quite some time), and 3. a general comment what I should wark on to improve.
Once again, many best best best thanx!!!

Joona:
Hi. I am a Finnish 5 kyu.
It seems that in this game, you left some groups in weak positions while trying to get a big territory elsewhere. Among <10 kyu players, this is a common mistake. I suggest that you try a more solid style and see if your playing gets any better.

For the questions,
1. There were no actual josekis played in the game. The fourth move of the game you asked about was ok. The mistake in the opening was to have a weak group early in the game. You should not allow this.
2. It's very hard to say but I would have taken white as soon as at move 40. 
3. You have to study life&death situations. You missed two kills in this game. Maybe it is still ok at 13 kyu level, but stronger opponents won't let you get away with that. Also tesuji problems will be useful.

One major thing may be to learn attacking and to appreciate strong positions. You said that you don't like to have walls. If you have the chance, play against a stronger player with an active playing style. You will see how your groups maybe won't die, but will be attacked severely while your opponent takes profit. Such situations are where strong and active positions play a role. You have to get rid of the idea, if you have that, that stones are merely something that surround territory. 

Note that this review is sometimes pretty detailed, spend a little time with it :).]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[ed]C[Piotr: I wanted to play the Chinese opening that I have 'discovered' recently but my opponent did not allow me. His first success :)]
;B[ec]C[Piotr: Did I chose a right joseki or should I pincer?

Joona:
It's the most common move in this situation.];W[dd]C[Joona:
I don't agree with this move, though it has been played professionally. My thinking is that black may get to the last corner first and then using the white wall from this nadare joseki will be a challenge. You can do this if you're confident of your skills in using thickness.]
;B[dc];W[ce]
(;B[bd]C[Joona:
This move, in fact, isn't a joseki. However, as a kyu player, I have little to criticize it.]
;W[be];B[dp]C[Piotr: I think at the moment the stones in the upper left survive by themselves, so I wanted to take the last corner to neutralize the White's coming wall. Should I play closer to it (around D10)?

Joona:
Well, there's nothing wrong with your thinking, but in my opinion, you cannot afford to tenuki here. Your position is too vulnerable!]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[fc];B[ca];W[fb]
(;B[ea]C[Piotr: I'm quite confused with what White did in the corner. Is this a joseki? I think he left many weak points behind (the other thing is if I exploited them correctly...) Could you comment on that?

Joona:
White did exactly the right thing. I didn't see really weak points but you answered correctly. Now you have to think, was D4 tenuki really worth it?

Generally, I see <10 kyu players overestimate the value of tenuki moves and so leave weak points and get bad positions. The judgement of when a position is good enough for a tenuki can be very difficult but it's something you have to improve, like all kyu players, I believe.

Notice that this was a reading problem. You should be able to foresee this before playing elsewhere. If you can't, reading problems may be the key to improvement.]
;W[md]C[Joona:
Leaving cutting points in white's wall is not recommendable, but it is a bit frightening for black to ignore this move.]
;B[jq]LB[pf:A]C[Joona:
I would play at A. Letting white double pincer is a confident strategy, because your corner stone will be in trouble. Also I would say that the latest move was passive. It doesn't really threaten white]
;W[pf]LB[oe:B][of:A][qf:C]C[Joona:
Being pincered by two fourth line stones is very severe! Black doesn't have very good moves because all attempts strenghten white. You may try from A to C.]
;B[cj]C[Joona:
This one is better. Now black can aim at cutting the white's wall.]
;W[ch]TR[fd]C[Joona:
As a territory move, it's not good. Try to count the territory it makes!
Still, it helps against the cut. Maybe it was best to complete white's wall in the first place. That is, not leaving cutting points.]

(;B[cm]C[Joona:
This is a passive strategy again. Also, Black's corner is still open for 3-3 invasion.]
;W[mq];B[pj]C[Joona:
I'm not sure what you want to do with this move. You probably cannot hope for much territory on this side.]
;W[qc]C[Piotr: I think fuseki is more or less over after this move. Was my opening strategy OK? Did I miss any big moves?]
;B[qd]C[Piotr: Right direction?

Joona:
Probably yes,  you will have a chance to connect to Q10.];W[pc]

;W[pg]
(;B[qf];W[ri]C[Piotr: Well, fighting is not my best side... Retrospectively, I think I should have tried to keep all stones connected and run into the center with them instead of struggling to get connection to the living corner or making eyes.]

(;B[mo]TR[po]C[Piotr: Too passive? I guess so. My nightmare are 'powers' and walls I get in exchange for solid territory as I simply don't know how to use them...
:(

How could I use better the K3 wall?

Joona:
Using thickness is indeed a difficult subject. To learn that, fighting shape knowledge and reading skills come to use. To learn more about the subject, I can recommend books Attack&Defense and Get Strong at Attacking.

However, here the game is already in yose. There isn't much hope to get an attack going. The influence you got could have helped in the cut at triangled point.]

(;B[fl];W[dm];B[cn];W[fm];B[gl]C[Piotr: With the following sequence (up to 168) I simply exchanged E3 group for D7 group. Could I play it better?

Joona:
It gets very complicated. It seems there is a ko of if the group in the lower left corner is dead. If black loses the ko, the result is a bit better for black, depending on the ko threat white ignored to live.]

The abstract point is that you want to stay active. What it would mean in the game, can be helping the cut of F16 or an invasion at the upper side. Maybe it will be useful when Q16 gets to a fight. If nothing else, it enlarges your territory if white doesn't get in to the corner.]
