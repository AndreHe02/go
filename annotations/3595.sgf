AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[markm: This is a recent game I played against Andrew Schepler on Dragon Go Server.  I'm rated there as a 25k, and he's rated around 17-18k

[Agi\] Greetings, I'm Agilis, 11k on KGS. I'll be doing the review primarily for black, but will try cover important points in general. I'll be labeling my remarks with a tag to seperate my comments from pre-existing ones.]
PL[W];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp]TR[gp][fq]SQ[jq]C[[Agi\] K4 for white feels just a bit weird. In handicap, yes white has to move to develop quicker in order to catch up, and that involves playing more loosely. 
Personally I prefer the triangled points a bit more, the square point also, but none are too significantly different from K4 that I can really say this is a mistake.]
;B[hq]C[[Agi[ I like this, it abuses the high nature of K4, threatening to come in and take away the "base" (however tenuous that is) of the white stones.]
;W[cg];B[lq]C[markm: too bold?

[Agi\] I wouldn't say this was too bold. i'd say you were carrying out your threat of H3, this is an extremely severe attack.]

(;W[jr]C[[Agi\] I disagree with K2. It forces black to split white, which was his goal in the first place. Suggestions for possible alternatives in variation.]
;B[lo];W[qq];B[pq]C[markm: q3 looked right to me because I thought it would split the two groups.

[Agi\] Because of the position of Q6, white can live with the help from O3. The typical joseki is in the variation.]

(;W[qp];B[qo];W[pr]
(;B[no]C[markm: is that too small?  Should I have played at, e.g., C11 instead?

[Agi\] If you're gonna let white out of the corner like this (which you shouldn't) you should at least take as large a point as you can find. C10, K16/K17, R14, etc.]
;W[oq];B[op]C[[Agi\] P4 is actually sente, though both sides don't realize it.]
;W[ck]
(;B[cm];W[hr];B[gr];W[iq]
(;B[gq]C[markm: would g4 have been stronger here?

[Agi\] Perhaps, but it leaves some aji lying around that might bite you later. see variation.]
;W[qf]C[[Agi\] it seems almost obligatory to pincer here. Any one would do, but a pincer would work beautifully with what's on the bottom.]

(;B[nd];W[qj];B[ql];W[fd];B[cf]C[[Agi\] Touching C13 does nothing for you in particular. Especially since basic instinct is to hane, or at least extend, when touched.]

(;W[eg]C[[Agi\] Luckily, white chooses to do something else entirely that invites danger. for example....]

(;B[fc]C[[Agi\] Again, same as last time.];W[hc]C[[Agi\] and yet again, another strange move]

(;B[qh]C[markm: the other move I was considering was k17

[Agi\] K17 is fairly interesting. perhaps L17 is a smidge safer, but there's nothing particularly wrong about R12.]
;W[ph]
(;B[qg]C[markm: and now I'm fighting for life

[Agi\] This however, is a mistake. See variation.];W[pg];B[rf]
;W[qe];B[re]
(;W[qi]C[[Agi\] A mistake on white's part, see variation.];B[qd]
;W[of];B[mf]C[markm: trying to limit the influence of his upper right group

[Agi\] That's a fine idea, but it does invite white to play m17 or the like. Consider taking (large) territory first, since black already has plenty of influence in the center.]
;W[lc];B[jc]C[markm: I seem to have a knack for these moves...]
;W[jb];B[je]C[[Agi\] K15 just abandons K17, If you're going to threaten to seperate white, be consistent and play out the sequence.]
;W[cq]TR[fc][dd][cf]SQ[ec]C[markm: I never know when to 'protect' the corner, and usually by the time I think of it, it's too late.  Watch C17...

[Agi\] You have 3 major issues with your corners. First, your enclosures. (see trianges) That formation is not safe from a 3-3. At the very worse, white can make life in ko. in there. if one of those stones were closer (at the square) white can't make life in there without lots of help from the outside.

Second, Timing, you can always go back and solidify your corner with something like D16+D17, you just have to evaluate the board and play there when you think the corner is the biggest play available to both sides.

Third, and most important. the 4-4 point Does Not Want The Corner. You're supposed to _welcome_ the influence you get from a 3-3 invasion. It is when that influence is nullified by outside stones already that you might not welcome the invasion.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[bp];B[bo];W[br]
(;B[ci]C[markm: again I play between two stones.  I bet there's a japanese term for this...

[Agi\] White offers ko on the bottom corner, why aren't you taking it? White can't live without it. See variation]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[di]C[markm: and that's one dead

[Agi\] And 1 stone matters how much on a board of 361 points? Sacrifices and exchanges constantly come up in go.]

(;B[bg];W[ch];B[bj]C[[Agi\] this is a peculiar move, I can't fault it because it does connect, but it gives white a number of forcing moves that might be useful for white at some point.]
;W[bh];B[bk];W[bf]C[markm: 2 dead];B[be];W[af];B[ce];W[fi];B[jh]
C[markm: trying to claim more of the centre, but I wonder if playing closer to the right would have helped reduce his territory there.

[Agi\] The problem with K12 is it doesn't actually help surround any territory. At best, you're reducing the center, and aren't expecting to many too many points out of it.]
;W[mh];B[ng]C[markm: attempting to split him apart.];W[nh];B[oj]
C[markm: and now I've got my eye squarely on Q11];W[pk];B[ol]
TR[mc][ap]SQ[hn][kq][mr]C[markm:  I'm concentrating very heavily on this side of the board.  Are there bigger moves elswhere?  I thought these moves, although seemlingly small, would pay off big if I could kill his group.

[Agi\] For large moves, there are still the marked triangle points. There are also a few moves that haev a pretty large follow up. such as the squares, where the bottom white group becomes under heavy attack.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[sh];B[rd]C[markm: Did I just lose a point by this move?  I wasn't sure if he could kill my S14 group.

[Agi\] You would need to fill S16, later when S14 group loses 1 liberty. Right now it is a pass.]
;W[rk];B[pi]C[markm: and there's the split.  If I play correctly now, his middle right group is dead.]
;W[nj];B[ok]C[markm: building a strong wall to try to stop him from escaping]
;W[rl]
(;B[qm]C[markm: I thought S7 would give me a bad shape, and I was concerned about whether he could connect to his lower group.  The variation shows my line of thought.]
;W[rm];B[rn]C[markm: and I think now he can't connect to the lower right corner, but it could still live.  However, instead of moving at t6 or t7, he played outside.  See variations.]

(;W[ml];B[nm]C[markm: not sure what I was thinking here.  I gave him a second opportunity to save the group.]

(;B[me];W[nc];B[oc];W[id];B[jd];W[kn]
(;B[ln]C[markm: I'm guessing this was way too small, especially with contested territory in the middle.

Black: 71 territories + 11 prisoners = 82
Result: W+7.5

[Agi\] 
To sum up. Black at the beginning should try to make his stones work together better. White was playing almost excessively loose, and although black constantly played splitting moves, black didn't follow through enough to land damaging blows. What won the game for white was black's submissive tendancies, especially in the center.

In short, black needs more "Rawr!" more Kiai, more fighting spirit.

Both sides had a bad habit of playing a move, then seemingly abandoning that move after the oppnent responds. Especially with jumping away after the other side attaches.]
