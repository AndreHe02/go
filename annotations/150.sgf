AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][pj][jp][jd]C[bconwil: I am a 12k on NNGS.   I played white in this game and lost pretty convincingly.  I have a hard time when I am  giving a large handicap.  I would appreciate any help you could give me on methods to playing this type of game.

Damien comments: the general approach should be to be patient and wait
for black to make mistakes.  Of course, you should try to help this along by
looking for complications that, being stronger, you should be able to handle
better, but patience is the key.

Naturally a solid grasp of life and death and star-point joseki are useful  (look at double approach moves in particular), but even more I would advise
you to concentrate on making light and resilient structures so that you can't
be attacked too easily.   Black has thick positions everywhere with the handicap stones: you need to make
these heavy and inefficient.  Trying to go all out for power early on will only
encourage black to tighten up the board.

Most of my comments will be directed to white: I'll try to stay on principles
rather than be too specific.

This is my first game commentary: I'd appreciate any feedback to    dmw@pobox.com]

(;W[or]C[this is a strange move: white becomes heavy, while black's response
removes a lot of the corner potential.  This should be saved until you
either need the eye space or have decided you no longer want to invade
the corner... it's really an end-game move.
(See variation for more usual joseki)];B[pr];W[pl]TR[np][nq]
[or]LB[nn:A]C[white should still be looking at extending along the bottom:
this group could come under strong attack.  a black move at
o6 (A) would attack both groups at once.];B[om]LB[ol:A]C[black chooses to lean: this sort of move is discussed in Ishida Akira's  _Attack and Defence_, for example.  Standing at]

(;W[ok]C[Black will stand...];B[oj]TR[ok][pl]C[Now these stones are also under attack.   Moving out into the centre would be worthwhile,
but you get a heavy position]
(;W[qf]LB[nd:A]C[If you want to leave things for a bit, I'd look to the far side
of the board.    The rhythm here is off a bit.  Maybe a high approach on the other side?
Just a cap from black would work nicely...


I think this whole opening along the right side is where the
trouble for the rest of the game comes from, which is why
I'm looking at it so closely.  Please don't be too upset.]
(;B[qe]
(;W[qc]LB[pc:A][re:B]C[This is too rushed.  Black has choices at A and B.

This is what you want to avoid, really.   White only
wants black to be able to choose when all the respones
lead to more complications.  Giving black a chance to  simplify things is usually too nice or honest.]

(;B[re]C[Black splits white: this gives up a bigger corner, but is more dangerous.]
;W[pc];B[od]LB[nb:A];W[oc]C[Black's hane is automatic: sliding with a knight's move would  stabilise the group faster.]
;B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[lc]C[White at last has sente, but leaves a defect in the corner.]
;W[pf]LB[nd:A]C[This is probably too late, now that black has a wall.  Still, aiming
at the cut at o16 (A) isn't too unreasonable.];B[ng]LB[qi:A]
[nf:B]C[Black attacks on a large scale.  Sliding or jumping down the
right side is probably necessary, or else you could try to resist
with a jump towards the centre.];W[pe]C[This helps black, while still leaving your stones heavy.]
;B[qd]C[Now black can aim at killing or at least making seki
of the corner...]
(;W[ne]LB[rc:A]C[This jump is wrong.  Black can hane at A to attack the corner,
or else just push through the jump.]
(;B[of]C[Black misses an opportunity.];W[oe];B[nd];W[mf];B[mg]
C[Now you should keep moving out to be consistent.
Save destroying the right side for later.];W[qi]C[This is a good move, but not in keeping with the push
into the centre.  I think maybe you should do this first.];B[ph]
C[This is hard to deal with.];W[og];B[pg];W[qg]
(;B[oh];W[nj]C[This is  a good move.];B[nf]C[Black doesn't need this eyespace so badly.]

the centre now.];B[pk];W[qk];B[nk];W[mj]C[Right choice.];B[nl]
TR[ok]C[The triangled stone is captured now.];W[mi]C[This is the wrong direction.  The edge group is mostly stable,
but so is the black group.  Running out is better.];B[ki]C[Black attacks again.]
;W[mh]C[Much too heavy.  My guess is you have missed the black  connection at the bottom of the group.]

not to endanger your corner.];B[kc];W[je]C[Faster!];B[id];W[ie]
;B[hd]C[Pushing the cart before the horse.];W[fc]C[I would approach from the other side, but the timing is ok.]
;B[ec]LB[df:A]C[Black should play on top.  You can now play
a nice double approach move around (A)];W[cc]C[Aiee!  Just stand out or approach from further away.
This is too rushed.];B[cd]C[Black plays the other way now.  This time I think  black should split white's stones.]
;W[dc]
(;B[fd]C[black descending would be better.];W[eb]C[This is ok for white, but black should connect.
White will still have to live, and black can then
close the bottom left corner.];B[gc]C[black doesn't nees to worry so much.]
;W[ed]C[This is a great success for white.
Black should block on the outside still,
but white is always happy to have a ko lying about.];B[fb]C[White should just connect now and either take the corner
or cut into the centre.]
(;W[fe]C[black should take the ko, but white can fight happily.]
;B[ge]C[this is a strange move.  the solid connection is better,
if black doesn't want to start the ko.]
(;W[gd];B[nr]LB[qh:A]C[This is not a small threat, but white has been ignoring
these stones and has few prospects in this corner.
Maybe the push at (A) is better?]

a connection]
(;W[bf]C[This is probably not required, but it definitely settles the position.
The only problem is that it is gote, even if the black stones are  captured.  20 points in gote = 10 points in sente: there are bigger moves.]
;B[be];W[bg];B[cj]LB[dq:A]C[This seems a little late to me.  I'd look to something like
(A) to close the bottom left corner.];W[cn];B[co];W[fq]C[This is just right, I think.]

but in general you don't like black being settled.   The ko at (A) is potentially troublesome.]

sides: no territory here.  Black should look to seal the  bottom right.]

To sum up, the early mistakes let black build a very strong centre
