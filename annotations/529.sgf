C[I play white in this game and win by 2.5 points.

However, I felt unsatisfied by the way I played, and am unsure how I could have done better. 

Specifically, I felt that by move 120 white was behind by 15 points or so.  White was fortunate to be able to stick a dagger into black's territory and then to be allowed a lot of sente moves on the sides to catch up.]
;B[od]C[plasma: Hi, I'm Allan, about 4 or 5 kyu in Britain. I'll do my best to help.]
;W[pp];B[de];W[dp];B[ic]C[This is the first time I've faced this opening, and was a bit taken aback.

plasma: Yes, it's a very unusual shape.]
(;W[qd]C[Is this actually helping black's plan?

plasma: Possibly. If I was going to invade, I think I'd do it at D17 instead. That way, black's wall will not work so well with the stone at J17.

See variation.];B[pf];W[oc];B[nc];W[pc];B[nd]C[plasma: This whole formation certainly looks quite good for Black (except that the D15 stone still feels misplaced)]
;W[dj]C[plasma: Good, develop some influence of your own.];B[qn]

(;W[nq]LB[ql:a]C[plasma: Given Black's influence oriented game, I think I'd consider the pincer at 'a' which probably gives up the corner in exchange for some influence for White.

See variation.];B[qf];W[qk]LB[ql:a]TR[pf][qf]C[plasma: Yes, something like this would be my instinct as well, given Black's obvious intention of taking the right side. I think, however, I might play at 'a' instead. That's just because I'd like to keep my stone away from the Black wall of 2 stones above.]
;B[on];W[ok];B[mn];W[kp];B[kn];W[pm];B[pn];W[qh]C[is N9 better for white here?

plasma: It's hard for me to say. But there's an argument for making your own groups secure before you attack, so R12 seems OK to me.]
;B[re];W[rd];B[qq];W[qp]TR[kn][mn][on][pn][qn]C[This is correct, right?

plasma: I think so. The marked Black group is not exactly safe, so I'd like to keep attacking it, not out of a hope that it will die, but rather because one can build up influence or territory while attacking.

So, in order to do this, you'll need to cut it off from the new group in the corner to stop it making eyes. So I think I'd play R4 as well.]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[or];W[oq];B[nr]
(;W[mq]LB[mk:a]C[plasma: I'm not sure this is strictly necessary, so I'd probably play at N9.

See variation.];B[mk]LB[lk:a]C[plasma: This or something near this is definitely a key point. I think I'd play a nicer shape at 'a' but the principle is correct - make eye shape and simultaneously move towards friendly stones.]
;W[ni]C[I didn't want to get stuck on the side, but really
don't have any good idea of where to play.

plasma: I don't think this is a bad move at all, and I certainly agree that you shouldn't let yourself be boxed in.]
;B[mr];W[lr]LB[li:a][dc:b]C[plasma: Again, I'm not sure this is really necessary. I'd probably either extend further out into the centre with 'a', or maybe invade at 'b'.]
;B[om];W[pk]LB[pl:a]C[plasma: I think much more natural would be to connect everything at 'a'.]
;B[rn];W[so];B[nk];W[ng]C[plasma: White's group at the bottom actually now seems ominously short of eyes, so maybe I'd extend along the bottom instead.]
;B[ph];W[qi];B[oh];W[oi];B[of]LB[nh:a]C[plasma: This seems a bit unnecessary really. Think I'd push through at 'a'.]
;W[nh];B[lf];W[ki];B[ch];W[dc];B[pi];W[pj];B[nb];W[ob];B[fd]

(;W[cd]LB[ce:a]C[Joseki is 'a'. Don't worry about the cut.

See variations.];B[ce];W[fb];B[gc];W[fc];B[ed];W[bd]C[Is B16 necessary?

plasma: I think probably yes, otherwise a Black move at C18 looks very nasty.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[cn]C[Is D6 better?

plasma: Yes. C6 is further away and so doesn't put as much pressure on Black.]
;B[ho];W[ip];B[io];W[jo]TR[dj]C[plasma: Given that White can't cut (as we'll see) I think he should so something on the left to strengthen the marked stone (which comes to be very weak).]
;B[jn];W[in]
(;B[hp]C[plasma: Black can instead capture the White stone straight out.

See variation.];W[iq];B[ko];W[lp]C[I forgot about maintaining the cut at J6.
Should white have played K4, or does the  black group have enough eyespace in the lowerleft?

plasma: Both Black groups look to me as though they won't have too much trouble. Anyway the net is still there.]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[dl]C[plasma: This works very well. White should probably have guarded against this.]
;W[cl];B[ck]
(;W[dk]C[plasma: I'd probably do the same, but with hindsight maybe the variation is better.]
;B[cj]
(;W[dm]C[I didn't think about E8 instead of D7 during the game, but it seems playable.  E8-D7-C7    If black cuts at E9, the D7-D8 stones are caught in a ladder  because of the D4 stone.

If black pulls out the D7-D8 stones then white has a larger presence in the center to reduce black territory.

What do you think?

plasma: I'm not sure an atari is called for at all.

See variations.];B[el];W[di];B[ci];W[fj];B[em]
(;W[do]C[plasma: Yes, I think you've got to defend, but given that an invasion at C3 might be nasty, I might play C3 myself.]
;B[bl];W[cm];B[hj]C[plasma: This looks very dangerous.]
(;W[fh];B[gi];W[gk];B[hk];W[gl];B[hm];W[hl];B[il];W[gm]
(;B[gn]LB[en:a]C[plasma: This is probably the crucial mistake. Black must, I think, play 'a'.]
;W[en]TR[em][el][dl]C[plasma: Now the three black stones die. This is absolutely crucial, saving the white group in the middle from lots of trouble.]
;B[fi];W[eh];B[ei]
(;W[gj]LB[dh:a]TR[eh][fh]C[plasma: Connect at 'a'. Not only does it save the two stones, but it gives you more liberties and stops any chances of Black getting a seki.]
;B[dh];W[ej]
(;B[hh]C[plasma: See variation for the seki chances I was talking about (though they don't seem to work yet).]
;W[fn];B[hn]C[plasma: I don't think Black needs this. So perhaps (as you say next) he should solidify his moyo...]
;W[kg]C[I had been counting on getting to play a stone at H16 in orderto erase a lot of black territory, but needed to be able toconnect to it.  If black had blocked white's access to H16 the game would have been essentially over it seems to me.

Thoughts?];B[nj];W[oj];B[lg];W[lh];B[jh];W[kh];B[mg]C[plasma: Bad, since it doesn't work...]
