C[>Hello,
I'm ziggystar 7k on KGS and I'll try my best in reviewing this game.

In general I always try to review both sides, because I find it important to see what the opponent thinks and does.]
;B[gc]C[>I think 3-3 is a bit low for a 9x9 game. I'd prefer 3-4 or 4-4. But I can't tell if it's really a better opening than this one.]
;W[cg];B[fg];W[cc]C[>This one is a bit too defensive by white. Better D7.]
;B[ee]MA[ce][fe]LB[fd:A]C[>I think this move doesn't gain much for black. It leaves a weakness at A (F6), so it's not a goold settling move as F5 would be. On the other side it doesn't threaten white much.

C5 would be the fighting option for this game, but I'd prefer F5 since black has more potential for territory.]
;W[gg]C[>White chooses to invade, which seems the right choice.]
;B[gf]C[Was this a good answer? Are there bigger points?

>This answer is ok.];W[hg]
(;B[hf]C[Maybe blocking on the other side is better for black. See variation. The reason is, that this sequence lets white settle both lower corner stones.]
;W[fh];B[eg];W[eh]
(;B[dd]C[Is e7 or c5 bigger?

>Now that white has settled the lower side it seems hard for black to win this game. But this move (D6) is definately bad, because it forces white to settle the last corner easily. Thank you black.

Though it's probably not a safe way to victory, black now has to play more agressively. Just playing C5 isn't enough anymore because the lower side of white is safe and white can concentrate on the upper left. So I'd propose something like the given variation.]

(;B[ca];W[ba];B[eb];W[df]LB[if:A]C[Maybe white better played A (J4) here.]
;B[ef];W[de];B[ig]C[I think h2 would have been better - is this correct?

>Yes. This is two points worse.];W[hh];B[ih];W[hi];B[if];W[bg]
C[Why b3? Is their a possibility to attack without it?

[bc][bd][be][bf][bh][bi][cf][ch][ci][di][ei][fi][gh][gi]C[In general you can probably say that black has played too defensive. There wasn't a very big mistake in the game by both sides but more something like constant underplay.

I propose that you try to play some more risky experimental games to see what's possible and where the limits are (but don't get used to playing too agressively)

But after all this is only a small 9x9 game and probably doesn't give me enough insight for judging your playing style. This is just an opinion founded by this game.

Thank you for letting me review your game,

(;B[da]C[Better.]))
(;B[dg];W[dh]C[> I wouldn't expect a stronger player to make this move (better C4). But against a stronger player there'd be no hope for black now. For a two digit kyu this move might seem normal.]

MA[cc][cg]LB[ce:A]C[This alternative leaves black with sente. Black can make good use of it by separating the two white stones on the left with A (C5).

White won't be able to save both of them.]))
