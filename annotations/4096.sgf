C[This is my sixth game as a 1 dan on TOM, i played against a 1 dan korean player, he was decently strong and crushed me with a big 9.5 win. i posted some questions and comments here and there in the game, hope the reviewer will find my crucial mistake and are welcome to give me some good hints and any comments, thx!!

Basti: Hi. I've marked my comments with "Basti:"];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[qp];W[cd]C[same start as my opponent, just a starting style i like]
;B[fq];W[cn]C[Basti: The C16 stone is low on the left side so  it is not interesting to play another low move there. I would play D6 or P4.]
;B[dr];W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[hp];W[iq];B[ep];W[dq];B[fr];W[eo]
;B[fo];W[ip];B[hn];W[mq]C[a new play i learned from the pros, but i think i lost some points here...

Basti: You would want to extend as far as P3. So maybe G3 is just not appropriate for this situation.]
;B[oq]C[Basti: Black's really happy to play here.];W[en];B[io]
C[Basti: This point is also very important];W[jo];B[jn];W[mo]
;B[dk]C[early attack by black

Basti: The white group is quite strong so the attack is unreasonable.]
;W[di];B[dm];W[dn];B[fl];W[qj]C[decided that i shouldn't let black further develop his territory at the right]

(;B[qh]C[push by black

Basti: I think this is the wrong direction.];W[qm]C[Basti: Now the white shimari is under pressure. White could also play at R6]
;B[ro]C[Basti: This move is quite painful to play because it i so low.]
;W[rn]C[Basti: If you are going to defend the group you should play at p10. Because you have a strong stones near I would tenuki.]
;B[rj]C[Basti: If white answers he gets only stronger so this move is questionable.]
;W[qg]C[don't know why i did this, maybe because it's a rush of battle rage for me, but i think this is what caused my loss]
;B[rg];W[qf];B[rk];W[rf];B[oh]
(;W[oj];B[qi];W[rl];B[of]C[black force is strong];W[qc];B[qd]
;W[rd];B[pc];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[fd]C[my wild cut that helped black get stronger

Basti: I think black didn't answer very well.];B[dc];W[eb]
(;B[gd];W[fe];B[dd];W[gc];B[ge];W[de]
(;B[cc];W[ce];B[db];W[fb];B[bb]C[i misread the variations and let black live, i could of killed it right there....]
;W[fj]C[i should have connected at E15 here right?

Basti: Yes. Even if it wouldn't be sente against the corner group. black lives with  only 4-5 points in the corner and the white wall is perfect. This F10 is also attacking a strong group.]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[ff];W[eg];B[hc];W[hb];B[fc]C[no more chances to kill it after this, my opponent must have read all the variations to find that he must connnect with his outer forces]
;W[fd];B[ic];W[ib];B[jc]
(;W[ga]C[should i have given it one more push?

Basti: I think so.];B[ki]C[black got the whole board's vantage point]
;W[el]C[Basti: Attacks a strong group];B[em];W[ek];B[fn];W[dl]
;B[cm];W[cl]C[this i thought was a big mistake];B[bm];W[bn]

(;B[ck];W[cr];B[bq];W[er];B[ej];W[fk];B[ci];W[dj];B[cj]C[i lost a whole bunch of points here, i have almost already lost]
;W[ch];B[bi];W[bh];B[jb];W[rq];B[rp];W[pr];B[or];W[pq];B[pp]
C[i thought i could live... but is there a better way to attack the bottom right corner?

Basti: I think the attack should have worked.];W[rs];B[sr];W[sq]
;B[qq]
(;W[nr]C[Basti: Have a look at the variation];B[ps];W[op]C[Basti: Because black could just capture at R2 this cut is strange.]
;B[oo];W[np];B[pn]C[in the end i still lost a lot of points]
;W[om]
(;B[qk];W[pm];B[ok];W[ml];B[kp]C[Basti: The black corner can be killed.]

(;W[ko];B[kn];W[ln]C[Basti: Seems like an overplay. This is the last comment.

Train your reading skills and don't attack strong groups. You should also stop playing crazy moves like R13 or the cut at F16 as they for sure won't work against a stronger player.]

I lost the game by 9.5 points to black, i understood some of my weak points, but i suppose it's always better to consult one of the better players. this is one of my games which i made some pretty dumb choices, please point them out for me and maybe leave some comments here and there. thanks for looking at my game, what do you think i should improve upon?]
