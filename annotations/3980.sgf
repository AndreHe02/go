C[XCMeijin: Hello again Garouf! I hope you've been learning loads since my last review with you.

Seeing as your opponent here is 10 stones stronger than you, im surprised there was no handicap. That he only won by 2.5 points tells me that he was playing "fairly" with you, i.e., he hoped you would learn a few things by yourself. Keep that in mind for the future; games where one massacres the other are hard to learn from.]

(;B[qn]C[XCM: not threatenening enough, i think...];W[qg]
(;B[de]TR[qg][qj]C[Should I have extend here? Or would be better play in other place like k16 or k4?

XCM: attacking is good, but i believe that you should attack the other one first.

See the marked white base? it's closer to D17 than C4. therefore, if you attack C4, there's less of a chance that the marked base can be used to white's advantage. Granted, the base IS quite far away, however, in Go you can never truly know what will happen.]
;W[fd]
(;B[cd]C[XCM: Slow. Small.];W[cg]C[XCM: see? white is limitting your functions easily.]
;B[cf]C[Here he forced a lot. Is there any way to prevent this or when I have played in C16 this the best shape I can do?

XCM: prevention starts EARLY. Remember that.

Now, it'll be a hard fight for black, so i might actually try to live in the corner, then rush to play big points.

C14 at C17 is better in terms of securing life.];W[cj];B[cc]
;W[jc];B[lc];W[jd];B[le];W[jq]C[XCM: OK, pause. Look at the whole board.

White has made his presence known throughout the whole board. Where as black is still largely confined to the corners, white has strong groups in the sides, which are also facing an open centre.

The opening is a major part of teh game. Never underestimate it. Try to play the biggest points at the start.]
;B[eq]C[XCM: dangerous. Even if it lives, white will gain massive wall/influence towards the centre.

E4 is safer, more chances to run to the centre.

And interestingly, K3 is there, so it acts like a quasi-pincer. i would have attack from a far higher position, something like E5.]
;W[gq];B[eo];W[dn];B[gp]C[I played here in contact in order to press him and to strengthen my own group, because it was in bad shape. Instead G4, should I play in N3?

XCM: Here's a tip - contact plays only make your opponent stronger. Try to realise that if you make contact, your opponent is forced to answer, and then the contact stone becomes outnumbered 2-1. 

See the more aggressive play white could've done.]
(;W[hq];B[go];W[mq];B[pr]C[XCM: good, protect the corner. BUT the G4 group is worrying; smack bank in the middle of white's influence.]

(;B[rb]C[XCM: wrong. You are too scared.

In Go, fear will work against you. Playing too defensively will cost you the game. Learn to have more courage, be more proactive, not just reacting to the other's attacks.

see variation.];W[se];B[rf];W[qf];B[rd];W[rg];B[qd];W[sf]C[XCM: OK, so you've killed the two in the corner. However, you've lost the potential invasion i showed you earlier.]

XCM: Not that i can see. However, you do have the potential to chase it around the board. I'd concentrate on making life first.]
;W[mg]LB[dg:3][nh:1][gl:5][fp:2][mp:4]C[XCM: OK, pause 2

Groups 1 and 2 are weak. 2 is stronger than 1, owing to the fact that it almost has one eye around 2. 

To increase you prospects of expanding into the centre, you can use your corners. Normally you would use side extentions to run to the centre; you don't have any, so you must improvise.

Hane (turn) at points 3 and 4 will be nice. 5 will be good for pulling group 2 out of trouble.]
;B[nf]C[XCM: BAD, only gives him an eye and makes him stronger.]
;W[ng];B[mh];W[lh];B[kg];W[lg]C[Would be better play in O10 instead play in L14?

I played in O10 because that three stones looked dead to me. Lemme see if it would be a good idea play there.]

(;B[kf]C[XCM: this doesn't really connect well. White need only play L15 and black is in trouble. See variations.]
;W[mi];B[bn];W[bp];B[cl];W[bk];B[em];W[en];B[fn]TR[mi][jq]C[After this I tried to attack him in order to build a big moyo in center.

Is there any place to play before start to do something like that?

XCM: Not really. The way i see it, after black strengthens the group at F6, the moyo in the centre is small.

The marked white stones will destroy most of any territory you plan to gain. Keep in mind that O12 is dead, so white is stronger here.]

Is it too soon to do this or it was a good decision?

I always try to study some josekis but I often forgotten the patterns because in Go you should play in order to maintain equilibrium between influence and territory.

A friend of mine told me long ago that before I start to study joseki I should learn about some positions, like keima, tobi and kosumi.

So what you think about this? Thanks for your attention and see ya!!

XCM: It was an interesting game. I can see room for improvement.

As you mentioned, the problem about joseki is remembering them. But the point about go isn't remembering, it's about playing the game. Next time, just try to play a variation on your own. It will take some time, but you will develop a sense of balance necessary for joseki.

goproblems.com has a series of best move/fuseki problems. They are good for developing a sense of which move is bigger in the beginning of the game.

Don't forget to do life and death problems! Even if the opponent is technically dead, if you cann't see the right way to kill, it may come back to life.

And yeah, i agree with your friend. You should study the different relationships between stones, tobi, kosumi, all that. Senseis.xmp.net has a good database, you'll find what you're looking for.

Good luck in you Go.

XCM: This is good. K16 is good for centre influence.

(;B[pe]TR[jd]C[XCM: this is a special shimari (enclosure). As you can see, it is facing towards the triangle point. Therefore, this kind of enclosure is suited for influence along the side and the centre.

Conversely, the shimari you made, (at R15) is more corner oriented, rather passive towards the centre. 

Which shimari you use is really up to you; personal preference plays a big role in Go. However, to keep the game more active it is good to use more active shimaris.]
