C[review by Tomas van der Wansem marked as [T\]

In general the game looks quite good; only few mistakes are made, however some big points take far too long before they are taken, especially in the lower left.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cp]
(;W[dc]C[[M\] Would C16 have been better to aim at C4? A follow-up at E3 or C-D 11 would be powerful (?). (See variation)

[T\] i wouldn't know, but i think it doesn't make much differnce cause there's enough space to play between the black stones]
;B[ce];W[cd]C[[M\] too agressive a move? I don't know joseki specifics, I'm studying Fuseki now.

[T\] The move is not too aggresive but i think extending at f16 is more valueable. If you want the corner, I think C17 is better cause it makes you stringer and it adds the same prssure to the c15-stone]
;B[ch];W[eq];B[cm];W[jd]LB[gp:A][hq:B]TR[eq]C[[T\] You leave the marked stone vulnarable; i'd first play a or b]
;B[gp];W[ip];B[gm]TR[eq]C[[M\] too big an extension for black?

[T\] It would be if w would manage to make use of you;re marked stone. In the following moves b moyo gets stronger, and the marked gets weak]

(;W[hn]LB[gq:A]C[[M\] Again too aggressive? Perhaps an equivalent extension at J7 would have been better?

[T\] this only helps black. If b plays A now, he will probably get a huge corner. see var.]
;B[gn];W[il];B[ho]LB[gq:A]C[[T\] Again I think A is much bigger]
;W[io];B[hm];W[im];B[gh]C[[M\] too small a move for black. Strengthing along the sides and UR corner would be best.]
;W[ph]LB[de:A][np:B][gq:C]C[[M\] I chose this point with respect to my white wall on the left would closer at Q13 or Q14 work well? -- What about J12 or K12?

[T\] Big territory is still to be claimed, so I wouldn't play j or k12. this move is good, but there are some other points I marked that I would prefer cause the claim a lot of terriory with one move.
A is preferred cause it is sente];B[gk];W[gd]C[[M\] if this were higher (5th line), would it be better?

[T\] D15 first is much better, cause it's sente. after that you can play the 5th line]
;B[qf];W[qh];B[oh]C[[T\] weak move. this aims at nothing but giving w more strength]
;W[og]C[[T\] attacking on the other side is better cause it sets up a nice wall to lower-right]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[mg];W[mf];B[mi];W[lg]LB[pf:A]C[[T\] A was needed here. b can cut instead of defending n13]
;B[mh];W[ok]C[[M\] better to defend at M14 first?

[T\] Q13 is much more dangarous, after b m14 w can give up m13 stone and take big upper side  (see variation]

(;B[nf];W[of];B[ne];W[oe];B[me];W[od]C[still cutting point at q13 is dangarous]
;B[lf];W[mc];B[oc];W[nd];B[ob];W[qe];B[pe];W[pf];B[qd]C[[M\] Attack at S14 instead?

[T\] doesn;t matter. R15 dead in both cases];W[re]C[[M\] definitely not able to save R15.

[T\] therefore, better tenuki];B[rf];W[rd];B[rc];W[qg];B[se]
;W[mk]LB[oi:A]C[[T\] you leave a weakness, better play at A first]
;B[pi];W[rg];B[sd];W[qj];B[qi]LB[fe:C][gq:A][nq:B]C[[T\] w group not in danger. Cause of these moves by b, w just gets stronger in lower right  ver big points for b marked.

A & C are sente and should have been played earlier];W[ri];B[sh]
;W[sg];B[rj];W[rk];B[pj];W[qk];B[pk];W[pl];B[oj];W[nj];B[oi]
;W[ol];B[kh];W[hj];B[ih];W[kf];B[kg];W[le];B[lh];W[md];B[mf]
;W[ke]C[[M\] K14 instead? Invasion not possible.

[T\] yes for sure];B[mb];W[lb];B[nb];W[kj]TR[mk][il]C[[T\] small cause marked stones are already a good border. lower & upper left much more important now]
;B[hr];W[hp]C[[M\] J2 instead? B. responds to H4 at J6];B[hq]
;W[go];B[fo];W[iq];B[ks];W[lr]C[[M\] I think I responded well to the attack, but how should I have prevented it?]
;B[kr];W[kq];B[ir];W[mq];B[qq];W[pq]C[[M\] Push black to the strong white wall At Q8]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn]C[[M\] Double hane is possible here.]
;B[qn]LB[pr:A]C[[T\]
double hane possible indeed, so b should play A to try to make small life in the corner]
;W[po];B[rm];W[rp];B[sn];W[rq];B[ql];W[rl]C[[T\] b already dead. why not tenuki]
;B[qm];W[pm]C[[T\]  not nesesarry];B[sl];W[sj];B[sm];W[pn]C[[M\] This move is very small!]
;B[jq];W[jp];B[jr];W[kp];B[ls];W[ms];B[ho];W[gj]C[[M\] Big ko fight begins...

[T\] The ko isn't worth to much and a thread like this is not good for w. This way you settle the border and you remove the possiblety of a real invasion around e12/e11]
;B[fj];W[go];B[sk];W[rj];B[ho];W[jg];B[jh];W[go];B[rh];W[si]
;B[ho];W[df]C[[T\] same comment as before, if a ko isn't big, you should avoid ko-threads that remove aji]
;B[cf];W[go];B[rh];W[sh];B[ho];W[eh];B[ei];W[fi]C[[T\] nice move!]
;B[fh];W[gi];B[eg]C[[M\] Black needed to defend here...];W[ej]
;B[dh];W[fk];B[dj];W[gl]C[[T\] too small, e9 eats much more territory]
;B[fl];W[hl];B[ek];W[fj];B[dl];W[go];B[hi]C[[T\] this move is worth nothing, f7 should be defended]
;W[fm];B[fn];W[el];B[em];W[fl]C[[M\] I could have pushed again at D9 at the cost of a ko.]
;B[en];W[fp];B[gq];W[fr];B[ho]LB[dr:A]C[[M\] Black wants to ensure life of H2 group.

[T\] He should do this by playing A, and w will be short of libs for certain]
;W[cq];B[in];W[jn]
(;B[ep]LB[bp:A]C[[M\] B should have attached at B3 instead to prevent life. (Is the W. group alive?)

[T\] Very hard life&death problem, but i think A would have been best for B, see variations
with the supplied variation i couldn't find a way for w to live]
;W[bp];B[dq];W[dr];B[dp];W[bo];B[fq];W[er];B[ee];W[hg];B[hh]
;W[ig];B[ed];W[ec];B[dd];W[bd];B[gf];W[hf];B[fd];W[ge]C[[M\] Big mistake on my part... Should have blocked at F17. I saw it a moment too late.]
;B[fc];W[ff]C[[M\] once the invasion occurred, however, I couldn't see a good way to defend - so I went with my original plan (White in upper Left can make life).

[T\] this is bad since b doesn;t need to defend];B[ef]C[[T\] unnecessary]
;W[gg]C[[T\] G17 is much bigger now];B[eb];W[db];B[ea];W[da]
;B[fb];W[bb];B[ib]C[[T\] this is to polite. j17 also connects]
;W[ic];B[hc];W[hd];B[hb];W[jb];B[ka];W[kb];B[la];W[ja];B[ma]
;W[bm]C[[M\] This was left open to push as far as I could...]
;B[bl];W[cn];B[dn];W[co]C[[T\] very small. try c9];B[dk];W[lj]
;B[ij];W[jj];B[ik];W[jk];B[ii];W[hk]C[[T\] small];B[am]
(;W[an]C[[M\] connecting would have been better for me.];B[bn]
;W[br]C[[M\] I thought I needed to make sure of life, though.]
;B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[do];B[eo];W[aq]C[[M\] This is not necessary.]
;B[be];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[ia];W[gs];B[hs];W[hn]C[[M\] Ko fight, part 2.]
;B[rr];W[qr];B[in];W[ag];B[bf];W[hn];B[cc];W[bc];B[in];W[al]
;B[bm];W[hn];B[cb];W[ca];B[in];W[gc];B[gb];W[hn];B[sp]C[[M\] This does not need a response. Black is still dead.]
;W[go];B[sq]C[[M\] now a response might be a good idea. If no response, see variation...]

(;W[rs];B[ss];W[sr];B[ho];W[in]C[[M\] I didn't have any excellent plays left, so I decided to end it. I could have played a weak threat at B9, but no response would have been necessary.]
