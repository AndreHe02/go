C[I'm not sure this is the best responce to his invasion at Q18.

It's as good as anything really.  The real problem here is the cutting point at r15 -- which is the result of the empty trinagle from earlier.  Q18 is a standard probe.  It's frustrating to have that stone there.  Personally, I think I would have played p16.  White might live in there, on the other hand, you get out very securely and threaten to kill that poor white group you're surrounding.  White is more likely to answer at the dying group and ignore q18 for now.]
;W[od];B[pc];W[nc];B[nd];W[ob];B[mc];W[qe];B[ne]C[Maybe I should have played O18 instead?


O18 is accpetable.  Go is this simple: Keep white divided, stay connected, don't die.  OK, it's a lot more complicated than that... but those are the big three in my opinion.]

To be honest, I'm not sure what you're after.  Are you trying to kill white?  I don't think that's possible.  It is very difficult to kill things.  You can reduce white's position by _threatening_ to kill him.  But you should so so strongly.  Say a bamboo joint at l14 and some yose moves much later on...

g8 might be a lot bigger here.  I'm guessing, rather than actually counting, but that white moyo in the lower left is getting pretty big.  Black has a 5 point group in the upper left, a two point group in the upper right, 15 points or so in the lower center and 20 points (maybe) in the lower right.

g8 lets you maybe carve into it a little.  Or at least threaten too.  It may be too late soon...]

[jr][hs][is][js]C[I don't know wheter White was trying to tie. Is that the case?  

Unlikely.  You must play chess?  In Go, a tie is impossible because of komi.  Also, at our level -- i.e., not a pro -- it's pretty impossible to actually force a 0.5 point win.  But it does happen coincidentally from time to time.  Most games at the pro level are won/lost in the first 20 moves or the last 20 moves.  The middle game is tricky, but fairly well understood.  The end game is understood but impossibly difficult.  The beginning is ethereal and confusing -- not even the pros understand it I suspect... but they understand it much better than we do.

If not, I would greatly appreciate to hear how could both sides have played better.

The secret is to think bigger.  Don't get involved in local conflicts if you can find a fuseki that's worth 20 points.  Who cares if you lose 10 points in a corner if you can get 20 somewhere else.

Thank you very much,

NP.  Sorry it took me so long to get to this review.
