AB[dd][pd][dp]C[hello, dear reviewer!

This has been my first game with Ben (Free002);

He offered me a Handicap 3 and I agreed; I never thought, that I could win the game:

Now, Iwould like to understand it, and also to send a reviewing to Ben.

I hope, you will find it interesting too!

Tanks in advance !

$ Hello, I m sylvain (sylvainc 3k on kgs).
Your opponent seems (according to his rank) stronger than me but I will try to review for both. All my comments will be precede by '$']

$ well, this is a very short game, perhaps not the best to be reviewed for you. White was not reasonnable here.
You managed well to attack and played good connection generally speaking.

Hope my comments will help.
Ask if anymore question at sylvainc@mail.pf
