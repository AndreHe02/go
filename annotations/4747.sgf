C[Dear reviewer,
I played black in this game and lost by 7.5 points.
I think I was ahead until my opponents invasion at r9 (move 142). I feel i treated ist very weak.

Hi, my name is Ukrit i'm from Thailand.  
Currently British 1k .  I'll try my best.

->  you ask to concentrate on fighting but I think you should improve on your opening too. Good opening will help you in midgame fighting. 

and for fighting you should study shapes and tesuji.];B[pd]
;W[pp];B[cd];W[fd];B[ec]LB[cp:A][dp:B][dq:C]C[-> normally you play in open corner, d4.  because f16 is a high move and far from corner.

-> because white will surely ignore e17, it gives white free choice to play  A, B or C.]
;W[dq];B[di]C[-> strange extension , should be sth like c13 or c12,  or you can approach lower left corner.]
;W[nc];B[lc]LB[kd:A][pf:B][qf:C]C[-> this is the move that creates the position that you have later.  I would suggest high pincer like L16 ( It works with D11,  aiming to eat up f16 on a large scale) .   or just play calmly at q14 or R14.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[jd];B[fc];W[gd];B[le];W[ng]LB[ph:A][qi:B]C[Don't know how to treat upper right corner. White has two separated groups, black too. Is where any general advise for this situation.
I decided to make territory in the corner, but

-> this happens with M17 pincer, if you don't like this then don't m17.
you should extend one more at q12 or r11 to secure the side

there are 2 points.  

one,  if you don't like this result then maybe running out with M15 now is a bad idea.  you can run out later if white doesn't block.  otherwise there are still aji's. 

two, if you want to run out then,  maybe  f17 and g16 exchange makes white stronger. = more difficult for black.]

;W[jp]TR[ph][qh]C[-> to evaluate  this result.  
black attacks white, 
white lives and has sente. 
black still has no eyes.  so black should not be happy.

--> white could play around marked area to stop black on the right side.  but white choose this, maybe he's aiming to attack j10 group, black should keep this in mind.]
;B[co]C[-> too low  should be high move, d5.  But right side is bigger.  R6 for example]

the shape is alive and white can also connect at j19

;B[qp];W[pr];B[ln];W[mp];B[bj]LB[cj:A]TR[cl][cm]C[better at p8?

-> also better at C10,   B10 doesn't help two stones at all.  white captures with c9.

 you should study shapes, good shapes, fighting shapes. it's impotant in fights.]

(;B[mk]TR[pl]SQ[il][jl][nl][jm][nm][om]C[->  you can connnect at q8,  I'm quite sure black is ok because of the (possible) shortage of liberties of k8 and o8, it takes a bit of reading.  
but the game is still close.  

this peep is bad, giving up P9 = lose the game now.
