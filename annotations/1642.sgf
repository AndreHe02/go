;B[pp]C[hi! Thanks in advance for reviewing the game, I'm white in this game. I've removed all the chat, I'm around 26 kyu, [26?\] on KGS.

--Serenity];W[qd]C[phi: Hello Serenity

I will do my best

phi: philipp (phi on KGS)
http://www.go-winterthur.ch.vu];B[dp];W[dc]LB[cq:A][qq:B]C[I noticed that some people play over the star and some to the sides of the star...is there a diffrence besides the orientation of the formations? And why would he play on all the stars...?

phi: It is just a matter of taste. A star point has more influence, but can be attackted at the 3-3 Point. A 3-4 Point is more secure in the corner, but does not have as much influence. 

When the opening is finished, you can invade a star point easily; see later in the game (my comment to move 12).]
;B[iq];W[id]LB[oc:A][ce:B]C[phi: I would do a corner enclosure with A(P17) or B(C15) first and after the corner enclosures go to the edges.

The proverb says: 
1st: Corners
2nd: Edges
3rd: Center];B[pf];W[od];B[qj]
(;W[dh]LB[dc:C][cf:A][ck:B]C[phi:

Have a look at the left edge.
If you already have a stone on the 4th line (C), play on the 3rd line (like A or B).

Another point is the extension from above. Your move is so far away from C, that black still can invade around A. To avoid an invasion around A, play A yourself.

Another oportunity allong the left edge is to make a Base. See variations on the previous move.]
;B[qn];W[dl]LB[cq:A][qq:B]C[phi: What I wanted to say in my comment on move 4: 
You could invade the two black corners easyli on an 3-3 point (here A or B).]
;B[dm];W[ii]LB[dh:F][cl:B][el:C][cm:D][dm:A][em:E]C[did I approach the middle too early?

phi: In most cases it is better to react to an approach move like A(D7). An approach move can be respnsed in two ways: adjacent (like B or C) or diagonal (like D or E).
I personally prever C (or B) in a situation like this, because i strengthens F (D12)]
;B[ln]C[he somehow seemed to have a stronger position at this point...without losing too much territory. Did I play my opening badly...?]
;W[ld]LB[kc:C][lc:A][mc:B][kd:D][md:E][le:F]C[phi: This move gives the opponent several attack possibilities:A, D, E, F.

On the other hand, it is not very good to have all your stoes on the same line (like you have now all 4 stones at the top right on the 4th line).

Better would be A, because you will have stones on the 3rd and on the 4th line:
* 3rd line is for making territory 
* 4th line is to get influence into the center.

But anyway, in this situation, I prefer C or B. This moves give your opponent just one possibility to invade. I you play B  for example, you opponent must invade on the L-Line (Move C or D) and has not many other possibilities: It is always good, to limit your opponents possibilities.]
;B[co];W[li]LB[ce:C][nf:A][el:B]C[phi: This move does not make much territory, because at A the field is still very open. 

I would play C, B, or A myself in this situation.];B[nh];W[fl]
C[phi good. You make a big moyo (influence) on the left side.]
;B[fm];W[il];B[lg];W[kg];B[lf];W[kf]C[phi: good: Answer attachments.]
;B[mi];W[ll];B[ml];W[in];B[io];W[gn];B[fn]LB[li:D][ll:C][gn:A]
[in:B]TR[lh][lm][jn]C[phi: You have been attached 4 times in the last 8 moves. This makes the 4 marked stones (A-D) weak.
I prefer answering attaching moves because you will be strengthened yourself.
It would be good to have some stones around the marked places.]
;W[go];B[gp];W[fo];B[eo]C[was it bad flow to go in right now?]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[eq];B[dq];W[er];B[fq];W[ep];B[fr];W[en];B[do]
;W[em];B[dn];W[gm]C[phi: good sequence: Now, black is split in two groups.]
;B[ce]LB[ch:B][dh:A]TR[dc][de]C[he attacked here...is playing a two-point star or the knights move supposed to be played, or is it supposed to be like an answering to an approach?

phi: well, black (which is about 40 points behind) has to do something. 
An invasion into "your" territory is the right thing. 
A komoku (3x4-Point) is normally answered with a smal knigt move or a one-point-extension.

Now you see, why it is better to alternate the 4th and the 3rd line. If your stone at A(D12) would be at B(C12), black wouln't have an easy invasion. I always look, that my stones along the edge alternate between the 3rd and the 4th line.]
;W[cd];B[bg];W[bh];B[dg];W[eg];B[df];W[ef];B[bd];W[bc];B[dd]
;W[cc];B[be];W[ed];B[cg]LB[ad:B][ag:A]C[phi: As I see it, black is dead now. If you play A and B in sequence, black will not have enough room to make 2 eyes: see variation.]

(;W[af];B[ag];W[ad]C[phi: now, black is alive.];B[bf];W[ac]
LB[de:A][ch:B]C[phi: this move is a waste.
To protect your top, better play at A(D15).

To protect your left side I prefer B (C12).];B[ae];W[ah]LB[ch:A]
C[phi A(C12) is better in this situation, because you will have too many cutting points, if black plays A first.]
;B[ch];W[ci];B[bi];W[bj];B[ai];W[bl]TR[eh][di][cj]C[phi: Now, you have many cutting points (See marked places).
It will be better to protect them first, before extending down the left edge.]
;B[di];W[cj];B[eh];W[fh];B[ej];W[fi];B[ei];W[fj];B[dk];W[cl]
;B[cm];W[nq]C[I tried to do the same thing as he did...attack...but

phi: I see it. It is very difficult to make live here.];B[mq]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[pq];B[qq];W[qr];B[oq]
(;W[op]LB[pr:A]C[phi: I prefer A(Q2) and leave black with 2 cutting points behind. See variation on the previous move.]
;B[pr];W[nn]C[I got cut from the corner, so I tried to make eyes in the middle]
;B[no];W[oo];B[nr];W[np];B[lp];W[mm];B[lm];W[nm]LB[mn:A]TR[mm]
[nn]C[phi: This form is called "empty trinangle". You have three stones forming an angle (marked stones). This stones surround an empty point A(N6).

The "empty triangle" is generally a very bad shape. It is only used to make live (eyes).

Why is the emty triangel bad? An empty triangle just connects 2 stones which are already connected: Here O6 and N7!]
;B[nl];W[pn];B[po];W[pm];B[mo]LB[ol:B][om:A]TR[ml][nl][oo][mp]
[np][op][nq]C[I just about realised it's dead here. But now it looks like if I connected at P7 I may have made another eye...should I have kept going?

phi: not realy. A(P7) does not make any eye. You could give up your marked stones and try (playing B) to hunt the two black stones. But it could lead into a disaster, if black manages to kill your stones and strengthen his at the same time.

So, to leave a situation, where you think your stones are dead is good. The proverb says: "Die in sente", which means, if you die in one place, get the upper hand (jp: sente) in another place. So, your decission to leave the place was good.]

[ps][qs][rs][ss]C[thanks again!

PS:

ummm..I just have a few more questions?:

At which point did the oppening middle and endgame begin?

phi: 
opening: Move 1 ;-)
middle game: Around move 13 to 18: When all the corners and edges have a color.
end game: The endgame starts with the first endgame moves. Your move 72 (A12) was a typical endgame move; but it was too early. Your endgame started around move 120.

I don't know if my train of thought is correct...I don't look ahead much until a fight actually starts, I just asses the nearby stones and determin where to go...(in the oppening), and if stones become close enough to become a fight, then I start looking ahead.

phi: I do the same, but my "looking ahead" probably goes 2 or 3 moves ahead of yours ;-)
This has to do with training: A good way to train the "look ahead" is to solve problems (eg.http://www.goproblems.com/) 

Besides going for corners first, sides, center, and the two-point and horse in the corner...I don't really know anything about the oppening. Was my oppening really bad?

phi: No, you opening was good. The only things I would have changed, I mentioned in the comments:
1. Make corner enclosures before going to the edges.
2. Try to make a "base".

Whats the most important thing for me to improve in or change...what was my biggest weakness?

phi: Difficult question. You have many good moves. 
1. Answer contact moves. Contact moves are adjacent or diagonal plays. 
2. Don't make endgame moves which bring only one point, when there are still open (unplayed) regions on the board.
3. Study life and death problems. "What is a real eye and what is a flase eye?"

phi: I hope, my comments were not too far away from your thinking and further I hope you have learned one or two things. 
The most important thing to improve at go is to play a lot. 
So, if you play at KGS again, have a look if I am around (phi); then we can play a "teaching game".

See you.

Thank you very much!
