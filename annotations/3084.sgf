C[MadRussian [11k?\]: To reviewer:  A close game between xinix and I, I believe that my openings are weak and luckily I was able to catch up during the mid-game stage.  Any play suggests welcomed

KKMD: I agree that you caught up in the middle-game. But I think that, worse than your opening, was your (and your opponent's) ability to read life and death problems.]

;B[fq];W[dq];B[gp];W[gc]LB[cn:B][co:A]C[KKMD: The joseki isn't complete. Black could take advantage of it with A. Instead of your G17, you should have played B, for instance, the simplest continuation.]
;B[kq];W[qj];B[ci];W[qn];B[qo];W[pl]LB[pn:A]C[KKMD: No. A is the key point for both players in positions like that. It is mandatory. This is a question of shape. Plus, it would make R10 perfectly placed, at the right distance from your two stones Q6-R6.]
;B[mp];W[qf];B[qe];W[ph]LB[pf:A][pn:B]C[MadRussian [11k?\]: My shape that I have on the right side here gets destroyed later... I thought it was a decent shape

KKMD: Actually it is terrible. Black could immediately force with A and B, leaving you with a miserable, overconcentrated position. Of course, here too A was mandatory.]
;B[rf];W[rg]LB[pf:B][qg:A]C[KKMD: A seems better, since after it B, which is such a good point, would be no more a forcing move for black.]
;B[pf];W[qg];B[md];W[cg]LB[cc:A][ce:B]TR[gc][dd]C[KKMD: Be aware that this kind of double-wing formation is kind of weak. For instance, as it stands now, black should be able to make life by invading at A, and of course B is also an obvious weak point. It can be very difficult to read, but at least be aware that such possibilites exist for black, so you will need to reinforce this formation later in the game. That's why you might prefer to play something like B instead of your move C13.]

;W[hp];B[gr];W[hr]C[KKMD: All right, you separated black. But he's strong on the right, and will easily strengthen himself on the left, and your seperating stones are quite heavy, so you put yourself into trouble. I think you would have done better with a gentle erasure.]
