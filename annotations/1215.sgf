AB[dd][dj][dp][pd][pj][pp]C[Hi,

I felt pretty good about the way I played this game. But after this result, I'm ready to lower the handicap and continue learning.

My concentration on this game was keeping my stones connected, strengthening groups when necessary and gaining ground by attacking weak stones.

I'd like to know where I was reenforcing weak groups unnecesarily and, as a result, may have missed some nice attacking opportunitites.


Hello,

my name is Peter Strempel. I am happy to review your game. My strength is somewhat around 8k.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]MA[jp][jq]LB[dn:A]C[This move is not good. It allows White to extend to K3 or K4, which gives White an excellent shape.
You only want to play the diagonal attachment if you have a stone around K4, as this would
prevent White to make the good extension.

Instead, simply extending to (A) is a good response to Whites corner approach.]
;W[fp];B[cn]MA[cq]LB[dn:A]C[(A) is good, too.
Please note that your 3-3 point at C3 is still vulnerable to an attack.]

(;W[dg]C[GnuGo likes this move. I see it often when playing GnuGo.
K3 or K4 is necassary for White. Black should ignore the top and play on the bottom now.]

(;B[cf]C[I dont like this move. Too close to the weak white stone. If you want to attack, then do it from
some distance while building up territory. Simply extending here is good.]
;W[fg];B[ec]C[This makes a nice corner, but White can press at C13 or C12 later and weaken your C10 stone.]
;W[ch]C[This is painful for you.];B[jp]C[Good move.];W[pm]
(;B[qn]C[Again!

Extend to P4, this works very well together with your K4 stone.
Now White can still play around the bottom to pincer K4.];W[bj]
;B[cj];W[nc];B[oc]C[Again!

Do not attach when White approaches from the open side without having a stone at K16.
Remember this. This attachment like here is bad.];W[nd]
(;B[jc]C[You leave your corner in a horrible shape. You need to play Q14 or R14 instead.]
;W[pe]C[This move hurts. It is a common move to punish black for omitting Q14.]
;B[qe]
(;W[bk]C[Actually White should continue on the upper right corner. B9 is huge, but White should get more
profit on the upper right.];B[cl];W[ee]
(;B[oq]C[You should take the initiative on the upper right. I dont know if there is a standard move
for this, but usually White would not stop the sequence after Q15.]
;W[ge]C[Weak move. White needs to play Q14.];B[gc]C[Good. Connects. Alternatively you could play at Q14 or so now yourself. Q14 is the move White wants
to play, it is almost always a good idea to get the move yourself then. "Your opponents good move is
your good move."];W[bg];B[bf];W[hq];B[jq]C[Good! Takes profit.]
;W[fn]
(;B[gm]C[This looks a little too close. Play with more distance.]
;W[eh]C[I dont understand this move.];B[fj]C[I dont understand why you answer it.

In this game you almost always react to GnuGos moves. Why? You need to take the
initiative somewhere else. The difficult thing is to decide when you can ignore a move
and when not. Basically you should secure your own stones first, but if there is no
immediate danger, you should play elsewhere. I dont see why F10 is necassary.
Instead attack white on the upper right or bottom.];W[io];B[gn]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[nf]C[GnuGo loves to leave weak groups behind. Very bad you never too the chance to play
around the upper right. You can still get Q14 or R14 now. Q14 is still a forcing move White can play.
Also a White placement at R17 is very painful, so you really would want to strengthen your upper right
group.

If you look at the board, you realize that black has four groups. The one in the UR is the weakest
one, so you should play there to reinforce it.

Also White has 4 groups. The one around E12 is strong, the bottom is mediocre weak. It should
not die but you can attack it with profit. Q7 is very lonely, and the upper right is also not
really strong, but neither weak now after O14.

Considering you have a weak group in the UR, and white a mediocre weak, you really have to play there now.
Strengthening your own stones while weaking the opponent is a good and efficient thing to do.]

white group.];W[rm];B[rn];W[ri]
(;B[qg]C[You can play the hane safely.];W[sm]C[I dont understand this move. White has some forcing moves at N7 and P5 first.]

(;B[hj]C[Why do you keep answering to white? There is no immediate threat here.]
;W[ji];B[jj];W[kj];B[lk]C[What does this move do? You seem to be trying to split white. But it makes no sense to split
already living groups. K9 would make proper shape, but your whole jumping at the 10th line
didint really make much points.];W[sn]

around H11.];B[qh];W[jf];B[rg];W[lb];B[kb];W[lc];B[kd]C[A bit thin.]

;W[ql];B[ei];W[ed];B[dh];W[gd]C[A big win, nevertheless.

Your main weaknesses are:

* You dont attack when you have the chance to do so while making profit.
* When you attack, play from some distance. Contact plays are for defence, not attack.
* Dont play the diagonal approach move when White comes from the open side.
* Dont blindly answer on every move, take a moment to see if there is a bigger move available.
* Look for sente moves in the endgame, you lost quite a couple of points in the endgame because
  GnuGo got all the sente moves.

I recommand you visit one of the Go servers and play human players. Playing too much against
the computer just spoils your style. GnuGo is actually one of the better programs, but human
opponents are nevertheless better. Nothing against an occasional GnuGo game, I do that myself
as well, but if you want to learn Go, then you are better off with a human player.

I hope my comments could help you a bit.
