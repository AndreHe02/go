C[I'm around 12k on KGS. I played black in this game, and won by 3.5 moku. However, there are some interesting points where my strategy went wrong or I made some bad choices.
I commented some of these points but there may be more.


Reviewer: Hi -- If there are any questions let me know. (I reviewed the game in in CGoban)

There is a proverb that says "play the urgent point before the big point."  My biggest criticism of your game is that you are in a rush to develop a big framework and because of this you leave behind weaknesses all over the board.  If you take the time to make the slow but solid move, it will pay off later in the game. 

I play on KGS as sergeant so look for me and I will play a game with you.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[jj]C[I've wanted to try this once. I guessed in an all-hoshi game it may be useful for ladder breaker, etc.

Reviewer: A little unorthodox but black is not bad here.  This kind of opening says "I want to fight!"]
;W[gc];B[jd]C[I wanted to try Bruce Wilcox's great wall as in http://senseis.xmp.net/?GreatWall, the difference being my two corner stones.

Reviewer: This is ok but it is hard to make a moyo playing so close to white's strong stones.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[kc]C[There goes the wall... but maybe move #7 is too late to start to build it anyway.

Reviewer: Don't worry -- this is good for you.  You have built a big framework, inviting your opponent in, and he has taken the bait.  

White was jealous of what you had and invaded WAY too early.]
;B[jc];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[kd];B[kf]C[Reviewer: L14 is a little too loose.]

LB[kh:A]C[Reviewer: White's group is already solid, so M12 does not threaten white in any way.  But it does leave cutting points as bad aji for you, so playing at A is better if you are going to play in this area.]
;W[cj];B[cl];W[cg]
(;B[el]LB[jp:A]C[Trying to build a moyo.

Reviewer: How does this build a moyo?  If you already had a stone at A then I would agree, but it is white's move now.  See variation for a better way to play.]
;W[jq];B[hq];W[lp];B[ho];W[qo];B[pn];W[gg]C[I think I should have occupied this point instead of Q6. The territory on the right is mostly safe but together with the lower left corner, G13 would have made a great moyo.

Reviewer: I agree that G13 is a big point, especially because it threatens a cut your K16 group, but Q6 is urgent. (urgent because it keeps your side in tact AND it keeps open invasion possibilities at R3.]
;B[cc]LB[ec:A][ch:B]TR[jc][jd][je]SQ[cl][el]C[Reviewer -- this 3-3 point invasion is probably ok but when invading, try to use the stones you already have on the board.  

An invasion at A threatens to link up to the triangle stones.
An invasion at B threatens to link up to the square stones.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce]
(;B[db]C[Reviewer: This is complicated but see variations.  Bottom line is it is almost always better to play B15 before D18.]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[bd];B[bc];W[ae];B[ba];W[ab]C[I wonder if there was a way to let this group live... After D2 I mean (see variation).

Reviewer:  Yes, see variations starting at move 55.]
(;B[eg]LB[ln:A][nn:B]C[Reviewer: This is a bold move, but you can let white have territory, just as long as you get more.  Playing at A or B is bigger right now.]
;W[df]C[Even if G13 is there, maybe there is a way to build that moyo...

Reviewer: It is tough.  Don't think about how to make a moyo -- let it come naturally.]
;B[ef];W[ee];B[ff];W[fe];B[gf];W[ge];B[he];W[hd];B[ie]C[Unnecessary?

Reviewer: Not a bad idea to stay solid.]
(;W[gi]C[Reviewer: I do not think it is possible for white to live like this.  See variation]
;B[ei];W[ej]
(;B[fj]C[Maybe the hane at D10 is stronger (var).

Reviewer: No -- your variation has white being nicer than he should be.  You played correctly.]
;W[di];B[fi];W[dk];B[dl];W[cq]C[I should have protected this corner but didn't have an opportunity.

Reviewer: Don't worry too much about this -- when you play star points in the opening you must be willing to live with such invasions.  The right middle part of the board is still the biggest place for white to worry about right now.]

(;B[fq]C[Reviewer: See variation];W[fr];B[gr];W[bp];B[dr]C[Reviewer: B5 is the proper move.]
;W[cr];B[bo];W[bq];B[ln]C[Reviewer: This move is big but connecting at C5 is big too.   Later white has the big end game play of B6.]
;W[jn];B[jo]C[From this point on my playing became like "how to let the opponent destroy my moyos" -_-

Reviewer: Is starting a ko even necessary?  I don't think  white can make two eyes if you just connect at A.]

;B[ql];W[oo];B[jb]LB[ac:A][ks:B]TR[jc][jd][je]C[There are players who would play at L18 instead of this, but I don't  understand how that move works. K18 threatens with a monkey jump and attacking the white outline at L19 is sente, so it seems just better to me.

Reviewer: There is no general statement I can make here.  Sometimes L18 is best, sometimes K18 is best.  There are many things to consider:

- What is going on to the left and to the right of your marked stones?

- K18 is not sente here.  White could just ignore you here, make a few other endgame moves such as A and B, before coming back to keep you from making the monkey jump.]
