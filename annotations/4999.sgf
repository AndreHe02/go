C[s> Introduction
Hello, this is siegoman offering a review of this game.  My comments are marked by s>.  The next three panes have summaries for these types:
- high level view
- best moves
- moves to change

in the review I have added some Labels:
A = play of the game
B, C, D, etc. = suggested alternatives.

thank you for the chance to review the game,
tom.g.coleman@gmail.com];B[dd]C[s> - high level view

Black had the game won, but lost the last battle, which turned things back for white.

a few smaller battles were won, but they had side effects that gave a larger scale side benefit.

Black is strong with local fighting, while White does a good job of the large scale game.

white leaned into the left, forcing black to live.  Black was happy to have so much territory, but as a side effect White got many weapons to attack in the other direction: The large wall around F5.

you had a won game until that last upper right group was lost.  let the center go and solidify the upper right.]
;W[qp]C[s> - best moves
( try shift + click to jump to that move )

71 ( r6 ) 
91 ( Q14 )
125 ( c18 )
137 ( e13 )];B[dq]C[s> - moves to change

180 ( j11 ) = things are mostly stable, time to wrap up the game, solidify, end game moves.

small moves = locally important, but not worth as much as other plays around the board.  one indicator for me is how many stones were sacrificed?
21( d2 )
179 ( n14 )
63 ( n4 )

heavy moves = do you need to save every stone? how about threatening to rescue a stone while building up a strong group.
79 ( r10 )

thank you moves = do you push your opponent into doing something that is good for him? did you just pass and let him make a free move?
15 ( e4 )
47 ( c11 )
49 ( e9 )];W[pc];B[cn];W[fc];B[df];W[ch];B[bg];W[fq]C[s> this exchange on the lower left corner is tricky.  somehow one needs to know when to break away and play elsewhere.

- can the group live for certain?
- can a large connection to the center be made?
- can this group be used to cut another?];B[er];W[do];B[co]

;W[fl];B[dh];W[ej];B[dj];W[dm];B[dk];W[dn];B[dp];W[el]C[i like these exchanges because i get whole side, but my middle group is looking very alone.

s> yes, it is a large place of territory, the left side is maybe 50 points.  white is playing big moyo style, looking for the large space in the middle.  If you can get K5 to live, or connected to a live group you  may win.]

a = small move
b = get something on the right
c = push against F17, build on the top
d = threaten F4, then build base for K5

if D ( h3 ) and white is able to capture C10, is it worth it to save K5?  

what do you value more, C10 or K5?];B[ci]C[s> small move, what does it gain for black? capture a stone, and make C10 a bit stronger.

c11 = 10 points];W[fh]LB[qi:D][gj:B][ek:A][hq:C]C[s>
A = game move
B = threatens to cut
C = make life for K5, attack F4
D = get something going on right];B[ek]C[s> thank you move, forces white to connect.  what does it gain for black?]

;W[lm];B[no];W[kn];B[om];W[ln];B[qn]C[s> excellent play, does three things
- threatens the corner
- extends O5 to the edge
- starts to form a group with R9 next

white can respond to one, but the other can happen
in the game white defends the corner while attacking, so black can make a base at R9.]

A: threaten to cut through at L16, threaten to capture K16.

B: expand into the center, indirectly threatens to : 
- capture H13, 
- capture K16, 
- connect with K9];B[kd];W[jb];B[ha];W[ke];B[kb];W[lb];B[ja]
;W[lf]LB[je:A][ii:B]C[s> B threatens to cut at H11, while starting to rescue K9.]

;B[ki];W[nh]LB[mf:A][ii:B]C[s> a = immediate connect
b = less direct connect, that attacks H12

K13 is safe, it has two ways to escape.
Q14 is safe, N14 is not needed to save it.
H11 is a cutting point that carries a large threat.];B[mf]C[and now i have to start working to win, but i dont end up getting the center to live....HELP ME

s>];W[ii]LB[me:A][lh:B][oi:D][fs:C]C[s>  counting, who is ahead? what is needed to win?

at a birds eye view:

black has four areas: 
lower left, upper left, upper right, right
while white has just one large area.

making a rough estimate of the count:
- lower left = B 25
- upper left = B 50
- upper right = B 35

- bottom = W 120

it looks like things are fairly close, time to squeeze out 5 or 10 more points for the win.

grab 6 points in sente, the do the final ( A - N15, N16 ) sequence to solidify things.

in the end game, look for threats that would make a large difference, that he must respond to, that can help you gain a few.  Sente moves, that must be responded to...

N15 = 4 points in gote, threaten to cut off M18, followed by N16 which captures O16 which is not sente.  if black misses this move then 

M12 = 4 points in sente, threaten to rescue K9, capture L12, rescue L11.

F1 = 2 points in sente, threaten to cut under, black ends with sente.

P11 = 1 point in sente,]
