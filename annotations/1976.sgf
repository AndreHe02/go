C[Dear reviewer,

This was a very close game I played (as black) in our local club competition. Central, according to my view, were two invasions by white. I have the impression the first one (move 46) gave me a lot of profit, while I lost it all with the second one (move 64). So my main question is how I could have handled that better. Of course I would be happy if you could pinpoint other defects in the game.

It would be nice if you could review the game for white and black.

thanks for your time and expertise.

(;B[df]C[JW: White didn't finish the joseki here, so I thought I could profit from it. I do it in a very clumsy way. Was there a better way, or should I have left it for a later opportunity?

vlk: I was looking at the book (36 basic josekis, which I only hav e) and since this is not there, I don't know well. It's said to be some kind of joseki in handicap games (the colors being reversed) .. Seen localy, if white could finish it and prevent the cutting point somehow, his/her c orner would became rather large, I think. I added some variation, which I think are interesting...]
;W[de]C[vlkplk: Maybe blacks D 14 was not bad move, since white responded it, but I think it comes too early. White is very strong, but not yet overconcentrated and black's one stone is not very constructive ..]
;B[cn];W[co]C[JW: I am happy with white's move.

vlkplk: I think white can be happy too-see the variation.];B[dn]

(;W[dh];B[dj];W[ci];B[cj];W[eh];B[ep]C[JW; Once again I try to profit from white's omission, once again without much succes (although I get strong on the outside). Where do I go wrong?

vlkplk: This move-at E 4 looks quite ok. Its nice presure on white. But even black has bigger moyo, his formation is less solid then white. In upper left corner white has ensured some territory, which black should keep in mind.]

(;W[hp]
(;B[hq]C[JW; to leave some aji. Is that a wise thing to do?

vlkplk: To leave some aji is ofcourse good thing. But it means in general to leave as many possibilities left in position as is possible, so as you can decide later, which is good to choose. Especialy bad is to force your oponent make moves for which he would be happy or which solidifies his position.]
;W[cq]
(;B[ho];W[ip]C[vlkplk; Now white's shape in lower side is almost settled, there seem to be no bad aji left.]

(;B[hf]C[vlkplk: I like this mo ve from black.];W[ff];B[pj]
;W[pl]C[JW: this invasion made me happy. It dit let me secure the bottom right and get a lot of influence in the upper right.

vlkplk: Yes. Move like this was better to keep for later. It aims at reducing something, which is not yet built, while white could make some invasion in upper-right area and gain some points.]

(;B[po];W[mo];B[on];W[mm];B[or]C[vlkplk: Black has played this sequence with intention to avoid white from connecting. That white could connect finaly was failure for black, I think.]
;W[oq];B[pq];W[nr]
(;B[qd]C[JW: I thought that if I secured the corner, white would have a very hard time. But maybe tengen was better.

vlkplk: I think this move was ok. White has at least two ways to approuch blacks moyo from outside-he is backed by E12 and N7 groups , so tengen cannot avoid some reducing moves . And with the possibility of 3-3 invasion still left...

Only problem is, whether move no 63 was not better played at Q17 instead R16. The reason is that there is wide r space between corner and blacks H14 group then betwen corner and O9 group.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[JW: I think I started to go wrong here. Pressing white to the top seems to be much better. Am I right?

vlkplk: I dont know. But generally its said that pressing against stronger group is better. Since H14 group seems weaker, this direction was ok.]
;W[ne]
(;B[le];W[mf]
(;B[og]C[vlkplk: I have the feeling that black could have played this move before N15. Anyway, he get to play it later, so...  And, why this point? Because its in the middle? But vital point in whites formation is now P14!]

(;W[lf];B[kf];W[lh]
(;B[ke]C[vlkplk: Black should have no worry about this cut.]
;W[kg];B[me]C[JW: Here I decide to cut white and win a lot at the top. The result is that my right side gets weakened too much. Was Q14 a better move?

vlkplk: Blacks rigt side group is still enough strong even without the stone at Q14.]
;W[nf]
(;B[nd];W[od];B[md];W[pe]
(;B[oe]C[vlkplk; I think this black's move is bad. It forces white to make better shape, than he could have obtained without it. Its better to avoid this kind of moves.]
;W[of]C[vlkplk: White god an extra stone at P14 and it seems better for making eyes than without it.]
;B[oc];W[lk];B[qf];W[pg];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[oi]
(;B[pi]C[vlkplk: This blacks move makes nothing. Black is already connected to the corner and to allow white eat the stone at O9 give white more points.]
;W[oj]
(;B[hj]C[JW: Here I counted and my conclusion was that if I could get enough around F8, it would be close. That's why I played H10. Was this the best move to achieve this goal?

vlkplk: Its hard to say, which point was best. But sure, first of all you could push first at J5 and than make this kind of move.]

;B[bm];W[bo]
(;B[cl]C[JW: unnecessary. I am losing a lot of points in the endgame.

vlkplk: Yes, there are some bigger points. But endgame is said to be very hard even for strong players. So we both have a lot to learn :)]

(;B[cf]C[JW: I counted that I was approximately 10 points behind. Some strong measures seemed needed.

vlkplk: You can do not hing with this stone! But, for example to play at C10 instead is actualy VERY big move.]
