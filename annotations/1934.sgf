;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[cp]C[This is a little close for this early in the game. A joseki, like C5 or D5 would've been better in my opinion. It is an interesting move though.]
;W[dp];B[co];W[do]
(;B[cq];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[jp]C[Good jumping point. Crawling along the second line would've been awful. It is a little large, allowing for a easy attack, but the huge framework you make is almost worth it]

;W[lo];B[hq]C[Interesting. This is very good looking to me. If white made a mistake here, it would've been a huge windfall for you. Even if he manages to cut you off, you can still run for it. It would be a hard run, but its better than letting him keep that huge section of the lower edge]

Don't use that as logic to keep fighting. If you see your strategy has failed, dont keep pushing the point unless you can see a clear way out. Go somewhere else. In this case though, you do have enough room to survive, thanks to your remaining corener stones]

In opening and mid-game, ask yourself is this my best possible move, or just a reaction to my opponent.
At endgame, hold sente as long as you possibly can. Do every sente you can before playing a hand that will lose it for you.
When it only looks like theres one move, look again.])

I hoped to get the corner, but afterwards it looked rather tiny...
But if i walk along the third line wouldn´t my opponent get too much influence?

Depends on what kind of game you wish to play. I myself usually get locked into the corner and the sides. In this situation. I think this would be better. Either he locks you into the corner or locks you into the side. But you are also right that this is a little small if you went this way. I would've probably jumped one to C7. Its a little bigger, plus it allows for later expansion, assuming the game doesn't focus entirely on this side. Even if it turned into a crawl, crawling on the third line is not bad at all]
