C[Hi,

I didn't play seriously for a long time, I will try to do my best to point some mistakes and some variations.

C[1) This move is clearly too close.
2) This stone is not important, it doesn't need to be captured.
3) You can work in the influence of your left part toward the center or consolidate the left border.
4) you can also make pressure on the group on the right.];W[go]
;B[qi]
(;W[pi];B[qh];W[ph];B[rg];W[pg];B[rf]C[is there a better way to apply pressure to these stones?

Yes : don't give up the stones in R11 and R12 :)
I think your appraoch was good.];W[rh]
(;B[cj];W[nh]
(;B[jf]C[This move is not a good tactic. Your opponent's answer in K13 is not good. What is the purpose of K14 ? The group O14 can escape easily and connect another safe group if he wants, so the most important are really sente moves and territories. Here, white should tenuki and attack your territory by using the fact that G5 is still opened.]

(;W[kg];B[jg]TR[ih][jh]C[Maybe you were not convinced by my comment on the previous move, but apply it on this move and it will be more obvious.]

In fact, F2 can be used by a lot of way, its aji is pretty good.
