;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo]C[fair to enclose quite early on?  i often do this, or immediately threaten his 3-4 points if he plays them.

Carey: I't not too early to enclose this.  You'll definately want to be eyeing L3 or L4, a very strong formation]
;W[qf]C[Carey: White should have played at the bottom, you're almost always going to want to keep a shimari from extending.  Now white is just wedging himself in between two black groups instead of extending his own moyo.]
;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[kc]LB[fq:B][kq:A]C[that was joseki up to my move - but i'm not sure if this last play is required by the joseki, nor exactly where i should really place it.

Carey: I probably wouldn't of played there.  I would have played L3 or even F3.  You have a shimari facing that way, so an extension from that is very very good.]
;W[gc]C[seems to me that his extension is good, it blocks my extending to h17 which i would dearly love to.]
;B[fp];W[cn];B[dq]LB[jq:A]C[again i forget if this is joseki, but am confident i can keep my pieces alive.  pretty sure that this isn't the best move for me though, would love a better one?

Carey: Extend! Definately.  Again, you have a shimari right there.   K3  would have given you a commanding lead on the lower side  D3 was a bad mood, I almost never see dan players make moves like that.

Don't get wrapped up in Joseki.  Just becacuse it's joseki doesn't mean it's right.]
;W[cq];B[eq];W[cr]
(;B[dr]C[so i reply, and form an empty triangle.  should i have left this corner altogether, played a bigger point like c10?

Carey: Correct, or even extend and take the bottom side (I sound like a broken record here.

Take a look at the variation];W[ql]C[ah - immediately this looks like a point that i should have played instead, or perhaps even extend to r9 (with the one point jumps escaping to the centre if attacked at r7?)]

(;B[ci]C[i chose this spot to invade because i can still make two point jumps either above or below if challenged.  i thought about invasion at c17, but figured that his outside facing wall would be scary given g17 already - he would drive me down the left side i imagine (white plays d17 after c17 and normal 3-3 invasion continues - would i be right?)

Carey:  I still think the lower side at this point is bigger than that point.  This is a good invasion point, however

If you inavded, white would want to keep you at the top, actually.  See variation.]
;W[ck]C[i suppose this is the problem with my invasion - now his extension is also an attack on me whilst building corner territory.  a separate thought: all of his stones (more or less) are played on 3rd lines - does this mean that i should be thinking about getting more influence in the centre soon?]
;B[cf]C[Carey: This is not a failure for black.  Now he has a base on the left side.]
;W[ce];B[df]C[i believe this to be the standard response - the 'iron pillar'.  also heading to centre has to be good for me.

Carey: It is correct to respond here, being surrounded by white stones.]
;W[cc]C[okay i see what he's doing, protecting the invasion.

Carey: Yes, but D17 would have been stronger protection, and it would of worked really well with the stone at G17]
;B[ei]C[i wasn't sure where to play here, but like the idea of pressuring the lower group.

Carey: now is the perfect time to reinforce the bottom.  You can't pressure a group that is already alive, like the white one in the bottom left.  I don't see how this move pressures the group at all.]
;W[kq]C[poo - okay so it looks like my previous move should have been in this area on reflection.  perhaps k4 would have been far more valuable for me last turn, right?

Carey: It's what I've been saying all along :)]
(;B[mq]TR[iq]C[Carey: No! no! no!  J3 is the correct move.  You want to push him TOWARDS the shimari.  The shimari is very strong, you want to hit him over the head with it.  By playing N3, you are only pushing towards your weak group.]
;W[ko]C[he runs toward the middle, and i figure that i can give chase (with n5), especially since in so doing i will be building my territory on the right corner.  BUT - i can see now that j3 is very important to me - what is the right time to play it?

Carey: You are very lucky he didn't play j3 himself.  You must play j3 immediately or your black group on the bottom left is in trouble.]
;B[mo];W[km]C[Carey: Again, both of you should really be playing j3 or h3]
;B[mm];W[hq]C[so my guess is that n7 was one point too far for me, i should have at that point cut my losses and played j3.  i was bitterly dissapointed when he played h3, i hadn't seen what a huge difference it would make to my board!

Carey: Rule of thumb: don't give chase until you destroy the base.]
;B[gq]C[i thought about attaching on the other side, j3, but couldn't see how i could save any territory for my group.]
;W[hp];B[gp]TR[fn]C[looking back, i'm thinking that g5 looks more promising?  it avoids an empty triangle.

Carey: You only have one eye, F6 would have been better, run towards your stronger group.]
;W[hn];B[fn]C[i very much want to stop his white lines from connecting across my group, and also want to keep them pushing out into the middle.

Carey: If you would have played F6 first, you would have been a step ahead of him.  G4 was a very slow move.

At this point, white is established and safe.  You don't need to worry about him connecting because he is alive.  You, on the other hand, don't have much room to make eyes.  You either have to run to your other group, or make two eyes with F2.  If white plays F2, you are stuck with only one eye (see variation)]

(;W[ek];B[ff]TR[hd][of][gj][fr]C[but there are two routes to the middle, and i like these one point jumps, they're making some territory for me.  perhaps though this sequence is bad - there's only two lines of empty territory between my series of one-point jumps, so is g11, h14, j11, k14 a waste of moves for black?  or are they good, making just the right amount of territory?

Carey: The best moves are jumps from your own territory that also threathen to take away your opponents territory.  Because of that, F14 is a very slow move.  All of the marked moves I would play right now.

Note H16.  This is a common attacking move, a shoulder hit.  If he pushes right, you move right with him and get some great 4th line influence.  If he pushes down, you move down with him and your new wall will work nicely with your stones at the top]
;W[ge];B[gf]TR[of][fj][em][pm]C[i'm happy that white makes this connect, it just allows me to extend my wall to the middle.

Carey: This move by white was correct.  You should not be happy with it.  Now he can push his way into what would have been a great framework on the top.

Just extending a wall to the middle is not good strategy.  You want to extend INTO your opponent's framework.  Good examples of that are marked.]
;W[he]C[after this, it seems to me that maybe j13 would be good, or perhaps l15.  maybe even h14.  if i really wanted to play in this area, which is the best move?

Carey: It's always hard to say what the best move is.  J13 is passive.  Your group is large enough to be safe now.I would play something like L15 or K15, extending my top group.  If white follows , you can extend on the right side.  See variation.]

(;B[do];W[co]C[i liked pushing white like that, at the time i was a bit panicked since i'm not totally happy with life-death.]
;B[fr]C[as demonstrated by this move, i panicked and wanted to make doubly sure that my group were alive.  it is a waste of a stone, but i'd love you to tell me how a possible white attack could have gone ahead on this group, and how my defence should have secured eyes?  i was particularly worried that white might just play at this key area to start with.

Carey: Like I said earlier, I would have played this stone a long time ago.  It is a critical point, and if white were allowed to play it, black would have most likely died.]
;W[dn];B[pm]C[i was pleased with myself for ignoring white's attari, looked to be worth very little, and this connect much more (at least, white's possible reply at q6 would have made black look much worse here)]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[pk];B[ok];W[pj]C[which area of black now needs most attention and why?  i could cap play with n9, finishes off the area quite nicely but doesn't leave much room for expansion.  perhaps m9 is good and leads into middle best? (i only just thought of m9 - i like it now)

Carey: I would continue to squeeze white's right side with P14 (or even p15 if you really want to start a fight)]
;B[pf]C[so i play here.  the plan must then be to make white solidify his walls, and then jump across to somewhere like m14.  sound?]
;W[pg]C[ah.  so white doesn't cooperate, and already it looks like q14 should have been at say p14 or p13]
;B[of];W[og];B[qe];W[rf];B[hb]C[now i've decided that further play at say o14 is only helping white get out towards the centre, besides this was begging to be played.  i did think that with g15 and h15 perhaps i'm playing a bit too far from my own stones - i guess white could probably invade me but i guess also (correctly) that he hasn't got the balls...]
;W[gb];B[hc];W[hd]C[so that was pretty successful, now i suppose i have to make sure that the two remain connected]
;B[id];W[ie]C[and already i'm making a sacrifice - white's solid corner is leaking into the centre, boring.  perhaps this in turn means that my h18 should have been more conservative and then blocked the route to the centre?

Carey: There was no good way to block the route to the center.  This was probably the best black could of hoped for.]
;B[jd];W[bf];B[bg];W[be];B[dg]C[Carey: This move is weak, it creates an emptry triangle.  A move like B12 or B11 would have been better.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[ro];B[qp];W[lr];B[mr]C[these moves so far are all just border drawing up.  i feel that white's plays are urgent so far though, and don't want to leave any of them.  i'm thinking on reviewing this game that i'm upset by the white group at h15 - without them i feel i could play hane at o13, and have a good chance of making territory in an area around say m14.]
;W[ms];B[ns];W[ls];B[or];W[fk]C[right - for me this is good, he's inviting me to chase with him to the centre, i gain territory he doesn't.

Carey: This is good for you, but not for the reason you said.  By doing this, he gave up sente, which means the ball is in your court.  I don't think he was inviting you to chase him up the center.  I think this is just a bad move.]
;B[ga]C[but first i play this.  i understand that this is usually an endgame move, but thought that it was so important that white would feel compelled to reply - which would leave me with the 4 points.  so is it true - can i play a sente play like this whenever i feel like it?  in the end the margin of the game was very close - perhaps my doing this made the difference?

Carey: We are in the endgame right now.  And it's only worth 4 points if he responds, it's worth a lot more if he doesn't respond.]
;W[fa];B[ha];W[fb];B[rp];W[rn]C[i liked that sente exchange.  again as i get the feel for white i think he's just going to respond to my moves when i prod him - perhaps another opponent would not have bothered to reply, but that border looks to be sente and worth a few points.]
;B[lq];W[jr];B[gi];W[gm]C[he blocks off the route of my group to the centre - but again, does this matter so much?  he can't make that much territory, and i can still invade/reduce at say j8 (or j9)

Carey: No, the group is safe, you don't need to worry about his move.]
;B[je];W[ig];B[hg]C[maybe i should have played l13 instead?  go for the centre at last?

Carey: The center has pretty much equal influcence.  You were right to respond there.]
;W[jf];B[kf];W[kg]C[boring - his tiger's mouth looks very good to me, hane, aiming at the centre, i was spitting after this play by him.]
;B[lj]C[but i was quite pleased by this response.  i thought it was _just_ close enough to the bottom group, and would make it very hard for him to get any room going in the middle.]
;W[kk];B[lk];W[kj]C[looking at it again, it seems that now it is absolutely CRUCIAL that i invade at h9 now before he plays say h10 and seals off a lot of territory]
;B[hk]C[woohoo!  i'm still thinking along the same lines as i did in game.  is there a better invasion?

Looks pretty good, but it will probably end in gote.];W[hl]
;B[ik];W[il];B[jl]
(;W[jm]C[White should have played K9.  K8 was wrong for black.  See variations]
;B[kl];W[ki];B[oj];W[oi];B[lf];W[ll]C[in light of his play, perhaps m14 should have been played at m7, but then i didn't like the look of white m14 either with atari.

Carey: This is not a threatening move.  Just play K9.  See variation.]

Carey: He should of :)];W[lm];B[jk];W[gk];B[gj];W[hh];B[gh]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[hi];B[hj];W[ii];B[bj]C[i guessed that this was quite big, certainly will be if he doesn't respond...

Carey: Correct];W[bk]C[Carey: Common continuation (in sente) is A9, A8, A10, B8]
;B[dj];W[dk];B[hr];W[ir];B[re];W[sf]C[i'm sure that was an error of his - he could have bridged under with t15, no?  i'm very happy though...]
;B[se];W[hs];B[gr];W[eo];B[fo]C[ah looking back perhaps the 'connect' at g5 was better, it peeps the connection at h5.  his tiger's mouth at g5 is good for white territory?]

;B[jg];W[if];B[kh];W[lh];B[li];W[ji];B[ni]C[so my giving away the stones in the k13 triangle (which makes no final difference to the score) ends up letting me play both m11 and o11 in a row, which is great!

Carey: That is not great.  It was the same result either way.  See variation.]
;W[nh];B[qk]C[i'm just playing around now];W[rk];B[mi]C[i figured that at some point he'll force me to play here with white n13 anyway, so it may as well be now then i can react to plays inside the square at o10]
