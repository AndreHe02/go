C[This game was played on KGS, as a free game. The  opponent was
14k, and I'm somewhere around  16-17k.
I think this game shows my usual mistake of not being  able to
keep sente. I lose important points because of  this.

I think sente played a great role in this game. There were some
bad decisions by me, though.

(M) Hi! My name is Martin (thus starting my comments with (M))
and I hope you will find my comments a little useful. :-)];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[qo];B[oo]LB[op:A][np:B]TR[pm][qm][pl][ql][qk]
C[(M) I can't find this move in my joseki-books. Most common reply
to a low kakari towards the 3-4 point is to pincer (on one of
the marked points). If you really don't want to play a pincer,
you can play the kosumi at A (witch is old-fashioned, but still
playable) or the keima at B.];W[pp];B[op];W[qq]C[(M) If white wants to play 8, he should not exchange 6 for 7.
It's not really a big mistake (rather bad style), but both players
build a heavy shape.];B[pr]LB[oq:A][or:B]C[(M) Hmmm ...  I don't like black's shape. A or B might be a little better,
but it's difficult to tell.];W[qr];B[nq]C[(M) That's th problem with black 9. If you are not willing to
leave the cut undefended (for the time beeing), you have to take
gote.];W[jq]LB[qn:A][rn:B][qm:C][rm:D][hq:E]C[With
this move he greatly reduces my territory. I  don't see how I
should have
avoided this. Maybe I  followed too much his hands in the right
side? I  wonder if instead of P5 a kosumi would have done  better.

(M) First: Yes, kosumi would have been better. Second: You never
really had any territory along the lower side, so white has not
reduced your territory, but prevented you form making such. To
do so, he leaves other big points on the board for you.

I would now make a leaning attack on the right: black A, white
B, black C.   if white answers this with D, you have strengthened your position.
After you have become stronger you can either leave this area
and take a big point in the upper left corner (whatever white
gained with 12 - it can't be bigger than taking an empty corner)
or you can decide to attack white 12 by playing at E.

if white does not play D, black plays D himself. the white corner
is now completely enclosed and not settled. so white will have
to answer in the corner and the black stones work nicely with
the black stone on Q16.];B[dd];W[fc];B[cg];W[dc];B[cc];W[ed]
;B[de];W[ff]LB[db:A][ec:B][jd:C][jc:D]C[(M) Not good. I think black should answer with A immediately.
He'll get a big corner. And if white connects at B, he has a
heavy shape which you can attack nicely (maybe with C or D).]
;B[cn];W[dk]C[(M) I don't think that this white stone works efficiently.]

(;B[cq]C[(M) I won't play 3-3 now. You give white the chance to build
a wall. Later he can use the weakness of your stones on the lower
right to mke a big territory. I'd rather play like in the variation.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[kp]LB[gp:A][bn:B][cr:C][em:D][jo:E]TR[dk]
C[I tried to go for some influence here because I didn't  want
my group to be confined to such a small  territory. But I guess
an attack around A would have  been better, L4 just strengthened
him.

(M) I think you should play neither 27 nor A. You should continue
the joseki with B (or C, which is not so common, but also joseki).
After black B white should finish the joseki with D.   If white omits D, black can jump out - which means attacking
the marked white stone and threatening to reduce the territory
on the lower side at the same time.

If you really have to play somewhere around 27 (which I do not
advise), then E seems to be better shape.];W[jp];B[kq];W[ko]
C[(M) With 28 and 30, white gains more then black. And the black
stones in the lower left corner are still unsettled.];B[qi]
LB[qn:A][qf:B]C[(M) The extension is to big for a shimari and it is also not
attacking the white stones at the lower right. If you want to
play at the right side, play either A or B.];W[ql];B[qf]C[(M) 31 and 33 don't work efficiently. With two moves you should
be able to make more profit.];W[mc]LB[db:A]C[(M) A is still a big move for black, but the chance to attack
the white stones in the upper left is gone now.];B[kd]TR[mc]
SQ[kd][pd]C[(M) This attack is not so strong. White has alot room to move
(the marked white stone is on the 3rd line, both marked black
stones are on the 4th; it will be easy for white to build a base
on the upper side). And there is the danger that black 35 will
become weak and white gets a counter-attack.];W[me];B[kf];W[mg]
;B[kh]LB[ic:A]TR[dc][ed][fc][ff]C[I thought that I gain more from the walls because I  owned the
right edge of the table.

(M) If you attack, you should always have an attack-plan. If
yor plan is to use your wall to attack to marked white stones
now, then it's ok. But your wall is not in the best position.
White only has to play at  A and his stones are settled. And
the 3 white stones on the upper right still can build a base
quite easy.];W[pc]LB[pb:A][qc:B][kb:C]TR[kd][kf][kh]C[(M) I think better is white A. If black answers B, then black
plays C and the three black stones have become really weak.]
;B[qc];W[od]LB[oc:A]C[(M) Should be at A.]
(;B[pb]LB[qd:A][pe:B]C[I lost the corner because of this. I should have  followed the
path in the variation.

(M) Playing A or B seems better, but you should not lose the
corner because of 43.];W[pe]LB[qd:A][oc:B]C[(M) Black can still play A instead of B and his position would
be completly save.];B[oc];W[qd]
(;B[pc]LB[rd:A]C[(M) I don't like that. This is heavy shape. What about A instead
(see variation)?

This is most likely the point, where black has lost the game.
Blacks position is split and he has three weak groups now: the
heavy five stones in the corner, the two stones at R11/R14 and
the three stones L12/L14/L16.

Chances are good for white to capture one of these groups (what
he did) and win the game.];W[qe];B[rf]C[(M) If black plays 43 - 47, then he should stick to his plan
and secure the corner. If your opponent cuts and you try to defend
both sides - you may lose both sides.];W[re];B[mi];W[lh];B[li]
C[(M) This will lead to another cut for white. White's three stones
N13/N15/N17 getting stronger, the black groups in this area are
getting weaker. the last 10 moves have been a big success for
white.];W[kg];B[jg];W[lg];B[ji];W[jf];B[je]LB[if:A]C[(M) You should play 59 only if you are pretty sure, that you
can make live for your group on the upper side. Else it would
be better to play at A and sacrifice two stones. True: white
would make a nice profit. But if you play 59 and the black stones
still die, whites profit would bee even bigger.];W[if];B[hc]
;W[id];B[jc];W[ic];B[ib];W[jd]LB[gb:A][kb:B]C[(M) Not good. White reduces it's own liberties. Playing at A
or B would make it much more difficult for black.]
(;B[kc]LB[ie:A]C[Black can think about A instead. I think it should be possible
to escape to the center of the board (see variation).];W[ie]
;B[lb]LB[mb:A]C[(M) 69 makes good eye-shape, but white will answer with A. After
that, the stones in the corner will have big problems. Most likely
black will lose one of his groups.];W[mb];B[lc];W[md]LB[gb:A]
C[(M) I think, white has no need to play here immediately. Black
can not cut. If white plays at A instead, black is dead.];B[gb]
;W[ke]C[(M) Since black is alive, capturing this one stone is too small
for white now. If white attacks and kills the upper right corner
instead, he will most likely win the game.];B[le]LB[rc:A][nb:B]
[ma:C]C[A mistake.

(M) Yes! Black MUST try to defend the upper right corner now!
I think A or B should save the corner. The problem with B is,
that white C is dangerous for the black group on the left also.

If black had saved his corner now, he would be back in the game.]
;W[lf]C[(M) White and black avoid the important fight in the upper right.
Who will go there first?];B[oh];W[pg];B[pf];W[of];B[og];W[ph]
;B[pi];W[rg];B[qg];W[sf];B[qh];W[bm]LB[dn:A][dm:B][jm:C]C[(M) That is the wrong side. White can play A and B in sente and
then play something like C - which would create a pretty big
territory on the lower side.];B[bn];W[cm]C[(M) White keeps pushing from the wrong side.]
;B[dn]C[(M) Good.];W[ig];B[jh]LB[kr:G][cr:F][en:E][db:D][gd:C]
[nb:B][rc:A]C[(M) Why defend this one stone? It is not important. You can take
sente now. Playing at
A, B, C, D, E, F or G (for example) seems much bigger.];W[hi]
;B[eh]C[(M) Also not big. Since black has a save position in the upper
left, white will not make much territory there anyway. And black's
territory is not much bigger after this move.];W[fg];B[fh];W[gh]
;B[fj];W[fl];B[cj]C[Maybe this was too large, as move #166 proves. I  guess B10 would
have been better.

(M) B10 or C11 seem to be more reasonable. But the big points
are still elsewhere on the board.];W[dh];B[dg];W[ci];B[ch];W[bi]
;B[di];W[dj];B[ei]LB[bj:A]C[(M) If black plays at A instead, he will capture two stones.]

C[(M) Yes! That is a big move.];W[fp];B[gn];W[gm];B[fo];W[gp]
;B[ho];W[ip];B[hp];W[hq];B[dr]C[(M) Good.];W[er];B[ds]C[(M) The moves from 119 to 129 have been good. But 131 is bad
endgame-style. Black would rather play A and hope to get the
chance to play B later. If black plays 131 it will end in gote
(like A would) but the last white weakness is removed.];W[es]

since white 20). B or C would be nice too.];W[nl];B[nk];W[ok]

(M) I don't agree. There have been

be the standard move.];W[ah];B[be];W[fb];B[ha];W[hd];B[ja]LB[gc:A]

(;B[bf]C[Playing the variation would have been better.

(M) Yes.];W[ag];B[bg];W[ai];B[ck]C[(M) It is sente, but it gains nothing. You should leave this
for a ko-threat.];W[bk];B[dh];W[fi];B[ma];W[na];B[la];W[ca]

;B[js]LB[kr:A]C[Again, a mistake, a 30k move...

(M) I don't think it's a 30k move, but it's a mistake. You have
to be very careful with moves like this, if you have no outside-liberties
left (like here).

Anyhow - If my analysis is correct, you can still live in seki.
But compared to at A it still loses 8 points.];W[ls];B[kr];W[ns]

(;B[ms]LB[nr:A]C[(M) If black plays A instead, he can make live in seki (see variation).]
;W[nr]C[(M) Now that is a 30k move.];B[mr]C[pandu [14k\]: i'm stupid :-)]
;W[eq]C[Savior [15k?\]: it could have been a ko];B[eo]LB[ar:E]
[aq:D][as:C][cs:B][fm:A]C[(M) That is not so good, because white can play A now and the
black corner becomes a seki. After white A black can not play
B, because it would be a self-atari. It's useless for black to
play C, because after white D, black E the position would be
the same again. Since black can not capture the two white stones,
they are alive in seki.

Fortunately for black, white didn't realized that at the end
of the game.];W[hl];B[kj];W[gl];B[ij];W[fm];B[ef]C[(M) So what's the conclusion?

As i said before: black 47 was the key mistake. When black allowed
white to split his top right position, the game was almost lost.
White had now a very good chance to capture one of black's groups.
But he didn't take this chance until move 150 (for 100 moves!).
Since black didn't defend the corner in this time eigther, white
killed and won the game.

So both players made several mistakes in keeping sente resp.
taking sente. Both players omitted several big move to anwer
small moves instead. So to problem of keeping sente exists, but
it did not decide this game.

I'd say that both players are pretty much of the same strength
and played a quite solid game. White was never really in danger
to be killed. Black made only one mistake to let one of hid groups
get killed. This one mistake decided the game.];TB[aa][ia][ka]
