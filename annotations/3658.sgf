C[Hi, this game seemed quite peaceful. I've identified some obvious mistakes, but, as I'm losing a lot of games (I've sinked from 8k to 11k and still going down), I'm looking for more serious (strategy related) mistakes. Thanks.
BTW, I'm white (jaimea)

csh: I will try and do what I can to help.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[dj]C[csh: It is bigger to approach the upper right. Right now, White is concentrating too much on the lefthand side of the board.]

(;B[pj]C[csh: Black missed out on a chance here. See the variation.]
;W[jc]C[csh: This ended up okay, though.];B[cc]C[IMHO, this is premature, isn't it?

csh: White has a double-wing formation (extension in both directions) in the upper left. You can also play once to reduce from the outside, but the timing is about right to invade.

Note that White should also consider invading in the lower right as well, to keep the game close.]
;W[cd]C[csh: This is the correct direction to block.];B[dc]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[fo]
C[csh: This is a big move. It flattens White's moyo (framework) on the left while expanding Black's moyo on the bottom at the same time.]
;W[nc];B[pf]
(;W[pb]C[Or better O15?

csh: Definitely O15. The game has become a competition between the black and white moyo. O15 helps White to enlarge his moyo, while flattening the black moyo.]
;B[qc]C[csh: Still a chance here for White to play O15.];W[jj]
C[csh: Crazy as it seems, the edges of the moyo are more important than taking the center.]
;B[me]C[csh: This is a huge move. It expands the edges of Black's moyo while flattening the white moyo. Note that White's area at the top is still open on the left.

Note that it is much more important to invade and wreck some of Black's territory. Imagine if Black ignores White's next move and plays R3.]

(;W[ne]C[csh: This isn't the right play.  White is forcing Black to strength the edge of his moyo. In return, White is pushing in and reducing only five or six points.

See the variation.];B[nf];W[oe];B[of];W[md];B[lf];W[le];B[mf]
;W[ke]C[csh: This exchange solidified White at the top, but gave Black thickness in the center. This exchange favored Black.]
;B[lj]
(;W[nj]C[Now this is a mistake! I got too worried about his moyo. Now I think a san-san or similar invasion and then F7 or similar was enough...

csh: Yes, this sequence probably lost the game. The invading white stone is a half-measure. It's not close enough to the edge of the board to get enough eyespace, and it's too deep to be able to run away and effectively reduce the black moyo.

See the variations.];B[ll];W[nl]C[Making life here will probe harmful for my moyo...

csh: Yes, but in part this is because the invading stone is hard to settle.]
;B[pl];W[pm]C[csh: These move are solidifying the black territory, but don't give White any eyespace.]

csh: It happens.];B[ej];W[fi];B[fj];W[eg];B[fh];W[fg];B[cq]
C[No more questions, just wanted to know if my analysis is correct or there's something else.
Thanks.

csh: I added a few comments on the endgame, but I think the biggest mistakes were in the middlegame, earlier. Note that the White group on the right isn't 100% alive yet.]

[is][js][ks][ls]C[csh: Overall, there were a few strategic mistakes. In games like these, expanding the moyo at the edges while reducing your opponent's moyo are big moves.

You may want to take look at Attack and Defense, volume 5 in the Elementary Go Series. Chapter seven, Reducing and Invading Large Frameworks, applies to this game and might be helpful to read.

I hope that you find this review helpful.
