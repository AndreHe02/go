C[Commented by Rafael Caetano dos Santos,
mingus 8k* on IGS.

Take the comments with a grain of salt,
especially the ones which start with
 "I guess" :-)

The comments and questions by
Emmanuel Beranger (who plays Black)
are enclosed in square brackets [ \].];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd]
;B[cn]LB[fq:a]C[I guess the usual approach is at a,
but it's more a question of style.];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck]
;W[iq]LB[op:a]C[Since W F3 is low, this is unnecessary.  W could  use sente to play a kakari at a.]
;B[nq]C[Good.];W[pn]LB[qj:a][nc:b]C[This move is bit odd in this phase of the game. It's too close to the black shimari.  I guess 'a' or 'b' would be better.]

(;B[no]C[[Is this correct in any way ?  The idea is to prevent w playing the same, which would result in b being capped under a wide w shape facing center\]

See variation.];W[qj]C[W is playing lightly, but it's still thin.]
;B[qg];W[ro]
(;B[rp]C[I think that in this case it would be better
to push at R5 first.
See variation (at previous node).];W[qo];B[jd]LB[pp:a]C[Big point, but there remains a defect
in the lower right corner, namely a.];W[fc];B[cf];W[df];B[dg]
;W[ce];B[bf]C[I guess you should atari at E14, then link at C13.]
;W[be];B[ef];W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[de]C[Good.];W[ee];B[ff];W[em]
LB[en:a][je:b][ie:c]C[[This was a good w move, to my opinion\]

Yes, it is in the right direction, because it diminishes Black's moyo while enlarging
White's  potentialterritory in the center.  But maybe it would be better at a, since
B can play at that point now.

On the other hand, b is big for W (and c for B)];B[en];W[fn]
C[Maybe W could start a fight at D7...];B[eo];W[fo];B[fl]C[This is bad.  If you expected W to connect at F7, you would only forcing W to strenghten
its group, while not getting any advantage.];W[ep]C[Better to connect at F7.]
;B[dm];W[co];B[fm]LB[bo:a]TR[iq]SQ[fq][fo][fn]C[I guess this is correct.

W can cut at a, but B has solidified its
territory at the left side. Its thickness
also spreads to the center, while
the W group hasn't so much influence:
the triangled stone seems low and a
bit too close to the squared stones.];W[bo];B[bn]C[This can be left for the yose.]
;W[qc]C[I guess that K15 is still urgent.];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob]
;W[qa]C[Wrong. Should be at R18 or S18.];B[qd];W[rc];B[rd]C[Wrong.  You could kill W playing at S18.]
;W[rb];B[pi];W[pj];B[oi];W[jj]C[[Again, w let me think I'm late ...\]

Why?  B is stil dominating the center.  Remember that the  B group at left has a considerable influence in the center.   P11 is also important.]
;B[kh]LB[oj:a][nk:b]TR[jj]C[Maybe a move like a or b would be better,
threatening the W group at the right-hand side
while eliminating a refuge for the triangled
stone.];W[ih];B[kj]C[Maybe you  have heard this already:
if you are attacking a group, don't touch it.
Don't attach.  When you attach, you
are giving the enemy an opportunity
to strenghten himself.

This is a very important principle.
Try to remember it.];W[je]TR[ih][jj]C[Finally W takes K15.  See how this stone will be useful
to the triangled stones.];B[ke];W[lq];B[jk];W[ij];B[ik];W[hj]
;B[gj]C[B is helping W make shape...

The following fight for living is  a bit hard for me to comment on.]

Sorry, it's a bit too complicated for me too. :-)
Anyway, you managed to solidify your territory
at the upper right quadrant.];W[fg];B[fj];W[fi];B[oj]C[I think this is good.]

Try to remember this kind of shape,
so that you don't make the same
mistake in your games.  
Even if you know that a defensive move is  necessary in this shape, sometimes
you may be too eager to gain some points
elsewhere, and let it pass.  So it's also
a matter of concentration.
I still make this kind of mistake.];B[cd];W[bd];B[cc];W[cb]
;B[bc];W[bb];B[ad];W[ab];B[ac]C[[I think this was a wasted move\]

Maybe it was lack of concentration. :-)
