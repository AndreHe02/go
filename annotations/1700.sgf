AB[pd][dp]C[At first i no good in english
Thank for review my game

please tell me where is my wrong move];W[pq]C[Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.  My comments will be preceded by "Ted:".

I think your biggest problem is that you spent too much time simply responding to your opponent's moves, and not trying to play more offensively.

You said in your comments that you would like to learn some joseki, but I think you (and most of us lower-ranked players) would do better to study things like life and death problems more seriously.  This cost you a good deal of territory in the top left.]
;B[nq]C[um i think O3 is good
any suggestion?

Ted: I think playing in the empty corner is best.  In this corner, Q5 or R5 is better than O3 because White doesn't get as good a shape.]
;W[dc];B[po];W[qp];B[qo];W[cg];B[di]TR[dc][cg]C[i think this is a good point
or C11
any suggestion?

Ted: I would suggest K16 here.  When one's opponent plays a shimari like the marked stones, it's usually a good idea to keep him from getting the big enclosure.]
;W[dl]C[i think i am in trouble
how can i respond];B[fi]C[any suggestion in my F11?

Ted: I think F11 is OK.];W[pj]C[trouble again

Ted: You're not in trouble at all.  R8 is a natural point for Black to make a good shape, and the Q/R5 stones can connect to O3 as well.]
;B[pk]C[Ted: R9 is better.  You can make a more stable shape on the side.]
;W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[qm]TR[pk][qk][pl][ql]C[Ted: Black would have a much better shape if the Black and White marked stones were switched.]
;W[pf];B[qe];W[qf];B[ld]C[any better move than M16 ?

Ted: M16 is good, although N16 might be a little better to prevent White from invading at O16.]
;W[jd];B[le];W[gd]C[Ted:  Look at White's stones in the top left.  This is why you should have played K16 instead of D11.]
;B[ip];W[fl];B[hh];W[lp];B[lq];W[kq];B[mq];W[kr];B[op];W[or]
;B[oq]C[Ted:  This is not needed right now -- White can't stop you from connecting if you play elsewhere, and this move gives up sente.]

;W[nh];B[lj];W[ln];B[lm];W[km];B[mm]TR[ml][lm]C[Ted: This is another poor move.  There is a proverb which says "The empty triangle is bad".  At the very least, N6 would make a better shape.]
;W[mn];B[kl];W[jm];B[jl];W[lh];B[li]C[Ted: I think this move is too small.  Perhaps a move someplace in the top left, or else attacking White in the bottom right corner, might be a better idea right now.]
;W[kh];B[ki];W[ef]C[Ted: This move really makes it difficult for you to reduce White in the top left now.]

(;B[na]C[Ted: I think attacking from the other side is better right now.  White can't make any eyes by playing at O19; if you play S17 it gives White a chance to make a mistake.]
