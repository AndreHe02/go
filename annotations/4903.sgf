C[I was playing as black against a player with more experience than me (I've only been playing for a couple of weeks). He passed in his first turn, either by accident or to give me a handicap. I thought I could take advantage, but I quickly lost that corner. Obviously I need help.

Hi Carpeliam,
my name is Oliver (karthago on IGS) and I will comment your game. Currently I play around 17 kyu.

At first it is nice to start with a small field to get a feeling for capturing and fighting, but please note, that the goal in go is not to catch the other stones, but to make more territory.

My comments will be marked with O:];B[gc];W[tt];B[cd];W[dc]
C[O: This is an invasion move. Your idea is to keep your stones connected, what generally is a good idea!
Since white passed he has to play aggressivly to still be able to win, so you should play securely and keep your stones connected and secure territory.]

(;B[fb]C[I was trying to surround him- in hindsight, I think either B7 would have been better, or tesuji.

O: Yeah, surrounding does not work here, it is hard to surround a group of stones. 
Please look at the variation.

Tesuji means skillfull play
Tenuki means to play somewhere else

I think you meant that];W[eb];B[gb];W[bd]
(;B[ea]C[O: this move doesn't stop White. Please look at the variation.]
;W[da];B[fa];W[bb];B[gf]LB[cf:B][be:A]C[O: here you could also still block at A, although it is gote, he W will not be able to run into your territory.
B is also possible to keep him away from the corner, but the he will most likely play on the other side for example at G3]
;W[dg]
(;B[df];W[cf];B[ce];W[bf];B[be];W[ae]C[o: This is a nice technique of connecting underneath on the first line.]
;B[eg];W[ef];B[de];W[eh];B[fg];W[dh];B[fh];W[hd]
(;B[gd]C[I'm not sure if this connection was really necessary, but it takes me a long time to think ahead right now.

O: reacting was just right! Please look at the variation.];W[gh]

(;B[gg]C[O: this move was wrong, please look at the variation.]
;W[fi];B[hh];W[gi];B[hi];W[ei]
(;B[hg]C[O: you don't have to play this move! I White cuts put him in Atari and kill it. 
You could have killed the whole white group instead, look at the varations!]

[ef]C[As far as territory goes, we were even at 19. I had captured 4, but the komi was 6, so he won 25 to 23. Clearly I could have played better in the top left corner, and I think I should have been able to get more territory in the bottom right corner as well- any assistance would be great!

O: Your play was ok, just focus more on making territory instead of trying to kill. 

You made mistakes in the top left corner and the bottom right, but those i explained to you. 

Maybe watch a few games from the GTL and learn from them, or play vs somebody who can explain a bit more to you. I think you will get into it fast and thus be able to think further ahead.

(;B[fi]C[O: there is nothing, that white can do.
So the white move was wrong in the first place and should have been on F1.
It would have been 30-20 for you without komi!

As you can see now, it is not horrible, that he made the connection up to the top, since you could block him better on the side.]
;W[cg]))
(;B[ei];W[gd]C[This would be terrible for B! The top group has only 3 liberties, while the bottom group only has 2!
--> At least one, if not both groups are going to die.

Please also remember, that you did not loose a point by reacting (one less point of territory but one more prisoner), only you did not gain sente, which does not make a huge difference here.]
))
(;B[cf]TR[gf]C[O: This shoulder hit ( a move diagonally to the opposing stone) helps you to confine white in the corner, especially with the help of the triangled stone]
;W[cg];B[bf]C[o: This move make the connection to the top impossible. Now white has to react and make a living shape. while you can try to attack it. 
Please note, that the top is not safe yet, because there are no two eyes, yet and you still have the forcing move of C9 to either make him connect at D8 or give up the D9 stone.]

(;B[be]C[O: this move is better. Remember: you cannot easily catch that group and kill it.]
;W[bc];B[cf]))
(;B[bc]C[O: you can hane (place a stone on the diagonally on the head of his group) on this side to make his territory smaller and put him under pressure.]

(;W[bd];B[be];W[bb];B[ad]C[O: as you can see, he cannot cut your hane.]

(;W[bb];B[bd];W[gb];B[hc]C[one possible continuation])))
(;B[cc]TR[gc]C[O: you could also try to keep W from the side. If W wants to run along your stones, you make territory and he will gain nothing, because your triangle stone is on the 3-3 point (San-San) it is hard to attack it, and you don't have to worry too much.
If W plays like in this variation, you would have a won game.]

;W[da];B[hd];W[he];B[hc];W[gf];B[fg]C[this move is securing territory in the bottom, so white will have to fight for a living.
As a conclusion, it would be better for white to play his first move on the bottom]
