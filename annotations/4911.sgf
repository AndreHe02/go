RE[W+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game. This game shows two of the problems that appear in a lot of my games:

1) My opponents' attacks seem to work well, while mine go badly wrong.
2) Every time my opponents play a move that's unfamiliar to me, I have no idea how to respond.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger

JS: Reviewer: Juergen Suntinger (KGS Nick: Juergonaut). Dear Ted Schuerzinger, in this review every commentary by me begins with my initials JS. If you have further questions do not hesitate to leave me a private message at KGS to discuss.]
FG[259:]PM[2];B[pd];W[jj];B[pq];W[jl];B[qk]LB[qo:A]C[Ted: I figured the best thing to do was to develop naturally, as though White 2 and White 4 were in the other two (empty) corners. The Chinese fuseki works for my opponents, but I never seem to get a good position out of it.

JS: My feeling about the Chinese Fuseki is, that it wants to build a moyo. Black generally wants that White invades the lower right side, because then he naturally gets a strong attack on the invasion stones. But when there is already a very strong White group in the center, then the invasion can very easyly escape and is not reluctant to become heavy so easily.

JS: One general advise is that when your opponen builds up strength, then you should do the same and not get too greedy to play the "big" points. So instead of the low Chinese fuseki I would advise you to make a shimari at the lower right corner by playing at 'a'. Just think about how few points the two White stones in the center will make, and how big your corner can become, when you make a Shimari.]
;W[lk];B[dd]C[Ted: I wonder if I shouldn't have played closer to either Q16 or Q3. But I've never had an opponent play like this before.]
;W[li];B[jc]LB[fd:A]C[Ted: I figured I was liable to get a goot position either on the right side or on the top.

JS: I cannot say, that Black's position is bad because White is overconcentrated at the center, but I would prefer to play more solidly by an extension from the starpoint at 'a'. There is also the concept of balance in the game of go. The balance between territory and influence. If either side gets much more of either territory or influence, then one should take a break and think about what is going to happen. In this position White has a very thick group in the center which's influence radiates all over the board. So Black has to do something against it. Playing wide extensions on the 3rd line is very territory orientatet, but Black has already more territory than White, so you do not have to crush your opponent, but simply win by 5 to 10 points. 

JS: Playing at 'a' stabilises the upper right corner. Notice that the move at 'a' is on the 4th line. A move on the 4th line is not very likely to beeing pressed down, because this would become too much territory and so the influence of the center stones is neutralised somehow.]
;W[jg];B[cq]C[Ted: I don't know if taking the last corner is a good idea, but I did.

I picked the 3-3 point partly to be different from what I had done in the other corners, and partly to ensure that I was going to get some territory here. I figured I was doing well as it is.

JS: I cannot say that Black is really in a bad position, but when your opponent is a good fighter, then he will probably win. Here the 3-3 point is going to secure the territory in the corner by one move, but this move has also drawbacks as you can see in the next  variation.]

(;W[qc]LB[jc:A][qk:B]C[Ted: I could look at this for a long time, and not be able to give a good answer as to whether responding at Q17 or R16 is better.

JS: Basically it is better to block at the wider side, because then you will make more territory with it. So when I look at the stones at 'a' and 'b', then the one at 'b' is the one which is by one intersection more far away. So I would tend to block this invasion at R16.]
;B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[pe];W[qe];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[rg]
(;B[of];W[mc]C[Ted: Now I'm stuck with thickness that won't do me any good.

JS: Your opponent played inside your sphere of influence, so you have to make some profit from it. This White stone is very easy to attack, if not even likely to be killed. Look at the variation.]

(;B[gc]C[Ted: I didn't think I needed to respond on the right just yet, and figured that if I did, it would be gote. So I decided to take some territory, but after seeing White's next move, I think I made a mistake.

JS: This move is much too soft. It doesnt take use of your thickness at the right side. Look at the variations.]
;W[qh]C[JS: Important turning point.];B[pg];W[ph];B[oh];W[ng]
;B[og];W[qn]C[Ted: If White had played at Q5 or R5, I would have known what to do, but this is yet another unfamiliar move to me.

JS: Normally Black is going to secure the corner after the wide approach move. R2 is the most natural move and involves no complications.]

(;B[pi]C[Ted: In hindsight, I think this was a mistake. I think I should have tried P9, making White do something with the R6 stone and giving me an opportunity to connect to the top group.]
;W[qi];B[pj];W[qq]
(;B[pp]C[Ted: Should I have played R2 instead?

JS: Yes, this move makes it too simple for your opponent, look at the variation for one of the joseki.]
;W[qp]LB[po:A]C[JS: Shape wise the move at 'A' is the only move Black has to think about in this situation. Regardless what is elsewhere on the board, you should not give White the Chance to play here.]

(;B[mq]C[Ted: This sequence goes badly for me, but what else am I supposed to do? End up with worthless thickness like I did in the top right?]
;W[po];B[oo];W[pr];B[or]C[Ted: I figured that it wouldn't work for White to atari at either P3 or P4 since I had R2 still.]
;W[on];B[no];W[nn];B[mo];W[oi]LB[pm:A]C[JS: Now you have to start to think, why this loose ladder was not working for you and how you could have made it work. The answer is Kikashi. Just think about Black plays some kind of peep at 'a' before doing anything else, will White answer by connecting? Probably yes. Lets look at some variations]

(;B[ni];W[oj]
(;B[nf]C[Ted: I originally planned to play a net here at O9, but realized that White could respond with Q9, putting my stones in atari. I have to figure out a way to get two eyes for my group in the top right.]
;W[nj];B[mg];W[mi];B[nh];W[kc];B[jd];W[kd];B[ke];W[le]LB[lf:A]
C[JS: Do not threaten from playing a double hane at 'a', you are going to be cut anyway, but this way white has less liberties and is very likely to have a hard time lifing.]

(;B[kf];W[lf];B[lg];W[kg];B[je];W[oc]
(;B[pb]C[Ted: I wonder if I should have played P18 instead, but I can't read the position out to determine whether Black can stop White from getting two eyes.

JS: Q18 seems to be the only move to attack White because it gives her the fewest number of forcing moves while keeping the white groups separated. Also in terms of endgame White lost many points in the upper right corner.]
;W[ob];B[kb]C[Ted: This shape worked well for White in the bottom right, but doesn't seem to work so well for me....]
;W[lb];B[ld];W[lc];B[md];W[nd];B[me];W[jb];B[ib];W[ka];B[hb]
LB[ib:A]C[Ted: I think I got the worse of this exchange, as I get more thickness that doesn't actually do anything for me.

JS: In this situation you should not worry about the single stone at 'a'. Just think about what White can do if you tenuki to play an other big point on the board.]
;W[qb];B[pa];W[cf]C[Ted: Now I don't see how the group at the top can get much territory.]
;B[ch]C[Ted: Attacking has worked for my opponent, but here it goes wrong for me, too.]
;W[ef];B[cd];W[cj]TR[ch]C[Ted: Now I can't find any way to save the C12 stone. I guess I should have let White jump down into the corner instead of playing C16, but that looks like it loses a bunch of territory for me, too.]
;B[cl];W[dk];B[dl];W[bh];B[ek];W[ej];B[fk];W[fj];B[gk];W[eq]
;B[gq]C[Ted: I didn't see how White could get a good position out of this, but sure enough, White does.]
;W[iq]
(;B[go]C[JS: This move is too thin, You can only attack from a strong position. The one point jump itself is very strong, but if pincered from two sides white can connect his stones like your opponent has showed you :-). Look at the variation.]
;W[eo];B[co];W[gr];B[hr];W[hq];B[fr];W[gp];B[fq];W[fp];B[hp]
LB[er:A]C[JS: Cutting is simply not possible here, the only thing you can do now is to connect your stones with the move at 'a', but then White has managed to make very good shape which should be winning the game.]
;W[er];B[gs];W[ir]C[Ted: Here I realized that I've got *another* dead group, so I resigned.

JS: Most mistakes (I am also prune to do) are to play too greedy which means to want to have the whole area of the board, or at least much more than a little bit more than your opponent has. The aim of the game is not to crush your opponent, but to have a few points more than him (Which means that you have to count the points of the board before you make important decisions, but first you have to get the basic tactics right). You showed it in the fuseki, where your opponent played some strange moves and you started to throw some stones everywhere on the sides very far away. Such positions are crying for  invasions.

JS: I hope my review will help you getting stronger. Have a lot of interesting games :-), JÃ¼rgen Suntinger.]

(;B[gp]C[JS: This move is called Iron Pillar, although it looks very slow, it has absolutely no defects and so one of the two stones of your opponent will die.]

(;B[nk];W[pk];B[qj];W[ok]))
(;B[pm]C[JS: Powerful Kikashi (means forcing move). Kikashis are very powerfull moves, but they only show their strength, when they are played out before you initiate some other sequences which are going to take use of it, because later on White maybe play in a different way, than he has to play now ... .]

(;W[pn]C[JS: Does the ladder work if White answers?];B[ni];W[oj]
;B[nk];W[pk];B[qj];W[ok];B[ol]C[JS: Yes the powerfull Kikashi would have saved your life in some kind of sense.]
)
(;C[JS: But White has not only the option of connecting his stones, so lets investigate some more variations.]
;W[qm]C[JS: This is the second move which comes to mind for White.]
;B[pn];W[qo];B[pl]LB[oi:B][nn:A]C[JS: But Black simply ataris and pulls Back, whick makes Miai of capturing the stones at 'a' or the stone at 'b'. So tactical reading is one of the most important things in the game of go.]
)))
(;B[po];W[qo];B[lq]C[JS: Much better than in the game, but White is going to come back to make the game even, because as you see he is invading everything, and has no problems because you ar making it to easy for him :-).]

(;B[qp]LB[qn:A]C[JS: If White now starts moveing with his 'A' stone, then you can simply keep your pincer stone at R9 connected.]
;W[pm];B[ol];W[om];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj]LB[oi:B][ol:A]C[JS: The move at 'a' secures, that the cut at 'A' is not working for White.]
))
(;B[ld]C[JS: I cannot see one way for White to make a base, so White has to escape into the center if possible.]
;W[md];B[me]C[JS: But Black simply keeps White inside his Sphere of influence. Note that Black is going to have the much better cards in this area when White is initiating a fight.]

(;W[le];B[lc];W[ne];B[mf];W[nf];B[ng]C[JS: No way to escape.]
)
(;W[lc];B[kc];W[ne];B[mf];W[nf];B[ng];W[le];B[kd];W[mg];B[lf]
;W[og];B[nh];W[pg];B[pf]LB[nd:B][ke:A][ph:C]C[JS: Also no way to escape. Now Black has Miai of captureing at 'a' or 'b' to secure his important three cutting stones and the aji around 'c' to not loose one of his other groups. It is always good to read such sequences out before you play such sharp where it is likely that some of your key stones are going to be captured.]
)))
(;B[qh]LB[pf:A]C[JS: It is much better to protect the cut at 'A' indirectly by extending. Note that White is not going to keep on pushing on the second line, because it is only one point worth each time, but the wall White get's is worth much more. It is important to see, that the this cut is not ladder dependent as White can capture in a net.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[pg];B[oh]))
(;B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]C[JS: This is the standard joseki which mostly follow after an invasion at the 3-3 point. Now White has not so good invasion points.]
))
(;W[dp];B[cp];W[do];B[er];W[gp];B[bn];W[dl]C[JS: See how easy your opponent can reduce the corner while building much more powerful influence and works quite well with the some how overconcentrated White stones in the center. So Black is not paying attention to the balance of power. Just think about, that Black is already somehow ahead at secure territory, than he shuldn't give White the chance to come back to game. In the future you will enjoy giving the corner to your opponent while getting a powerfull wall.]
