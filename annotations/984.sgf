(;W[jp]C[This move may leave too much room. See variations for alternatives.

DRS: Personally, I prefer K4.  K4 is flexible: you may end up with nice territory, and if not, you're likely to end up using F3 as a light stone to aid a 3-3 invasion at C3.  J4 and J3 almost beg B to play E3, which demands F4.  F4 with J3 or J4 is overconcentrated.  B E3, W F4 would make ideal shape with K4, so B doesn't E3 if K3 typically.]
;B[qn];W[pl];B[qq]
(;W[pq]C[Should probably block in the other direction to separate the black stones.

DRS: I disagree.  Kombillo shows 12 games where a pro played Q3, and one game where a pro played R4.  The R4 game was one where W was better on the top than the bottom, which isn't the case here.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[rm]C[DRS: Kombillo shows 12 pros playing R2, and no other possiblities.  Kogo's says R2 or R5 are both good.]

(;W[jd]C[Tenuki may be amitious as the corner is not stable yet.

DRS: K16 is a huge point.  Q6 does help W's wall on the bottom right.  If W wants K16, W will probably have to be prepared to allow Q8 to be sliced off in order to step off some 6th line territory - not good for Q8 of course, but great territory.  B doesn't get all that much by slicing off Q8 since the upper right is friendly to W.  K16 is huge because it's an extension from both D17 and Q16, and because it works so well with B's Chinese fuseki.]
