C[Dear reviewer,

In this game I played white and won by 0.5 points, but I feel it was only because my opponent played softly and did not punish me on my mistakes. I appreciate any comments and suggestions about my play. Thank you for your time!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[id];W[po]C[Should this have been around R14 instead? Black's 3-4 stone looked inviting.]
;B[pl]
(;W[oq]C[I was really uncertain about this. Outside seemed like a safe choice. Also played here because of D4 stone, but I don't know if that playes any role here.

MR: This is one possibility. Of course D4 should play a role in your evaluation of the situation - because of the white stones on the left side I would prefer to find a variation where white ends up with outside thickness respectively with a white wall to the left side.
The variation shows an often played joseki in this situation, however it does not end with white outside thickness.]

(;W[mr]C[This seems like a stupid move to me now. Something like J4 or F3 perhaps?

MR: To me the move does not look stupid. It completes the white wall to the left side. Maybe the move is a bit slow for now. However, when you play J4 or F3, you need to be prepared to allow black to crawl on the bottom right.]
;B[qn]C[Fortunately Black decided to play safe.];W[ip]C[Is this OK?

MR: Yes. Alternative would be D6, but this would invite black to invade the lower side, so it depends on whites willingness and skill in fighting.]
;B[ck]
(;W[ci]C[Don't know if the direction of the approach was right. I thought the upper group needed some strengthening and since something like C7 would not have secured the corner yet, this seemed like a better choice.

MR: To me this feels like "wrong direction". See variation.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fq];B[ej];W[nc]C[Is the timing and point of invasion OK?

MR: Timing is fine. The point is a bit questionable, as it allows black to play pincer and extension at the same time with M17. I would prefer L17 or R14.]
;B[kc]C[MR: Should be M17.];W[qf];B[pf];W[qc]C[MR: If you want to invade the corner you should do this without the R14, Q14 exchange.]
;B[qe];W[pc];B[qg];W[pi]C[Don't know about this one...

MR: Looks strange to me. The shape point for invasion is R10.]
;B[ko];W[in]C[I was afraid of the center starting to look too black]
;B[kq];W[mn];B[km]
(;W[kn]C[This cut seems premature as it got me into all sorts of trouble.

MR: Yes. Black L3 is asking for fighting as it seperates the two white groups. On the other hand, white is stronger than black on both sides, In addition, chasing out black will *automatically* destroy any black center moyo - that you were afraid of some moves ago.]

That's it. In the end I was happy to win, but it felt like losing, since I only won because my opponent did not cash on my mistakes. Thank you for your comments and time!

MR: In most games it is - also - because of the mistakes of the opponent that one wins. So I would not mind on this.

You played quite well in the game.
The main mistake was, in my opinion, L6. This caused a lot of trouble for you. Black was weak before L6 and was strong after catching the four stones around N6. The fight was "too much for you". As you commented correctly, black could even have captured your right side group. 
The variation given in the comment is one natural flow. After which - as in the game - you are (nearly) connected with your single stone on the right side, and there is less black territory than in the game on the left side.]
