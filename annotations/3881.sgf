C[Hi my name is Matt and this is a game that a friend and I played on Thursday January 6, 2006.  I am white in this game and my friend is black.  We are unsure of our ratings because we have never been rated so I'm just guessing his and my rankings could you please, along with commenting, Tell us what you think our ranks are at the end of the game.  Thanks in advance for taking the time to comment on our game.

E: I will comment for both.  I do not feel I can judge your ratings from a game.  Maybe the ones listed with this game are correct, or maybe they are a little higher than I would expect.  Ratings are only a general description, and do not decribe how two particular players will balance.  

E: My suggestion: If you are only playing each other then add a handicap to the winning player for each 3 wins in a row.  If you play others, you will determine your ratings soon enough.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[pj];W[co]C[E: Chinese opening by black, lots of influence. W has territory in bottom left.]
;B[iq];W[nd]LB[nc:A]C[This was too close wasn't it?

E: No, this is a very good approach. A is good as well.];B[md]
LB[ld:A][pf:B]C[E: This is an extremely aggressive response. Too close. Princer at A, or extension at B are better.]

(;W[pc]LB[nc:A]C[E:  I like A better.  Generally, if your oponent attaches a stone to yours, attach a stone as well.]
;B[od];W[oc];B[nc];W[mc];B[ne]C[Instead of taking that piece should black have split my groups at o18?

E: I like B's move, though both are OK.  Look at the great influence B has toward his other stones.]
;W[nb];B[lc]LB[qc:A]C[E: Corner is not settled, A is urgent.]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[qd]C[E: White has corner. B should now work to make corner small.]
;B[qe]C[E: Good.];W[rd];B[re];W[nd]C[W: Too small, save for end of game.]
;B[le]C[Is black being too defensive?

E: No, this is a very good move by B. B now radiates enourmous influence toward bottom and left.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[of]
(;B[qc]TR[oe][of]C[E: probably better to attack the cutting stones.]
;W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[ob]TR[pb][qb][qc]C[E: W is safe, B's attacking group is dead.]
;B[nc]LB[fc:C][cf:D][df:E][pg:A][qg:B][cj:G][dj:F]C[E: This is not helpful to B.  Attacking cutting stones is more profitable, plus there are many big moves on the board.]
;W[qf];B[nd]C[E: ?? B appears to be abandoning right side to save a single stone.]
;W[se];B[pf];W[rf]C[E: W connects around the edge, very good. B loses  territory.]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[rh];W[sf];B[ph];W[oh]LB[hc:C][oh:B][dj:D][dq:A]
[gq:E]C[Where should white have played next?  I was a little unsure of where I should play.

E: W has ladder blocker A, so cutting group is still OK.  B extends group and threatens to keep Black small on side.  Plenty of big moves to play too.]
;B[og]
(;W[ng]C[E: Mistake by W.];B[nf];W[nh]LB[gc:A][cj:B]C[Should white abandon those stones and go somewhere else, if so where?

E: After the mistake, these W stoens are weak. How about A or B?]
;B[sh]C[E: Too small.];W[cj]LB[gc:A][hc:B][np:C]C[I played this because I needed more time to think.  Any suggestions about where to play?

E: This is a very good move.  When in doubt, tenuki. A or B looks large. C to approach corner.]
;B[nj];W[lg];B[mh];W[mg];B[kg];W[lh];B[mi];W[kh]LB[ki:A]C[E: A is a better extensios.]
;B[jg];W[oi]LB[pi:B][jj:C][oj:A]TR[lg][mg][ng][kh][lh][nh][oh]
C[E: Threatens to cut at A or B.  Good but, I'd rather settle the dragon, which is in danger.  Perhaps C.]
;B[pi];W[oj];B[ok];W[mj];B[li];W[ni];B[nk];W[kj]C[This is a mistake I should have played at m10 right.]
;B[lj];W[mk];B[lk];W[jh];B[ih];W[kk];B[ml];W[ig];B[kf];W[ii]
;B[hh];W[hi];B[hg];W[if];B[hf];W[lf];B[ke];W[gf];B[ie]TR[if]
[ig]C[Odd I though.

E: Captures stones and creates a good eye.  Might be too small.]
;W[gh];B[jf]C[E: Not needed.

E: Though attacking, W's dragon is safe and can escape to left.  Both unsettled corners have 3-3 invasion open.]
;W[gg];B[jj];W[ji];B[jk];W[jl];B[km];W[ik];B[in];W[qq]TR[pj]
[nk][ok][ml][km][in][iq]C[Is the 3-3 appropiate here?

E: This is good. B has influence toward center, but W can take some small territory.]
;B[fp]C[E: responding to invasion is bigger.];W[fq];B[qo]LB[qp:B]
[pq:A]C[E: ?? Why not A or B?];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr]

;B[po];W[np];B[mq];W[lq];B[mp];W[lp];B[mo];W[jq]C[E: WIth unorthodox play by both, W might attach to left corner.]
;B[lo];W[jp];B[jo];W[ip];B[hp];W[hq];B[ir]TR[iq]SQ[kp][kq]C[E: B stones are dead. Bamboo joint is a solid connection.]
;W[hr];B[jr];W[kr];B[io];W[gp];B[ho];W[fo];B[go];W[ep];B[il]
;W[hl];B[im];W[gn];B[kl];W[ij];B[hm];W[gm];B[gd]C[E: With size of W territory on left, game is decided.]
;W[fd];B[gc];W[fc];B[sg];W[sd];B[sb];W[qa];B[cc]C[Is there a way to kill this black stone since I have sorrounding white stones?

E: I do not beleive so, but it also does not matter.];W[cd]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[bc]LB[fb:A]C[E: Better to keep B group small with A.]
;B[fb];W[db];B[cb];W[bb];B[da];W[gb];B[fe];W[ed];B[hb];W[ge]
;B[hd];W[he];B[ga]C[E: Only prevents a ko threat, not needed.]

;W[cg]C[please feel free to comment on any moves that are wierd or wrong or even good.  Thank you again for reviewing my game.

E: W consistantly got the best of the fighting to capture stones.  Both should look for larger moves more focused on territory than capturing stones.  Use influence to do this after a fight by extending from your strong walls.  It may be true that white won because W was more willing to allow stones to be captured.

E: Please do email me if you have questions on my comments.]
