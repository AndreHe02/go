C[(black first time using winmgt) Hi, I´m Jorge, just a poor igs 14k*, and even I won this game and both of us did great mistakes, I would like to be commented a few situations, of course you are free to comment others, thank you very much in advance

14k igs is already not a poor player!
i'll try my best as a poor 7k igs who was once a 6k igs!
danTheKyu];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]C[cannot be a mistake so far!]
;B[ce]C[ok];W[cg]TR[dp]C[white's move makes sense, it forces black to either flee in the center or to establish itself in the corner
it seems logical since d4 is  white but in fact it might be wrong given the word of caution explained by ishida in his dictionnary see var 1 & var2 next]

(;B[ee]C[this is a common way to play]
(;W[fc]C[ white's actual play is sub optimal
but i do not know how to take advantage of it
(i'm poor 7k igs!)];B[dh]C[ok, you know your josekis];W[cd]
C[& so does white!]
(;B[cf]C[this is not joseki,]
(;W[ch]C[probably the right answer];B[dg]C[seems ok];W[ci];B[ck]
C[now this seems dangerous for black who can be split in 2 by white
in fact, on second thought, it may be a good way to play
someone stronger than me should be asked];W[di];B[cn]
(;W[co]C[seems natural, but black bottom group settles too easily]
;B[dn];W[fp]TR[ck]C[black is going to miss a first chance to master the pace of the game
the continuation shows that black delta, given this continuation, was not that bad!]

(;B[ej]C[this is really an attack on white, but coming from the stronger of the 2 groups, or i should say, it weakens the weaker group]
;W[ei]C[black's upper group needs reinforcement NOW
this will also enable the attack to go on vs white's group whereas deserting is going to cost you more]

(;B[qj]C[(black) was the left group settled enough to be left and take advantage elsewhere even being me a conservative player? is R10 a good movement to that?

Answer :i believe that this is a good exemple of the difference between big moves (r10 is certainly this) & an urgent move ie settling your 2 groups which are divided by a white group that has some strength]
;W[eg]C[good];B[ef];W[fg]C[given white's move, black should not push

2nd comment; pushing now will be the cause for your troubles in the center
helping the other to reinforce himself WITHOUT any advantage for you is always bad]

(;B[eh];W[fh];B[df];W[fj];B[ge];W[hd]
(;B[he]C[(black) was H15 such a bad move as I think? my only aim was to escape, but I saw me soon blocaded!
here again you push while reinforcing the other];W[ie]C[(black) now there is a "strange" conbination just to escape to the botton, i don´t know if there is an easiest way and i was always thinking if i were able to make a little life without having to escape

when you can, you should ALWAYS try to escape vs living small]

(;B[gd];W[hc];B[gc];W[gb];B[hb];W[fb]
(;B[id];W[ic]
(;B[jd];W[je];B[kd];W[ib]
(;B[if]C[you are not going to capture the 2 white groups, so it is not interesting]
;W[jf];B[ig];W[jg];B[ih];W[jh];B[ii];W[ji];B[gi];W[fi]
(;B[mc]TR[id][jd][kd]C[(black) yes, it´s a big mistake to let white to play J10, but "forgeting" it, was N17 such an important movement to surround the center white group and to secure the upper side or it wasn´t necessary?

n 17 is big but avoiding to loose the center is urgent
and on top of that, n 17 is mainly passive, to help delta group, without really endangering white one]
;W[ij];B[hj];W[gg]C[hum!];B[hg];W[hk];B[ik];W[jj];B[gk];W[hl]
;B[gj];W[fk]C[(black) now it was for me a very important movement, too much for me, i had to think about if i were alive inside, if i has to continue escaping and if a was able to attack some of the tree white groups that surround my one, finally I choose to escape and threatening the left one try to capture the two white stones, what a hell should i did?]
;B[gl]C[probably the sound move (i would have played it myself)
escaping is generally better than living (or trying to live!) small
but do not think so much about capturing others];W[fl];B[gm]
C[ok];W[fm]
(;B[fn]C[(black) I don´t like the situation on the little left black group, but what should i did?
you are not going to link, do you think it is worthwhile to close white's group?]
;W[en];B[eo];W[em];B[do];W[fo];B[gn]C[(black) it was an automatic movement, but now i´m not sure, there is a lot of posibilies to keep running meanwhile invading courner, what should i did?
(black) here i have had some problems with the use of the program, I hope it works ...
ok white is surrounded, but you have 2 groups which are not alive!
maybe you were helped by white who did not play optimally]

 juan 14k*:  ???????????

(black) it´s really too much cobardy?, i had been enoughly bad to let white to almost connect all and i think that now that i as winning it was time to secure

it is not the worst move in the game apart from losing an opportunity to kill white
but if you did not see you HAD to play b15 first, then it makes sense to live before doing some thing else]
;W[im];B[hm];W[jm];B[lj]C[(black) well, now i start to play very conservative, but in spite now i have seen my brother doesn´t like, i think it is right, or i have been too much cobard?]
