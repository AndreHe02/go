Hi,
My name is Peter.  I will add [PL\] before all of my comments, so you can see where I start.
My personal strength is large scale strategies, I'm not very strong at calculating complex positions.  You talk about aji.  Since strong positions (walls, live groups, ...) are very important, I will start with the following that an 8 dan pro told me once:

First connect.
If you cannot connect, live.
After you've achieved either of both, you can start attacking.

I will refer to this comment during the game from time to time.  Also, I will tell you how white could've played better.  That way, you will also learn the strengths and weaknesses of white's structures.  This way, during the games, you can learn to estimate if you, or your opponent, is in a better position.]
;B[qd]C[I think I'm a little stronger than 28k.  I am 15k on KGS, but usually only about 20k on IGS; strange huh?  Anyways, I guess the main problems I have seen come up in my games is how I often miss alot of important moves, so this is what i would like to focus on for this review.  Also If you see any territory I should have killed or likewise that which my opponent should have killed please point that out as well.  My aji isn't the best and I often miss alot of things.   Any help or advice on joseki and ending is appreciated as well.

Thanks for your time,

[fa:B][cb:A]C[Interesting move.  What would be the best way to respond here?  A?

[PL\]
yes.  See variation.

white is playing much too agressively here.  We will see later that your response (B) is also correct, and that he knows this as well.]

(;B[fa]C[[PL\]
This is more agressive, but playable.];W[ca]LB[da:A][cb:B]TR[ea]
C[[PL\]
White knows he cannot play at 'a'.  If he does, you play at 'b' and capture white.  This proves that the triangled move was too agressive from white.]

(;B[ce]C[[PL\]
This move is very agressive.  It leaves a lot of problems, that white later abuses.  See variations for one calmer response, and one more agressive one.]

[PL\]

(;B[jc]C[[PL\]
This is fairly safe, but rather small.  In the variation, I show you another move that makes it all a bit bigger.]

(;B[fq]
(;W[dn]LB[hq:A]C[If he was to play A instead of D6 should i give up on the stone or try to save it.  Im thinking i should give up on it as trying to save would most likely result in alot of influence on whites side.

[PL\]
Yes, your conclusion is right.  I show you a joseki in the variation which is normal play.  The joseki gives a lot of influence for white.  This shows that your move was on the wrong side.  Go back 2 moves and check the variations.]
;B[iq]
(;W[qo]TR[fq]C[[PL\]
check the variation to see how white can punish you for your wrong move (triangle)]
;B[op]LB[qm:A]TR[iq]C[[PL\]
Very good move !  This works nicely with the triangled stone, and it threatens 'a' !  You are asking white to react, so you have a free move.]
;W[pl];B[qj]LB[rl:A][qm:B]C[[PL\]
Very good again !  If you can later play 'a', then white has no base (or white can jump into the corner and live small while you cut around 'b' for example)

You are keeping up the pressure.  So white will have to run.  When it starts running, you can make your bottom, and your right side, more solid.  This is a very efficient strategy.]
;W[ql]
(;B[qg]LB[oj:B][pj:A]C[Would playing at A or B have been better in this situation?

[PL\]
'A' or 'b' would have been more agressive, and they would've kept the pressure on white.  In one word: they would've been more severe.  See the variation.]
;W[nc]C[[PL\]
White's timing is very good: before you can strengthen, he invades.]

(;B[lc]LB[ne:A]C[Would playing at A have been better than how I played it?

[PL\]
No, because you are building strength towards the middle, but there's already a white group limiting your influence.
Check the variation.];W[ne];B[le];W[ng];B[oi];W[mi];B[nk]LB[qb:A]
C[[PL\]
Very good idea !  This is called a splitting attack, because you keep two weak groups split.  But white isn't really so weak with the top group, because he can do nasty stuff to your (still open) corner, e.g. start with 'a'.]
;W[on];B[lh]LB[le:1][lh:4][oi:2][nk:3]CR[nc][ne][ng][mi]C[Got some nice territory / influence while he was trying to escape.

[PL\]
Where's the influence ?  :-)  See the variation (to the next move) to see how white can eliminate the 'influence' of 1 and 4 in a single move, and build a lot of influence very quickly.  White can also live in the top right corner, and in the bottom right corner, or run away with one or both groups.  He doesn't have too many problems on the right side..

I'm being a bit severe in my comments here, maybe a bit sarcastic.  I'm sorry for that.  I stress that your evaluation is wrong, because I hope this way, you will learn it quickly.]

(;W[lf]LB[kf:B][mf:A]C[What would you have done here?  A to threaten cut and at the same time take a liberty away from whites stone?

[PL\]
cfr. variation.  A is a very agressive move that makes things very complicated.  'b' would be better, cfr. second variation.]

(;B[nh]C[[PL\]
This move is also agressive.  What would you do if white responds as in the variation ?  Better to take it easy.  I usually try to keep games as simple as possible, but to force the opponent to do what I want.  When I'm leading and the game is simple, the opponent has very limited possibilities to come back.]

White has also come out rather easily, as I showed in the variation before.  Now black can use his strength...]
;B[kh];W[qf];B[pf]C[[PL\]
Too agressive.  This is an overplay.  When white would play a crosscut, black is in trouble...  cfr. variation]

(;W[pe];B[qe];W[pd];B[of];W[nf];B[lj]LB[mb:B][mg:A][mk:C]C[Probably should have played A here.  A stronger player would have not let me get away with letting it be.  Also, don't think M10 was necessary quite yet.

[PL\]
The move you played was better.  If you play 'a', then white can play 'b' and have plenty of room for eyes.  Or white can just run out (FIRST connect...) by playing m10 himself, or 'c'.
Because black cannot yet kill white, your move (contain) was better.]

;W[ed]TR[oc][pc][nd][od]C[[PL\]
I think white is right in his estimation that his group is alive: the triangles show a live shape, and there's some potential on the side as well (just in case).  He can now use some forcing moves to build up his left side...]
;B[mf]C[Saw that he had a good potential of forming at least 1 eye at the top so decided to trade.  Kept sente though.]

(;B[ob]LB[oc:A]C[With A, I could have made that into 1 eye then probably contained/keep him from forming another.  How would it out had I played A?

Hm, I think white would've lived.  See variation !

You're focussing too hard on trying to kill white, while it seems rather impossible, or at least *very*very* difficult.  This will be very hard.  See the second variation for more interesting ideas.]

What are some other major points I could play instead of this?

C[Another wasted move.];W[oa]
(;B[mb]C[[PL\]
Only now it becomes really a wasted move.  You could've played the variation below, to build your structure, or invaded.  Suppose white takes your two stones (cfr variation)]
;W[mc];B[kb];W[go]C[[PL\]
White is playing a very strong move now.  This is the idea that I have mentioned before: he is pressurizing your stones, and enlarging his influence at the same time.]
;B[cj]LB[ch:B][cm:A]TR[kd][ke][kf][kg][kh][lh][lj]C[This turned out to be far more dangerous than I thought It would be.

[PL\]
It's not really that dangerous: you can try to expand with 'a' or 'b', and if it doesn't work out, run towards your influence in the centre (triangles)

'A' is best, by the way, because it's a very weak point in white's structure: you can easily enter deeper if he doesn't react.]
;W[dk]C[How would you respond to whites

[PL\]
This is another very strong move by white.  If you lost this game, don't worry, your opponent is a very strong one.  This is good, because he helps me in telling you how to play better, so you learn more ;-)]
;B[dj]LB[bh:H][ch:F][ci:E][di:C][dj:D][ck:A][bl:B][cl:G]C[Wasn't sure how to address whites attack.  What would you have done?  I dont like fighting for life in small areas so tried to flee to my other stones.  Turned out ok in this situation but could have been bad had he played correctly.

[PL\]
Your reaction is a good one.  There's other possible ways to react (by trying to live on the side, for example), but yours is easiest to understand.  And as you may know by now, I like easy moves !  Let's take a look at the rest...]
;W[ek]C[[PL\]
Quite agressive by white !];B[ej]C[[PL\]
solid reaction.  You're playing this sequence quite well !]
;W[ck]C[[PL\]
White is making his corner solid, and big.  Another good move.]
;B[fd]C[[PL\]
This is big, but a bit early.  In the variation, I show what white can do...]

(;W[gq]TR[go]SQ[cj][dj][ej]C[[PL\]
White is playing agressively, but he's right: there's many possibilities for white, because black didn't reinforce after the triangled move.

For black, not reinforcing was a strategically good move: the reduction (rectangles) is very big, and you handle the problems at the bottom well.]
;B[gr]
(;W[hq]LB[hr:A]C[I think he should have played A in this situation.

[PL\]
See variation !];B[hr];W[io];B[hp];W[gp];B[ip]C[[PL\] You're playing this very solidly.  Good !]
;W[dq];B[rm]C[[PL\]
This is very agressive, but I like the idea.  Did you play this to sacrifice this stone ?  If so, great !

What you're doing here is exactly the idea that I've mentioned a couple of times already.  It's a forcing move.  He will react, and because of his reaction, you can get profit somewhere else.

(if you're trying to kill, I'm sorry, it will probably not work: white can run out too easily)]

[PL\]
Your defense was alright.  'a' or 'b' would've been agressive, and would maybe get him into problems.  see variation.
I think white plays the best move by taking simple profit (he's reducing your territory), and he's strengthening his weak group at the same time.]

[PL\]
I hate to say it, but your groups aren't connected.  In order to connect, check the variation to this move.]

(;W[bj]C[[PL\]
white is being gentle here.  He's played much more agressive before.

Let's take a look at the current status:
Black:
- lower right: between 25-30 points
- right side: just over 30
- top side: probably something like 15 points
- prisoners: 5

White:
- bottom left: about 25
- currently just over 10
- 2 groups at right side: just under 10 points
- prisoners: 5
- komi: 6.5

I'm not saying that, at your level, you should be able to count the game status.  But I'm using this to show you the current situation.  Black has about 75 points, and white has something like 55, so you're leading.

Since white is playing a gentle move here, if you don't make any mistakes, you should win.  Let's see what happens...]
;B[bi];W[bk];B[eh]LB[ci:B][gj:A]SQ[kd][ke][kf][kg][kh][ej]C[A  probably would have been better, right?

[PL\]
No, your move was perfect !  Suppose white wants to be nasty and plays 'b', then the stone you just played is perfectly placed to stop him.  Also if he tries to complicate things (cfr variation).  And all the rectangled stones work together nicely: you've made your weak group wider, which starts looking a bit like a (very thin) wall facing a (very strong) wall.]

(;W[ch];B[ci];W[fi]C[I almost ignored this move.  Would have been bad. :(]
;B[ei]TR[ff][gh][fk]C[[PL\]

Other big points are:
- 'a' takes a territory on the side
- 'b' rescues the stone, which is a reduction
- and 'c' of course, which you found yourself before.];W[gm]

*ouch*];W[fp];B[ep];W[eo];B[en];W[do];B[ro]LB[lp:A]C[Again I think A was an important move I missed.

Well this is where he resigned.


[PL\]
Okay, here's the summary.

- White played a lot of very strong strategical moves.  I advise you to review the game at least once, to only look at the large strategy.  Don't spend too much time calculating the position.  Just focus on white and black's structures, and how white makes its structures bigger, and how I suggest you can stop him, or how I suggest you can make yours bigger.
- Your strength is more in calculating complex situations.  This is good !  If you practice, you will find this is can be advantage: if you build a large framework and the opponent must invade, you can sometimes out-calculate him and win.  When you play more, your calculation strength will also continue going up, so no reason to worry about this for the time being.
- maybe you handled both white groups a bit roughly.  In both cases, I got the impression you were trying to kill.  It's enough to let him live small, and to take a lot of profit yourself.  Cool down, it's just a game :-)

So, a good game, and a deserved win.  But work on your large-scale strategy, and I think you will find your level will go up.  Now, your calculation strength is unfocussed, but if you manage to focus it on a strong game plan, you will become quite a lot stronger, and hopefully, quickly.



Take care,

Threaten white a bit, let him live small (just like above), then take profit.

I've also pointed out some variations on the top side that would have enabled you to build a bit of a structure.  Also *very* important is an invasion into white's left side.  These three ideas will help you construct territory for yourself, and limit the amount of territory the opponent gets.

There's a (very advanced) book on killing that has an example of a player that tries to kill many groups, but fails against stronger players.  The example game in that book shows nicely how that agressive player has to sacrifice position in order to try to kill.  Killing is the most efficient way to win: the opponent has wasted a large number of moves, and you get double points for each stone captured.  But you can't expect such a bonus frequently.  It's a very nice feeling to allow the opponent to live in a small way, but to build influence while he's doing it, and to take profit.  If he spent 15 moves for 2 points (2 eyes) and you spent 15 for 30 points, then you're leading :-)]

This is very complicated, so I've added one example.  White is cut into 3.  One group probably lives in the corner.

Black's triangled stones are in a lot of danger.  For example, after 'a', they can't escape.  So while black is helping his weak stones, white can help his group with the rectangles, possibly doing a lot of damage to black's right side (cfr. continuation).]
