C[wonk: hello, i'm 7k on IGS and i play black.  i just reviewed a game for someone and asked him not to fight so much.  then i played about 10 games like this ;-)  i hope you enjoy looking over my game.]

LB[np:B]C[Playing B would be more solid. With N4 white is given a lot of aji to get away from attacks later.]
;B[mp];W[qf];B[qd];W[qi];B[qo];W[qn];B[pn]TR[pn][qo]C[This way of attacking is not as forceful as you might think. It just leaves white a lot of weak stones (marked with triangles) to attack in order to get shape. Normally it is the player with the weak position who attaches and crosscut in order to slip away in some unexpected direction.]
;W[oo];B[pm];W[oq]TR[mp]C[Now you see why the marked stone was not solid enough.]
;B[qp];W[or];B[nn];W[lq];B[mq];W[mr];B[pr]TR[qn]C[wonk: do i try too much to be fancy? it looks like there is a lot space over on the left, when should i tenuki?

MP: Q2 do not seem to be an urgent move as long as the marked stone is captured.]

;W[cl]TR[cl][dm]C[The marked exchange was dubious I think. Black now both want to save two stones on the lower side and invade the left side which seem to be a litte unreasonable.]
;B[dq];W[fm];B[el];W[ek];B[fl]TR[ek][fm]C[The marked white stones look bad. White should have forced with E3 immediately and then attacked the two black stones directly.]
;W[eq];B[dr];W[er];B[cs];W[ho];B[go];W[gp];B[io];W[hn];B[jr]
;W[kp]C[L2 Would be normal for white here, but life seems impossible for the black stones anyway.]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[jo];W[kq];B[ko];W[hl];B[op]TR[oo][po]C[These white stones are not very important.]
;W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[en]TR[ho][gp][ip]LB[fe:A][dk:B][ej:C]C[I do not see any point in playing here right now since the marked white stones are very strong Black can only hope for some silly mistake. Perhaps A is a good big move in this position. Or in order to get som kind of group B would be the way to fight since it threaten a ladder with C.]
;W[em]C[White E7 was wrong. wG7 would keep black heavy and white would be strong in the center.]
;B[gm]C[Good move];W[dl];B[fn];W[dm]TR[em][fm]C[White should perhaps have played H7. The marked stones are no important because white can recapture if black captures.]
;B[hm];W[in];B[gn]TR[hp]C[White is in trouble now because marked black stone is too important t ogive away.]
;W[jm];B[gl];W[il]LB[im:A][jn:B][jl:C]C[The white stones are not connected. Black A will make B and C miai.]
;B[gj];W[ei]TR[hl][il]C[wonk: i think i am lining up dominoes instead of playing go ;-)

MP: Here black has the chance to capture the marked stones.]

(;B[hi]C[This move is good too.];W[mc];B[kk];W[jk]TR[jk][il]
[jm][in][hp][hq][hr]C[Attacking white is rather pointless since the 3 marked black stones only have three liberties.
On the other hand if black can remove the liberties from white as in the game it could be very efficient.]

(;W[nm];B[nl];W[om];B[ol];W[on];B[no];W[gr]TR[im]C[wonk: i am concerned that i play too much to confuse my opponent. i can see that white's play should be at the triangle (k7), giving black a tough game. instead i get lucky.

MP: I agree :-)];B[im];W[jn];B[pp];W[hs];B[jl];W[hc]C[Now it should be impossible to lose for black.]
;B[fe];W[he]TR[fc][hc][fe][he]LB[gf:A]C[Why invade? You have two weak stones to care about and two weak stones to attack.  Just play at A and wait for white to respond. When your own stones are strong you can invade without worries.]
;B[dh];W[le]C[Now white get the cance to complicate the game.]
;B[lc];W[oc];B[md];W[nd];B[mb];W[nc];B[ld];W[of];B[me];W[ne]
;B[mf];W[gg]C[This is perfect chance for white to turn the game around.]
;B[bj]C[???????];W[bh];B[dk];W[dj];B[ck];W[cj];B[bk];W[bi]TR[bh]
[bi][cj][dj]C[This sequence of moves is a complete loss for black. White is stronger and has more territory while black has got nothing.]
;B[eh]C[The variations seem not to be better. But white still gained from this fight I think.]

(;W[ci];B[es]TR[bj][bk][ck][dk]C[The black stones are captured so black cannot attack the bottom white group. White only need to stay connected.]
;W[fs];B[gq]C[White can probably tenuki without worry as far as I can see. Check the variation.]

;W[ee];B[dc];W[cd];B[cc];W[bc]C[White misreads.];B[bd];W[be]
;B[df];W[ad];B[de]C[Now all black stones are safe again and it should still be a simple game.]
;W[ig]TR[hc][he][gg][ig]C[Why not attack the white stones while you have the cance to do so. The UR corner is small in comparison. If you attack in sente you will probably have time to play in the UR corner later anyway.]

;B[ib];W[hb];B[li]TR[mf][li][kk][ll][ml][nl][ol]C[This leaves too much space for white to play with.
This move should played closer to the weak stones at M12 or N12.

Note that the the move you played is very close to an extremely thick wall. This is a sure sign of inefficency.]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[lg];B[mg]C[wonk: i am curious to know how this life/death situation actually works :-)]

;B[pj]C[wonk: i lose here. thanks for looking over my game, i look forward to reading your comments.

mp: The reason you lost is that you did not attack when you had your chance in many occasions.
When you did attack you often attacked with moves with little strategic meaning. When two groups are weak on the board, you had a tendency to not finish the fight but to play elsewhere - complicating things for no real reason.]
