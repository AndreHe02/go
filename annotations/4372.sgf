C[alski: Hi];B[pp]C[open always in the top right corner if your going to open in a corner, be polite.]
;W[ec];B[jj]C[you already started playing in the corners, do continue this, dont change your strategy and waste your first move.]
;W[cd];B[od];W[dp];B[dj]TR[qd]C[make your corner yours. before its too late.]
;W[jd];B[jp];W[qe]C[its too late. you have a very smal corner now.]
;B[qd];W[ph]C[and by saving the sal corner, you let him have your center.]
;B[bp];W[fp]TR[cq]C[take the corner from him, make him pay]
;B[cp];W[hq]C[alski: What is a good way to improve?

dont let him take your territories... you have nothing with those two stones in the b&c 4,  and you lost both your sides.]
;B[dq]C[solipsist: playing.  learning from mistakes by observing results of your actions.  reading a good basic book for beginners.]
;W[eq]C[alski: thanks];B[dr];W[dm];B[do]C[solipsist: i myselg am not an expert, but i can tell for sure that you already begin the game in a better way than earlier today when we played]
;W[eo]C[alski: really? Cool];B[ep]C[solipsist: 1 - securing corners.  2 - extending on the sides.]
;W[pk];B[dp];W[pn];B[jf]C[this move only lets him make the top side solid.]
;W[hd]C[solipsist: controlling the middle of the board should be kept for the endgame
alski: ok];B[fq]C[solipsist: but what you did is good : positioning a stone already]

;W[kh]C[alski: yeah];B[jh]C[solipsist: better to put stones in useful places regularily than to battle for a long time in the same region

This idea is called tenuki. If you dont know where to play, look somwhere else. Each of your moves must have a purpose, and if you arent able to tell me what that purpose is, you must find another move.]

alski: I dont have time for another game, but when I do, we can tommorow
alski has resigned the game.


you should have resigned a long time ago, and then asked for another chance... Better to loose allot fast, than to lose allot over hours and hours.

everyone loses in the beggining, we all started bad, keep playing, you will get strong :)]
