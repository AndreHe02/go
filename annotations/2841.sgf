(;W[ch]C[B: It is more important to answer R10. On the right side you got more stones then black and you should keep this advantage by playing R12. (see variation)]
;B[cg];W[dh]C[It is better to make a light move like E12 or better:  C9 here. Now black plays C8 (or C9) which is a good extension from his corner enclosure and at the same time an attack against your heavy stones. This black move is to good to allow!



If black answers white C9 by attacking your stone on C12, you can anwer C6 sacrificing C12 and getting a stable position nullifying the black influence from the corner enclosure.



If black answers white C9 by plaing C7 his extension is a little narrow and you still can play D12 getting a far better result then in the game.]

;B[on]C[B: Black got a clear lead now.];W[qh];B[nc]C[B: you cannot allow black L17. You should play M17 allowing black a small live in the corner and getting influence. See variation.]

(;W[pc];B[kc];W[oh];B[oj]C[B: Black got a big lead now. As well in terms of territory and also in terms of influence.]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[ce]C[B: OK, that is worth a try!];B[bf]C[B: good answer by black!]
;W[ee];B[de];W[ef]C[B: I see! you are working for influence now. Good!]
;B[ed];W[fd];B[eg];W[fe];B[dg];W[fg];B[eh];W[ei];B[di];W[dj]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[bh];W[dl];B[dm];W[cl];B[cm];W[gf]C[B: This move is not necessary. It is true: you got impressive thickness now. But this cutting stone is not really important as both white sides are stable on their own. Good white moves now are M18 or K4.



If you plan to play G14 you should not have played D8 and C8, but directly G14. Reason: After G14 you got a stable position anyway. In that case you find stronger attacks on the lower left corner then D8 and C8. Th exchange D8,C8 against D7,C7 is now very good for black: He has a stable big territory in the lower left corner.]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[ri];W[lb]C[B: Good! The black stones are really thin (the last black move S11 was bad). You got good chances from this attack!]
;B[ne]C[B: You can punish this move by playing N16.]
(;W[of]C[B: Q14 is better. After Q14 black can move his stone Q13 out, but this is no real advantage for black (you would answer R13).]
;B[lc];W[kb];B[jc];W[jb];B[id];W[hc];B[je]C[B: Black N18 would be better.]
;W[md]C[B: I see, you still want to kill. This attack looks promising.]
;B[mc];W[nd];B[og]
(;W[nf]C[B: O13 is better. You are giving away your three white stones P12,Q12,R12.



In trying to achieve your goal (attacking the black stones) you should always also try not to take to big losses elsewere. To the contrary: you are the attacker, you should get profit or influence elsewere even if you dont succeed in killing.



 If you are sure you capture the black group above your move might be ok. But otherwise it is to big a loss. And also after O13 you are attacking the black group strongly. Maybe you were afraid of the black answer P15? Lets see...]
;B[ng];W[mf];B[jg];W[mg];B[nh];W[li]C[B: This makes it to easy for black. 

Play N12 instead! This could turn the game in your favor. If he answers O11 you play K11 and the black stones are in real trouble.]
;B[ji];W[jk];B[kj];W[mk]C[B: This move is hardly worth anything. You are forcing black out into the center (thats were he wants to get anyway) so you are helping black. Later the stone on N9 will have little value. This is the wrong direction.



There are two possible alternatives:

You can play M8 pushing black in the other direction. (If black M10 white N11, threatening N10 or O11 both of them good points for white).



The play on M8 gives also a little influence into the black moyo on the lower left corner. Probably not the fight in the center decides the game, but the question what will happen with that moyo. Even in the middle of a fight you have to think about that moyo.



In fact this is the second alternative for your move: You could play K4 now. This is a strong shoulder hit. Depending on the development you might get a chance later to attack the black center group. And you will know the attacking direction by then.]
;B[kk];W[kl];B[ll];W[lk];B[jl];W[km];B[ik];W[jm];B[il];W[mm]
;B[hp];W[pl]C[B: It is difficult to find a good move for white now. As the black center group still doesnt have two definite eyes I would still dream of the possibility of an attack later (which might start with White J10). As a preparation of that I would play F7, which is a reducing move for blacks moyo. 



Your move doesnt look promising as your stones P12,Q12,R12 are so weak (if not lost). It is a pitty that you gave those stones!]
;B[ql];W[pm];B[qm];W[pn];B[qo]
(;W[po]C[B: wrong direction. The white corner is worth more then those three stones (Q6,Q7,Q8) you must play R4 here.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[pq];W[qr];B[bl];W[ro];B[rn];W[iq]C[B: keeping your stones C8,C9 looks important to me]
;B[ip];W[gq]C[B: This cannot work without any support. By the way: your attack indirectly helps blacks center group.



The only thing you could achieve here is a connection to your lower right if you played K3 instead of G3. But I agree, this would not be sufficient to win the game.]
;B[hq];W[gp];B[go];W[ep];B[fq]C[B: wasted move by black. Black D3 is much stronger. you would need to defend the cut at F4 anyway.]
;W[fp];B[dq]C[B: Maybe here it is obvious why F3 is wasted: It just fills your otherwise empty triangle.]
;W[en];B[em]C[B: Capturing with D9 would be better for black. Black makes some slack moves here, but still your attack is no success.]
;W[fn];B[gl];W[gn];B[hn];W[jq];B[gr]C[B: Black is getting afraid. Of course he should play K4. Now at the end you are getting something from your attack!]
;W[jp];B[qf];W[qe];B[rf];W[re];B[gi]C[B: Strange move. Black is helping white!]
;W[fi];B[ir];W[jr];B[jo];W[ko];B[jn];W[kn];B[kr];W[is];B[hr]
;W[kp]C[B. A very good result for white!];B[se];W[sd];B[sf]
;W[rc];B[ob];W[pf]C[B: A very good idea!];B[qg];W[ni]C[B: Good!]
;B[oi];W[rh]C[B: Unfortunately this doesnt quite work (as the game shows). So you should play N12 here.]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[lh];W[kh];B[lg];W[kg];B[lf];W[kf];B[le];W[jf]
C[B: No. You must play N15];B[me];W[gk];B[hl];W[pk];B[pj];W[fl]
;B[fm];W[od];B[qb];W[ke];B[ld];W[kd]C[B: This is very risky. Black can play P15 and if you answer Q15 he can play Q18 and your group in the corner would be dead. black easily wins the capturing race (against the group P12-S12). So you must answer P15 by Q18.

Anyway: This attack would be a  success for black in sente.



Black could also start this attack with Q18 and you have to answer to avoid getting killed (which will be difficult enough)]
