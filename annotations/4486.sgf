C[yksato: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
detachedp: okay];B[pd]C[DP: Hi.  First thanks for reviewing this game.  I played white in this game.  I was not able to have a good opening.  I feel I was too slow in the beginning and had to stretch a bit with moves from 15 to 37.  Both of us couldn't handle each other's tesuji moves well.  I ended up resigning because I couldn't kill his group.]
;W[qp];B[dp];W[dd];B[op];W[lp];B[on];W[qn];B[ol];W[ql]C[DP: Maybe I should've played P3 first.  It shoudl be my sente.  But I don't like the idea of black getting R8.




A: I think this move is ok and have seen in it in many games between better players as me.]
;B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[rr]C[After the game, I felt I should've played j3.




A: I think there is still room enough for white to invade on the lower side, despite black's next move.]

A: I don't think this move is good. I have seen some alternatives...]

;B[cp];W[eo];B[fr]C[DP: Why he played f2? Is it necessary?]

A:I think you should have defended the other side first.];B[qf]

A: now the splitting invasion works more painful for W.];W[cg]

A: it is not good to force miai, R2 and R12are more or less equal value for black in the opening. For example, playing at e12 would be very big too. But more urgent is to play g8.]

A: how confident are you that W's lower left group can live?]
;B[hc]C[




A: I think this is well placed, black can aim at connecting to the right and jumping outside.]

A: this is the moment in which you definitively begin to loose the game. This is not reasonable, and it is very painful to hang tough in these situations. These type of mistakes you should avoid.]

A: I see no way  out of this for white. This was a nice fighting game but you nee do prepare more the moves during attack and defence.
W's invasion on the lower right side was also unreasonable.
I recommend to keep with your fighting but to pick up more shape making moves from pro games.
Also the lower invasion was wrong.
