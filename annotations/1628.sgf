Hi !

First of all, please forgive my poor english, I'm not a native english speaker.

I am white (ebitoika) in this game played on KGS. Though I'm still quite weak (25k...), I'm very willing to improve from my mistakes. That's why I'm requesting a review for this interesting game which lets me dissatisfied.

I've already included commentaries from my reflexions and feelings in the file until move 152.
Please feel free to react and argue whenever you think I'm wrong or misreading the game (which may occur very often =)

Be sure that your help will be greatly apreciated.

Antoine (ebitoika).];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[fp]C[I thought answering at f4 would give me thickness in order to build a big moyo on the east side.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[jq];W[dm]C[But obviously I'm lacking of support on the North and East. Black seems confortable in the south (though there's still place for attacking) whereas my group is not working very well with the d16 stone.

By the way, what's the best extension in this situation after this Joseki ?
d6/7 ? (solid and territory oriented)
d9/10 ? (leaving a weakness around d6/7)

I think the usual move is d6.  You can extend down the side later.]
;B[np]C[too kind from black ?
threatens to build a big moyo

I don't think this is that big.  You can still invade the lower right corner, and this isn't a moyo yet.]
;W[qf]C[I want to prevent black from building a big moyo on the east.
Maybe better around Q10 ? or am I in the wrong direction ?

This is a mistake.  You're going to wind up helping Black build a moyo.  Q10 or S10 would be better.]
;B[qh]C[I think that's the appropriate answer for black]
(;W[of]C[I think playing this move at R17 then Black R16 etc... would give perfect thickness to black (see variation)

This is the only move in this situation.  The other variation is terrible for White.]
;B[nd];W[oh]C[I think this is good for white

This leaves a weakness at Q13.  I like Q12 better.];B[pg]C[I was very surprised by this answer from black.
I guess this is a mistake... but I couldn't figure out a good way to attacking the two black stones.]
;W[qg]C[thank you move ?];B[ph];W[mf]C[White has too many weaknesses here.]
;B[ld];W[oj]C[I don't know how to feel about this situation.
The 3 eastern black stones seems weak, but I think mine are weaker.
Maybe I should have attacked at R10, accepting to offer r13 and r14 stones against an ivasion in the East...

Your stones are weaker.  Black can connect to the stones at the top any time.  See variations.]

(;B[qj]C[seems better for black
I feel I've been trapped by q13 trick play...
But the result is not so bad for me, the black moyo has disappeared and I am strong in the center]
;W[qo]C[I think this attack is far too close to the black force.
better between r6 and r8 ?

Where do you think is the best place to attack ?

I think stabilizing the north-west would have been bigger at this moment, but I don't want to give the initiative to black

I like C11 or F17.  Something to strengthen your group in the upper right would probably be a good idea (probably Q14).  I don't think you should be attacking at all at this point.]
;B[qm]C[tough attack

This is brutal.  You're in a bad spot here.  If you try to save the stone, you'll probably give Black a lot of thickness, and if you don't, you've just helped him shore up his territory for free.]
;W[qp]C[I think a jump to R3 would be better.];B[qq];W[po];B[pq]
;W[no]C[that's bad, isn't it ?

I don't think it's too good.  I think Q7 is probably your best move.  It moves towards your group in the center, and it gives you a little more room to breathe.]
;B[om];W[nn];B[nm];W[pn]C[I think that wasn't necessary

Right.  This move was wasted.  Keep in mind that Black doesn't have to kill your group to benefit from this chase.  In fact, he probably prefers that it not die.  That way he can chase it all the way across the board.]
;B[pm]C[I think this was a mistake for Black.];W[lo];B[lp];W[km]
C[i think black could have killed

I think he could have done better, but his goal should not have been to kill.]
;B[pf]C[tough cut];W[rd];B[qe];W[re];B[rg]
(;W[qd]C[better to connect at s14 ?

I don't think so.  It's easier for you to live in the corner, and I think you wind up with more territory.  See variation.]
;B[rf];W[pc];B[oc];W[qb]C[once more, I think black could have killed

I don't think so.  I think he should have played the variation here though.]

(;B[oe];W[og];B[ch]C[very big, I think

It's big, but so is something around J17.]
(;W[cf]C[I think you should have approached on the other side at C10.  See variation.]
;B[ck];W[cl]C[thank you move ?];B[dk]C[I think black is happy to play d9]
;W[kf]C[In the sequences that follow I think I've been too soft, trying to connect all my groups instead of attacking the black invasion.
Even if my connection stones are disconnecting black, I let him live locally

I think you need to play on the top edge here.  Your center group is not in danger right now, and the territory available at the top is MUCH bigger than anything you'll get in the center.  I think Black should play at E13, and your move starts to look like a mistake.

The other option would be to attack the group on the left and try to make a large center territory.]
;B[jd];W[eg]C[Good.];B[ei];W[hg]C[E17 is better, I think.];B[gd]
;W[gg]C[Your group in the center can live by itself, so connecting these groups isn't getting you that much.  This move especially doesn't look very good.]
;B[gi];W[bi]C[overplay ? (see variation)

I like H11, and the upper left corner is still open.];B[bh]
;W[bk]
(;B[ci];W[bj]C[white ends this sequence gote...];B[fk];W[go]
C[aiming at disconnecting black, but I think I can't kill him anymore

I don't think you ever had much chance of killing him.  This is a decent move, not because you're disconnecting Black, but because it helps to connect to the group on the lower right, which could still run into trouble.]
;B[hp];W[ho];B[ip];W[im]C[too soft ?
anyway I need this connection

J6 is a stronger connection, and allows Black less territory too.]
;B[hl];W[il];B[hm];W[in];B[fm];W[em];B[el];W[hi];B[hj];W[ij]
;B[hk];W[ii];B[mk]C[even if the proverbs says "there is no territory in the center", I think this is a tough reducing stone

Yep.  Now you're not going to get much.];W[lj];B[lk];W[kj]C[I think N10 would be better.]
;B[mj];W[mi];B[mm];W[nj]C[far too small

Yes, it is.];B[ae]C[I'm being punished for being too soft
this is big

This isn't that big.  I think Black should have played at E17.  That's bigger, and sente, so he probably still gets this move.  Then you won't get anything in the corner.]
;W[bf]C[I never manage to defend against "saru no suberi"...
shame on me

If you don't have a stone on the second line somewhere to help out, the best you can do is give him the first line all the way to the corner.]
;B[af];W[bd]C[Is this the right defense ?

Yes, this is the best you can do.];B[ad];W[bc];B[ac];W[bb];B[ab]
C[bad bad bad];W[bg];B[ag];W[fc]C[the biggest yose around ?

I think so.];B[gc];W[fb];B[gb];W[ga];B[ha];W[fa];B[ib];W[ob]
;B[nb];W[dr];B[er];W[pk]C[I think that's bad];B[qk];W[na]C[this is bigger

Yes, it is.  It's also sente, so you could do both.];B[mb];W[ma]
;B[la];W[oa];B[lb];W[fj]C[foolish
but I can't see any big sente on the board

This is no good, but it is sente, so it doesn't hurt you that much.

You should probably play at S5, and then you can monkey jump in either direction.]
;B[fi];W[ej]C[This move is really bad.  I don't think Black should answer.]

I'm in byo yomi, so my "mistake per minute rate" is increasing...

For that reason, there are no more commentaries included for the last 100 stones.

Even if I finally won by 14.5 moku including 6.5 komi, I feel dissatisfied with this game.
But I think there's a lot to learn from it !

This ko fight is not worth fighting.  It is worth less than two points.]

You did a good job of connecting your groups.])

This is way too good for Black.  The game is probably over at this point.  It's his move, and he only needs one more move to solidify the HUGE moyo.]
