C[krv:
Dear reviewer.
I'm playing black here. There is no komi. I won that game, but seems I shouldn't if white haven't blunder.
All middlegame was hard to me. I've asked some special questions, but also I ask you to look other moves and mark if they aren't good.
Also I'm interesting is my yose (endgame) moves order right.

crux: Hi.  I'm 2 dan at the local club.  I hope this review will be useful.  Too avoid confusion I've marked the variations that I've added with (*).  Please use an SGF reader that displays which nodes have variations.  I recommend gGo, glGo, qgo or Jago.  cgoban2, the KGS client, has some issues.]

(;B[jj]TR[pn]C[krv: In joseky book wroten that with favorable ladder I can play taisha joseki more comfortable and it's nothing wrong to tenuki. Because this I've play tengen to ensure favorable ladder for one of the two corners with taisha joseky. Is this ok?

crux: I would never play like this, but I cannot judge if it is OK.  If I was Black, I wouldn't have tenukied the first time when White played the marked move.  I checked my database; tenuki against the taisha does happen in professional play, but only very rarely.

Having a ladder breaker allows you to play one of the simpler lines in the taisha, but there are others to choose from, and you could play the complex one - chances are your opponent doesn't know it either, and you'll both learn something :)
When you play a stone, ask yourself what goals it is trying to achieve - just being a ladder breaker usually isn't good enough, as breaking ladders isn't the object of the game.]
;W[ce]LB[dd:A]C[crux: This move has been played in one professional game I could find in GoGoD; Black leaves the position alone for a while and then extends at A later in the game when the conditions are right.]

(;B[be]C[krv: Not sure how to play here. May be D16?

crux: Tenuki is an option - play out the lower right corner and leave the black stone in the top left for aji.  I see no easy way to move out this stone immediately and get an appealing result.  White isn't going to spend another move in that corner anytime soon - four stones to one would be somewhat overconcentrated.]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[de]
(;B[bg]C[krv: Is B17 better?

crux: Neither is appealing.];W[cg];B[bf];W[bd];B[ch];W[dg]C[crux: White got more territory, more eyeshape and more influence out of that sequence - as he should, having invested two more stones, but it still doesn't look good.  We can't even really say that Black has sente - defending his stones immediately would be the honest move.]
;B[op]
(;W[pp];B[po];W[pq];B[oo];W[qo];B[qn];W[ro]
(;B[pm]C[krv: Is S6 good here?

crux: This (Q7) is joseki.  The point is that capturing the laddered stone is now sente for Black (White must protect his two stones by capturing the black one in the corner), so White has less opportunity for playing a ladder breaker.]
;W[rp];B[nq]C[crux: Just capturing the laddered stone is probably better.  No good leaving ladders around for too long.]
;W[cn]
(;B[cl]LB[ck:A]C[krv: Is B9 or C10 better?

;W[fq];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[cq];B[eq];W[cp];B[gq];W[dm]
(;B[fr]C[krv: D12 better? Is E2 waste move?

crux: F2 you mean?  Yes, this is wasted - Black is reinforcing stones that are already strong while ignoring the ones with weaknesses.]
;W[cj];B[dh];W[dl];B[on]C[crux: This may be the wrong moment to abandon your weak group.]
;W[bi];B[bh]C[crux: Black is left with a half-eyed group.  It seems like White ought to be able to find a good attack.]

(;W[qf]LB[rn:A]C[crux: Looks like the wrong direction.  White wants to develop along the top; the right side isn't very interesting given that it's got an open underbelly at A.]

C[crux: Seems small, and invites White to fix up the cut which might otherwise be an asset to Black.]
;W[kh];B[ih];W[ld]
(;B[kf]LB[ki:A]C[krv: N15 better?

crux: Given that this stone just gets captured...  However, A seems like a vital point.]
;W[lf]
(;B[sd]C[krv: Seems like better is to leave corner for endgame. But my way to attack isn't looking good. Can I do any better here?

crux: Can't see a way to kill, so this is purely for territory.  A small monkey jump may be bigger here - White is forced to defend somehow, and then Black can leave the position.]
;W[sc];B[se];W[rd];B[nh]C[crux: This seems really small.  Note also that while you have forced White to defend in the corner, White can pick up the two Black stones at any time.]
;W[ki]C[crux: White takes a vital point.];B[kj];W[mh];B[ni]

(;W[il]TR[fi][fk][gh][gi][gj]LB[mi:A]C[krv: Is it good for white to cut me now? Variants are too complicated for me.

crux: I'm afraid they are for me, too.  If I was White I'd hesitate to cut straight away, as the marked White stones might come under attack.  It all depends a bit on whether White thinks he needs to do anything fancy to win.  Black's only territory is in the center, while White has a fair amount at the top and some more at the left and the bottom right.  My guess is that reducing (around here, and at A) is good enough.]

If I'm losing F4 group I'm losing all game with 20-50 points, right?

crux: Ugh.  Reading out semeais isn't exactly my strong point.  Still, it does seem that Black should lose his stones after connecting.]
;W[ir]
(;B[ks];W[hs];B[js]
(;W[dr]C[krv: Can white catch me? Seems like yes.

crux: Yes, but not with this move that doesn't fill a liberty.]
;B[fs];W[dq];B[ls];W[bo]C[crux: Getting sente to kill these stones is some compensation for White, but not large enough, especially since Black's next move is also very big.]
;B[im]C[crux: Big, but some of Black's sente moves (e.g. M19) could be played now.]

crux: Turning it into a semeai would be a success for White even if he loses it, since Black would have to play in his own territory to take off the white stones.  I'm not sure if White could get enough liberties for that to happen.  Certainly not in normal play, Black would have to ignore a ko threat at least.]

;W[gs];B[jq];W[di];B[ia]C[krv: Is it better to play ko-treats like J19 first? (to have more ko treats if white tryes to ignore this and initiates ko fight for K18)
I see that there is no difference here, but I wish to know this for possible future cases.

crux: I'm no expert on ko theory.  I think all threats are equal since it's the last ko and its value is minimal, so any non-zero threat will be answered.]
