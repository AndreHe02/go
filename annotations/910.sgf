C[Game played on IGS, 6/4/02 between Richard Jones (12k on IGS provisional, 8K in UK) W,
and Taija (6k*) B.



Total Game time around 40 mins.



I have added my own comments under RJ.];B[pp];W[dd];B[dq];W[pd]
;B[nc];W[pf]
(;B[pb];W[qc];B[fc]C[janr: black does not finish the joseki in the upper right.   Letting a joseki unfinished is so;eti;es possible (e.g. after o17/r14 black could play elsewhere), but here black has no choice.
The idea is that the corner (r17) and the side (m17) are miai (equally valuable).  so white can play m17 instead of r17 after which black takes the corner (joseki).  However, if white chooses r17, black should take the side.  If white gets both points, black is at a disadvantage.    So a first reflex for white could be to pincer at m17 (see variation)]

(;W[co]C[RJ:  I abandoned the top left in order not to continue to be pushed around by B.  I was aware that I risked a pincer attack but thought that I could counter pincer using my stone played this move as back-up.

janr: personally, if i would not play m17, i think i would answer at c14 as i find it more difficult to defend against a double kakari on a 4-4 stone than against a double kakari on a 3-4 stone (which is a 5-3 joseki).  But if fighting spirit asks you to ignore your opponent go ahead.]
;B[cf]C[RJ:  Indeed, there came a pincer attack.];W[ee]C[RJ:  I extended out toward the centre to give my top left group a bit more strength]
;B[ic]C[janr: it see;s black is fixing his top-right problem whileplaying on the top left.
on the other hand, this is locally not a standard more and so there exists perhaps a good move for white on the top left now.  I try a few variations.]

(;W[ch]C[RJ:  Then pincered from below, with a view to making territory on the left]
;B[cc];W[fq]C[RJ: After B dived into the corner, I decided that a pincer on the bottom left would even out the situation.

janr: it seems that white gives black now a wide range of possiblities on the top left.
black could e.g. choose to continue there]
(;B[cp]C[this is not joseki.  See variations.]
(;W[do];B[bo];W[bn];B[bp]
(;W[cn];B[ep];W[nq]C[RJ:  Again, I moved on, not wanting B to extend along the bottom before I did.

janr: as white has kind of a wall on the left side, it is still a good idea to move first in the top left.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[jp]C[RJ:  Attach and Extend Joseki seemed to work well with the bottom edge, allowing black the right edge, but with some stones of my own along there to stop it becoming too large.

janr: I agree that playing simply at r6 would be better for black.
especially as black has no intention to extend his bottom right position in the next moves.]

(;B[cd]C[RJ:  Was there some potential for me to cause damage in this corner, prompting B's play?]

(;W[go]C[RJ:  On reflection, I suspect that Q10 or something similar would have been a better move.

janr: indeed (see previous comment).
however, white is getting very thin on the upper left. as black can split at d13 or even attack around c10.]

(;B[pk]C[perhaps it is better on the third line?];W[qi]C[RJ:  We divide up the right side.  At this stage, I felt that W was leading.
janr: both sides seem to have a number of defects. I'm not convinced that there is a clear leader but black has more secure territoty i think.]
;B[jj]C[janr: no, i do not think there are much points to gain in the center now.
Still, if black too thinks he has more secure territory than white, perhaps he wants to prepare invaions and reductions, e.g. at the left side.]
;W[lc]C[RJ:  I played this move to reduce B's potentially large territory on the top.
janr: good move, but it is more difficult as black is strong on the top left now.]
;B[ne];W[le];B[ng];W[id]C[RJ:  This move was played in order to ensure  that my stones either connected out or had eye space.  Is this correct?
janr: it is difficult.  the black center stone seems to give more influence than i originally thought. perhaps j15 is a good idea too.]
;B[hd];W[ie]
(;B[he];W[jc];B[ib]
(;W[jb]
(;B[dc]C[RJ:  Again, B plays a solid move in the corner, but this doesn't seem urgent to me.  Am I missing something?
janr: it;s a big move i think. cutting at d17 is also big for white.   However  1) locally black can be more agressive. (see variation)
2) defending the top right stones / attacking whites top stones can be more urgent.  (urgent moves before big moves).]
;W[eg]C[RJ:  Worried that W knows something I don't, I run towards my left side group
janr: b invested already a move here, so capturing two stones is not so big any more]

(;B[hp]C[janr: i think there are moves that are easier and/or better for black.]

(;W[hq]C[seems a little timid.];B[gp];W[gq];B[fp];W[ip];B[ck]
C[black got much thickness.];W[ek]
(;B[el]C[in this sequence there are some tactical errors.   too difficult for me to read out accurately, i just try some ideas.]

(;B[ej];W[dj];B[fm];W[fj];B[gj];W[fi];B[gk];W[ho];B[io];W[jo]
;B[in]C[RJ:  This sequence turns out quite bad for W.  Perhaps the move at G5 should have been a line lower?]
;W[fo]C[does not work ?];B[eo];W[en];B[fn]
(;W[qk]C[RJ:  Having made this loss, I decide that compensation can only come from the right side of the board.  Should this move have been played earlier?]
;B[ql];W[pj]C[RJ:  Much as I would have liked to settle quickly on the edge, I realised that W was not obviously leading (at least, not obvious to me), and that I needed to hassle the weak B group on the top.]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[nk];W[nj];B[mo];W[lp];B[gi];W[fh]C[slow move.  what can black do if white does not answer?]
;B[if];W[lg]C[RJ:  After following B round for a few moves, I ignore J14 and shut B's group in with M13]

(;B[pa]C[makes no eyes.];W[mh];B[nh]
(;W[ph]C[RJ:  At this point, it seemed like I had killed the B group.  Unfortunately not though...]
;B[mj];W[mi];B[lj];W[km]C[RJ:  With the B group shut in, and with me believing that it ws, if not already dead, then going to die, I made an incursion into B's large lower central framework.  Looking back, a move like N16 would have been better?
janr: indeed.];B[lm];W[ln];B[mm];W[jm];B[im];W[kk];B[jk];W[kj]
;B[ki];W[kl]
(;B[ll]C[RJ:  With that incursion over, I decided to move on, and try it else where.
janr: the last moves are all quite small.  both sides had the opportunity to tenuki.]
;W[fd]
(;B[gd];W[gc]
(;B[gb];W[ec];B[hc];W[eb];B[db];W[be]C[RJ:  I had been watching this spot on the board for a while - is this an appropriate time to play a move like this, or should it have been earlier in the game?  Or not at all?]
;B[ce];W[bf];B[bg];W[cg];B[bd];W[bh];B[ae];W[ag];B[bb];W[gh]
C[RJ:  Next, I noticed the potential weakness of the top centre black group, and thought that I'd try cutting it off.]

;B[ff]
(;W[fe];B[ge]C[RJ:  Although I failed to cut this group off, I made my own top centre group stronger, and my left side group too, whilst keeping B's stones compressed.  Was this a reasonable result?]
;W[rk]C[RJ:  Next, secure my right side group, and threaten the invasion of B's large right side.]
;B[rl];W[lk];B[mc];W[lb]C[RJ:  It was at this stage that I found out that this B group was actually alive, due to defects in my W group.  Up until this point, I believed that W was ahead, but this brought the situation down to near level, perhaps with B leading.]
;B[md];W[oe];B[of];W[pe];B[me];W[og];B[mg];W[ld]C[RJ:  I played this move, as I was unsure if it could cause problems for my W group if B played it, bearing in mind that it could now be cut off from the right side.  Comments?]

If white takes e15 blacks joseki is at c17.  if black does not take c17, white takes both e15 and c17 and should have an advantage.]
