AB[dd][pd][dp]C[B>
I'm playing a 3 stone handicap against a modified version of GnuGo
called ggIII. I'd appreciate comments regarding the placement of
stones, whether I'm attacking efficiently, and how to better defend.]
;W[op];B[qo];W[qq];B[pn]C[This seems a little slow since it doen't put much pressure on white.  I think that Q7 looks better since it stretches further down the side.  P6 would, instead put a little more pressure on white.]
;W[pf];B[nd]C[B> I was deciding between O16 and a pincer + extension at Q11.

Since a pincer would also be an extension from your two stones around R6, I would prefer the pincer.]
;W[qd]
(;B[pj]C[B>
Ended up deciding to play a similar pincer  here in anticipation that
if white played around M16 then I'd slip underneath.

You could probably have played R17 first since white would most likely respond.  Then the pincer would be more effective.]
;W[qe];B[lp]C[B> Trying to put some pressure on the corner white stones.

A defensive move in the upper right (possibly R17 or M17) is more important at this point.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[fp]
(;B[no]C[B> Is it correct to ignore F4 and instead cap + attack the corner group?

Your chances of killing the corner are slim although this move gives you nice outside influence.  However, I think a pincer around J3 would put pressure on the white stone at F4 and provide a good shape relative to the stone at M4.]
;W[fd];B[id]C[B>
Pincer + extension

Because of the length of the extension (it's vulnerable to a white play around M16), I'd feel more confortable with a low pincer at J17 or K17.]

(;W[jq];B[lr]C[B> Playing M2 to cut off the left
and right group. I thought about L3 but that would strengthen the left
group so I didn't play it.]
(;W[cf]C[I think that white can probably live in the corner -- see variation.]
;B[ee]C[B> Conceded upper left corner to white in anticipation of getting some inflence since I had M4, O5, Q6

Yes, I think separating white here is best even if white gets the corner especially since white has no support on either side.]
;W[cc]
(;B[dh]C[B>
I made the large knight move to create some fighting that would help
strengthen my weak lower left corner (but I guess it didn't work).

You should first decide which side you will give to white so you can get the other side. Don't get too greedy.]
;W[dc];B[gc];W[nf];B[ld]C[B> I didn't want the groups separated, so I played M16. Any better options?

No, I think that is best.];W[cj];B[cm]C[B> Trying to strengthen corner stones and look at chance at attack C10.

Good defensive move and it puts some pressure on white stones at F4 & K3.]
;W[ej]C[B> I guess this blew my invasion thought. :p];B[fh]
C[B> Since I couldn't invade, I wanted to start a large attack on the F16 group.

I think this is a reasonable move, but for a different reason: The three black stones at C16, E15, and D12 are weak and almost surrounded by white stones.  It's usually not a good idea to try to attack with a weak group or you're likely to just get in trouble.  I think those black stones need to try to connect to the the group in the upper center or to get out.  Connecting seems unlikely, so getting out is very important.  The play at F12 is a good start.]
;W[bh]
(;B[ge]C[B> Trying to gain central influence here while severely pressuring the F16 stone.

From white's perspective, the stone at F16 is not very important except for possible keeping the black stones separated.  F15 would be more effective for black to keep the stones at D16 & E15 connected to the stones at D12 & F12 and also threaten to capture white stone at F16.]

(;W[oa]C[White missed an opportunity to attack the still weak black stones in the upper left.]
;B[na];W[ce];B[cg]C[B> I figured that this group was probably alive, so I diagonal attached.]
;W[bg];B[df];W[pa];B[mb];W[cd];B[ec]C[This just asks white to play E16.]

(;W[hp];B[eq]C[B> Strengthening the corner just a little bit more.

This is a little thin with the stones at C7 and D4 separated by a large knights move.  If C7 were at C6, this would be a safer move.  C3 instead of E3 would be more secure and ultimately might mean more territory for black.]

(;W[qh];B[qi]C[B> I figured that this group was alive too, so I diagonal attached. Is there a better move?

This leaves vulnerabilities around Q8.  (See white variations.) R10 would be stronger and safer.]

(;W[ri]C[B> I was a little surprised at this whte move since I expected an extension instead of hane.]

(;B[qg]C[B> Trying to do something weird :p]
(;W[pg]C[White decide to help you.];B[rh];W[ph];B[rj]C[B> here I figured since the white got some central influence I'd try reducing its territory a bit.]

(;W[nj];B[mg]C[B>
I played this stone in anticipation of capping the right side white
stones while solidifying my central influence.

This seems a little close (M13 feels better), but probably works because white has the weakness at P11.]
;W[oi];B[ol]C[B>
Here again I was a bit afraid that white would take the weak point so I
played P8. Is there a better way of defending this weak point by
attacking?

With white's stones now hanging over this group, I think this is the best move.]
;W[np];B[nq]C[B> Pressuring corner group.

I don't think this works since white can play N4 and then go up or down.  N4 looks like a safer move (or even better perhaps is N5) since black is thin here.]

(;W[oq];B[mq];W[nr];B[oo]C[B> You'll notice later that this group lives. Is there any good moves to kill this corner group?]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[rg];B[si];W[bl];B[bm];W[cl];B[dm];W[fq];B[jo]
C[B>
This move aimed at preventing the white from going out too far by using
the group at F4. You'll notice later that I wasn't very successful at
completely blocking this group's growth.

This is also a good move because it helps black defend against white playing N4 (black responds at N5) and then making the cut at M5.]
;W[lj];B[mi];W[mj];B[jh]C[B> Further strengthening central wall while looking for chance to connect with bottom.

Very good territory move.];W[mp];B[mo]
(;W[eb];B[fc];W[mf];B[lg]C[B>
Is a hane at M14 better? I was afraid of a cut since I was playing in
white territory.

Yes, allowing white the cut at M13 could get complicated for black.  If white now pushes at M14, the hane at L13 should work for black.]
;W[fr];B[gn]C[B> G6 aimed to further cap the white group. I figured if w E2 then b D2

I think E2 would be better since white can play at D2 now.]

(;W[er];B[dr];W[eo];B[do];W[lm]C[B>
This seemed like a pretty severe extension to me. I was hard pressed at
finding a good move to deflect this attack.]
(;B[ln]C[B> Is this
move okay?

I would prefer L4 since it is more solid and also puts some pressure on the white group in the lower left.  A white play at L5 now would complicate the situation considerably.]

(;W[mm];B[km];W[hn]C[B> This was the move I was talking
about. White managed to push up a bit.];B[hm];W[fn];B[fm];W[go]
;B[gm];W[in];B[im]C[B>
I went for the central wall to complement the central territory on top,
but you'll notice that I didn't end up getting the very central part.]
;W[jn];B[jm];W[kn];B[ko]C[This turned out badly for white.  In the future, black can play at J4, white will have to respond at J3, and black can get a snap back by playing at J5 which captures the 4 white stones.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[fb];B[gb];W[gj]C[B>
I thought this white move was pretty severe also. Any suggestions on a
better defense?

It's not likely either side will get any territory around the center so your move of G11 or the shoulder hit at H11 are probably the best.]

(;B[gi];W[fi];B[ei];W[fj];B[hi];W[de]
(;B[gd]C[This is sort of small at the moment. J4 is bigger.]
;W[ds];B[cs];W[es];B[cr];W[am];B[an];W[al];B[bo];W[sg]
(;B[jj]C[B>
Not sure if this was a right move. My purpose in making it was trying
to prevent the white from linking up.

White is connected to live groups on both sides so linking up is not important.  J4 is bigger or even N2.]
;W[en];B[is]C[B> Monkey jump to reduce bottom white territory.]
;W[hr]C[Good reducing move.  I'd feel safer playing N2 first, but I think this works.]
;B[io];W[ho];B[dk]C[B>
I wanted some black wall on the side so I could try to get some more
territory. Tried to play some forcing moves here.];W[dj];B[ck]

;W[me];B[le];W[qp];B[ng];W[hs]C[B>
I thought that if I blocked at K1 and white did something tricky my
entire group would become a connect-and-die sacrifice, so I played it a
bit safe here.]
(;B[kr]C[Yes, K1 would definitely be a mistake.];W[js];B[of]

I don't think you needed to worry about that -- the stones on both sides of the cut are connected to live groups.]
