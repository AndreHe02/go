Note from submitter (krinid):
I'm playing white in this game.

I'm not interested in moves I could have done better to 'win the game', because as it's a 0.5 moku loss, there are lots of spots to pick up enough to win (eg: don't play L2 on move 210, see variation on move 210 for a winning play).

I'm interested in moves I could have played better to improve my shape, style, territory, misplays, overplays, missed opportunities, played an ooba instead of a kyuuba, played in the wrong ooba, order of play, sente/gote, joseki/tesuji misplays or completely missing the potential to play them, etc, in general, regardless as to whether they would change the outcome of the game or not.  I'm interested in the flow of the game and patterns or ideas I may have missed.  eg: if there was some way to have trapped black's F5 play and make territory in the area around it.

Thanks in advance for the review.

krinid];B[pd];W[dp];B[qf]C[NM: I don't like this, because making a keima is not really consistent with the outward look of the hoshi stone.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[cf]C[NM: Excellent];B[fd];W[dj];B[qn];W[np];B[pj]
;W[iq]C[NM: I would go for a splitting move on the top side here, such as L16. But this is also a question of personal style.]
;B[ic];W[cm]C[NM: Now it really becomes important to play at the top, e.g. O17. After all, the bottom left corner can still be invaded.
Or another possibility owuld have been to play in the centre, if you like the "cosmic" approach.]
;B[nn];W[eq]C[NM: W has concentrated too much on making his territory secure.]
;B[fo];W[il]C[krinid:
I wasn't sure if I could trap that when I played J8, but I figured I had to try, and hopefully could gain some territory in the e8/j8/j13/e13 square area if I couldn't kill F5.

NM: You certainly have to attack that stone. How to do so is trickier: I'd play J5, and then somewhere around F10. But the idea is sound.]
;B[io];W[lq]C[NM: There, you' ve already got useful profit from your attack.]
;B[hm];W[hl];B[gl];W[gk];B[fl];W[lg]C[NM: Again a matter of style, but I would havew jumped right in, either to O17 or to P18.]
;B[qc];W[mc]C[krinid:
This seemed like a big enough space to invade at, but it didn't turn out as well as I'd have liked- he kept attacking me and I ended up barely living with very little territory.

I'm interested in knowing:
a) what a good way to invade here is
b) how best to respond to his attacks to
     i) maximize territory
     ii) minimize gote plays & his territory gain
     iii) aid my other stones on the board
c) whether attacking this area at this time was even a good idea or not

NM: I think reducing was good. But you can't really attack now, since his two groups are very strong. Perhaps it would have been better to play M16, since that is loosely connected to M13, which helps, since you're certainly going to have to run away - you can't live locally.]
;B[ne];W[kd];B[je];W[ke]C[NM: I think I would have played L15, but this is fine. You've linked out and reduced successfully.]
;B[jg];W[gg]C[NM: What on eaarth is this stone supposed to do? It makes no territory, and it's not much use as a reduction. P18, N15, O13, or K16 followed by K14 - any of these would have been better.]
;B[bd]C[NM: Excellent reply, which takes territory while attacking.]
;W[bf]C[NM: Haveing some this far, I think I would play D13 or E14 in order to strenthen the link with G13 - but how humiliating!]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[rq];W[pq]C[NM: I much prefer S4, which gives you the nice follow-up of R8.]
;B[rp];W[lk]C[NM: Worth making a probing attack first? Something like R10 or R8.
But sooner or later you're going to have to link up - just doing it so passively lets B get a good lot of territory in near-sente with a move like O10.]
;B[nk];W[ln]C[NM: That is good - it puts pressure on the F5 group and keeps open the option of some sort of attack to the left.]
;B[im];W[kl];B[dn];W[cn];B[ng];W[ob]C[NM: I would go on with the F5 attack first - I think he can live, but you can at least torment him a bit first.]
;B[kb];W[lb]C[NM: I don't think this will work out well - I would play N15.]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[li];W[kh];B[gq];W[fr];B[cq];W[cp];B[eg]C[krinid:
This move killed most of the territory I was hoping to make in this area.  And that in addition to not killing F5 really hurt!

NM: It was always going to be tricky to make territory here - G13 is just too far away!]

(;W[mj]C[krinid:
I expected him to block this move, giving me time to connect my stones later, but I guess I had the order wrong.

NM: Indeed! But I don't think the P18 group can be killed.]

I was lucky that this move was left over.  I R17 had been at S17, all my stones here would have been dead.

NM; Yes.];B[rc];W[nd];B[od];W[mh];B[ni];W[oc];B[jc];W[hp];B[gp]
;W[hg]C[NM: I'd still be tempted to see if there's anything on the R - e.g. starting R10 or R8. Perhaps not, but the defence is quite tricky, and the game is close - if you even end up able to push a couple more points from O12 that could be enough!]
;B[ff];W[ih];B[ql];W[pr]C[NM: Very big, but gote. Maybe O12 first? Or you could even try P7.]

krinid:
Overall, I'm not dissatisfied with the result, other than the unnecessary L2 play losing me the game.  He was a stronger player, and I think I did all right, but I still feel I had a lot of room to improve on in this game.

Thanks for the review.
