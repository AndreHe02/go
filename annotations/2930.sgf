C[Berni: I've got two major questions, which I put at the corresponding place (about the joseki at the top left and about how to deal with the invasion at the right). But I also would be happy about comments on other moves, where I went wrong. At some times, I added comments about my reasoning.

The game was played in the "Internet-ligue", a ligue of german clubs.]

;W[jp];B[de];W[cg];B[cc]LB[ef:A]C[I do not think that the standard joseki here leads to a good result for B.  I would play at A and aim for an outside position.]
;W[dd]C[Berni: Major question A: I know, that this move isn't joseki. But I didn't know how to refute it. I read out some variations and we played one of them for several moves. But in the end, it looked to me, as if could have done better, especially as I think, my opponent had better moves too. Can you tell me where I got astray?]

;W[ff]C[Berni: Here I think, white could have just killed the corner and would have gotten out much better.

SGF: True.  But by now B is going to get a badresult whatever W does.  B's whole sequence of moves showed a lack reading and patience.]

;W[fg];B[fh];W[fc]
(;B[dj];W[ee];B[dg];W[ci]C[B's group is very heavy and has no chance to attack W.  It would have been better to sacrifice it all than to end up like this.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[cm];W[dk];B[ek];W[ck];B[el];W[bm]C[This move has no value. W is alive so why push towards thew corner?]
;B[fq]LB[mp:A]C[Berni: I decided, that my group in the center is stong enough, so that I can invade. Maybe I should have played C6 first?

SGF: c6 is not so big.  A more important question is whether you need to invade.  If you do you may end up with a weak group.  Because the D11 group is not yet totally secure you may end up with two weak groups, in which case the entire B moyo on the right is likely to disappear.

A better stretegy is to play at A and wait to see what W does.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[cn]C[This is the wrong strategy for W.  The territory is not small but leaving the K4 stone isolated in the large B moyo is not a good idea.]
;B[np]LB[lp:A][mp:B][lq:C]C[Not severe enough.  B needs to restrict W more severely.  A or B are much better.  C would not be good as W could then press from on top and probably escape easily.]
;W[fn];B[hq]LB[gn:B][jp:A]C[This move makes no sense whatsoever. B needs to attack A, not bury his head in the ground like an ostrich.  B is much better.]
;W[jr]LB[hn:A]C[This is failry pointless. B is already low here so the only point of playing this move is to separate.  W is not likely to be able to get a good attack going on B so he shuold simply play at A, casting a distance eye on the D11 group.]
;B[kq];W[ip];B[ho];W[fj]LB[ei:B][fi:A][gm:C]C[Why?  'A'  is the eye stealing tesuji so W needs to aim at it.  Forcing B to connect gives him half and eye at B. C is a better way to attack.]
;B[ej];W[gh];B[fi];W[gi];B[gj]C[Berni: If white draws the stone out, I'll play the driving tesuji and connect my two groups.

SGF: See variation.]
(;W[hn];B[fk]C[Berni: Now my center group is alive enough, so that I can fight with my bottom group.

SGF:  This move is not necessary.  Giving W sente below is too dangerous.]
;W[in];B[ir]
(;W[jq];B[er];W[dr];B[ep];W[dq];B[en]LB[jq:A]C[Berni: I jugded this a success, because my stones are now connected, and white has been separated

SGF:  True.  W should not have connected at A.  This is a double gote point and so B is reluctant to take it except to have to live.]
;W[fo];B[eo];W[dm];B[em];W[qj]LB[km:B][hp:A]C[Berni: Major question B: Here I wondered, how I could made use of the fact, that white didn't defend his week group at the bottom. I thought about S16 as well as the two hanes, but decided, that a direct attack would give me more power, so that I can attack the invading stone much better. Still it did not work. What strategy should I have adopted and how should I have played in this situation?

SGF:  You have the right idea.  Problem is that you have to do it in such a way that W cannot get any eye shape.  If you chase W's lower group towards to right you should get a natural splitting attack.  The fact the B is open at S16 means that there is nothing immediately interesting on the right.

B is is the move to achieve this.  W would have to play a move around B and then B can attack.]
;B[kn]LB[kn:B][hp:A]C[Problem with this move is the W gets to play A and it is too easy on him.  'B' is a little too far from the right to have a lot of affect.]
;W[lo]C[Berni: I didn't find a good answer to this counterattack and so I thought I might have overestimated the weekness of this stones (or my strength).]

(;B[qk];W[qi];B[pk];W[re]C[Berni: Maybe S16 first and let white cut instead?

SGF:  Not really.  With B open at S16 there is no direct way to attack.  That is why the splitting attack was so important.]
;B[rd];W[sd];B[mn]C[See previous variation which shows this to be clearly wrong.]
;W[ln];B[mm];W[nd];B[km]LB[nd:A]C[B cannot ignore W at the top - it is just too big.  In fact, the point A was sente for B and so should have been played earlier.]

C[Berni: I thought, that this was an unresonable invasion of white, because I jugged him ahead anyway. Although I managed to capture this stone, he could make use of the aji later. Could I have done better?
