C[janr: I include some comments from the discussion with my opponent after the game]

;B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[cj];B[qm]C[HK:  Black 15.  I like R9 instead.]

(;W[lc]C[HK:  White 16.  It is a little difficult invasion, as the right side white group is not strong enough.  H17 is recommended.  Refer to the variation.]
;B[jc]
(;W[ec]C[HK:  White 18-20.  A little greedy moves.  Continuation from white M17 is urgent.  See the variation.]
;B[fd];W[fb];B[le];W[me]
(;B[lf]C[janr: perhaps hane is better?  But we didnt find a good continuation

HK:  Black 23.  Yes, hane at N14 is better.  Let's try variations.]

(;W[of]C[HK:  White 24.  P16 or P15 is better, because black N16 dividing is very big.  Refer to the variations.]
;B[md]C[HK:  Black 25.  Very big.  But G18 before it is necessary.]
;W[nd];B[nc];W[mc]C[HK:  White 28.  This cut should be reserved until necessity.]
;B[ld];W[hb]C[HK:  White 30.  Very big.  But G18 is better for good aji at the top left corner.]
;B[fo];W[lq]
(;B[jq]C[HK:  Black K3.  O3 is better.  Let's try a variation.]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[oq];B[qr];W[no]
(;B[om]C[HK:  Black 39.  Q5 is better, as the aji of attacking at N4 is a big threat for white.  Refer to the variation.]
;W[po];B[op];W[np];B[qp];W[nm]C[HK:  White 44.  L5 is better to settle this white group.]
;B[ol];W[on];B[oo]C[HK:  Black 47.  Q6 is better.];W[pn];B[qn]
;W[qk];B[nl];W[mm];B[jm]C[ HK:  Black 53.  M9 is better, because the bottom side black group has secure base.]
;W[ml];B[ql]C[HK:  Black R8.  Very submissive move.  O10 instead is better aiming to attack either the bottom white group or the right side white group.]
;W[ej]C[HK:  White 56 is the only move.  White has a big lead now.]
;B[co];W[do]
(;B[cq]C[my opponent expected me to take the side (e.g. c4 now) letting him cut (and reduce my territory while i was reducing his)

HK:  C3 without the exchange of C5-D5 is better.  Now that black moved at C5 he should continue with C4.  Let's try a variation.]

(;W[eq]C[HK:  White 60.  D3 is better.  Refer to the variation.]
;B[er];W[cp];B[dq]C[HK:  Black 63.  B3 instead is better.];W[ep]

C[janr: after the game other players suggested c16 or c14 leading to a lot of variations

HK:  Maybe black cannot get two eyes here.  Let's try variations.]

(;B[cd];W[cc]C[HK:  White 76.  White should move at C14.];B[bc]
;W[bf];B[cb];W[dc];B[be];W[ae];B[ad];W[af];B[ab];W[db]C[HK:  White 86.  C14 first.]
;B[cf];W[cg];B[bd];W[bg];B[ca]C[HK:  Black got very big profit in the top left corner, but white still seems to have a slight lead.]
;W[gg]C[HK:  White 92.  White might be sure of his advantage, but the move is too slolid. It must be F6 or F7.]
;B[fm];W[el];B[em];W[dm];B[gk];W[gj]C[HK:  Black get back in the game now because of the white's slack move G13.  It's now important to keep concentration for black.]

(;B[fk]C[HK:  Black 99.  It must be H10 hane.

Let's try a variation.];W[fj];B[ek];W[dk];B[bq];W[bp];B[ap]
;W[ao];B[aq];W[kr];B[jr];W[od];B[oc];W[rk]C[HK:  White S9.  White should connect at B5.]
;B[bo];W[bm];B[an];W[ro];B[qo];W[sn];B[rp];W[re];B[sd];W[rd]
;B[rc];W[kn];B[mr]C[HK:  Black 125.  Black should block at K6.]
;W[js];B[is];W[ks];B[hr]C[HK:  Black H2.  Black should cut at O3.]

;W[oj];B[pm]C[The rest of the game is not recorded.

white wins by 12.5

HK:  White has a slight lead.  But I can't understand why black lost with so much points.
