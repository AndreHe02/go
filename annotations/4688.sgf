C[Hi,
This is a game I played recently on kgs (I played black). I think one of the main reasons I lost it may have been the way I didn't deal with the white invasion into my high chinese framework. I often find that I get too attached to the idea of a framework becoming territory directly - either it does and my opponent gets more, or it doesn't and I don't get anything in exchange. So I'd be pleased to know how I could have dealt with this better, and in general whether there were better ways to play in the opening.

Thanks!

(;B[fc];W[hd];B[fe]LB[hb:A]C[e: I wasn't really sure how to deal with this pincer. Jumping out seemed to work better with the black stone in the top right than a 3-3 invasion.

N: normal move i think];W[df];B[db]C[e: Aiming to settle];W[cc]
;B[hb]
(;W[nc]LB[ge:B][qf:A]TR[hb]C[N: not sure wether this is the right direction to invade, because the triangled sone is low, the upper side is less interesting i think. Also better play the probe first]

(;B[lc]LB[hb:A]C[e: I chose this pincer to work with the black group in the top left, expecting white to run out.

N: Wrong direction i think, see previous comment. In each case your reasoning is not good, your goal can not be to capture the single white stone because you already played A in a low position.]

(;W[ke];B[jd];W[md];B[je];W[kf];B[ng]LB[mf:A]C[e: I don't like the look of this move much now. My aim was to put some pressure on the white group, but it seems strong anyway so maybe it's best to tenuki. I also considered something around r13 but this seems very slow.

N: this move looks good, aiming at A in the future];W[jf]
(;B[he]TR[df][dp]C[e: Perhaps I should tenuki? This could be me getting too attached to small areas of territory again...

N: yes, i think it is very important to tenuki first here, the left side has two high stones, playing here is urgent.]
;W[ie];B[id];W[if];B[ge];W[lb]
(;B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[mc];B[ic]C[N: now it is clear that you invested to many stones, even ending in gote]
;W[pl]
(;B[ql]TR[ng]C[e: Perhaps attaching on top is better? White is clearly going to get something here, so is it better to emphasise strength on the outside rather than taking points?

N: i think so, see variation, it would also work better with the marked stone.]
;W[qk];B[qm];W[pj];B[ok];W[ph]C[N: vital point];B[qi]
(;W[pi];B[qh]C[e: r10 better? I was getting a bit worried about the group in the top right.

N: this is best];W[qj]C[N: heavy]
(;B[qg]TR[ng]C[N: bad move, you could connect to the marked stone, now the invasion is a succes for white]
;W[ni];B[nj];W[mi]
(;B[nm]C[N: this looks slow, and bad shape]
(;W[mj]
(;B[gh]C[e: This is an effort to reduce white's influence in the centre. But maybe playing on the left would have been better.

N: i think so too, the left side is wide open, and you play very close to a rock solid group, as if all the territory is almost white, and you induce white to take territory on the fourth line, this can not be good]
;W[di]
(;B[cn];W[cl]
(;B[fq]C[N: i think it was possible to jump in the corner, that way you will end in sente, and the variation is a bit simpler]

;B[bm];W[bl]C[e: I wasn't happy with this result - white gets a lot of profit on the left and the top. Maybe I chose the wrong approach?

N: the bottom is still quite open]
(;B[gj]C[e: Too slow?

N: absolutely];W[cm];B[bn];W[fp];B[hp]TR[fp]C[e: Looking at this now, it seems to be a very bad idea. Playing near thickness... I felt that I needed to take risks though.

[last comment\]

N: your main mistake is that you first allowed white to reinforce with the marked stone, better to have played here right away. Now it looks quite deep.]
