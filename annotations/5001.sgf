AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[ Howdy ! :-)
This game show a little fear about new moves you never saw before. If you see a new move ask you two questions: 
1. What do the opponent want with this move?
2. What can i do to prevent the plan of my opponents move?

And then choose the best move which prevent best.
In the game you make also a lot of moves wich makes your opponent stronger. If you want to attack a stone don`t touch him. 

I hope you enjoy it :)];W[mp];B[jp];W[qn]TR[oo][qo][qp][nq]
C[Wasn't at all familiar with this. was thinking "huh? Never seen that one before. Moving out doesn't seem too good, and I don't want to touch or just leave it as it is." So, after considering all of the marked points...

Reviewer: Moving out doesn't seem good? Why?
                       The goal here for you is to divide your opponent
                        stones in two.]
(;B[qp]C[... I eventually settled on the iron post. Was this a good idea?

 I don't think so. In a handycap game, white want to shut you to the corners and build outside thickness to make several attacks. Here, you do what white wants.]
;W[oo]C[Again, I wasn't familiar with this, but I didn't want to let him stay connected and keep me boxed in, so I did my best to cut.

 This is funny. R4 Says: "Please connect your stones", but after that you want to cut him. Here is a good example for vital points. "The vital point of your oppenent is also your vital point." Here, P5 is the vital point. R4 should be at P5 to cut (your aim) these two stones (now three :) ).
If you cut now you can`t get a good result.]
(;B[no];W[op]C[Here, I thought "oops. Maybe I should have cut the other way". Which would be better?

 Yes, I would also say "oooooops" :-)
      I think, the best result was simply to live in the corner (as in the previous variation). Here, you make white a very strong shape. White is very happy.]
;B[oq];W[nq];B[or];W[nr];B[qr]C[I was pretty happy with this shape.

 You are happy?
I would cry. You must live with few points in the corner and white is very stong.Also, you end in gote. How can that be good for you?]
;W[gp]
(;B[dm]C[I also considered k7, but it looked funny to me, so I played d7, thinking to push out if w moved to enclose me.

Yes, D7 is the correct idea.];W[jn];B[io];W[hm];B[go];W[fo]

(;B[ep]C[This, in retrospect, was a mistake. I think I should have played d3 instead.

 D3 can work, yeah.];W[bp]
(;B[cq]C[
You should prevent the cut at c7];W[bq];B[cr];W[cm]
(;B[fp]C[Here I gave up the three stones on the right and decided to try to prevent  w from making too much on the bottom. I think e5 first might have been better, enabling me to strengthen the g6 group while making w's shape bad, if w decided to go for the left, or save the three, if w went for the bottom. What do you think?

E5 first can be very dangrous because you destroy one liberty of black]

(;B[rj]C[Too small. Something in the c13-14 region instead?

 Yes, because white have a wall at c9 so white c14 is very good for white. You should prevent w c14 with a move of you at c14 :)]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[hc]C[ wow, a very risky attack....]

(;B[hd]C[ There is one fundamental rule for attacking a stone or a group: "Don`t touch what you are attacking"

A contact play like H16 means that you want to defend one of you group....but there is nothing to defend :)
With this contact play you make white stonger than a non-touching move.]

I'm pretty sure this is my game losing move, here. The rest is just me coming to realize that j4 was a mistake and resigning.
