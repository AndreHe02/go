RE[W+21.5]

C[malveaux: I played Black in this even game, and lost handily.  I know a few blunders i made, at B#53, #91, #191, and #209. Please  feel free to point out some of the others.  Also, if it's not too  much trouble, i have a few questions, at moves 21, 29, 78, 91, 121,  and 174. Thank you,  - Mike Malveaux  <mm@foxinternet.net>]
;B[dp];W[qc];B[pp];W[cd];B[fd];W[jd]C[malveaux: Sorry, i know it's not joseki, but i don't really know joseki yet]
;B[dc]LB[cc:A]C[asobu: I think joseki is overrated.  You learn more if you play what you think is good, and find out if it works.

'A' is one of the joseki variations for the two point high kikari.  You should know a few josekis.  Not that you want to play the joseki moves blindly, but rather you should attempt to understand the joseki moves.  If you don't know any joseki moves, you have many variations to consider and it will cut down your chance to find the correct move in a timed game.  Besides, many joseki moves are tesuji moves, and you can learn from them.]
;W[de];B[hc]LB[cc:A][dg:B]C[asobu: Of course, I lose a lot that way ;)

'A' gives you better eyespace because it's a corner move.  Besides, it makes the two white stones eyeless and black can look forward to an attack with 'B'.]
;W[qn]C[malveaux: Oh good... i'm not the only one then];B[dg]
LB[cc:A]C[Again, 'A' is more urgent.];W[cf]LB[cc:A][cg:B]C[White should play 'A'.  The game move induces black to play 'B', strengthening  black on the left side.]
;B[cg];W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[db];W[bg];B[bh];W[bf];B[dn]LB[ci:A]
[bi:B][ch:C]C[malveaux Q: At this point, i feel like Black is doing ok  in the fuseki.  Since fuseki is generally a big weakness for me,  please make any comments.

'A' is proper although it seems slow.  By skipping this move, black makes his line rather thin.  For example, white can cut at C when the ladder works for him.  Or he can clamp at 'B' for an invasion.  Please see the variation for this move.

From a fuseki perspective, black is doing fine.  For the upper left exchange, black gets some thickness on the left side and some territories on the upper side.  In return, white only gets a few points in the corner.]

(;W[pj]LB[nq:A][pd:B]C[White should punish black for not answering the kikari by playing 'A'.  I suppose white wants to a build a moyo on the right and upper sides with the game move.  However, his upper right stone is on the 3-3 point and black can dash white's hope of a big moyo by playing 'B'.]
;B[jq]LB[np:A][nq:B][jp:C]C['A' or 'B' is better.  If you want to play around the game move, then play 'C'.  Please see the two variations to determine why the game move isn't proper.]

(;W[nq]LB[qq:A]C[With the above reasoning, you can see 'A' is better for white.]

(;B[oq]LB[pn:A]TR[qn]C[The marked stone is strong and the O3 stone is weak.  In a double kakari situation, a general rule of thumb is to attach the strong stone (making it stronger doesn't hurt) to build up strength.  Then attack the weak stone (O3).  Please see the variation.]
;W[np];B[on]C[This is thin.  It gives white a chance to separate this stone from the corner.]
;W[kp]
(;B[kq]C[malveaux Q: Is L3 the right direction? Is K4 better?

K4 is better.  It could give you a moyo on the lower left.  Please see variation.]

Yes, P8 is better.];W[pl]C[malveaux: ouch
malveaux: well, given how you're fighting, i think that's probably the game. do you mind continuing anyway?
asobu: I don't think that the game is over yet.  Let's keep going.]
;B[ok]LB[pk:A][om:B][ol:C]C[Simply capturing the white stone at 'A' is better.  Now white can play 'A' to capture the three black stones.  If black plays 'B' next, white can play 'C' to split black.]

(;W[om];B[pk];W[mm]TR[nm]C[White wastes this move.  The marked black stone isn't worth anything.]

;B[qg];W[pf];B[mh]LB[rg:A][pg:B]C[Play 'A' to force and then 'B' to connect.  If white cuts at 'B', he could make lots of territory.]
;W[ng];B[mj];W[pg];B[nl]LB[mg:A][ki:B][li:C]C[This is a useless stone.  Don't save it.  I will play 'A' to force and then jump out at 'B'.  Otherwise the peep by white at 'C' is annoying.]
;W[ml];B[ol];W[pm]LB[on:A][mg:B]C[malveaux Q: In retrospect, Black P8 does not look like a  threat.  White doesn't need to connect, does he? Would White be  better playing somewhere like N9 or K10 ?

White doesn't need to connect.  Even after black captures the Q7 stone, white simply plays at 'A' to connect.  Black cannot make an eye here by capturing.  White should play at 'B' for two purposes:  to play it first or else black can play here for a forcing move, and secondly expanding his territory on the upper side.

A key point here.  When you attack your opponent's group, your aim is to make some profit, although you can kill your opponent's group once in a awhile.  Clearly white is on the offense here.  Where's his profit for this attack?  The upper side.]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[mf];W[me];B[ne];W[of];B[le];W[md];B[ld]TR[jd]
C[Because white failed to play at N13, you can see how much his upper right has been reduced.  Besides, his marked stone is now isolated.]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[nd];B[kc]TR[de]LB[ci:A]C[malveaux Q: This should be at O17, i think.  I don't  know if White was being soft on me, but now I feel like  Black's left-facing thickness is a reasonable trade for  White's huge upper right corner / right side. Is that  right, or is White way ahead?

Yes, O17 is better.    Because of white's mistake at Q7, his upper right has been reduce significantly.

White has about 40 points on the right side, 7 points on the upper left, and maybe 15 points in the center, plus 4 captured stones with a 5.5 komi, yielding around 70 points.

Black has about 10 points on the lower right, and about 20 points for the upper side for a total solid territory of 30 points.  Can make black make up the 40 point difference with his thickness?  I prefer white at this stage because of (1) the possibility of the white's marked stone jumping into black's moyo, and (2) the 3-3 point invasion at the lower left, and (3) the aji around 'A'.]
;W[nc];B[lb]C[malveaux: hmm, i should've atari'd once more
asobu: probably

Right,  this is small.  Black should take the sente to play at one of the 3 points mentioned earlier.]
;W[mk]LB[kk:A]C[malveaux: too much caffeine, not enough sleep
asobu: heh

White is just helping black to make territorry on the upper center.  If he wants to play in this area, avoid contact with black and play 'A'.  This move also makes territory for white at the lower center.]

The three marked stones look vulernable.  Play 'A' to defend before you can attack.]

malveaux: yep];W[ip]LB[hp:A][in:B]C[Try to avoid a move like this by white.  It forces black to play 'A', which makes a good shape for him.  A move around 'B' is better.]
;B[hp]C[malveaux Q: I would like any comments on handling fights like  the one that takes up the next 25 or 30 moves, please. I feel like  Black got a bad result since White was not sealed off from the left  side / center.]

Sealing white at 'B' is better than blocking at A'.  Please see variation.]

;B[df];W[ed];B[dd]C[malveaux: Yet another blunder. It seems like if instead of  trying to kill the whole corner, Black simply defends at F17,  then the game is very close -- Black might win by a point or two.
