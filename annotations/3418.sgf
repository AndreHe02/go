C[Hi, I an unsatisfied by this game, because I believe that I played very well in the beginning, but in some points I felt like I was in an advantage only because the opponent played a bad move.

I think my main problem is a wrong attitude towards the game, so please take note of that while looking at the game.

Well - all advantages are caused by bad moves by the opponent. The best we can hope to do is to maintain them - by avoiding bad moves ourselves!

In general both players here were too anxious to attack and omitted to defend]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]LB[pj:A]C[An aggressive move - likely to lead to a big fight in the corner.

However both players follow a peaceful line

A is more common];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj];W[qj]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[ql]C[At this point there are still 57 pro games on Gobase that follow your pattern exactly!]
;W[qg]C[Now down to 14 pro games];B[mc]C[Now we are tracking just one game...]
;W[qn]LB[rd:A]C[In the professional game that you have followed up to now white played A. Preferring to strengthen his group rather than start a fight which risked weakening it.]
;B[pn];W[qp]LB[qm:A][po:B][qo:C][qq:D]C[Not the usual move - normally one would expect one of the points marked A-D]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[po]LB[qq:A]C[white should play A next]
(;W[rm]LB[qm:A][qq:B]C[An unusual move since it allows black a choice of A or B more usual is white B - see variation]
;B[qm];W[rn];B[rl]C[Here I was unsure if it's better to turn here than to play R3 in sente and make an extension on the bottom.
At the end I decided to play here, because it makes R10 weak.

R3 looks better to me because you leave the cut at Q7 (F17 breaks the ladder)]
;W[qq]C[Correct];B[pq]C[Correct]
(;W[oj]LB[oj:A][kq:B]C[Wrong - white needs to secure his corner  first - see variation]

(;B[jq]LB[pm:A]C[This would be a good move but for the weakness at  A.
Also white can compress black's corner in sente first see variations on this move and the one before.]

(;W[jc]C[Way off target from white the moves mentioned earlier are still urgent.]
;B[bp]C[ditto for black];W[cq];B[bq];W[fo];B[in]TR[pm][pr][qr]
C[This move looks very funny to me, do you think I should have played at K5 instead?

Both players are STILL ignoring the vital points marked

AFTER these issues are sorted then the move you played looks reasonable]

(;W[lo]C[a bit too deep if the black wall is sound 


(which it isn't because the cut at Q7 would still have worked and the push at Q2 would improve whites corner and take a few points from black in sente see variation)]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[lq];W[ho]C[ G4 wasn't really a fire and forget kikashi better to follow up with black g5]
;B[pk]C[not a good peep];W[ok]LB[pj:A][ok:B]C[If you play the peep then you should be prepared to follow through at A otherwise its a loss because B is a good stone for white]
;B[io];W[ip];B[jp];W[hp]C[Here I felt that white is unreasonable. Because white needs to run with M5, right?

White can utilise M5 in sente - the stone itself doesn't matter if white can get into black's moyo]
;B[lm]C[White can still get out  if he plays correctly see variation later]
;W[om];B[pm]
(;W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[nm];W[on];B[ol]C[White has missed the line here]
;W[nl];B[pl];W[nq];B[pr];W[qr];B[nk];W[ml];B[mk];W[ll];B[kl]
;W[lk];B[lj];W[km];B[kk]C[White has messed up badly here and should have resigned at this point.

Only bad mistakes by Black let him back in 

The game has become scrappy from here on so only a few comments]
;W[jm]
(;B[kn]C[better to play at M6 - see variation];W[ln]
(;B[jn]C[So far white isn't doing well, and I don't think I made any critical mistakes so far.

You did - but white didn't exploit them.

This is terrible shape - L5 is correct];W[im];B[hm]C[It seemed that white wants to save those stones, so I decided to have alittle fun...]
;W[il];B[hl];W[ik];B[hk];W[ii]
(;B[qs]LB[hj:B][qs:A]C[Here I was getting greedy. I played this move as preparation to connect at O2.

Yes - you MUST connect at H6 - you can't kill white's corner with correct play.

Connecting at O2 is pointless - white has not enough room for eyes anyway and once connected to the outside via H6 black's stones will win the fight]
;W[rr];B[rs];W[hn];B[nr];W[kp];B[jo];W[kq];B[kr];W[lr];B[jr]
;W[mr]C[The funny thing is, that I read all of this even when I played S2.

You mean S1 ?

If you read this - why did you play it - its terrible for you?]
;B[lp]C[Oh NO - forcing white to  do what he wants and giving up a Ko threat]
;W[ko];B[mp];W[np];B[no];W[mq]C[I haven't been paying too much attention to the game right now. I tend to lose interest when the positions get messy.]
;B[oo];W[mo]TR[in][jn][kn][io][jo][jp][jq][jr][kr]C[White live  - courtesy of black  - and the triangled stones die]
;B[sp]C[By my count I can still win this game, so I decided to go on.

It now depends on the top right];W[sq];B[rp];W[hj];B[re];W[pj]
;B[mg]LB[of:A][pf:C][og:B]C[This is too close to your stronger stones and too far from white A,B or C look better]
;W[nf];B[mf];W[od];B[oc];W[pe];B[qd]C[You are playing too submissively here - you need to kill this group  or cut off K17 to win]
;W[nd];B[nc];W[md];B[ld];W[rf];B[qf];W[pf];B[qe];W[ng];B[nh]
;W[oh];B[mh];W[rk];B[sl]C[Here I started to feel decieved, because although white made all my corner territory safe, he got a big area himself quite easily, I still have bad aji around M15.

White's stones have bad shape - he need to deend]
(;W[je];B[me];W[lc];B[ne];W[oe];B[pg]C[Here white resigned. But I don't think he should have.

Probably not - if he can save the main part of his group he should win!]
