C[aheimlich: hello reviewer. I feel like I've been playing too
aggressive lately. Even though I won this game, I think its a
good example (not to mention a really fun game).  Any thoughts
on how I might calm it down a bit?  I played black.

Hope you enjoy my game, and thanks in advance for your help :-)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[dj];B[fd]LB[cf:B][fc:A]C[aheimlich: correct direction?  I usually play white, and have
trouble making use of black fuseki.

MP: At this stage you are free to play what you like best yourself.

Normally Black plays at 'A'. But this high approach is playable
as well.

What you should not do is to play at B and create a weak group
for no reason.];W[hc]LB[df:A]C[White 8 is a new move move to me. Normally White always play
at 'A'. Perhaps black skuld now play a counter pincer with 'A'.]
;B[dc]C[I think white should play the inside hane, e17, otherwise the
pincer attack become meaningless.]
(;W[cc]LB[ec:A]C[This is not an oppurtunity to increase complexity rather the
opposite. If black simply plays at 'A' then White has a lot of
problems: a thin shape on the left and a single stone that can
be attacked severly immediately.];B[cd];W[ec];B[db]TR[fd]C[Here White should play simple. Connecting the white stones separates
the original black stone and make it look rediculous, thats why
crosscutting probably was a bad idea in this situation. See the
variation.]
(;W[cb];B[eb];W[fc];B[ed];W[de];B[gc];W[ce]TR[hc]C[An equal split but white should not be happy because the original
pincer is misplaced, against a strong black group.];B[fq];W[hq]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[go];B[gf]C[This move should be one stone to the left. This move has too
little effect on the moyo of white.];W[gb]TR[fd][ed]C[This helps black getting an even stronger shape. That is "aji
keshi" - removing potential/possibilities. Because it gives extra
liberties to the marked stones.];B[fb];W[gd];B[ef];W[nd];B[kc]
;W[pf];B[oe];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd]C[This is not normal - White should try to connect on the other
side.]
(;B[re];W[rc]C[See the variations for some crude tactics.]
(;B[qe];W[ob];B[oc];W[nc]C[You  could play Q18, to get better shape. Unfortunately black
cannot play O18 to cut white into two because white can play
atari on p17. The best here is perhaps the vulgar move Black
q17 because then black is guaranteed a peep at N18 before playing
elsewhere.]
(;B[od]TR[pe][pc][pd][oe][oc]C[This is terribly ugly! A double empty triangle. If you want to
make a move that look like this, you should say to yourself  "this is wrong, this is wrong,... " ten times or so and the look
for a better move.];W[mb]TR[kc]C[White resist and connects on large scale.

This make a big difference compared to if black had played a
peep here first. The marked stone is and weak and even if black
catches the upper side, white can play a monkey jump to k19.]

(;B[fc]C[Play on the outside first. If white captures your stone you get
two moves in  a row.];W[ib]TR[ob][nd][nc][mb]C[Better play a one space jump straight up. it looks like you are
atacking the strong marked white stones which goes against the
logic of go.];B[le]C[White could play something like N14 to create complications first
and make a mess of both the upper side and the right side.]
;W[pi]
(;B[qh]C[This is like putting an atomic submarine into a small lake. It
is a powerful move shapewise, but it is played on the wrong occasion.

If the white group is surrounded then a move like this could
be the killing blow. Or if white is forming a large territory
then it is also a good move to erase that territory. But here
it looks very inefficient.]
(;W[po];B[np];W[pm]
(;B[qp];W[ok]C[58 is bad];B[pj];W[ph]TR[ok]C[Very bad. The marked stone cannot be left like this. White should
play R11 and pray to the go gods for some help in the coming
fight.];B[qi]C[Black is very lucky... in the end all black stones on the right
side are perfectly placed. And white is cut up into three! (although
p9 perhaps should not count as a group yet) eyeless groups. But
this is because white was kind to black...];W[ne]C[Strong move, it just shows that white should have played something
like this immediately instead of helping black on the right side.]
;B[nf];W[of];B[ng];W[nh]C[It is easy to cut white into two large weak groups later. It
is better to be patient  right now and perhaps simply defend
at M12.

Do not try to play "strong" moves when you own stones are not
strong on their own.]
(;B[oh];W[oi];B[og]C[Bad since it provokes q13 which gives White a lot of strong aji
on the right side.];W[pg]TR[nh]C[The marked stone is not important anyway so spending moves on
cutting it is bad on principle and here it is tactically terrible
since white simply captures the cutting stone... it should be
the opposite.]
(;B[ni];W[mh];B[lg];W[lh];B[kg];W[nj]C[aheimlich: I saw some trouble coming a bit before this, where
did it start?

You tried to hurt white with complicated tactics. When one has
not completely read out the results of such an attack it is almost
always the case that white will get away with profit.

Try to attack on large scale with moves that both defends your
weaknesses and let the opponent initiate desperate tactical measures
and then pick up profit naturally.];B[cg];W[ci];B[ch];W[kq]
;B[bd]TR[ch][cg]C[aheimlich: here comes some of that aggressive behavior. Any easier
way to get 30 points?

MP: No this was a very clever sequence. It could have surprised
me too. This is not aggressiveness it is more like a surgeon
amputating a leg.   Note here why your sequence worked: You prepared it by attacking
from a distance by playing the marked stones, c12 and c13, that
in themselves are good moves locally because they take some territory.
and make yourself stronger. If you had  played 81 immediately
it had not worked.   In a way this is a perfect example of how you should play in
comparison to what happened on the right side.

It took you two moves to prepare the attack and then your opponent
have no chance to escape without a sacrifice.];W[be];B[bb];W[bc]

;B[ol]C[This is perhaps not a good ko threat since if white cuts black
has lost a liberty. On the other hand black might want to cut
here in sente anyway.]
(;W[ba]C[This is too early because White have some perfect local ko threats.
See the variations for this.];B[nl];W[nn]TR[dl][en][gp]C[One alternative idea is to play a diagonal attachment at m4,
and plan to cut at g4 later in this fight. Also an invasion on
the left side should be on the wishlist.]
(;B[mn]C[Complicated, I cannot tell if it works or not.];W[no]
;B[mo];W[mp]C[Do not peep on strong shape if you cannot cut. That is: p4 is
meaningless, it is better placed at o3 because that will threaten
to capture the white cutting stone at n4. It is also better from
an endgame point of view.

(Or perhaps you are simply very strong for it might be good in
a semeai as happened in the game. I would play o3 any way because
then I am 100% sure my opponent will be bothered of it)];B[op]
;W[mm];B[nm]TR[nl][mn]C[Now it is complicated again...

Note that if white captures one of the marked stones it might
make the attack a waste of resources, the japanese term is "amari
katachi". It is like punching the opponent quickly 20 times in
a row without hitting in a boxing match and finally become exhausted
unable to lift your arms.];W[ml];B[mk]

(;W[lm];B[jp];W[iq];B[oo];W[on];B[qo];W[bp]C[White is threatning to kill an entire corner. White could simply
capture the corner and and sacrife the stones in the upper right

(;W[mi];B[lj];W[nk]TR[dj][jm]C[These black stones are to heavy to get away. They cannot live
locally and running away is not possible since the escape route
ends with white stones.

Black must play more subtle to succeed here.

(;W[kr];B[hr];W[nq]C[When you kill, try to make the eyespace as small as possible

If the group lives then you have at least profited from making
it live small. See the variations for some ideas.
(There are also exceptions to the rule of reducing eyespace first
among those variations that are interesting to study)

[I made a mistake first I did not see the atari at c3. Which
it make it impoosible to kill here netherthe less you can look
at hte variations. Some of them does not work because of my mistake.
But they are good examples if add a black stone at q4.]

C[The cut at j6  is, nothing less but  crazy because if white cuts
at d14 all black stones on the left side are eyeless and white
wins easily.

monkey jump at k19 or m19]

It is sort of a double trap. If white sees the first trap, then
white falls for the next!

This kind kind of aggressive tactics is rather risc free. The
safe way of playing would be to connect near d14, but as long
as black is playing moves white must answer it is ok to do so.]

[aa]C[Black is very strong in tactics, still this game was quite close
in the end despite numerous tactical successes for Black.

The thing here is that black has perhaps been a little spoiled
by tactical superiority and knows that the results of a fight
is almost always good if it get complicated.
But against slightly stronger players this will not work very
well.


I have pointed out a lot of mistakes of white because if these
had not been made then Black would not have survived in this
game. Many Balck moves did not work because they were simply
too complicated and played too early before proper preparation
or just simply unreasonable.

Still there were some good examples of black playing moves that
worked. Black won and this is the reason. I have also tried to
point out the resons for why these moves worked in those cases,
black played well, and white did not give it away for free.

* Patience is a virtue.
* Do not go for the kill until you have it read out - or you
have no choice.
* If you have no choice - think again - perhaps there is a
choice after all. Think "leaning attack" instead of "cut" and
"capture".
* Think big. It is winning the game that counts. Not winning
every *possible* fight. Fight every possible fight in your head
then choose a *safe* strategy, that take advantage of what you
saw in your head. Do not play it out on the board just to see
what happens.

Good luck! Hope these comments are helpful.])
