dear reviewer,

hello, i am jasmine 3k at igs. thanks for your reviewing.

in this game, i take black and find somewhere confused, while at last lose. i have reviewed it myself, and put some questions forward to request your guide. after your finishing evaluating all of my moves, would you please point out in which field should i improve myself most urgently and what is the best way?

your assistance will be greatly appreciated.

sincerely,

forfun (ff) - Hi Jasmine. Thanks for giving me the chance to review your game.  It was quite interesting.  I've tried to point out a few things as I saw them and to address your questions.  I also added quite a few variations without too many comments - hopefully the stones speak for themselves.  If there are any points that are unclear, feel free to send me a follow-up question or two.  Look at my variations with a critical eye - there are mistakes to be found there (my own games are full of them!).]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[po]LB[cp:A][qq:B][np:C][oq:D]C[i had wanted to occupy the left-lower coner with A(c4). but if w plays B(r3) or C(o4) to attack my q3 stone after that, it will be same as the sequence: black A, white 4, black 3. i am afraid, in the above sequence, it seems a little hot-headed for black to approach white's coner by 3, because as the game goes, black may find it is better to approach at B(r3) or D(p3).

how do you think of my thought?

ff - You may be thinking about the one corner too much here.  Let's see what happens...]

(;B[qo]LB[qn:A][qp:B][pm:C][nq:D][qi:E]C[i play 5 in order to force the sequence from A to E, then get sente to occupy the left-lower coner.

and i have calculated out if white plays q4 (see variation please).   how do you think of my thought?

ff - In a sense you are thinking that the LL corner (empty) is more valuable than the UR where you already played.  You are trying to push white toward the UR in order to play first in the LL.]

(;W[qn];B[qp]
(;W[pm]LB[dp:A][nq:B]C[because white's shape of 4, 6 and 8 is flexible, i worry about it's A(q4) after my B(o3). so i want to make it heavy and can not get sente in the right side to occupy the left-lower coner.

how do you think of my thought?

ff - Another way to think is that a play at B will make it hard for white to develop from the LL so perhaps black should not worry.]
;B[on];W[oo];B[rn]
(;W[no]C[ff - More usual is O6.];B[rm];W[dp]C[ff - White has paid a big price to play here first.]

(;B[nr]LB[nq:A][mq:B]C[i think black's 15 is necessary for preventing white' enclosure from the left and can make white's 12 group and 14 stone less influential.

i choose 15 instead of A(o3), because white's 4, 10, and 12 stones are too strong, and can enclose black by B(n3).

how do you think of my thought?

ff - See the variation.];W[mq]C[but unfortunately white's n3 is still critical.]

(;B[mr]C[ff - White N2 instead would have no effect on black.  Black should play away.]
;W[kq];B[cn];W[cl]
(;B[fp]C[i play 21 and want to lead to the following sequence to impair white's thickness(see variation please).

how do you think of my thought?

ff - A reasonable way of thinking.  But realize that white's lower side can never be so big since black has already pushed in at N2.  Also see the addition to your variation, it might not go as you expected.]

(;W[dn];B[dm];W[en]LB[cm:A]
(;B[cm]C[i think white's 24 is not good, it should cut at A(c7), so i connect.

how do you think of my thought?

ff - I think that you have changed your plan to use F4.  In Go we always have to flexibly adapt to what our opponent plays but in this case giving up your strategy to try for a tactical gain may not be best.]
;W[co]
(;B[dl]LB[em:A][fn:B][cq:C][dq:D]C[i think i(black) should push at A(e7) to make the 25 group stronger and get more liberties, but worry about white's answer at B(f6) will damage my 21 stone.   after  the exchange of black's A and white's B, when black plays C(c3), white can answer at D(d3), which make black's 21 stone dead and the bottom territory of white.

how do you think of my thought?
ff - See the variation]
(;W[ck];B[di]C[i think black's 29 is the critical point of this kind of shape.

how do you think of my thought?

ff - I like this play too.];W[dk];B[cq]C[black's 31 intend to make a big exchange, which i think is in favor of black (see variation please).

ff - See my comments in the variation.]
(;W[bp];B[ek];W[ej];B[dj]
(;W[fk]LB[el:A]C[i have not noticed white's 36, which i think should be A(e8) instead.   which one is better for white and severer for black, 36 of A(e8)?

ff - This doesn't seem to work.  See the variation.  E8 would be much better.]
;B[el];W[fl];B[bl];W[bk];B[fm]C[i do not know whether black can escape by 39 and 41.

what about your opinion how to capture black's big group?

ff - White's idea looks impossible, white is too optimistic.]
;W[gm];B[fj];W[fn]C[ff - This is the wrong idea.  E10 is the key stone.  Now F9 makes no sense.]
;B[ei];W[eq]C[black captured white's 40 group, but in sente or in gote i am not sure, while white secure it's left-lower coner and make it's moyo thicker.

i am not satisfied with this result and prefer the result in the previous variation.   how do you judge this exchange and how to force white to the result i prefer?

ff - White's side group is small.  The real point is that E11 makes black very thick.  Now black should approach the UL from the top which will put white on the spot.  See the variation.  Another point is that B4 instead of B5 left white's stones on the left side weak.  Now white adds E3 as well.  This combination is over concentrated on the corner.]

(;B[cf]LB[fc:A]C[i try to capture white's 40 group in sente by my 47, but i think this move contravented the general theory of go: when i have the thickness of 29 group, i should approach white's coner by A(f17) instead of 47.

which point should i choose, 47 or A(f17)?

ff - F17, see the comment in the variation.  This C14 is much too narrow.]
;W[df];B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[ee];B[dg]
(;W[fd]C[ff - White doesn't need to be this careful (see variation) but shows a good understanding of the whole board.  Black's stones on the left are over concentrated.]
;B[bd];W[bc]C[i think i have achieved the goal of capturing the white's 40 group in sente, but white get chickness in the left-upper coner and top side at the same time.

how to judge the exchange of these moves?

ff - I think it is still in white's favor as noted.  Black has used the power from 45 to increase maybe 10 points while building up white.  The left side is not completely secure yet.]
;B[kc];W[ic]
(;B[pf]LB[qj:A][qk:B][nc:C][mc:D][nd:E]C[i play 59 to make the right side territory with one more move at A(r10) or B(r9), and alleviate white's invasion at C(017) or D(n17).

in fact, i had thought to play E(o16) instead of 59, which can make my upper side safer, but it has much less value to make the right side territory.

which point should i choose at this time, 59 or E(o16)?

ff - Because S13 is very low it is better to look to the top for territory - E (O16) is better here.]

(;W[mc]LB[nc:A]C[which point is better for white's invasion, 60 or A(o17)?

ff - Since black has played Q14, white needs to be concerned about Q8 next.  Black has no good play next at the top - if now black O16 the shape with Q14 is very strange.  So how about R12 for white?  See the variation...]
;B[oc]LB[ke:A]C[after the game, i ascribed my losing to 61, which should be instead by A(l15)?

how to deal with white' invasion at 60?

ff - Play 59 at O16 :-)
I think that 61 is a reasonable approach.  White is strong in the UL and in the lower side of the board.  It is not reasonable to think of capturing white.  So where will black make territory while chasing white - the right side.  This 61 is a good start.]
;W[ld];B[jd]
(;W[id]C[ff - This looks unreasonable - although it turns out very well in the game :-)
White only pushes black up against white's weak stones.]
(;B[jf]LB[je:A]C[too careless, should be A(k15) instead.

ff - Yes, this is a big mistake.  This 65 is the losing move, not 61 (P17).  If black came out at K15 white has to jump out.  Black's thickness on the left is closer than white's at the bottom.  Black will have the chance to chase white and make territory on the right side.]
;W[kd];B[qk]LB[qj:A]C[i had planed something in the upper side (see variation please), but it is not the proper time to carry out now. i want to secure my right side first and make thickness along the 9th or 10th line if possible, then return to the upper side.

how do you think of my stratagem above?

and another question, which point is better for the right side, 67 or A(r10)? 67 is better shape with 13, while A(r10) is better with 59.]

i am too greedy.];W[hb]LB[kb:A]C[now black should play at A(l18) to make a ko or escape with white left-upper coner damaged (see the 4 variations please).

even if white makes the 34 stone active by A(f11), B(e11) or C(f10), black does not have to warry about. because on one hand, it can make the 29 group stronger by D(b10) in sente; on the other hand, 37 group can escape toward black's 21 group or the center, while white also has it's 34 weak group, which runs one step slower than the black's 37 group.

(;W[jp]C[ff - This is more interesting to me.  White develops quickly if black continues on the right side.]

(;W[pn]C[ff - With black on Q16 I think that this is the more usual reply.]
;B[nq];W[pj]C[ff - Now white is ready to play in either the UR or LL...]

(;B[cp];W[qf]C[ff - White may play in the LL first but will be looking for the chance to complete the shape on the right side here.]

(;W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[qq];W[pn];B[qm];W[dp]C[ff - Normally white finishes the LR with O4.  In this case D4 looks good.]
;B[jp]C[ff - Black plays in to prevent white from making a framework on the lower side but it is not so easy to attack white.]
;W[hp]C[ff - Black has already played 5 stones to white's 4 in the LR.  If white can give up the 4 stones well, that's OK.]
;B[no];W[pm];B[ql];W[mo]C[ff - Now what for black?]

C[ff - Black has prevented white from taking the outside but white is well settled and black has a weak group left.]

(;B[cp]C[ff - If black goes ahead as planned and let's white take the initiative in the LR while taking the LL, how much can white gain?]
