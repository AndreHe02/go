Yann-

My name is Barry and I am rated about 10-11 kyu on KGS.  You played a good game even though you lost.  Your play seemed a little cautious, but that is not unusual for someone who isn't used to giving handicaps.

A good source for how to play handicap games is the Wings Across Calm Waters Go Club, an internet based go club.  They have
 a publication called how to play against stronger players and it is full of examples from handicap games.

 If you have any additional questions after reading the review please feel free to email me directly, or I could review another game for you.

Post review comment:  You played a nice game and except for a few errors.  You had a good plan and it would have been successful if you could have made a little more inroads on the center.  Keep up the good work.]

(;W[qd]C[I thought about R6, but didn't dare... Is it possible ? 
(See variations)
b: Yes, its possible, but there are better moves. While you sometines need to play risky moves in a handicap game to see what type of response you get, this is not the best time.   It is better for later in the game. 

One key to keep in mind in a handicap game when you play white is to be patient!  Give the other person time in the game to make a mistake and take advantage of it.  Don't make an obvious overplay early in the game.  You'll be surprised how many points you can make up in the later portions of the game.

The book Five Hundred and One Opening Problems gives the following general questions you should answer when deciding your move in the opening stages of a game..

1.  Is there an urgent move?
     a.  One that makes a base for your stone.
     b.  One that takes away the base of your opponent's stones.
     c.   One that takes the initiative in a certain area.

2.  Is there a big move? 
    a.  One that extends from your own position.
    b.  One that prevents an extension by your opponent.
    c.  One that threatens an invasion.
    d.  One that prevents an invasion.

3.   Is there a big moyo?
    a.  Do you need to expand or close off your moyo?
    b.  Do you need to erase or invade your opponents moyo?


and remember the motto: "Play urgent points before big points."]
;B[qc];W[qe];B[rc];W[qk];B[pl];W[rd]C[I feared monkey's slip

b:  A valid fear, but this move is better for later in the game.  Regardless of the potential Monkey Jump, you group is safe.  It is better to take sente and move the battle elsewhere.]
;B[pb];W[nq];B[or];W[oq];B[pq];W[nr];B[os];W[jp];B[no];W[mo]
;B[nn];W[fq]C[b: Nice move.  Your group is nice and solid.  You have good base from which to work.]

;W[dr];B[cr];W[fc];B[eb];W[dc]C[that was a misclick... I wanted to play E17, but well, let's try

b: This was the begining of an interesting ko fight.  Your misclick added some interesting possibilities.]

;B[oj];W[fb];B[cj];W[cf];B[mn]C[at that point I thought I'd be able to kill black in the top left... Was I dreaming ?

b:  You were right.  You could have killed black if you had moved in the corner before black. c18 kills black.]
;W[kc]C[b: nice extension.];B[lc];W[ld];B[md];W[jd]C[b:  Although your move makes good shape, I probably would have played at L16.  I don't see the advantage of the extension at k16 with your follow up move.  If you had followed up with L 15 and started a ko.......otherwise you just end up with over-concentrated stones.]
;B[le];W[kd];B[lb];W[kb];B[lf]
(;W[og]C[I played this to try and get out, but it didn't work well... What went wrong ?

b:   It would be very tough to try and get out of here.  However, I think your extension was too short.  Remember that you can play farther away from a wall and still keep from getting cut. (See var.)

You might have been able to get out with a sacrifice.];B[oh]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[qh];B[ng];W[of];B[nf];W[oe];B[od];W[nh];B[oi]
;W[lh]C[b: o12 is gone.  Take a look at the stone's position to see if it worth saving.  The cutting point does not put either of black's groups into danger, so it is best to let it go.]
;B[mh];W[mg];B[ni];W[lg];B[li];W[ke]C[b:  Don't crawl along.  Extend out.  Perhaps k13?  That would threaten to rescue the stones but extend your influence out further towards the center.]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[kh];W[fl]C[I gave up hoping to save them

b: good idea.  Never be afraid to give up small groups of stones for the bigger move.  Try to think whole board.]
;B[dl];W[ci];B[dj];W[di];B[ej];W[ei];B[fj];W[fi];B[gi];W[gh]
C[b:  F8 is getting into trouble.  Black is building up influence in the middle that will allow him to attack f8 and the bottom center.]
;B[hi];W[ih];B[ii];W[jg]C[I thought that was very good for me because I now had the top left, and I could probably force him to make a not-too-large territory in the center
.

b:  Good thinking, but don't wait too late.  It is a close game and you still have a chance.]
;B[kg];W[bj]C[I though it was sente... I intended to play f6 just after that

b:  It is only sente if your opponent can't afford to ignore it.  That move is not worth a lot, about 4 or 5 points.  How about  g6 or k7 instead?  Or finishing off the top left corner.]
;B[bk];W[bi];B[fn];W[hn];B[gm]
(;W[hl]C[b:the f8 stone is dead, better to leave it and try to play a little more solid.  See variation starting after previous move.]

;B[kj];W[lk];B[kk];W[nk];B[ok];W[qn]C[I was getting kind of desperate, I had to make some points before the end, so I tried invasion, hoping for a mistake...

b:No need to get desperate at this point.  Be patient and count.

Using the score estimater on Cgoban I get that black is only a half a point ahead.  Easily made up if white plays a good end game wihout mistakes.]

 b: Not if black plays correctly.
See the variation you did and some other I've added.];W[bd]
;B[ad]C[I think I could have killed as I do in the variation. Right ?

b: Not completely,  but black could have started a ko to live and win the game.]

(;W[cb];B[bb];W[ea];B[ca];W[ae];B[ac];W[be];B[da];W[fa];B[fd]
;W[gd]C[b:  the game is about over at this point.  In restrospect you made not have enough points even with the corner, but iw would have been close.  You played a good game but had a few costly mistakes that allowed black  a lot of center territory.  Keep the basics in mind and look for the biggest move every time.  Don't get caught up in a small battle and ignore the big picture.

This is the end of my comments.
