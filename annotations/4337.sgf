C[I have played earlier games with players around 15k and sometimes won them, but that's because I have had luck in killing
their big groups. In this game I didn't kill so much and I lost. I think my biggest weakness is playing fuseki as I don't know a single joseki.
I appreciate if you could sum up my weaknesses and strenghts in
the end. Thank you.];B[qd];W[cq];B[dd];W[qp];B[jp]LB[oc:A][od:B]
[op:C][oq:D][jq:E][kc:F][kd:G]C[[Calvin}: The corner is bigger than the side.  That makes moves like A, B, C, and D bigger than this wedge.  If you play the wedge, it's easier to make a base on the third line with E.  Another possible strategy for black is to start building a moyo with a low or high Chinese fuseki (F and G, respectively.)]
;W[do]LB[lq:A]C[[Calvin\]: White's direction is wrong.  The 3-3 stone is very strong, and it's more imporant for white to play from the weaker side.  A (M3) would probably be best.]

(;B[np]LB[op:A][oq:B]C[There must be more important moves than this. If I had played A, would white have played between my stones? Is it stupid move or
would i be in trouble then?

[Calvin\]: Your direction is correct.  This helps your K4 stone and makes it hard for white to make a shimari.  I think A and B are more common, though.]
;W[oq];B[nq]LB[pn:A][lp:B]C[[Calvin\]: Good for black.  White should have played the keima at A instead of P2, leaving black to fix the weakness at B later.]
;W[jd]LB[oc:A]C[[Calvin\]: White copies black's suboptimal wedge.   If white is going to play on the top side, A is the normal move.]
;B[fc]LB[lc:A][nc:B]C[[Calvin\]: Wrong direction.   If playing on the top side, black should play A to threaten white's base, or B to be territorial.  I'm not strong enough to say which is better, but F17 is definitely wrong.]
;W[od]LB[oc:A]C[[Calvin\]: Yep.  Do you see how black's F17 exchange has induced white to play in a spot black would like himself?   White can also consider A, since this is not a moyo game.]

(;B[qg]C[I always answer same way when white plays that move. I don't 
see any weeknesses, but is there better move or joseki.

[Calvin\]: Even if you don't know joseki, you should always consider more than one move.  To get stronger at the opening, you need to think about different options.  At my first lesson with my first go teacher, I was playing the opening very fast, and when he reviewed the game, he asked: "what other moves did you consider?" for many of the early moves.  I was embarrassed each time to admit that I was just playing what I knew locally and often didn't consider other options.   See variations.]

(;W[pc]C[[Calvin\]: Maybe you do well with your favorite move, R13, because it's not that common and your opponent's don't know how to respond!   Don't get used to it; it won't last long.]
;B[qc];W[md]C[[Calvin\]: A little overconcentrated for white.]

(;B[ic]C[I didn't like white to get whole top board and this move seemed to
strenght my corner.

[Calvin\]: Don't be jealous.  White has played 4 moves in the early opening to secure maybe 15 points of territory.   And you can still play a move like this in the endgame.  Black should look all over the board for the next move.]
;W[jc];B[id];W[dj]C[[Calvin\]: White's move is not that good.  Where's the moyo?]

(;B[dg]LB[cg:A][ch:B]C[Looking this game afterwards I'd play A. Better or does it matter.

[Calvin\]: It matters.   This is too close to your strong group and doesn't threaten white.  Locally, B is where you should be aiming, although I think you need to play on the bottom first.]
;W[qm];B[pj]LB[qj:A][gq:B][hq:C]C[I prefer A here too but isn't there too many stones in the third line?

[Calvin\]: Both white and black have strong, low positions on the right side.  When you see this, you should consider the area blighted.  Sometimes a professional will say this side is "uninteresting" and that means that because of the strength on both sides, neither players should make further plays in the area until the early endgame.  Balance is nice, but relative strengh of groups should drive your thinking.  Fourth line moves are for moyos and attacking.  Where's your moyo?  if you are attacking what's your target?   The area near B and C is  big.]
;W[hq]C[[Calvin\]: Now white has gets a moyo in sente.]
(;B[iq]C[[Calvin\]: White makes more if you kick like this.   See variation.]
;W[fq]LB[hp:A]C[[Calvin\]: This move dosen't exist.  A is proper here.]
;B[hp]C[[Calvin\]: Good!];W[hr];B[ir]LB[gp:A]C[A (G4) is better for shape and restricting white's moyo.  Don't just think about territory.]
;W[ce];B[cd]LB[cg:A]C[Is this right way to answer white's move.

[Calvin\]: What other moves did you consider?  Separating white's stone with A is also possible.]
;W[cg];B[df]SQ[fc][ic][id]LB[ch:A][cl:B]C[[Calvin\]: I know you want to stay connected, but playing in this direction gives white territory and makes you overconcentrated with respect to the marked stones.  I would hane at A (C12), and build strength to invade at B.]
;W[bh];B[cf]TR[dj][do]LB[dh:A]C[This move is small I know. I think, I should have played somewhere between marked stones, but I'm horrible at invasions so could you show me couple of variations here if possible.

[Calvin\]:  I think black could play at A (D12) directly, and save this push.]
;W[bf]LB[dh:A]C[Small move too I think.

[Calvin\]: If white hanes at A (D12), it reinforces the left side, so he would be happy to give up the stone.]
;B[je]C[[Calvin\]: Finally.  It's interesting to note that pros rarely leave this 2-on-2 position for long.  The first player to get ahead has an advantage.]
;W[ib];B[hb];W[jb];B[if]TR[dj]LB[ie:A][ke:B]C[I should have played somewhere near marked stone?

[Calvin\]: D12 is still sente, but here, connecting solidly at A (J15) is better.  If you like to fight, try B.  You should be able to handle the cut.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[be]
(;B[ei]TR[dg][cf][df]SQ[if][je][ic][id]C[I think this was too late because white can now attakc marked stones more easily.

[Calvin\]: This seems wimpy.  Also, a shoulder hit on a fourth line stone is a serious moyo move, and your marked thickness is too close.   See variation.]
;W[dh]C[As he/she tried to do.];B[eh];W[di]
(;B[ej]LB[fk:A]C[[Calvin\]: This is pushing from behind on the fifth line.   Instead, get ahead with the keima at A.]
;W[ek];B[em]LB[fk:A]C[[Calvin\]: A pushing battle is a game of chicken.  It's a do or die thing.   You have to hane at A (F9), otherwise, white will play there instantly.]

(;W[dm];B[fk];W[kj]C[Very important move for white. How i supposed to kill that as I'm
not very strong. This reduced my big mojo in center.

[Calvin\]: When something like this happens, take a deep breath and estimate the score.

Black: 15 points in the upper right, another 15 or so on the lower side, maybe 35-40 in the upper left, so almost 65-70 points plus clearly superior thickness.

White: 15 on the upper side, 15 in the lower right, and 45 on the right, plus komi, but that is only 0.5, so 75 points.  But white has a weak group and that's supposed to have negative value, so I think that game is close.

Now, do you have to kill white?  No. You just have to make another 5 points or more of profit, play the endgame well, and you may win.  Let's see what happens.]
;B[lf]C[I tried to prevent white from connecting.];W[qi];B[pi]
;W[rk]C[Why he/she played that?

[Calvin\]: Probably a misclick.]
(;B[om]LB[pm:A]C[[Calvin\]: I might play A.];W[mh]SQ[kj]C[[Calvin\]: The marked shape is not good for white.]

(;B[nf]LB[li:A]C[[Calvin\]: Maybe play A and let white connect the other stone.]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[og];B[of];W[kh]

[Calvin\]: In general, Black's tactics were better, but Black lost the game mostly due to a bad sense of direction and a lack of understanding of thickness.  One can see from the endgame position here that the pushing battle in the upper left gave more to white than black.  This is giving away points as surely as if your stones die.  One can also see that the moves 24 and 46 were huge for white.

When playing thick game, you cannot expect to be ahead immediately with some big kill.  You have to have patience and be willing to take your profits via attacking and have a tight endgame.  My teacher says that the great moyo player Takemiya Masaki 9p has a great endgame, and does not rely on kills.

Instead of studying joseki, to improve your opening it is important to study fuseki with joseki in context.  To this, play through the first 50 moves of many, many pro games to get a feel for the biggest areas and the appropriate direction.  Get to the point where you can replay the first 50 moves from memory of both pro games and your own games after going through them once.  For books, I would recommend Yilun Yang's "Fundamental Principles of Go" and the two-volume series "Whole Board Thinking in Joseki."   The fuseki is very difficult, so I recommend getting fuseki advice from a professional.]

But R13 is a little passive.  Surely black would hane at A?]
