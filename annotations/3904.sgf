C[hello kaktus/nikolai : )

I hope this commentary will prtove helpful, even if my english is not so fluent as i would like it to be.

During this game, both sides tryed to get lots of influence in the fuseki (- opening). Good to you, if you know how to use large moyo (- sphere of influence).

When you have a moyo, it is a threat to make it your territory, and generally your opponent would invade your moyo, and you wil invade his moyo too, BEFORE it transforms into a territory.

Have a good review !
; ) lapin

P.S. commentary after the review ;p

when one builds influence, it is a way to attack fiercely across the board. The game -- huh sorry, gthe battle -- begins at move 1. You should take each part separately : fuseki, chuban, yose. During the fuseki, you try tyo establish influence. During chuban - which do not begins at the first fight - you fight to establish borders. During yose, you try to keep up, even if an equilibrium is already established.
Good luck to u Kactus !];B[dc];W[qp];B[pd];W[dq]C[here white tries a shusaku opening. He should establish himself in the lower and right borders.

black has a flexible opening, he can claim territory on the top border, and with the hoshi he will certainly try to create influence]
;B[ce];W[jq];B[jd]TR[ip][iq]SQ[dj][pj]C[here both sides played thickening moves.

Black should've played k16 at one of the squared points, or an approach move in the bottom left. k16 seems a natural extention from the shimary, but it is played too early and the resulting position is overconcentrated.

White probalby wanted to obtain a chinese fuseki, thus the third stone should be at one of the triangled points. The aim would be to protect the left side, while preparing a shimari on the other side if black do nhot invade. The natural extention for white is then at q10.]
;W[oq]C[too early. The threat should be to plmay here later -- ie after playing k10.]
;B[dj]TR[pj][do]C[again, it seems to be a natural extention, BUT q10 seems more urgent, since it is the strong part of white territory.]
;W[cm]C[q10 is better for white too];B[bk]C[this move is gote - it loses the initiative.

One important rule in the fuseki : whenever possible, avoid moves on the second and first line in the fuseki.

q10 is very urgent for white now];W[dm];B[pj]TR[dm][jo]C[black now has a lot of stones aimed at influence, but whites stones are too low for an invasion.

It is reasonnable for black to try an erasure move like k5 (or even k6 or k7), since he will more probably able to eradicate white moyo if white protects this area arond k5]
;W[pk]TR[ok]C[here white wants to solidify the position.

if he manage to build a wall close to the bottom border, he may gets all this influance transformed into territory.

because of white low position, an invasion in white area is almost impossible now.

maybe black could continue the sequence with a p9 and try to penetrate white 's sphere.

Another option is the erasure move at k6 or k7. time for invasions has come for both sides, anyway ;p]
;B[qj];W[qk];B[ok]TR[rk]C[p9 is an attack move. it works with s9 and could have worried white a little.]
;W[qg]TR[qe][rk]C[OK, here's the real thing. White r13 is a peeping move. it aims at both the corner and the three black stones near r10, but it is not a very strong move. Black should simply protect the corner. This way he is making points while preventing the whites stones to settle down. The black stones may be cut, but it is black 's sphere, so there is not much to fear.]
;B[og]C[not very good];W[qe];B[pe];W[qf]TR[qd]C[r16 is urgent and needed]
;B[rh]C[this move ok?

huh uh
this move makes no points
and it does'nt prevent white to settle down. on the contrary, the group is pushed toward the corner.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[pa]TR[nc];B[oa];W[rb];B[oj]TR[pj]
[qj]C[p10 urgent? I thought so...maybe I should have used sente for attacking...

it was not so urgent, because the stones could connect at any time]
;W[hd]TR[gc][ic][jo]C[the real thing once more ;p there was a lot of events in this game. right now black can choose to attack the invading stone with large scale moves, or try to erase white influence, which is the aim of p9 and p10

have a look at the variation J17 instead of G17]
(;B[gc]TR[ic][jc]C[maybe j17 is better - or even j16];W[hf]
TR[hh];B[ge];W[he]TR[hh];B[fg]C[ok until here? is there a better way to attack?

yes, H17 really kicks. let your opponent feels how it is really like to be surronded in hostile environment.]
;W[gp]TR[hh]C[I may say, that the aim is to push the invading group toward the wall.**always** -- with H12, white has to make life in black 's sphere of influence. wish good luck to him ;p]
;B[jg]C[and this one?];W[hh];B[ii];W[pf]TR[of]C[was my reaction to q14 right?

(aaargh!) hum, well ... here you must answer with p14];B[oe]
;W[of];B[nf]C[the position has been damaged ... more stones to put in this sequence]
;W[qd]
(;B[ne];W[gi]TR[fk][jm][jn]C[here it is still possible to invade at k6 or k7. Note that it was a good move before, it still is a good move. but in a short term sight, it will not be playable anymore.]
;B[hi];W[gh]
(;B[fj]C[I mustn't let him connect...but what's the proper way? ^^'

I) try to get compensation -- w invades, black makes an invasion / takes points

II) prepair to cut at the moment he invades];W[gj]

C[Actually I think I played to safely - I tried to defend all weak points and even points that weren't as weak as I thought...]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[pm];W[qn];B[nl];W[ic];B[jc];W[pn];B[mp]C[to greedy...!?

too low ... o6, or even k7 better];W[mo];B[no];W[np];B[oo];W[po]
;B[lp]TR[jm][mn]C[what to do now?

now it is the time for big yose (say hello to big yose !) --  borders won't move much, you just have to take the big points.]
