AB[pd][dp]C[This is a relatively short game I played on KGS, I am black. Thanks for taking the time to review my game.

rika:
Hi, I'm Chun-Kit 3k DE, 4k IGS.
Since you won that game, there are just a few comments. For the next time please submit a game where you have lost or you don't know what happened.]
;W[cd];B[qp]LB[ed:A]C[rika:
approach at E16 (A) is also possible];W[nc];B[qg]C[rika:
speedy development. In a handicap game, I prefer more solid one Q14 or R14]
;W[pb]MA[pc][kc][kd]C[this is not a joseki move given the R13 stone, what is the best way to answer it?

rika:
sure it's joseki, somewhat very slow for white, but still possible. (Remember, you have still the advantage of the 2 handicap stones, better for white is Q17 or side extending like L17 or L16)
only answer for black is R17.];B[qc];W[kc]C[rika:
now you have sente];B[ec]TR[kc]C[rika:
it's much better to approch high if white has a stone around the star-point at the upper side.]
;W[gc]
(;B[ee]C[rika:
I don't like jumping out where white is strong at the top.]
;W[df];B[dh]C[rika:
not good. white can simply separate the two groups by playing wE14]
;W[ef];B[gd];W[hd];B[ge];W[hc];B[ff];W[eh];B[de]C[rika:
if you push, you must cut... if you don't cut the push is unreasonable.]
;W[ce];B[eg];W[dg];B[fg];W[ch];B[di]C[up to here i thought that i did well in this corner/side, is there any better way?

rika:
it's ok. you have reasonable position in the center, white has territory at the top and on the left.]
;W[ci];B[dj];W[cj]C[I wasn't sure what to do here, extending at D9 seemed a bit too submissive, and capturing E12 felt like a slow move, any suggestions?

rika:
capturing is ok, if you want no more complication. I like bD9 which gives you impressive influence towards the center.]
;B[cf]C[rika:
I don't see the point playing C14 right now];W[cg];B[cc]C[rika:
bB14];W[dk]C[the next few moves look bad for black, maybe I should have extended.]
;B[fi];W[ek];B[fj];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[dd];W[bf];B[op];W[ql]
;B[qj];W[qn]
(;B[rm]C[With this move I wanted to take away whites' base and make him run, so that white will have a floating group that I can gain from by attacking it. Do you think this move is too aggressive/ too early?

rika:
bP10 is good enough, but extending the lower side seems to be much bigger...]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[rl];B[qo]C[better S5, because wT7 becomes sente]
;W[fq]C[rika:
white's tenuki is dangerous, but it's a handicap game]
(;B[cm]TR[cj][ek][dk]C[rika:
very troublesome with the white presence at the left side]
(;W[mq]C[this move is too far...]
(;B[jq]C[so I pincered both stones, but is this the right move? is J3 better?

rika:
seems to be the right spot];W[hq]
(;B[lp]C[This attachment seems bad but all other moves i thought off would let white off too easily. What is a better play in this situation?

rika:
keep separating the two groups, kosumi (bL4) seems to be the best]

;B[dq];W[gn];B[hp]TR[fq][hq][gn]C[What is a better move to attack white? This move seems to cause no trouble for white.

rika:
the horse face formation is a good shape. There is nothing you can really do about it.]

yes.];W[nl];B[ld];W[lc];B[mj];W[ll];B[kj]
