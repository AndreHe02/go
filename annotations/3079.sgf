C[grrr [8k\]: hi




hi,
i am mainly intrested in strategic mistakes i made(black),
and the direction of play

Hello, I'm Kevin, I hope you'll find this helpful. You play pretty well strategically in the opening, and it is hard to say for sure somethings are wrong and others are right.]
;B[pd]C[gono55 [6k\]: hi];W[dp]C[grrr [8k\]: have a good game]
;B[pq]C[gono55 [6k\]: to];W[dd];B[jp]SQ[qo]TR[pk]C[I am sure you are aware that black 5 is not a standard sequence, and particularly not for the high chinese opening. The normal play would be Q9.

The question is why not? Hmmm. I'm not a dan player, but here are my thoughts:

1) Typically enclosing a corner with a knights move is more valuable than a mid point.

2) An approach by white at R5, or Q5, allows him to flatten you along the bottom, or prevent a moyo type structure, which is the point of the high chinese opening.

3) Playing at the star point on Q16 is an influence move, that Q9 would help strengthen (along with Q3). Without it, A territorial corner play might have been better in the upper right.

Had I played white, I would have immediately played into your right side to disrupt a moyo opening.]
;W[dj];B[pk];W[nc]
(;B[nd]C[is this a good joseki choice?

It would not have been my choice yet, a little too aggressive right now. It would be better if you had a stronger presence on the right side, but I can't say its wrong.

You did retain sente, but he earned great shape in exchange and S17 is white's privilege for big endgame points. I think it was a little early to be fighting over a tiny portion of the corner, there are probably bigger moves on the board. Either side had a couple of chances to tenuki for sente.]
;B[me];W[ld]MA[kf]C[what is the biggest point on the board now?

I like your next choices, yet perhaps L19 is the most important as it is the edge of two moyos.]

White might almost think, what is the best way to attack black. White is pretty safe, I would look towards surrounding, or pressuring it to build strength.]

Overall, your strategy and opening is pretty good. I might even say better than your tactics at this time. Your upper right joseki was OK, but the lower right you really missed out on an opportunity to take advantage of your Chinese opening. I remember your request, but I'd put some more effort into your tactical decisions and reading, you had a lot of opportunities to really capitalize on some bad white decisions.

Looks like you won't be an 8k for long. Best of luck!
