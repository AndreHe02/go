C[Dear Reviewer,

Thanks for reviewing the game. I have made comments and questions inside the game, but in any case, I'm mostly interested in fuseki.


 Great -- many of my comments have to do with the fuseki.  I try not to play out too many variations (it can get overwhelming), and instead I just talk about various options.  However, there are a few variations played out where appropriate.]

While your intuition on what part of the board is most important, your move is usually better  played at K17.  You are invading his area and want to destroy it as efficiently as possible.  4th line moves are usually for fighting and/or making moyos -- you are doing neither here.]
;B[hc];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pf]TR[jd]C[
As you comment on later, your marked stone being so high gives your opponent an opportunity to settle himself and attack you at the same time.]
;W[jp];B[qj];W[cm];B[pq];W[qq]LB[cm:A]TR[qj]C[Is this the right direction? Looking back I'm not sure.

I like the 5-4 point opening -- I play it a lot.  It is a move that stresses outside influence.  However, here the presence of black's marked stone severely hampers your ability to make use of any outside influence you may get.

Perhaps instead of playing at A earlier, you should have enclosed the lower right corner with Q3.]
;B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[ql];B[lq];W[nq]C[This looks like a weird move now.]
;B[nr];W[jq];B[rr]C[Do I need to answer this? Later only, right? A monkey jump is not worth so many points.

Right, no need to answer now.];W[fq]LB[dq:B][eq:A]C[This seems too small, but people try to live under these three stones and can't. 8-)

The presence of even one black stone anywhere in the area significantly improves black's invasion prospects.

If you want to be sure the corner is yours you must play at A or B instead of F3.]
;B[jb]C[I never know how to answer these. I guess I should not leave the opening in the first place.

Right.];W[qc]C[
A little early for this invasion.  Now you have two weak groups to worry about.  Black is thanking you.]
;B[qd];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[fc]C[Too agressive?

Well I think it is an overplay, yes.  However, I also think black is doing better than you right now so maybe it is necessary to complicate things.]

I think black could have cut here.  See variation.];W[dd];B[cd]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[fg];B[mb]C[I should have moved there a long time ago I guess. This turns out to be terrible and I lose the game because of it. The whole fight that follows is full of mistakes on my part.]
;W[nb];B[lc];W[ld];B[hg]C[
No fun to have more than one weak group. :-)];W[gh];B[nf];W[oe]
LB[lf:A][kg:B]C[

This move is very slow.  You need to get out.  I would probably play at A or B.]
;B[of];W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[rc];W[qg]C[
Now you have three weak groups.  One suggestion I have is when you get to the middle game,  try to never have more than 4 groups on the board.]

I think playing at A is a better move.  The two sequences I play out here have you living outright.]

;W[kj];B[kl];W[lj];B[nj]LB[il:A]C[Here 109 is a bad move.  If instead he hanes at A your whole top left goup is in big trouble.

There are no more comments to make that can change the outcome of the game.

You have good intuition but you need to take the time to make slow, solid moves.  It is easiest to attack when you have no weaknesses.  Trying to be everywhere at once is called Kyu Player's Disease -- if you can break this affliction you will become stronger.

Good Luck,
