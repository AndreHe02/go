C[Notes for reviewer:

Please review for black. I went through this game and put in some questions and comments.
Overall, I thought I played pretty well, with a few not so good moves, but didn't suffer too much from them. It's typical for me to get ahead by midgame, then fail to contain and kill or lose territory along edges due to tactical errors. I thought white played too conservatively--I should've had more trouble.

Please comment on my general playing style, and the biggest areas where I can improve my game. One thing I know is that I think I'm behind and play aggresively, and if I could estimate score, I could just play safe and keep my lead. If there were any big mistakes or missed opportunities by either side, please mention that too. Thanks, Keith


csh: It looked like Black had an easy time in this game, but hopefully this review will still be helpful. I agree, White did appear to play too conservatively.

However, I had some comments on your comments: In the middlegame, you don't usually manage to contain or kill one of your opponent's groups. As a result, that should not be your primary aim. You should be able to gain an advantage, in influence or territory, by threatening to surround or kill a group, even if unsuccessful in that goal.

Losing territory around the edges has more to do with the endgame than the middlegame. I'll try to give what pointers I can.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[od];W[dj];B[pj]C[csh: One easy way to estimate territory is to compare areas of similar size. In this case, it's easy: Black controls the right, and White controls the left, so it's more or less even.]
;W[jp];B[jd]C[csh: So far, it looks like it will be a game of competing moyo: Black's upper right versus White's lower left. Again, it still looks even.]
;W[nq]C[csh: This approach is good.];B[qn]C[csh: This response is also good. I think low (on the third line, the R column) is good, since the other stones are high.]
;W[pr]C[csh: This move is slow. The upper left is more important. Black can consider ignoring this move and playing in the upper left.]
;B[qq]C[csh: This move is also slow. It's worth a lot in the corner, but the upper left is more important.]
;W[qr]C[csh: White pushes...];B[fc]C[csh: And you take sente to play in the upper left. So far, so good. The game still looks even.]
;W[dc]LB[cf:A]C[csh: This move protects the corner, but only from an attack on the right. The corner vulnerable to an approach around A.]
;B[fq]
(;W[hq]TR[jp]C[csh: This move is from the wrong side. The marked stones are somewhat redundant. See the variation.]
;B[fo];W[dn]
(;B[dq]C[csh: This move isn't good. The black group cannot connect together. See the variation.]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[gr];W[dr];B[fs];W[cq]C[csh: This result was horrible for Black. The black group has one eye (assuming Black gets either G3 or H2) but White got the entire corner. The group is also somewhat "heavy."]
;B[hp];W[hr];B[ip];W[iq]C[csh: Bad shape.];B[jq]C[csh: The cut is bad.]

(;W[jr]C[csh: White should play to capture. See the variation.]
;B[kq];W[kr]C[csh: Crawling on the second line is rarely good.]

(;B[lp]C[csh: This is an odd shape. See the variation.];W[lq]
;B[kp];W[jo];B[mq];W[lr];B[np];W[mr];B[mp]C[csh: You took the outside, and White only got second-line territory, so I think you came out ahead.]
;W[pq];B[rq];W[op];B[oo];W[oq];B[nn]TR[fo][jo][fp][hp][ip][jp]
[fq][er][gr][fs]C[csh: Now that the game has sort of slowed down again, it would be a good time to take inventory and see how the game stands.

White has territory in the lower left. White also has territory along the bottom of the board. White has a lot of influence on the left side of the board, but it's not territory yet, since it can still be invaded.

Black has a huge moyo, almost half the board. What's more, since Black took the outside at the bottom, the moyo can grow even bigger. It looks bigger than what White has because White hasn't invaded on your side yet. Assuming that the black group in the lower left lives, Black is comfortably ahead.

Thus, the two marked groups should become the focal point of the game. If the whtie cutting stones get away, the game could get difficult for Black. If the stones are firmly captured, then the game is Black's to lose.]

(;W[ld]C[csh: White starts a counter-invasion. If this is an invasion, it's not deep enough (since it's hard to get a base.) I would have invaded on the third line. It is also too deep for a reduction.]
;B[mc];W[lc];B[jc]C[csh: The white stones are really heavy now.]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[ke];B[fe]C[csh: While it did poke into Black's territory, the white group at the top has become a liability for White. I think Black is comfortably ahead.]

(;B[di]C[csh: This isn't a good move. It's better to leave the weakness and exploit it later. It's strengthening the white group, while the black group at the top still is in trouble. See the variation.]
;W[ei];B[ej];W[hg]TR[gb][lb][fc][jc][lc][jd][ld][ee][fe][ke]
SQ[ef][eg][dh][eh][ei]C[csh: There are three groups in motion here. The triangle white group is the weakest. The black group is almost surrounded. The square white group still doesn't have eyes, either.]

Should it be so hard to contain the W groups at N13?
I also wanted to surround K5 by making a wall across the middle.

csh: I think your move was in the wrong direction. 'A' is better, but I still think White would push through and fight. Perhaps 'B' is better. I don't like 'C' because the ladder doesn't work if White cuts. See the variations.]

;W[hi];B[ji]LB[hk:A]C[This wasn't so good for my strategy of making territory around K5.
Playing at A would've been much better, but I was worried about the M9 group.

csh: A move around 'A' would also help the M9 group. The big question, though, is whether or not the group at the top is alive.]

C[csh: Well, the black group at the top is alive now. Another good time to check inventory.

You have a little more territory in the center that White has at the bottom. If you add your two groups in the upper left, you have a little less than White's upper left corner. White's dragon in the upper right makes only four points of territory or so. The upper right looks equal the lower left, so it looks pretty even.]
;W[ih]LB[ad:C][sm:A][rr:B]C[csh: White enters byoyomi. Unfortunately, this isn't a big move. I marked some moves that I think are bigger.]

(;B[kk]LB[ad:C][rk:A][rr:B]C[csh: Since this is the endgame, you need to start thinking about points. This move gets you two points in gote. Compare that to some of the other moves I have marked. I made variations for each.

You want to play sente moves first, since you can keep playing sente moves while the opponent has to keep responding. Also, you want to play larger moves first.]

[io][jo][lo][mo][po][ro][so][jp][rp][sp][sq][sr]C[csh: Black held the advantage throughout most of the game, and pulled ahead in the endgame. However, there were instances where Black could have lost the game by taking too many risks. It's important to learn to play solidly and not squander the lead when ahead, but that only works if you can judge the relative positions well.

Hopefully learning to compare territories (instead of counting) will give you a start. Since you are on KGS, if you feel up to it, you can also look at Dr. Straw's lecture on counting to see if that's helpful. If it's too difficult, then comparing territories should be enough for now.

Note also that Black made a lot of points on the right side of the board, even though the white group was not killed. Chasing the group while making territory made more points, and in the end, was what made the difference in the game.

I hope you find this review helpful.
