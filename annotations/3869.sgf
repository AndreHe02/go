C[Hi, my name is Heiko Schott and I played white in this game.
I'm 9k on DGS where this game was played, but I guess I'm more around 12k or something.

At the end I screwed the game up, but until then the game was about even I think.
I made a few comments thoughout the game and also posed some questions I'd like to have answered. I wouldn't mind comments on other moves besides those obvious ones though. :)

Please tell me what you're thinking.

Thanks in advance.

Edgar> Hi, I'm the reviewer Edgar Ibsen. A pleasure to review this game. I hope my comments will prove useful.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dq];B[do];W[co];B[dn]C[This isn't Joseki as far as I know. But I don't really know what to do here. D4 doesn't really look good to me (see var.). So I decided to continue on C6.]

(;W[cn]C[Edgar> This can actually transpose into the large avalanche with D4. I've included the common continuation after D4.]

(;B[cm];W[dp]LB[dm:A]C[Got a big piece of the corner here and white has a cut at A...

Edgar> Position looks not bad at all for white.];B[ep]C[...which he doesn't want to defend.

Cut first, think later...];W[dm]C[Edgar> Cut seems reasonable. Quite aggressive.]
;B[cl];W[em];B[fo];W[fn];B[eo]C[So black is in an ugly shape (two empty triangles can't really be good) but white's group is floating in the center with nowhere to run to and struggling to make eyes.

Now the thinking after the cutting starts and I wonder if it was a good choice to cut (at this early stage). Plus, white should defend his group and thus end in gote. :/

Edgar> I still think this is a fairly reasonable result for white. Black does not yet have real territory or much influence on the bottom, and his shape looks very inefficient. Also, I won't say that defending the white group is gote... after all black needs to defend his too, as you noted yourself a few moves later.]
;W[hm];B[gn];W[gm];B[ip];W[go]C[Another cut. This time it threatens the lone stone and the ugly shape to the left, so it should be good for me.]
;B[gp];W[ho]C[So white has an eye, lots of liberties and black's still struggling to make a base. Now I felt a bit more comfortable about the cut at D7 (which still doesn't mean that it was a good choice to cut in the first place).]
;B[hp];W[oq]C[Maybe a kakari at F17 or O17 would have been better!?
Or maybe R14 to work with the R4 stone?

I have my problems what to do with "empty" corners like this. Is it a matter of taste or is there a rule (of thumb) what to go for?

Edgar> There is no rule of thumb that I know of, but I like the shimari here for two reasons: 1. the shimari by itself is quite a big move, and 2. it prepares a possible slide by white at the bottom, effectively depleting black of any possiblity for a large territory there. Compare this with the result of a typical black approach to the corner, and the difference should be clear.

F17, O17 and R14 are all smaller than the shimari. For R14 to work with R4, there should already be a shimari in the lower right.]
;B[lq];W[pj]LB[qj:A]C[Nice. Black gave me the time to extend along the shimari.

Edgar> Black violated the principle of  never trying to protect "territory" that has open skirts on both sides, and you gained a nice move. However, R10 is much better, as you have prospects of building up a very nice box-shaped influence area with P10 later on. I'll comment more on this after white R7.]
;B[qh]TR[pe][qf][pg]C[Black extended pretty far. So maybe I can invade at one of the marked points later. Which one would be best?

Edgar> I feel that the only real "invading" move is R14... Q13 and Q15 both seem more like reducing moves. Q13 can potentionally turn into an invading move after Q13 R13 R14 Q14, but white can only live there at the expense of giving black a huge wall (I've included a continuation of this).

Invading moves are fine, but you must make sure your groups are strong enough for you to invade. I'll comment more on this when you actually invade.]

(;W[fc]C[I decided to attack the D16 stone now, because it seemed weakest.

Is this the right direction?
C14 didn't seem right to me (see var.)

Edgar> Yes I also agree that this is the right direction.];B[df]
;W[db];B[cc];W[ic];B[di];W[nc];B[pc];W[qm]C[Still thinking about the invasion, but I felt I should play R7 first which looks pretty big to me.

Edgar> I won't say this is a wrong move, but it feels too timid to me. Also, the Q10 stone looks really out of place now. In this case I might be tempted to play S10, even though the result is far inferior to if white had played R10 and then P10.

Here you see the problem with the Q10 stone... it is too high to effectively secure territory, and your choice of a small low shimari shows a very territorial style of play. Q10 is commonly used as an extension with the small high enclosure (P4) since the enclosure is comparitively much more influence-oriented (note that the low extension is also useable with the small high shimari because it is still quite territorial, even if less so than the small low shimari).

However, when one looks at this game, one sees that white is indeed very territorial, and not only with the small low shimari: take the top side for example (all of white's stones are on the second and third lines). It is a good idea to have a consistant style of play. The very simple reason here is that the influence that Q10 gives is of no use to white, as he doesn't really have much influence anywhere else besides Q10 (G7 group seems more like a dragon with one eye than real influence).

In any case, white really doesn't get much in the way of influence here, and what's more, his territory can be stolen away by black sliding in underneath the high Q10 stone. This is why the high extension Q10 is usually not used with the small low shimari.]
;B[rj];W[qf]C[Ok, let's see if I can black cut apart.

Edgar> Invasion is fine, but white should realize that black is actually not all that weak on either side. Thanks to the high Q10 black has plenty of wiggle room via S8 (at least one eye), and the other side seems plenty alive. In contrast, white's R14 stone is actually quite weak. Also note how R14 escaping would involve giving black a chance to play stones on both sides of the escaping R14 group, and put your O17 stone in danger, since it is already quite weak.]
;B[qe];W[pf]C[Now that was easy.
The game is going nice for white so far.

Edgar> I won't say that if I were you hehe];B[oh];W[nf];B[re]
;W[rf]C[Keeping black seperated.];B[oe];W[of];B[ne]TR[ic][nc]
C[...and get seperated myself. Now what? Defending the big gap between the marked stones? But then the Q14 stones would have a very hard time. Can't really risk it.

Edgar> At this point I would say white's invasion has failed, and that white should start cutting his losses. I would avoid trying to save O17 at all, and focus on not letting black kill the O14 group.]

(;W[me]C[I'm not too happy with this move. M14 instead? O12 to attack the lower black group?

Edgar> O12 is interesting, but I perfer N12 more. At the very least you can transpose into the O12 line via N12 O11 O12 (I don't know if you would want to play O12 after N12 O11 though). If black tries to cut, you save both your group and the top (see variation). I've also included a possible line of play after M14, which doesn't look all that good for white. It is really hard to recommend a clear-cut good move here (the situation does not favor white), and N15 seems reasonable.]
;B[md];W[nd]TR[pc][pd]C[So I'm cutting again.
What I was thinking was that if black would try N17 I could play N18. I would have 3 liberties while he has only two and I should be able to come out ahead.

Edgar> You forgot that while it's true black temporarily has one less liberty than white, black has room to increase his liberty count, while white is fighting with his back towards the river (little chance of liberty increase because of the proximity of black Q16 and Q17). As I noted three moves ago, even in principle it's a much better idea to just abandon the O17 group and not make it heavy by adding more stones. Black has nothing to lose by starting a fight there. White, on the other hand, has two weak groups there.]
;B[mc];W[mb]C[Still thinking this would work.];B[le];W[mf]C[I wasn't afraid of this either.
I expected black to connect at either M16 or L16 and be able to connect  my stones to those at the left side, too.]
;B[lb]C[This move caught me by surprise.
Now if I connect at O18, the group will die.
So I'm going for the cut again.];W[lc];B[ld];W[kc];B[nb]C[So in the end, black managed to get a big corner, threaten the white Q14 stones and walk into the center nullifying white's wall on the top.

Not much hope for getting any points in the center now for any of us I guess.]
;W[pe];B[od]TR[nc][nd]C[Probably not a smart exchange since the marked stones are in atari now.

Edgar> Actually this is just an idle move. The only white loss is one ko threat. Of course it's better not to play it, but it doesn't really hurt the position much.]
;W[qd]TR[pc][od][pd][ne][oe][qe][re]C[I miscounted here. I thought I should be able to get either of the marked groups this way.
Not If black can just kill the O17 stones though.];B[rd];W[mh]
C[So... maybe I can kill the black stones on the right. Or at least gain profit by attacking them and strengthening my own group.]
;B[ni];W[nj]LB[lj:A][nk:B]C[Edgar> Bad move. Attaching to the black stones you are chasing only makes them stronger (since now they can actually hurt you). When attacking, it's usually a good idea to not touch the stones you're attacking until you have it surrounded, and is going in for the kill. 

Also, this is a directional error. As I noted a couple moves back, the black R12 group is actually not all that weak, with the wiggle room at S8. Instead of thinking about killing black's group, white should think about  not letting his own die, or giving away too much to black for life.

White should instead chase black in the other direction, with "A". As a reference, even if white wants to chase black in the N11 direction, it should be with "B" and not the move played.]
;B[mi]C[Edgar> White forces black to play a move that he wants to play anyway, and which attacks the weak white group.]
;W[lh];B[li];W[jh]C[Edgar> Now it's black chasing white. The directional error of O10 rears it's ugly head.]
;B[kh];W[kg];B[ki];W[kf]TR[ki][li][mi]C[Okay, my white group seems pretty safe now. On the other hand black got out nicely, too.

Edgar> I feel black has gained more here. The only thing white has gained is life for his weak group, but not only does black gain life, he also gets nice influence with the marked stones. At the very least, white can say goodbye to any notion of making points in the center.]
;B[ji];W[ih];B[ii]
(;W[je]C[Edgar> This struck me as a weird move... and allows black to hane at H12 and force white to accept bad shape. I couldn't find a continuation after black K15 or K16 that would harm white. I've included a continuation each for both moves.]
;B[hh]
(;W[om]LB[cb:A][fq:B][mr:C]C[This move looks a bit small to me now. O7? N4? Or should I help the center group in the lower left now?

Edgar> There are several nice sentes you can do here. Comparitively, P7 is small. "A" is a standard corner yose move, and is somewhat sente and not all that small. If black ignores, white can make black miserable with B17 and D17. Corner exchanges are usually larger than they seem. "B" is an interesting move exploiting black's open skirt and also his M3 mistake. I've included a continuation after "B". "C" is another standard yose move, which is also not small, especially considering the black miai at O2.]
;B[eq];W[dr];B[io];W[hn];B[kl];W[jm]C[Edgar> Also an idle move. Black does not have any real territory there. Even if you are trying to reduce black's center, a move like N4, which increases your territory while reducing black's, is much better than this move.

It's always a good idea to play moves that have dual or even triple uses.]
;B[km];W[jn];B[ko];W[fk];B[in];W[im];B[hg];W[if]LB[cb:A][fr:B]
[mr:C]C[Another small move. I can't remember what I was thinking there. The game looks better for black now, I think.

Edgar> You probably were trying to save the two stones. I agree that it is quite small, especially since black has to make two gote moves to actually capture the two stones. A, B and C are all larger.]
;B[hf];W[he];B[ge];W[hd];B[gd];W[gc];B[er];W[kn]C[Edgar> Small move that does very little. After black's E2, E1 should be almost an automatic reflex. The miai value of that move is 2 points, so the combined value is 4 points in sente, quite huge at this phase of the game.]
;B[ln]C[Edgar> But I don't know why black played this move. It seems pointless and gives away sente.]
;W[jo];B[kp];W[jp];B[jq];W[mr];B[lr];W[kb];B[ma];W[fd];B[fe]
;W[qk];B[fi];W[ci]C[Black seems to be ahead and white can't really win like this, so I started an invasion.

Is there a better alternative for invading? C11 didn't really seem playable.

Edgar> C11 looks quite dead. At this point I think the best course of action is to play out a normal yose and maybe win the game in yose, since white is not *that* behind. There is simply no place where white can invade and have any chance of living whatsoever. Invading like this just gives black extra points.]
;B[dj]C[I don't really know what to do with the single stone now. I don't see any continuation to make any profit out of it so it looks like another wasted move.]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[dl];B[cj];W[rk];B[qj];W[cb];B[lf];W[lg];B[ds]
;W[cs];B[es];W[br];B[hk];W[gj];B[gl];W[fl];B[hj];W[gi];B[fj]
;W[gk];B[gh];W[hl]C[Again a small move. The group was alive before so there's no good reason for playing there.]
;B[no];W[bc];B[bd];W[dc];B[cd];W[oo];B[nn]
(;W[nm]C[Would P6 have been better?

Edgar> Yes.];B[on];W[pn];B[op];W[pp];B[po];W[qo];B[nq];W[nr]
;B[mq];W[or];B[mj];W[nk];B[mk];W[pi];B[ph];W[ri];B[qi];W[rh]
;B[ng]TR[mg]C[Interesting move. Black prepares to cut at n13 but I can just connect at t10.]

;W[ms];B[jr];W[ed];B[ee];W[oo];B[np];W[se];B[qc];W[an]C[Edgar> Not only is this move wrong considering the black followup at B3, but even without that followup it is only 2 points in gote. A16 is also two points, but in sente. Sente is quite important in yose as well.]
;B[am];W[ao]C[So the game is about even now and it's nearly over. Maybe White can still win...]
;B[bq]C[... or maybe not. I was counting on that move earlier before the B5 stones were played, but not now anymore.

Edgar> This is a brilliant move on black's part. I have yet to find a continuation that is not either ko or seki. The crucial point in almost all variations is A2, which has "magical" properties in many cases. More info about this point can be found here: http://senseis.xmp.net/?12Point]
;W[cq];B[ap]C[This prepares for a snapback. White has to defend the cut at C4.]
;W[cp];B[ar]C[Looks like I had three options now:
1) Start the ko with A1
2) Make a seki with B1
3) Tenuki so I can make a few points elsewhere and if Black wants to start the ko, he has to find the first ko-threat

I decided for the latter because Black is ahead by a few points and a seki would surely make him win. I didn't see that B1 was sente and I could be able to make some endgame moves in sente which might be enough to win.

Edgar> White is quite lost... if he choses ko it would be a flower ko for black. If seki, then he gets no points in that corner and loses. Also, I don't see how it is a sente seki for white (see comment at the end of the sente seki variation).]

(;W[ej];B[ei];W[ek];B[bs];W[as];B[sk];W[sl];B[bs]C[Now I noticed that I don't have any good Ko-threats at all. Maybe I should have looked closer earlier.

Edgar> Black actually went through the trouble of filling in ko threats (for example, S17). It's clear that black has counted all the ko threats on the board. White has no chance of winning the ko.]
;W[la];B[cr];C[Result: B+Resign

Edgar> I'll summarize the major errors that white made in this game:

1. Inconsistancy in style (ex. Q10). More precisely, failing to extend low from a small low shimari.
2. Invaded at R14 when the top side was weak, and black not so weak on either side of the invasion.
3. Chased black's weak group towards white's own weak group, and also attaching to black's weak group during chasing.
4. Played small moves when there are huge yose moves on the board.

Overall it is not a badly played game by white, and I wish you luck with your future games :-)
