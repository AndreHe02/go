C[Llywelyn: I hope my review helps your game (it's my first review!).  I'm not that strong, but hopefully what I said doesn' t have too many errors and makes some sense.

In summary, here are a list of a few things to keep in mind:

1) Reduce your use of the one-space diagonal jump, especially when there is a stone present that threatens a strong cut.

2) Be prepared to sacrifice stones.

3) Sometimes playing a little more aggressively when you are behind can cure a multitude of sins.

If you just focus on these three things your strength will improve quickly and dramatically.  For a book, I would recommend "The Way of the Moving Horse" by Janice Kim.  It talks a a great deal about good shape and the way the stones "move" across the board.

Again I hope there aren't too many errors, feel free to email me at dclement@mines.edu if you have any questions or comments.]

TR[ck]C[Llywelyn: This move would have made a great deal more sense if there had been a pincer at the triangle to prevent an extension.  A--the Shusaku Diagonal Move--or B--a two-space higher pincer--would have probably worked better for white in this case.]
;B[cm]LB[cl:A][do:B]C[woj:
I was thinking of claiming territory on the edge here. In retrospect,
this move seems sort of small.

Llywelyn:  Yep, the rule of thumb is a two space extension from a single stone, a three space extension from two stones.   A would have been bigger and helped secure a base, B is more traditional should White have the pincer already discussed.]
;W[gp];B[dj]TR[jc][jp][jq][mc][mq]C[Llywelyn: Kind of small at this stage in the game--there are bigger points to be had.  I would have probably played around one of the marked points.  That being said, your move is fairly secure for your group, though I would have probably played one lower.]
;W[dh];B[jd]LB[df:A]C[Llywelyn: An invasion at A would also be good.]
;W[jq]TR[nc][qf][qn][nq]C[Llywelyn: This move is a bit defensive for my tastes and smallish for this stage of the game--an invasion at one of the marked points would be better.]
;B[mq]LB[df:A][jo:B][gn:C][kp:D]C[woj:
Wanted to block his advance since I suspected that I wouldn't get much
territory on the left edge.

Llywelyn:  You are worrying a little too much about territory this early in the game.  An invasion at A or a reducing move somewhere on the lower left-hand side (perhaps around B or maybe C or D) would be better.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[lo];B[fh]MA[ei]LB[fi:A]TR[pm]C[Llywelyn: this is bad haengma in this circumstance--A cut at the square/X (it appears as one in cgoban, the other in Stones) could be very destructive.  If you are trying to escape into the center, A would have been a stronger move.  You are also asking for an invasion on the right-hand-side and a move around the triangle would have been strong.]
;W[pn];B[qo]C[woj:  Wanted to defend the corner.  Would somewhere near O6 have been better?

Llywelyn: White would have played O5 and could have made your life difficult :-)]
;W[ql];B[rj];W[np];B[nq]C[Llywelyn: Correct :-)];W[oc]C[Llywelyn: This move is a bit unusual.  The marked locations would have been more traditional, but it seems that white wanted to secure a base--this is an invasion.]
;B[qc]LB[mc:A]TR[jc][jd][pd]C[woj:  Should I have done Q17 instead?

Llywelyn: Possibly, that would have defended  your territory better, but  considering that you know white is going to try and establish a base, I might have tried playing a one-space pincer at A instead.  It works well with the marked stones and, while it gives white the corner, should give you good outward influence.  I think, anyways, a stronger player would probably be able to give you better advice on this one.]
;W[lc]C[Llywelyn: Now white's invasion makes a little more sense :-)]
;B[ld];W[md];B[le];W[kc];B[kd]LB[jf:A][je:B]C[Llywelyn: Slow and poor shape.  A would have been faster and brought you more out into the center.  It would also have given you much better shape.  B would have formed a bamboo joint, not quite as fast, but also gives good shape.]
;W[jb];B[rl];W[rm];B[qk];W[pm];B[ol]C[Llywelyn: Not really sure what you are aiming for here.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[og];B[pg];W[mg];B[jg]TR[lg][kg][ig]C[woj:
The group at L16 was starting to look rather isolated, so I figured
that I would have to connect it sometime.

Llywelyn: Yep, but K13 was weak(ish) move for connecting it.   I think the marked moves would have been better.]
;W[mj];B[ml];W[oo];B[op];W[no];B[pl];W[qm];B[kl];W[ki];B[ii]
;W[jj];B[lg]LB[kf:A][il:B][jm:C]C[Llywelyn: This would have been stronger if played at A and would have prevented you from playing there later.  I'm not entirely sure, but I think B or C might be a bigger moves overall.]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[li];B[kf]LB[df:A]TR[fh][dj]MA[lg][lh]C[woj:  I was worried about white cutting my groups at L14.

Llywelyn: Reasonable--though you are only really risking the two stones I've marked with squares, so I think there are bigger plays out there (such as an invasion at A, which would be well supported by the marked stones).]
;W[jl];B[jm];W[il];B[ef]C[Llywelyn: One lower would have been stronger.  This reducing play works well though.]
;W[cf]LB[df:A]C[Llywelyn: Cautious defense, I would have probably played the contact-play at A.]
;B[de]TR[ei]C[woj:
Looking back, this move doesn't seem to be that useful. G10 (where
white plays next) probably would have been better.

Llywelyn: D15  isn't bad, it threatens a cut in two directions, which is good.  Yes, the marked point would have been bigger.]
;W[ei];B[fj];W[kp];B[fi]TR[he][ge]C[Llywelyn: I think one of the marked points would have been bigger at this stage of the game.]
;W[im];B[km]LB[kn:A]TR[he][ge]C[Llywelyn: A Tiger's Mouth at A would have been faster, but the stronger connection you used is probably better in this case.   I still like the marked points though.]
;W[ge]C[woj:  Darn, I was hoping to play there sometime.  :(]
;B[gm]C[woj:
At this point, since the top left corner was pretty much controlled by
white, I decided to start reducing white in the bottom left.]
;W[gn];B[fn];W[fo];B[en];W[hn];B[hk];W[dd];B[ff]TR[ci][ro][kr]
[bp]LB[eg:A]C[woj:
Was worried about white going at E13, F13, or F14 and cutting my
groups.

Llywelyn: "If it is less than seven stones, tenuki" -- this tongue in cheek proverb applies here.  There are bigger plays on the lower and left sides (I've marked a few of them with triangles).   All of that being said, a play at A would have been stronger and more difficult to break.]
;W[gf];B[gg];W[if];B[ig];W[id];B[oh];W[of];B[pf];W[nk];B[nl]
;W[me];B[bh]MA[dh]C[woj:  This turned out to be a big mistake.

Llywelyn: This is called hazama tobi and, while it has its uses, tends to be a poor choice of moves--particularly if there is stone present that is threatening a cut--as there is in this case and that I've marked with a square.   If you don't make this move when that stone is present you will become much stronger.]
;W[ci];B[bj];W[bi];B[ai]C[woj:
I was thinking that I might be able to save B12.  I probably should
have let it die and played C10 instead.

Llywelyn: Good call.];W[cj]
(;B[bk]C[Llywelyn: I've included a variation that gives a significantly favorable result by following the proverb "on a thrust, block".  I'm not experienced enough to say if that is the best variation or if there is something I am missing though.]
;W[ck];B[cl];W[dk]
(;B[ej]MA[dj]C[Llywelyn: I've proposed a variation here.  This would have sacrificed the marked stone but would have given you a chance to minimize White's damage to your moyo.]
;W[el];B[fl];W[em];B[fm];W[dm];B[dn];W[df];B[ee];W[jn]TR[pb]
[ro][ce][lr][nm]C[Llywelyn: Smallish for this stage of the game.  I've marked a few plays that (I think, anyways are bigger.]
;B[di];W[ch]C[Llywelyn: Good read on white's part.];B[eh];W[ij]
;B[hj];W[jh];B[ih];W[kh]C[Llywelyn: Not really sure of the purpose for this move/]
;B[kg];W[lr];B[or]C[woj:
It seemed like I would have some problems if I played N2 and then white
followed with P3.

Llywelyn: The bad aji here was worrisome, agreed.];W[ro];B[rp]
;W[qn];B[so];W[rn];B[po];W[lq]C[woj:  Big mistake for white!  I could now cut at P6.]
;B[on];W[om]C[Llywelyn: White needs to read this one forward--White is just improving your position.]
;B[nn];W[nm];B[mn];W[mo]C[Llywelyn: Good read on white's part.]
;B[mm];W[nh];B[oi];W[pb];B[qb];W[jf];B[ek]TR[mr][bp][fd]C[Llywelyn: This was premature--it makes you one point but eliminates a potential source of a ko-threat for later.  There are also bigger moves (marked).]
;W[dl];B[bp];W[cq];B[bn]C[Llywelyn: Premature.];W[bq];B[ap]
;W[bg];B[aj]C[woj:  Being a beginner, I first considered A12, but that would have been bad.

Llywelyn:  Good call.];W[ah];B[bl]C[Llywelyn: Another good read.]

;W[ko];B[od];W[nd];B[pc];W[ob];B[sm]C[woj:
I'm not sure why I played here...  In retrospect, this was probably a
wasted move.

Llywelyn: Prettymuch.  It looks like you were trying to avoid a ko-threat and playing very conservatively, not necessary considering the circumstances though.]
;W[ed];B[hg];W[hf];B[hl];W[hm];B[gk]C[woj:  Was this necessary?  Could white have done anything if he played at G9?

Llywelyn: Not that I can tell -- it looks like the group is alive.]
