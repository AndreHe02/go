C[This game was played between me and a guest on KGS. I was black.

White won by resignation.

Hi Sarah my comments start with *];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ep]
TR[eq]C[In all honesty, I don't play this move very often, so I don't know the joseki for it. Normally, I play at the marked point.
* this is a normal move];W[gq];B[cq]LB[fo:A][gp:C][er:B]C[Did this, thinking to get a base in the corner. Was it the right idea?

* This is a normal move. Other possibilites are A, B or C.]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[eq]C[Reading ahead from here, I couldn't see any way to make moving to the right work in my favour, so...]
;B[bp];W[co]C[* this move is wrong Should be at C5. Altough it is hard to find the correct move after 12.]
;B[bo];W[cn]C[* Black's F3 is not the best choice, you create a very small corner and a floating group. Better to live by E2]

(;B[fq];W[er];B[fp];W[fr]LB[br:A]C[* 19 at B2 is too painfull. First play B6 to see how white responds. Only play moves like A in goto when you really do have no other options.]

(;B[br];W[eo];B[fo]C[* Should be at G4];W[fn];B[en]C[Major mistake on my part. No way I should have played that. I have no clue how I missed w's obvious response to this blunder, but I did.]
;W[go];B[fm]C[Perhaps it would have been better to tenuki?

*Yes, with this move you only give more points away];W[gn];B[em]
;W[gp];B[ce]LB[ic:C][bm:A][cm:B]C[* I think the only reason playing here is preventing white making teritory. This is not important since the left side is open (with A or B reduce white's teritory).

Better a move around C. This reduces whites influence as well as that it treatens to make teritory at the top.]
;W[dh]
(;B[ee]C[* Better is just to live by playing C17. Also because this move provokes F16.]
;W[fd]
(;B[eg]C[* I do not like the answer at E13. Looks like a dame. Play C17 to live. This will also prevent white to strenghten D12.]
;W[cl];B[gf];W[hd];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[dj]
(;B[pj]C[*Q10 is a very large point, better is to attack the top left, whilte attaking you might get a cahnge as well to play Q10.]
;W[nc];B[qf]
(;W[cg];B[cf]C[* Better at D15. This gives a chance to reduce the top.]

(;W[kd];B[ne]C[* Better at N3.];W[nq];B[qn]LB[pn:A]C[* Better at A6 (A)]
;W[mm]
(;B[mo]TR[no]C[Perhaps a line too far to the left.

Is the marked point better?
* White will then play the following variant.

You should count now to determine how to respond.
Black has the following points:
Left side:  17 points
right side:  35 points 
  
White:
Left side: 24 points
Top: 26 points

With the sequence as shown white adds a 30 points to it 's teritory, black only 10 points. 

To reduce whites teritory, try to play around N3.];W[no];B[nn]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[oo];B[om]LB[kn:A]C[* Better to get out with A.]
;W[kn];B[mq];W[nr];B[mr];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[qp];W[rr];B[rq]
;W[qr];B[jr]C[* Better at K4. This also puts some pressure on the 3 white stones. If needed you can later try to live with K2]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[jp]C[I knew I was sacrificing the strength of my lower right to make this, but this group seemed just too weak to leave on its own without reinforcement.]
;W[pm]
(;B[pn]C[* Play at Q3, you either save the 5 stones or yuo can cut the 3 stones.]
;W[on];B[nm]C[R7 seems better to me, in retrospect.];W[pl];B[ok]
;W[rm];B[rn]LB[in:A]C[* Better at A. This strenghtens your group attacks white and give you a change to save the 3 stones at E7 as well.]
;W[rl];B[rj];W[po];B[qo];W[oq];B[ml]C[*better at J6];W[ll];B[mk]
;W[in];B[lm];W[ln];B[km];W[jn];B[kl];W[iq];B[jq];W[kf];B[kh]
;W[lg];B[mh];W[lh];B[mg];W[li];B[lk];W[pb];B[qc];W[gj];B[mc]
;W[lc];B[oc];W[nb];B[ob];W[oa];B[pc];W[md];B[nd];W[mb];B[qb]
;W[ik];B[ei];W[bg];B[bf];W[bn];B[dr];W[ej];B[gi];W[hj];B[ih]
;W[if]C[Now, a thorough count of the board told me w was ahead by over twenty points - assuming the group in the lower centre manages to live. Feeling like this was too large a difference to make up, I resigned. Quite early. Should I have held on longer? I couldn't think of anything at all to manage to bring a win out or even narrow the gap significantly.

* Points black:
Left bottom: 8
Top left: 10
bottom middle: 3
Right side: 38
Total 59

Points white:
Right bottom:  24
Left & centre: 36
Top: 38
Total: 98

So you are behind by 40 points, without a real change to kill any white group or get all the large end-game moves (whilst your group in the lower centre is not alive yet).
So yes resigning was a good choice.])
