C[I've gone over this game a few times mysef and i realized some big mistakes on my part and my opponents.  All in all this was one of my better games but I still think there are alot of mistakes that i didnt catch or just better moves that i could have made.  I just started playing in mid September so i dont kno much about reviewing games and this is the first time ive acctually looked at a game afterwards. I would really appreciate any advice to improving my game.

Thank You

F: It is interesting to experiment, and it will certainly improve your play. Playing tengen means that you hope to be able to build a big moyo or to be able to attack with good result.]
;W[jq];B[de];W[ed];B[dd];W[dc];B[ce];W[jc]C[F: Try to find big moves early on in the game. D10 seems big, since you can build a big moyo in relation with K10 (see variation )]

(;B[cc];W[pc];B[qc]C[F: I believe black  P17 works better in relation to your K10 stone. P17 separates two white groups, and leaves the corner for white.
You could also consider tenuki (ignoring your opponents move and play elsewhere), since your Q16 stone is still strong because of K10. Consider D10.]
;W[qj];B[di]C[F: Good. Your C15 stones are very strong so you could as well  have played D10, inviting white to invade...]
;W[dq]C[F: Maybe it is better to leave the corner for white. Try to build a moyo on the left side and be happy to give the corner to white. Consider E4. After E4 white can still sacrifice and invade your moyo, but it will be much harder for white after black E4. Consider C4]

(;B[cq];W[gp];B[eq];W[dn];B[co]TR[dl]C[F: "Always push against a strong group". No need to reinforce D4 stones at this moment. Black D8 would take a lot of territory and is sente towards white D6 stone. White would have to react and jump out to F6.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[pf];B[oc]TR[pf][dj][dn][gp]C[F: Let's take a look at the whole board. 
All white's last moves were on the fourth line, looking for influence towards the centre. In the meantime black took almost three corners. It is white now who has taken over the moyo strategy, and black needs to invade.]
;W[oq];B[mn]TR[qm][oo][pp][mq]C[F:  Good move. Now black threatens a further invasion into the white framework and can make a move on one of the marked points next.]
;W[jn];B[jm]TR[pp][mq][nq]C[I understand that in order for the tengen to work i have to basically defend the middle and instead of relying on joseki... I dont kno how but it turns out now i have the corners instead of the middle

F: The tengen stone is not  weak yet , and it is not that important to black anymore. There is little or no territory to grab in the center for black. Continue with the N6 invasion and forget the tengen stone for a while. You could try to take a piece of the corner and sacrifice the N6 stone by playing Q4, or play O3  to start a fight... . You need to defend the N6 stone, and therefore starting a fight is a good idea. N3 is also possible I think.]

;W[fj]C[F: Not good for black. Black is alive, but reduced to only a few points of territory. White was able to connect all his stones. It had been better to leave the K10 stone and come back to them later in the game.]

;B[bi];W[gd];B[bg];W[eb];B[db];W[ec]LB[da:A][cb:B]C[i think i should have played at A but i thought at the time it was more secure to play at B

F: B is ok.  The recent fight was excellent for black.];B[cb]
;W[fe];B[gf]C[F: Always consider not reacting to your opponent's move.. No need for G14 here.]
;W[nc]LB[pb:B][nd:A]TR[kc][pp][mq]C[should i have play at A instead of B?
i think i got scared a little and just reacted.


F: Locally, A looks better than B.

Let's count :
     Black: 70 points
     White: 100 + 6.5 komi = 106.5 points           

A rough count indicates you are behind in territory. O17 was a very good move by white. You need at least one invasion to reduce white's territory. Your center influence is big now, so you can consider playing on  the marked points.]
;B[pb];W[ld]C[F: With M16 your chances of invading the white top are gone, and it reinforces the K13 stone.]

C[I dont know what i was thinking here...

F: Many options for black..];W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[rd];W[sf];B[se]
;W[ph];B[pe];W[qf];B[of];W[og];B[nf];W[pl]C[F: White is securing his territory and plays defensive because he is clearly ahead in points. N3 looks the only point left for black.]

C[F: White makes a mistake here. The white D6 stones need help. F5 looks good for white.]

You played a good game. Don't let your groups be reduced to a small territory. When playing on tengen, go for moyo's and fighting. When you have to invade yourself, sacrifice some stones to make a group within white's territory.
