C[jagara (W,22k?) - UncleWaldo (B,20k?)
Played 04/07/2006 on IGS

W:  I won this game, perhaps in spite of myself.  I got a few lucky breaks that helped counteract my mistakes.
W+15

s> I am please to have the chance to review this game.  The time controls are tight, but it may give some opportunities to explore what makes go work.  Try to balance the blitz with slower games.  Blitz can help you get in touch with your reflexes, but go is more about reading than first impressions.

In general you played calm and took advantage of some mistakes.  He failed to take advantage of some of your mistakes, so you win, hooray! :)

my comments are scattered, and marked with   s>
in the next few frames / moves I give general overview suggestions, with moves specific to each item.

- tom];B[pd]C[s> in general, much profit can be gained by ignoring the small stuff.

- 60 - ignore the loss of a stone that does not help give life to a group.
- 66 - let a stone go, and jump into some open area.
- 86 - let a cut happen, cut him and he has fewer liberties.]
;W[pp]C[s> there are some moves that can improve, they are related to shape:

34 - connect and avoid a cutting point.

20 - play light with lots of possible followup moves.

114 - consider getting a strong group to attack with, or maybe you can cut in already.

156 - the invasion will be ok, his shape has many flaws locally to cut and kill or live.

164 - things are safe, stabilize elsewhere.];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd]
;W[jp];B[pj];W[dj];B[qn];W[nq];B[dh];W[dm];B[fi];W[fk]C[s> nice style, not rushing into anything, patiently waiting for a chance to strike.]
;B[gj];W[gk];B[hj]
(;W[jj]LB[hc:E][lc:D][mc:C][nc:B][qf:A][ql:F]C[W:  I'm not sure why I did that.  H9 was the obvious move.

s> this is a tricky part of the game, when to play somewhere else?  as the plays get away from the edges consider going elsewhere.  There is not much territory in the center.  get small investements in many areas, with potential in each one.

I would not R17 or C17, they would get small life, but not much influence on the board.  look for something that will live and flow into the board.

I have marked things I would try.

A: I like this best, because it can flow in three directions.  A is likely to be a sacrifice stone to set up some other plays, for example F or B, then E.

try some light plays, let them die if needed, play free and open, I think you will enjoy the game much more.]
;B[hk];W[hl];B[ik];W[jk]C[W:  Maybe J8 would have been better.]

(;B[jl]C[W:  I hadn't anticipated this move, but since I can separate B, I guess I will.]
;W[il];B[kl];W[lk];B[ll];W[nl]C[W:  I don't really have a plan at this point.  I'm just reacting to his moves, one at a time.]
;B[pl];W[on];B[om];W[nm];B[pn]LB[oo:B][po:A]C[s> white is to keep black out.
A: keeps a cutting point at B
B: safer connection.]

(;B[jn]C[W:  I hadn't anticipated the net, and almost played tenuki here, but then I realized I had more liberties.

s> nice, your first reaction said oops, I'm dead, but then you read it out a bit.  a good sign of go play.]
;W[jm];B[jh];W[in];B[kn];W[im];B[lp];W[lq];B[qq]C[W:  Starting with move 51, B was able to live in the corner.  I wonder how I might have prevented that.

s> black's move #55 was slack, and gave an opening for white to kill.
other chances came up, don't stress the small edge stones when you can jump in and remove the eyes.]
;W[qp]C[W:  My main concern here was to prevent B from linking to his stones above.]
;B[rq];W[rp]LB[pq:A][or:B][qr:C]C[s> black wants to live in the corner the main choices I would consider are...
A: reflex move, extend to have three in a row
B: seems odd, but gets a wider base
C: closes off the corner, will there be enough room?

one of the biggest things to improve your game is the ability to read.
choose the possible moves and read out how they will go.]
(;B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[pr]LB[sq:A][sr:E][os:B][qs:C][rs:D]
C[s> many choices

C, D and E seem to be the critical spots for two eyes or connecting out.

C seems the best to me.]
(;W[os]
(;B[ps]LB[rr:B][ns:A]C[s> white has some choices here:
A: save the stone P1
B: kill the black corner group

when the other guy threatens to take a stone, take a moment and think... 
- it's just a stone, 
- does he get an eye by taking it?  
- does he cut my groups apart?]
(;W[ns]C[s> protecting this stone is not needed.  it does save one stone, but if black takes P1, it will not be an eye.]
;B[rr];W[sq];B[sr]LB[fc:C][qf:B][sp:A]
(;W[sp]LB[cc:B][rs:A]C[s> again, this is a small move, not gaining much.

for black, A = pass, B = keep the corner.]
(;B[rs]C[s> this move is worse than PASS, he fills in his own territory.]

(;W[nj]C[s> O8 is very strong, can never die, extend out a bit more.]
;B[io]LB[ho:A][jo:B]
(;W[ho];B[ip];W[hp];B[iq];W[hq];B[hr];W[gr]LB[kq:B][ir:A]C[s> black has the choice of...
A: defend his stone at H2
B: make life for his group, and lose H2.]
(;B[ir]C[s> I think this is the move where black lost.];W[kq]
C[W:  I wanted to try to live in here, but I wasn't sure how to go about it.

s> excellent play by white. connects to K4, reduces eye space, threatens to cut at K5]
;B[kr]LB[jo:B][lr:A]
(;W[lr];B[np]LB[jo:B][op:A]C[s> white has a choice to connect at A or cut at B.  go is all about visualizing the future possible moves.  Go ahead and read it out, count the liberties.]

(;W[no];B[mp];W[mo]
(;B[lo]LB[jo:B][op:A]C[s> again, cut or connect, read it out, who wins?]

(;W[op];B[jo]LB[kp:A][jq:C][jr:B]C[s> white has some options,
A: rescue K4 and close the possible eye at L5
B: capture L2 and create two eyes for white
C: connect with K4, threaten to capture L2.

for close combat like this one needs to identify the most likely moves and read out what will happen.

one can see how the battle on one side will effect the battle on the other.
for example, if R3 had been captured, then O3 would not worry about liberties as much.]

(;W[kp]C[s> this does take away an eye from black, however it does not help the white group form eyes.]

(;B[mq];W[mr]
(;B[jr]C[W:  B lost the game with this move.

s> may be, but I cannot find any other good move for black.  I think the black group had little hope.]
;W[ls]C[W:  This eye turned out to be crucial.  B could easily have made an eye on the first line, but instead he attacked on the right.]
;B[ro]LB[so:A][hs:B]C[s> there is a liberties race going on with P5 and M5.

A: sente move, black must respond, but it takes away a liberty for white.
B: attack from outside. take away a liberty from black, but not from white.]

;W[qi]LB[ql:A][rl:B]C[s> black wishes to attack S7,

B: indirect]
(;B[ql];W[rl];B[qh];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[rf]LB[qf:B][sf:A][ph:C]
C[s> white has a few moves to consider ( locally )
A: slide under the stone, get stable in sente.
B: cut through, support the cut at C
C: cut off Q11 directly.  may need the support of other moves first.]

(;W[sf];B[se]LB[qf:B][sg:A][ph:D][si:C]C[s> in this stretched out shape, with lots of cuts, consider different moves...

A: defend the attacked stone, just a stone, let it go. :)
B: start to cut up the opponent, prepares for maybe D?
C: defend, get something with life, then you can attack with confidence.
D: attack at another point, maybe it needs some supporting stones ( sacrificed to support this move )]

(;W[sg]LB[qe:A][ri:B]
(;B[qe];W[si];B[qc]C[s> the cut at Q12 seems big to me.  it may need a preparing move or two.
for example, move to lean against K12 or K16, not too close, just close enough to bother him.  after he responds on the other side a couple of times, then you have good support for the Q12 cut to work.]
