C[Dear Reviewer,

I looking for comment for white on the theme in Fuseki order and joseki I choose suitable for the game or not. In the middle game I hope receive some tesuji tips and advide.  And hope may receive your insight ideas to improve my game performance.

Thank you.];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[ep]C[Q: am I put white stone 4 to block black 3 is in right timing? Or I should put W4 into Q16(star point) first?

Either is acceptible; filling all 4 corners before playing twice in any corner is more usual, but this configuration can be
found in pro games.];B[dq]C[This is, I think, a mistake on B's part. I don't find it in the pro game database. Moves that pros made from this position include Q17, Q16, E3, G3, H4, E5 and D6.]
;W[pd]C[Q: I should put white stone 6 at E3 to block instead of place it at the star point?

Blocking is probably correct. In the GoBase repository, the pros blocked at E3 in all 6 games where the lower left corner situation came up.]

C[I think S4 is better here];B[nq];W[pr]C[This is not a good move; it makes poor shape. you should play S4]
;B[oo];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[nr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lq];W[jq]
;B[ql];W[om]C[You should play tenuki here, perhaps D10 or around one of the upper corners.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[qm];W[qj];B[pk];W[pj];B[ok];W[cj];B[cm];W[lc]
;B[db];W[cb];B[dc];W[cc];B[ed];W[da]C[I don't like this move; it's too small. E15 is much more important.]
;B[eb]C[B should have played at C16 (for a fight) or D15 (for influence in the center and left side). This move is too small.]
;W[cg]C[Dangerous because it leaves weaknesses behind at C16 and D15. C14 would be better.]

C[Q: White 54 is confirm dead already, so I do not want to place more stone and waste here. And so I place it at White 58 intend to block black. Right?

Or in this situation, other place within the board got more important and urgent place to place stone for?

The correct joseki move is Q18 followed by R18, taking the corner.]
;B[na];W[qb];B[pb];W[rb];B[lb];W[pa]C[This is an end game move; it is not yet worth playing.]
;B[oa];W[qa];B[ld];W[og];B[lf];W[lh]C[Q: This move white 70 intend to block black further advance into center area, am I place the stone in the right location?

This center is not worth much, since neither side has much territory in the center that they can surround.  You could try to save P7 with N7 but it's probably too early. A play around K5 or K6 might be best here. D15 should also be considered. The move O16 is sente and should be remembered,]
;B[ef];W[df]C[This move should be at D15, then E14 does not work to invade the corner.]
;B[de]C[Q: when black place B73, when is the best location to block? Is here got tesuji (skillful play) able to apply in this situation?

I think if I block or react in this situation, I become reactive, and hace a feel of under-hand.]
;W[cd]C[I place W74 become of situation ask for the respond. I wonder have better location to react to the treat from being eat W2 if Black place on the location.

I think this is your best move here. The mistake was a move earlier.]
;B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[dg]C[You should have sacrificed D14 and played B14, to keep your stones connected.]
;B[bf];W[ae];B[eg];W[bd]C[I don't think this is required. In response to A14 you can play A17. So you should be able to play E12 here, or perhaps C8 or even D7. Another good move is E10.]
;B[bg];W[ch];B[ei];W[bh];B[do];W[fo];B[en];W[dp]C[This move is no good; it gains you nothing and takes away your liberties. The situation on the left is urgent, and you are letting black build up strength before attacking you there.]
;B[cq];W[eo];B[dn];W[er];B[dr];W[fr];B[kp];W[lr];B[jp];W[kq]
C[Instead, you should play J3 or even J4. B will not be able to cut you.]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[hp]C[You are letting B build up a wall toward the center.]
;W[gp]C[This move almost loses you your left side pieces. H3 is better.]
;B[hq];W[gq]C[You could still save your stones if you played at H2 here. Then if B G2 you must play J2 and then you can connect with either G1 or G3.]
;B[hr];W[gr];B[go];W[ho]C[Your only hope here would be to play G6 followed by F6 and try to run out into the center. Even if it you can't save the stones, you should at least be able to make gains by threatening to save them.]
;B[gn];W[fe];B[ee];W[np];B[mo]C[These two peeps are too early; you should remember them and use them only if you have a way to connect to them or otherwise make use of them.]

C[Q: I think with this black stone move in and destroy the eye, I lose this area of territory already. Am I able to counter this black 215?

W at B18 makes this a ko or seki];W[fb];B[bb]C[Q: I still wonder, already have B215 destroy the eye, how the purpose of the B217 for?

To prevent you living in seki];W[fa];B[ec];W[gi];B[fi];W[gd]
;B[gc]C[Up to this point, I decide to resign, since I few no more chance can turn-arround the situation. Am I should continue the play?

You could honorably have resigned after losing the stones around F3. You have no good chance here.]
