jacek 5k*: hello.

jacek: Thank you for reviewing my game. I chose this one, because I didn't see any big tactical blunders I made, and I don't really know why I lost.

Summary:

You manage to lose the game in the opening. By about move 50 you seem to be behind.

I think that perhaps there are 3 reasons for this. For about the first 20 moves it feels to me as if you are just answering black's moves. Do you have any plans of your own?

Then in the bottom right corner you make a vary bad choice of joseki. you don't get a good reult and you end in gote.

Then in the top right corner you end in gote again.

Each time you end in gote, black uses sente to expand his territory, so you end up behind in territory.

Perhaps you need to study the opening a bit? You need to think about making all your stone work together and trying to preven you opponent from making his stones work together. This is sometimes referred to as "the direction of play". You still have to play ordinary move like extensions an pincers. You seem to know the basics of this. The next level of sophistication is to try to find which of the seemingly simmilar moves actually work best in a particular position.   One book I like is "Get Strong at the Opening". You have to work quite hard to extract the main ideas from the sequence of problems, and more importantly the answers, but if you make the effort you will learn a lot.

Of course, I have only seen one of your games, so I could have got the wrong impression.

I hope that you find this review helpful,

;W[jq]
(;B[oj]C[This is a good move,

but,

It is worth looking at the board and noticing that all 6 black stones are on the right hand side of the board. This is not very balanced. It is quite important to establish a presence somewhere else too. One idea would be to apprach the top corner at F17, hoping to make a moyo across the top. What I am trying to say is that there are other good moves available for black.

However, when you consider the result that happens in the game, it is quite good for black, so in this case you should ignore this comment.]
;W[on];B[np];W[mn];B[lq]
(;W[ko]C[Up to here black is happy. He has made territory whilst attacking.

However that does not mean that white is loosing. White was very sensible to answer black's threatening moves. The position is still basically even. But you must admit that it looks like black is the one with big plans, and white is just answering.

Perhaps this last white move is a bit slow? I think that there might be bigger moves. On the other hand this move is thick.]

(;B[jr]C[This is a bad move.

If this was the endgame and the area at the bottom left was going to be white territory, then this would be a good, big sente endgame move.

However this is still in the opening and in the furure black might want to invade in the bottom right so this is bad. It makes white a lot stronger and makes it a lot easier for white to make territory in the bottom left.

Also, the black corner is very strong because of the two moves at O4 and M3 that black was able to play whilst attacking white. This means that if white plays a move like L2 to seal off the edge, then black can just ignore it. White would not be threatening to do anything nasty to the corner. So white L2 would be gote. Is white going to spend a whole move just sealing off the edge? Well if he does black should be very happy at this early stage of the game.

So white is unlikely to play round here anytime soon. So black will still have the option of playing here later. So black should not be in a rush to play around here:

"Keep your options open."

The other reason why this move is bad is is that there is a much better move avaiable. If you look at the whole board there should see one point with a great big flag on it saying "PLAY HERE BLACK!!!". Where do you think it is? (see variation)]
;W[ir];B[kr];W[iq];B[cn]
(;W[cl]C[jacek: Is B5 better ?

Good question.

When the time comes to choose a joseki you must ask yourself:

1) what are the surrounding positions like?

2) so what would I like to achieve in this situation?

3) so which is the right move to play to achieve this?

1) In the top right there is a single white stone on the 4-4. So you might like to play a move on the left edge since whatever else that achieves it would also be a good extension.

At the bottom you have that strong formation that black was so kind to give you. However it is quite close to the corner so it would be very easy to end up with an over-concentrated position.

2) So what would you like to achieve? Well one thing that springs to mind is that there is a very big move at the top. You would like to extend to the middle of the top to limit the size of the black moyo. Such a move would also be a nice extension from your corner. So you would like to end up with sente.

3) So where should you play? With the 4-4 point there are basically 4 plans.

a) The second most common plan is to play a pincer. This is a good idea here because it is a combination pincer and extension. This is the correct pincer to play because you want to finish up with sente. We will look at the variations in a minute.

First look at the variations to see the other 3 possible plans.]
;B[cq]
(;W[dq]LB[cp:a]C[jacek: Is C4 better ?

Yes, 'a' is definitely better.

If you play this way then you end up with a wall that is too close to your strong position at the bottom. You get seriously over-concentrated. Also, you end in gote.

See the variation for what happens after 'a'.];B[cp];W[do];B[bn]
;W[em]C[White is badly over-concentrated at the bottom.];B[pl]
;W[ql]C[White should not answer. The single white stone at the 'tail' of the white group is not important. White is connected out into the middle so white does not need eyes on the edge.

If black wants to spend two whole moves capturing 1 white stone, and, perhaps, making 10 more points of territory, then white should let him. White should be able to find much bigger moves than that elsewhere on the board.]
;B[ml];W[km]LB[ri:A][ro:B]C[Again, this move isn't really necessary. Since white played a defensive move on the edge, if he ever does get cut off then it is easy to live with moves like 'A' and 'B' which are good endgame moves as well. It is still better for white to play at the top.]
;B[kk];W[jd]C[At last!];B[cc]C[Interesting question: which side should white block on? and after that which joseki should he choose?]

(;W[dc]LB[bl:A][ck:B][bk:C][cj:D][mc:E]C[I think that this is the wrong side. I could be worng, but I gave this question quite a lot of thought.

To start with there is a proverb that covers exactly this situation. The proverb says "Block on the wider side." For once it is a go proverb that is hardly ever wrong. The only difficulty is deciding which is the wider side.

At first sight the left side is wider than the top.

There are, however, reasons to think again. First, one option for black is to play the huge endgame moves balck a, white B, black C, white D in sente. This makes the left side smaller than it first appeared.

Second, if white can finish the sequence in the top left in sente then he can follow it up with a move at E. This makes the top wider than at first appears. Despite all this, I still think that the proverd is right, and white should block on the other side. See the variation.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf]C[I agree that white should double-hane.]
;B[cf];W[de];B[bg]C[White now has a choice.]
(;W[df]C[White plays this way to take sente. This is good in this game.]
;B[af];W[cg];B[bh]TR[df]C[jacek:  Usually B connects at B14. What should W do here? Tenuki?

Correct. The whole point of the marked atari move was to take sente.

You should not be scared to ignore black. The move played here is very similar to the joseki move. It is interesting to put them both on the board and compare them. This move is stronger down the left side (but not much) but it leaves some slight problems for black in the corner, especially if white gets the hane at C.]
;W[bf]C[This is not so good. White ends up loosing sente.];B[cb]

[na:B][oa:C][qa:D][qb:E][qc:F][sa:G][sb:H][sc:I][sd:J][se:K]
[sg:M][sf:L][qe:N][qf:O][qg:P][qh:Q]C[Now white is in real trouble in the game. We can count the territory. I assume that you know how to do this. If not then you should read the first chapter of the book "The Endgame" from the elementary go series.


Black:

Top right corner: 35

I like to count territory in pairs. I have indicated the pairs I would count there. Notice that I have been fairly mean and only counted points that are virtually certain to become black territory. This is 17 pairs, 34 point. Call it 35.

Bottom right: 20

Top left: 10

Bottom left 10

Total: 75


White:

Bottom: 25

Right: 5

Komi: 5

So white needs to make about 40 points from the moyo at the top. I think that you would be lucky to get 20 points there.

White must desparately find something impressinve, either that or resign. Fortunately there is something that whtie can try. See the variation for white's possible move.]

;B[kf]C[jacek: I thing cutting off the black group was bad for W. Right ?

I think so. You have made a little bit of extra territory in the centre by attacking, but your stones at the top are in trouble in exchange. I think that you needed to play the cut earlier.]

(;W[fp]CR[fp]TR[fq][gq]C[b) In isolation, this move (or one of the triangled ones) is most often correct. It is a patient move. Black needs to play another stone so white should end in sente.

(;W[bo]CR[bo]TR[bp][cp]C[c) When white is strong enough it good to play one of the moves that seals off the corner territory.
