C[backpacker (BP): I have added many comments to show my thinking. I am interested in my faults in those thoughts, and what you would do.  Also if you have any shape issues please let me know (bad peeps, bad kosumi's, etc.).  Thanks much.  I won this game by 4.5 , after the 6.5 komi.  Yikes it was close.]

[cj:B][qn:C]C[When you play the marked stone high, you usually accept gote, and play there again, maybe at 'B', to protect the weak spot at 'A'. When you want to have sente, you should consider playing low.

On the other hand, taking sente is a very good idea here. The left side isn't that as important as the right side is. I would prefere to play around 'C', though. If black pincers your move (which he should) he gets a nice result in the lower right.]
;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[kc]TR[nd]C[BP: I think this black move is small.

A move there is ok, since the marked stone is high again. Better shape is one point to the left, though.]
;W[cj]C[Good, big point, as I pointed out earlier.];B[ch]C[BP: another small black move?

No need to be that aggressive here, yes.];W[ej];B[cf];W[ce]
;B[df];W[fd];B[eh];W[pn]LB[qn:A]C[The high approach to the 4-4-point is usually bad. Thus, I would play 'A' here. I understand that you do not want to have all stones on the right side in a low position. But sometimes you cannot avoid it. This is such a case. Black played well, but missplaced the last move in this variation. Please have a look at the variation at move #27.]
;B[np];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo]
(;B[pl]C[BP: Now I figured I should build a base since I am being attacked.

This is a catastrophe for b. Please see var.];W[rq]C[Very good! This move spoils all of blacks possibilities. The last two moves changed the whole game: from a favourable position for b, to a good one for w.]
;B[pq];W[rr]C[You see, it is nearly reverted now. You got the corner, you got a save position, and b's territory is undercut now.]
;B[hc];W[gc];B[hd]TR[nd][pd][qc]LB[ge:A][gc:B][ec:C][cc:D]C[BP: Is this black shape too close to the other stone at L17?  That is why I played G17

Locally these three stones are maybe a bit overconcentrated. But considering also the other marked stones, it gives b not a bad position. Still not optimal, but ok. Thus, it is not clear that the result of the exchange is really good for b. I would prefer 'A' over 'B'. You should also consider the weaknesses of 'C' and 'D' in your actual position. Thus, even this small corner territory is far from being save.]
;W[ff]C[Good, splitting the two groups.];B[gh];W[fg];B[fh];W[hf]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[br];B[fo];W[om]TR[pl]LB[ih:A]C[BP: Black has 2 week groups and I am unsure as to how to procede.

Indeed, a difficult position here. Since the marked stone is light, it is not easy to attack. If you want to attack, I would suggest the other weak group, maybe at 'A'. This attack could help you to build territory on theleft, and limit b's moyo on the lower side. Alternatively, you could invade the lower side somewhere. What to do? Well, time to count, and decide afterwards!

Black:
Upper: 22
Left: 2
Lower: 30
_________
sum: 54

White:
UL: 14
LL: 20
Right: 15
Komi: 6.5
_________
sum: 55.5

Thus, even without your actual move the game is close. But you have sente. If you are able to get some more points on the left while attack the b group, and also limit the prospects of the lower b moyo, you should be able to have a good game. No need for a difficult invasion into the lower side.]
;B[pi]LB[pj:A]C[Mistake, 'A' is the shape-move here.];W[pj]
;B[qj]LB[rj:A]C[Proverb: "From a crosscut - extend!"

But is it applicable here? Maybe the game continuation isn't that bad. See some extensions in the variation for reference.]

(;W[rj];B[qk];W[oj];B[ri];W[qh];B[rh];W[rg];B[rk];W[ol];B[rm]
C[BP: I think he is living small, so it is okay to me.  But It was my side, so  that potential is gone, except for my outside influence.

You did not lose so many points on the right, because you could not expect to capture the invading-stone. Thus, I think the result is fair.]
;W[og];B[sj];W[gj]LB[ih:A]C[BP: Off to weak group #2.  Would you attack from this direction?

I would still attack from 'A'.];B[fm];W[el];B[lq];W[ko]LB[hi:A]
C[BP: I diverted from the attack and went after his potential moyo.  Bad?

Yes. The next attacking moves, starting with 'A', are at least sente. You should not b give the option to play there first, and save his group.

B's moyo does not have much potential.];B[nn];W[jo];B[ip];W[io]

You play a "thick" go, not giving your opponent many possibilities to attack. That's fine. But when you find a group to attack, you have to make a plan. You should know what you want to achieve with this attack. Sometimes, a small achievement is enough, then you should go for it. Sometimes, when you are behind, you have to get more. In that case, make a (more risky) plan to get that. If it fails, you will lose the game, but if you don't take this risk, you will lose anyway, because you are behind.]
