Dear Reviewer,

I played black in this game. I am 1d on kgs and my opponent is 5d. The time is seven 50 second byo-yomi. It might be a little fast but it's not often i get to play a 5d even. I still lost. I tried to  capture a group at the top and it got away. The game ends with one of my groups getting captured. I don't know how to count territory point by point but before my group was captured I think was behind. I wanted to win this game. My request is "How could I have won this game?"

Please review for both sides. The more knowledge the better. =) Thank you for the review. It will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Danny Kwon

(;B[if]C[How about R16 instead here?

emp: R16 not bad to secure the corner, but w can erode from K17 direction, R16 isn't that big. b got no good moves to play there, the reason was M16.]

;B[fg];W[hi];B[ch]C[Is D12 also possible? I don't know how to play after white cuts.

emp: this move is overplayed. b isn't that strong in this surrounding. so don't push too hard. D12 is better than C12.]

(;W[cb]C[baka [-\]: :P

emp: too passive , but w got sente.]
(;B[ck]C[I didn't like this move. Can black play elsewhere?

emp: ya, a large part of the board is empty now];W[jb];B[fi]
C[emp: this is way too repetitive to C9. C9 was a small move.]
;W[bg]C[I thought about playing B12 next but if I read the top left corner correctly white can live even if white ignores black B12 and black follows up with C15. Later on white played B12 and it was a big point. Maybe during the game black could have played it.

emp: small move by w. it's not at the ending game stage yet.]

(;B[cn]C[I went for an approach move on whites corner

emp: too small and in wrong direction. F3 is the right direction to approach. the existance of C9 made C6 direction a barren land for both side.]
;W[co];B[dn]C[The extension isn't ideal but my idea is it makes a base sente.

emp: bad idea. again, too small, not efficient at all.];W[fp]

emp: L3 is good];W[rp];B[qq];W[qm];B[rq]C[emp: small move. b can go R6 at the later stage.]
;W[rd]C[emp: w should take care of L3 or H13 group now. two weak groups are too many.  even if w wants to play at upper right, Q17 is better.]
;B[qc];W[ph]C[Looking at it now the white corner is invadable.

1) to know what a valuable target should look like, take sente exchange into consideration.

2) to know when to attack and how much pressure is proper.

3) get a clearer mind about basic life&death during the game.

4) avoid unnecssory moves.

5) appreicate good and bad directions.

6) try to think about "don't answer" as a possible answer.

w didn't show a 5d's strength in this game.
