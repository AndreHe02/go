;B[jd];W[dc];B[cj];W[jj];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg]C[Per: This move makes black overconcentrated. The solid connection at D8 looks better.]
;W[fc];B[kh];W[hk]C[Per: Now black has to make a descision. The normal joseki M4-L3-L9 looks strange here. So black has to chose another path.
See variations for my suggestions.]
(;B[jc]C[Per: Allthough this move is very solid it might be to slow.]
;W[lj];B[li]LB[kf:A]C[I thought 14 was amaing at A

Per:
Yes, this is a good move for white.];W[ek];B[dk]LB[ej:A]C[I was wondering whether A was better, defending the left side, but losing the corner : I prefered to take the corner

Per:
I would have made the same choice. Playing A would have made the D7 stone even more overconcentrated.]
;W[ej];B[dl]C[I saw that 18 was aiming at invading the left side, but I thought I could defend and that white should answer 19

Per:
It would be to slow for white to defend at E2.];W[ch]LB[bf:a]
[di:b]C[Per: Good, white is showing fighting spirit.
Black now faces a difficult descision since white can connect at both A or B. See variations for some of blacks possible responses.]

(;B[bh]C[Per: This looks a little strange to me. White can cut black apart by playing B7.]
;W[bg];B[bi];W[bf];B[dh]C[Per:
White D5 and black is seperated.];W[cg];B[di]C[I lost a big part of the left side ... but still could invade the lower side thanks to 19]
;W[df]C[Per:
This is small.];B[fl]C[Per:
Black could also consider M3 since white didn't answer M5.]
;W[gl];B[fk]C[Per:
Black E2 gives black sente to play the big move at J6];W[el]

(;B[kj]LB[ki:A]C[I didn't want to let white the opportunity to play A]
;W[kk];B[ki];W[ji]C[Per:
Black has very few liberties, but white has many cuttings points.]

(;B[kg]C[I had to do it ...
Per:
See last comment.];W[fg]C[I didn't understand this move
Per:  White is probaly trying to make points in the center, but H2 and M3 is much bigger.]
;B[jg]C[for me this was big];W[hl]C[Per:
This treathens D4, but M3 is still very big.];B[lk];W[ll];B[mj]
;W[kl]C[Per:
Now is the time to play D4.];B[hg];W[dj]C[I didn't see it ... it was a hard blow]
;B[bk];W[ci]
(;B[ef]C[I was lost : I didn't know what to do
Per:
The best thing you can do now is to play the forcing moves at G8 and G6 followed by G12. This will make the game close, but white would still have a small lead.]

(;B[bg]C[Protect against  the low connection.]
(;W[di];B[bh]C[Per:  White has reduce blacks left side in sente, but have given black a  good move at B9. White can't be satisfied with this outcome.]
)
(;W[ci];B[bh];W[bi];B[bj];W[eh];B[ai]C[Per:
Blacks left side is reduced, and black has the good endgame move at B9. Just like the the last variation.
But this time white has better shape in the center.]))
(;B[dh]C[Protect against the high connection.];W[bf]C[Per:
This is a very annoying situation for black. White has taken the left side and is still able to cut at D5.  Black has no option other than protecting against this low connection.]

(;B[hc]C[Treat L6 lightly and play elsewhere.])
(;B[lj];W[kk];B[jf]C[Per:
This makes points and increase black strength in the center.]
