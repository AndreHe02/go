AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hello 
Leslie.
In a 9H game, B has a 'lead'. I don't think it is necessary to respond to 
*every* move that W plays, unless it urgent and affects the game by a lot.

After i had looked through the game, I noticed that you do the Empty 
Triangle often. Usually, this is not a good move. I will explain why before 
I review your game..];W[cn]
(;B[cl]C[I this the best joseki?
Don't worry about joseki for now. People only need joseki when it is 
impossible to improve without study. We're not in that stage yet. (Think 
about joseki when 5k...)

C9 is choking Ws eyespace. W can either:

-use C6 as a sacrifice and then take the corner. (if this happens, B will 
have more influence than it already has)

-refuse option one, leap out and fight.];W[en]
(;B[do]C[D5 threaten to disconnect W.
W's stones are almost connected already. W responds by strengthening his 
stones. (forms a group of 3. libs=8) (B in contact with W. libs=5)
D5 is not best move. It strengthens W and weakens B (relatively) 
simultaneously.];W[dn];B[bo];W[gn];B[fo];W[fn];B[eo]SQ[do][dp]
C[Is the shape good for black?
[ \] = ET.];W[go];B[gp]C[I s  the marked stone the best move?
i'm sure there's a better move, but i like G4. it serves its purpose. =D]
;W[jn];B[io]LB[ho:A]C[Should balck play here or A?
Doesn't matter either way, because W can still connect.
W is running. this means W is in some sort of trouble. (W doesn't have any 
eyeshape as yet either)];W[ln];B[ko];W[nn];B[mo];W[ll];B[kn]
;W[pg];B[qg]C[Should this move be in the 5th line?
Q13 (W) is a move i have seen being played by a dan player when playing W in 
9H. It has many 'back-up' plans, so to speak. (can attack corner, or attack 
side or run to centre).

R13 is dangerous....
Connecting to opponents stone can sometimes be bad b/c (because) you lose a 
liberty immediately. Ws turn in next, so now W is favour.)]
;W[ng];B[of];W[me];B[nf];W[fc]C[Who is better now
Too hard to say. A lot can happen...
But for now, B is up. (b/c of the 9H)];B[hc];W[cf];B[df];W[dg]
;B[ef]C[Well done on circled stone. After W takes another one of your 
liberties, you should strengthen your stone. Now B has replaced lost libs. 
Good!];W[db];B[ec];W[qn];B[po];W[pn]
(;B[oo]LB[on:A]C[Should I play A?
No, A isn't too good. See what could have happened when A is played.]
;W[ce];B[de];W[cd];B[dc]C[W has claimed top left corner.];W[cc]
;B[eb];W[eg];B[fg];W[mf];B[nd]TR[pd][pe][nf][of]C[triangle: this shape you may be familiar with 
(The Net). It's a good shape for creating eyes. Good eyeshape. (this 'empty 
net' doesnt make a eye just yet b/c W is too close.)];W[qf]

(;B[qh]LB[pf:A]C[Should I play A?
A can be played. R13 gets cut off for the time being but... since it is on 
3rd line... I think it entails some fighting. I think it could work out.]

;W[jb];B[ib];W[cb];B[fh]LB[pf:C][ch:A][ql:B]C[I think this is not the best move
It wasn't that urgent. However, C12 would be good point for B or W.

in no particular order, A. B, C look like good moves for now.
A and B secures potential territory for B. C is fun. (fighting...)]
;W[el];B[dm]LB[ek:A]C[I think I should play at A
D7 doesnt do as much as it looks like it does. You can play A if you wanted, 
but there are more pressing points you can play. =D];W[bn];B[ei]
CR[em]TR[eh]C[I sthis the best move?
it makes a nice box focussing on the centre and can hold around 3 points. 
Does something, but there are also some other moves.
triangle: behaves like e11 but stronger and more secure.
circle: more fighting. B can cut E8 from Ws wall and get potential terr.]
;W[ok];B[oi]LB[pk:A]C[Should I play at A?
=D A sees the point, but R8 does more or less the same thing. R8 more 
secure, safer in my opinion.];W[jc];B[ic]C[Should I play at J16?
Sure. can avoid ET.];W[hf];B[gf]C[did my territory became smaller
Hmmm. The potential terr holds less points now. W is poking inside.]
;W[qk];B[ig]C[Why did nt white connect?
Don't know. I would have connected...
you can separate H14 from K14 and take back those lost points.]
;W[pk]C[This wasn't even urgent for W. Good question, why didn't W connect 
H14 to K14? =D];B[km];W[rg]C[Here's the part where W takes the top right cnr. You can save a lot 
of it.];B[og]CR[ng]SQ[nf][of]C[Fighting triangle.

something inside. (cirlced)

for the review .Since I am not very good at asking questions ,add any 
necessary comments by your self

Good game.
I am sure you will improve a lot.

Recap:
-ETs are inefficient. Your game will improve once you limit amount of ETs.
-Centre isn't as large as it looks. Take sides whenever they are free. 
(after the corners) those points i had mentioned before have many points 
inside them. watch out for them.
-protect corner.
-trust yourself more. You know when you connect, and you are right when you 
think so. Don't be afraid to attack. It doesnt always end out bad for you...

I hope this review has helped you, even a little.])

TRIANGLES:
##ARE A WASTE OF A STONE AND LIBERTY. = FREE TURN FOR YOUR OPPONENT##
- Both shapes are made from 3 stones. But, they have different amounts of 
liberties. The straight line has 8 and the ET (empty triangle) has 7. So, 
the ET doesn't have as many liberties as it can. Less liberties=less 
strength

- ETs aren't as strong as the straight line and do not exert as much 
influence as the straight line.

- In my experience, ETs are the beginning of an ugly heavy shape. (dango)

**There are few circumstances in which ET is good. The good ET makes good 
eyeshape.

This concludes my little lesson on ETs. (I hope I explained it well...)]
