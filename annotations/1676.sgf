C[Hello.
Before I played this game I set my rank to 12k. I don' play go often and I thought I got stronger a bit recently, so I just wanted to test my strenght.
I think I didn't play well, my opponent gained advantage and could even kill my center group. But even he made a mistake at the end, the game became equal, and he shouldn't give up so early.
I don't read moves forward well, but i think I have shape sense.
Plaese comment my game.
Sorry for my english.

:: Hello,
We discussed your game in a small group of our local go-club. I hope you'll find the following comments helpfull.

Steffen];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qn];W[np];B[pj];W[cf];B[fc]
;W[dj];B[lq]TR[qn][np][pp]C[:: This is a quite aggressive move by black. It had to be expected in the marked formation, though.]

(;W[hq]C[
:: Maybe(!) this move is too loose on the black stone to the right.
See variation for some possible continuations.];B[oq]
(;W[nq]C[
:: We agreed that this was an important move. The variation is not as good, we concluded...]
;B[op]
(;W[oo]LB[pp:A]C[

:: This move invites trouble. The possibilities are immense. Maybe giving away the corner - while leaving potential with A - would be getter. See variation.]
;B[pq]LB[oq:A]C[

:: It's not a good idea to let white build a wall facing black's sphere of influence towards the top. So the wide extension with A was not a good idea in the first place.]
;W[po];B[nr];W[mr];B[or];W[mq]C[Here I wasn't sure to connect at N3 becouse I was afraid of cut at O5.  I think after the cut one of my groups would die, but i couldn't find better move. Probaly O3 was too greedy.

:: As I already said. O3 was most likely a must. In this situation - after you invested all these stones - keeping the black stones from connecting to the outside with N3 is a must, too.
The cut at O5 could invite trouble - but trouble for both sides!]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[cm]C[

:: This move of black is too weak against the bottom or the top. One should decide what do to and not play halfhearted moves.]

(;W[cp]C[Maybe better at C9.

:: Yes, since the top group is weaker than the one at the bottom.
On the other side, after wC9 black could decide to take the corner. See variation.

Just as a sidenote:  We decided that the black group in the bottom right corner is dead. See second variation for some ideas.]
;B[bj]
(;W[ck]TR[cf][dj]C[

:: This is not a good move since it forces black to connect beneath and actually weakens the connection of the white stones marked.

Furthermore I'd like to point your attention to the whole board situation (never forget about her!):
The most interesting constellation is on the ride side: A quite solid white wall facing into a quite loose black sphere of influence.

There is quite a solid sphere of influence for white at bottom. 
The top left corner is quite surely black's. 
Generally speaking the top right is wide open an neither's territory by now.

And there is almost no territory for either side on the left.
(Let's consider the bottom right corner alive.)


These circumstances help to decide where to play:];B[bk];W[cl]
;B[bl];W[nc]LB[ch:A]C[

:: You cannot tenuki from the situation to the left, I'd guess.

Now black has all the options. Playing black I'd start with A e.g..

So white should play there first. After that black will have to respond there too. Otherwise the black group will be struggling to live.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[jc];B[pf];W[bn]C[


:: Again time to consider the whole-board situation:
The top right is black's. The ride side is still open and therefore big. The bottom (and left) is white's. The left side is unclear.
The top left is black (supposedly) the top edge is white (supposedly).

Due to two weak groups (of either player) the left side currently seems most interesting.
The white group there obviously needs reinforcement. Black's group there is very low.

So, your move at B6 is at the wrong side. -> Play from the weak group.

Actually B6 helps black. Since she can connect. This is very much a endgame-move!]
;B[cn];W[bo];B[bm]TR[cm][cn]C[

:: Now black has sort of stepping stone into white's bottom 'territory'.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[en]C[This move connects and builds moyo with cost of safety of upper left.


:: Yes. Now that all this mistakes happened you will have to stick with the top group, though.]
;B[ch]C[

:: Now black separates the white stones.];W[dg];B[dh];W[eg]

(;B[em];W[fm];B[fl]C[


:: Black does good to create cutting points and therefore possibilities: taking the white stones on the left or reducing white's territory at the bottom.
Later the cut at O5 could get interessting again.];W[el];B[dm]
;W[gm];B[ek];W[ej]

;W[ee]C[E15 Mistake];B[df];W[ef]LB[de:A]C[Now I think this is mistake too. I wanted to sacrafice to have external potential, but this move ensured black big advantage.


:: Yes, you should have played at A instead. This move would connect the corner to the outside. The corner ist too big to give away.]
;B[de];W[ed];B[ec];W[gg];B[lo];W[no];B[gl];W[hj];B[hl]
(;W[mm]C[

:: This move is neither 'meat nor fish'. 
It does not really attack the stones to the left and does not put pressure on the right side, either.]
;B[km];W[ln];B[kn];W[ko];B[jo];W[kp];B[jp];W[kq]C[

:: The territory on the bottom is almost reduced to 'nothing'.]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[ho];W[go];B[hm]
(;W[ql]LB[qk:A]C[

:: Maybe better one line above. I'd even consider the variation.]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[qk];W[pm];B[nj];W[mg]LB[me:A]C[Could I invade deeper to reduce black's territory?
I think black is strong here.


:: Currently black leads by about 20 points.
A deeper invasion is not really possible since the white group at the top is not that strong (Consider simply black A). 

Actually the situation is much in favor for black.];B[nh];W[ng]
;B[og];W[mh];B[mi];W[li];B[me];W[ld];B[lf]
(;W[lh];B[jf];W[cd]C[


:: Pointless. And not a nice style to play. I would rather keep such kind of moves as ko-threats.]
;B[dc];W[bc];B[bb];W[ke];B[kf];W[mj];B[ni];W[le]C[

:: Again a ko-threat. Don't play moves the opponent simply has to respond to.]

;B[gc];W[ig];B[if];W[jq];B[ji];W[jj]LB[lk:A]C[


:: Don't always try to capture few stones. First watch out if every group is secure.
The one to the right could be more easily secured by playing A e.g.]
;B[jg];W[jh]C[

:: Don't let the opponent atari you in that way.];B[kh];W[ih]

(;W[lk]C[Ko to save N12 group.


:: Good. I would FIRST walk into black's territory, though...
Reducing (and capturing some stones in the meantime) would be equally big.]
;B[mj]C[Mistake.
Now I can kill N 10 or R9


:: Right.];W[oh]
(;B[nl]C[Black o14 to catch n12 and save n10.


:: Yes, O14 would definitly be better since it get's rid of a thread.]
;W[ml];B[ok];W[qj]C[My mistake. P11 to kill N10, which is worth more.
I think the game is close now. Maybe white has a few points more.
I think black didn't see he could catch n12 (or he is very good at counting).
{Game 4: lukaas2 vs Buri : Black resigns.}


:: You had good alternatives here. I think you lead. Not with a bit margin, though.


I hope my comments help to improve your game.])

But there are many other possibilities...]))
