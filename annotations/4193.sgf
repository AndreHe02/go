AB[pd][dp]C[K: Hello dear reviewer,

First thank you very much for reviewing my game. This is the very first game i submit this way.

I read a lot of books but lack practice. I think my reading skill is slowly reaching 10k and that's why i asked this 8k player to give me "only" 2 stones. As you already understood, my nickname is Kaiu and i'm playing black in this game.

I am not asking for the "losing move" of course (i found some of them and the most obvious is L9). I would instead appreciate any comment about my primary concerns at the moment : Reading out variations and choosing the good one.

Of course i bow in front of any other matter you may want to underline if you feel it necessary.

L: Your comments will be marked as "K" , while my comments will be marked as "L".]

;W[cn]C[K: This "counter move" decided me to play for the left side.]
;B[cj];W[fp]
(;B[eo]TR[cn][fp]C[L: Before separating the two marked white stones, try to make the C5 stone heavy. Thus, white might be reluctant to save it. See variation.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[dq]
(;B[dm]C[K: With a weak point at C12, i felt i had to play a stone (D6 ? D7 ? E7 ?) to secure at least the lower part of "my" side.

Unfortunatly ending in gote, i could not play the O16 move i was hoping for...

L: D7 is overconcentrated. If you want to obtain territory along the left side, it's best to create some sort of framework here.  See variation.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[jd]C[K: At this point i felt again in front of a question. K4 to gave some "influence" to my opening (too much of black stones are low). Or a corner enclosure... (P18, Q18, R17)

L: It is best to secure the upper-right corner territory with Q18, since Q18 exploit some weaknesses in white's formation. See variation.]

(;B[jp]C[K: I choose the K4 option because of the relative weaknesses of the O17 and R11 white stones.]

(;B[ne]C[K:This is a "thank you move" for it forces white to play M16 (something he was happy to play).

But i felt i had to quickly settle this group...

L: See variation on some other ways to settle this group effectively.]

;W[rj];B[rh]C[K: And i settled, gote...];W[hq]C[K:I then asked myself :

Did i have to answer this ?

F17, C17, E14 were in my mind...

L: No, there is no need to answer H3 right now. F17, E14 are definitely the right moves here.]

;W[cc];B[gj]C[K: Now i have something weak to attack.

But in many of my previous games this week i tried to kill and failed...

I was very focused about harassing instead of trying to kill... I was obviously too focused on this, as you will see :)]
;W[gk]
(;B[ik]C[L: When white attaches ur G10 stones, it's best to keep ur stones strong. Thus, H9 would be a better move.

L11 looks promising instead...

L: No, this move is fine.];W[ki]

C[Thank you very much for this review !

Japanese rules :

White : 68 + 23 black stones + 0.5 komi
Black : 61 + 27 white stones
W + 3.5

L: In the end, the score came pretty close. Overall, I think you have a good direction of play. One thing to pay close attention to is the whole board view, and be flexible on your strategy. Look for enemy's weakness, and exploit them when the time is right. (such as S8 and H17). And of course, play slowly to avoid those blunders ;) Good luck in your future games!]
