C[ P: I think i've started ok, and i've losed because I haven't take care of my debilities.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[ PacoRuiz 6k*: Hello.

DRS: This is the most common move among pros here.];B[pk]LB[fq:A]
[pk:D][qk:B][qo:C]C[DRS: A through D are 1st thru 4th most common among pros here.]
;W[lp]LB[dj:H][jd:G][jp:A][jq:C][kq:F][lp:I][mp:D][nc:B][nq:E]
C[ P: No fuseki

A-I are the 1st thru 9th most common among pros.   So I isn't a bad move.]
;B[po]LB[ip:A][lp:B][pk:E][po:C][pq:D]C[ P: I think is the best response

DRS: Yokota Shigeaki played A here against Kato Masao in the 22nd Tengen, round 1.  This is the only pro game I have in which B was played.

C isn't bad, but:

1) If you want to play a shimari, it may be better not to play a Chinese opening.

2) C, D and E are all high (4th line) with respect to the right side, which means "no balance".  It is good to have a stone on the 4th, then one on the 3rd, then one on the 4th, and back and forth.  This gives "balance".]
;W[iq];B[mr]LB[cj:B][cq:D][dj:A][nd:C]C[ P: too slow? Better k17 or c10?

DRS: Yes, much too slow for this stage of the game.  I like A, B or C best.  I like the A/B area best, because a White extension around A or B would work well with the large wall that would form if you invaded at D.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qj]C[ P: No joseki

DRS: Yes, it's better not to attach here.  Attach strong stones, don't attach to weak stones, because it tends to erase your potential for invading.]
;B[qk];W[pj];B[nk];W[rk];B[rl];W[rj];B[qm];W[nj]LB[dj:C][ni:B]
[oj:A]C[DRS: I like A or B better for White locally.  Globally, C is big.]
;B[cj];W[fc]C[ P: this I think is bad

DRS: Since White has played into the widest area, I don't think this is all bad.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fq];B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[ic]LB[cj:A]C[These kicks of White's are poor.  Black gets ideal shape with A on both sides.]
;B[kc]C[ P: Now I thik I have advantage and I should win. Now I should defend from c12 and c8.

A quick gnugo count suggests Black is ahead by 17.5, so you are likely correct.]
;W[lr];B[mq];W[lq];B[mj]C[ P: Maybe e10 is better

DRS: I like E10.];W[mk];B[oj];W[ni];B[ml]LB[mk:A]C[DRS: Locally speaking, if you continue at A instead of B:

1) You poke your head through, and put some pressure on White's group
2) You eliminate a useful forcing move of White's
3) You don't force A to strengthen.  I believe this is a "thank you" move.]
;W[oi];B[lk]C[ p: I've loosed the sente for almost nothing

DRS: This is not nothing.  A ponnuki is worth a lot.  http://senseis.xmp.net/?APonnukiIsWorthThirtyPoints]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[oj]C[ P: this is very bad, I have now sente

DRS: I agree.  This move of White's is quite small.];B[re];W[rf]
;B[fo]C[P: e10 better, or b6 or b14

DRS: I like E10.];W[ch]
(;B[dh]LB[dh:A][di:B]C[A is good if you want to take influence.  B may be able to shut in White.]
;W[di];B[ci];W[dg]
(;B[eh];W[cg];B[eg];W[bf];B[de]C[DRS: This asks White to strengthen the corner, and does little to protect the two black stones.]
;W[cd];B[ed];W[ec];B[ef];W[ge];B[ej];W[in];B[gp]C[ PG7 better?

DRS: Yes, I like G7 better locally.];W[gq];B[hp];W[ip];B[gm]
;W[no];B[np];W[mo];B[oo];W[om];B[pm];W[nm];B[nl];W[nf];B[gg]
;W[il];B[bi]LB[ls:A]C[ P: H9?

DRS: H9 is OK. It expands B a little, and threatends to expand further.  I kind of like A, actually, because it's double sente.  Your move here is ok, because a capture has a good followup in the late endgame.]
;W[bg];B[ep];W[eq];B[do];W[cp]C[DRS: This isn't necessarily bad, but bear in mind that by playing this sequence, you're Also saying "I have no intention of invading here later".]
;B[hk]LB[bo:B][hi:A][ls:C]C[DRS: This is ok.  It expands Black a bit (doesn't reduce W at the same time tho), and threatens a further expansion around A.  However, B and C are nice too.  B is big and has a sente followup, while C is double sente.]
;W[hq]C[ P: Very small];B[le]LB[ke:A]C[DRS: I like A better locally.]

[lh:E][ls:B][sf:C]C[DRS: This is worth 1 point in sente, but it is gote for White to do anything here, and it erases a ko threat.  I think there are bigger moves, like A, B, C or D.  E isn't bad. Actually E is quite large, albeit gote.]
