C[Degan:  I played black in this game which I played on DGS, so I had plenty of time to consider each move, and even downloaded the game and worked on variations sometimes, but didn't save any of those.  I have reviewed this game on my own, and have comments, variations, and questions throughout.

CH:  In this game, W played a series of weak early moves. As a result, with your group on the
         right side, you reached a clear advantage. Now you should have kept pushing into the 
        center.
        You then start making small moves instead of bigger ones, allowing White to catch up.
        89, 115 and 117 are the most typical examples. Playing at the border of two moyos counts
        twice: It takes away enemy territory while making your own. If there are two equally big moves
        to chose from, play the one that has the larger follow up. In the endgame, try to play before
        your opponent where it is sente for both sides. Finally, it was White's endgame experience 
        that decided the game.

        If you have further questions, send me an e-mail. I'm Christoph, 7 kyu.]

(;B[bq]LB[bp:A][gr:B]C[Degan: I think the sequence up to here seems pretty normal.  Is B3 too small?  Maybe A or B? Variations...

CH: The purpose of this move is making life, and that is achieved. I prefer this move over the others,
        since it leaves the maximum possibilities open for later. It is not too small, I don't think
        you could tenuki here. (I changed some of your variations)]
;W[po];B[lq]LB[iq:A][oq:B]C[Degan: I envision trading A or B with white to form a base.

CH:  good idea.];W[cj];B[ec]C[Degan: Is this too small?

CH:  See at move 17.];W[jd];B[qe]C[Degan:  Again, looks small in retrospect.

CH:  The shimaris are largest when they are combined with a third stone on the 
        side they are facing - this location is at K16/17 for the right upper shimari, at
        C/D10 for the left upper shimari. Both points were already occupied by W when 
        you played the shimaris, so they were not very effective.
        Therefore, I would have played 15 at K16. Depending on W's reaction,
       you can still play the shimari at R15 later, or take the other large point at Q10 / R10,
       or solidify the left upper corner. 
       At this early stage with so much of the board still open, you should remain flexible 
       and build influence rather than focusing on a certain spot to make territory. Be ready
       to give up part of the board in favour of other parts.]
;W[pj];B[iq];W[nq];B[qh];W[df]C[CH:  White should have played low at C14.]
;B[cf]C[CH:  good];W[cg];B[bf];W[dh];B[lc];W[le];B[hc];W[oe]
;B[oh]C[Degan:  I am getting the sense that I lost some opportunity to get some of the center.  This happens very frequently to me.

CH:  You did well. See at 43.];W[oc];B[pd];W[od];B[jc];W[pb]
;B[qb];W[nb];B[mb];W[he]C[CH:  White puts his hopes in the central moyo. Not a good strategy, since such moyos are easily reduced.]
;B[qj]C[Degan: Are these (moves 41 & 43) good?  It seems like I can take some more side territory.

CH:  see at 43.];W[pm];B[ql]C[CH: Each of the black moves 23...43 are good, together,
        they are putting Black ahead in the game. This applies especially
       to 41 and 43. It's White who is to blame for playing slack. It is incredible
       how his initial stone at K16 ends up being placed there to no avail. Also, Q10
      should have been played low at R10, and (after Black R10) Q7 at R9.]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[ol];B[ok];W[pk];B[qk];W[rm]C[CH:  W should play P10]
;B[rl]C[CH:  not here, at P10, it's urgent.];W[nm];B[oj];W[pi]
C[Degan: I was surprised that white did this.  Moves like this make me doubt I have read things out correctly, so I work them out again and again.

CH:  Q11 was bad, it helped you further consolidate your position. Black is ahead now.]
;B[oi];W[ri];B[qi];W[pg];B[pf];W[og];B[ph];W[qg];B[rg];W[of]
SQ[pf]C[Degan: From here on till much later in the game, I'm wondering when it is worthwhile to do something in the upper right corner.  I just figure that there are lots of bigger moves...]
;B[lk]SQ[oh][oi][oj][ok][iq][lq]C[Degan:  This looks to me like strength from which I can approach the center.  I'm trying to use M9 to perhaps connect the two groups.

CH: This M9 is a huge move. As the saying goes "play urgent moves before big moves" and S12
        or S14  is urgent, but, then again, not too urgent since both groups will live if W separates them
        (see my variation).
        So I can't decide which one, M9 or S12 / S14 is better. Allthough I can't tell for sure the status
        of the bottom group, I might have played M9 myself with the same reasoning.]

(;W[ko]SQ[iq][lq]C[Degan:  But of course white sees this too.  And I do not see that this threatens connection between J3 and M3

CH:  Yes you must react immediately. I think W could have killed. But since he failed to do
         so, your M12 brought you a winning position.];B[lh]
;W[kq];B[kr];W[jq];B[jr]
(;W[ip]C[CH:  W should play at H2 to prevent the formation of eyes, then make sure
         you can't escape.];B[hq];W[gr];B[hr];W[hp]
(;B[is]C[Degan: Maybe I didn't need to do this? Variation.

CH:  J1 must be played at some point, so it's best to play it now. In your variation, Black dies (see my additions).]
;W[gs];B[hs];W[mr];B[lr];W[mp];B[fp]C[Degan:  I was figuring that this peek gives me sente and helps to solidify my structure in the corner.
CH: good move.];W[gp]
(;B[co]C[CH:  Not here, at B4. See my variations. They all drive a spike into W's territory or capture C4.]
;W[do];B[dp];W[bo]
(;B[jg]C[CH:  Because F16 is sente for W, I'd prefer F15, which may end up sente for Black.
         Keep pushing into W's moyo from all sides.];W[mg];B[mh]
;W[fd]C[CH:  Now W makes some territory that could have been yours.]
;B[fc];W[ed];B[dd];W[mc];B[lb];W[ld];B[ik]C[CH: huge move !]
;W[en]
(;B[bp]C[CH:   Play this at C3, where it's sente (variation). This way, you ended in gote.]
;W[cn];B[cq];W[fq];B[er];W[fo];B[ep]C[CH:  too small: just 5 points in gote.]
;W[fm];B[lm];W[ln];B[nl];W[om];B[mm]C[CH:  109, 111, 113 are good.]
;W[mn];B[mq]C[CH:  Not sente, and therefore too small at this stage. Look at White's response: He makes lots of safe territory
with one move. Playing around G10 / F10 yourself would have been big.]
;W[fj];B[im]TR[gg][gi]C[CH:  Again, G11 seems larger to me since it has G13 as a follow up move, while this J7 threatens only G8.]
;W[hi];B[ii]C[Degan: I counted around now, and felt like we were fairly close, and hoped I could find a couple moves to reduce white's territory.  Still I've gone over the rest several times and don't see where I could do any better.

CH:  Black moves 119 ... 123 are good, then you slow down. See later comments.]
;W[hg]TR[fg][gg][fh][gh][ei][fi][ej][dk][ek][dl][el]C[CH:  With just a few moves, W has made the triangled territory, which otherwise could have become neutral.
An equivalent amount of territory, which now is neutral, could have become black.]
;B[gl];W[fl];B[ai];W[bj];B[bi];W[ci];B[bg];W[qf]C[CH:  White helps Black to consolidate. Huge error. Instead, he should cut the groups apart.
        Starting at S14, see my earlier variation.];B[rf];W[de]

;B[lg];W[ng]
(;B[nh]C[CH: Again too small: saves only one point of Black territory in reverse sente.
How about H10 or T7, or both, instead ?  See variations.];W[sl]
;B[sk];W[sm];B[rj]C[CH:  not necessary.];W[lp];B[nr]C[CH: Good. Makes territory in sente.]
;W[or];B[ms];W[op]
(;B[jn]TR[aj][hj]C[CH:  Bad move, allowing White to answer in sente, as he did, making endgame points at your
         expense. If you want to play in this area, play at L7 because it's W's keypoint.  
        However, first choices are H10 and A10. Both are absolutely sente, so their 
        size doesn't matter much. A10 should be played second because, if ignored,
        it brings only Ko (see variation). 
            Even Q19, allthough possibly gote, is better than this K6, since it eliminates W's chance 
       of playing R19 in sente.];W[km];B[mk];W[kn];B[kl];W[jm]
;B[jl];W[hj];B[ij];W[hk];B[hl];W[ih];B[jh];W[in]C[CH:  with 154 ... 166 W has about equalized. Go back to 153, play H10 there instead, then count and
         compare the result with the present position.];B[hn]
;W[io];B[gk];W[fk];B[gj];W[gi];B[gd];W[ge];B[hd];W[if];B[jf]
;W[os];B[ns]C[CH: Too small, just 1 point in gote. You don't need the eye.
Still, A10 can be played in sente. Then play Q19, it's big.]
