AB[pd][dp]C[BittenFIN: This was a close game where I unintentionally got a lot of terri

tory and I noticed it near the end of the game. I made a lot of mistakes and e

arly game didn't look too good to me.];W[dd];B[pp];W[md];B[me]
;W[ne];B[mf];W[nf]C[BittenFIN: I wanted that top right corner, so I started to go down on there

. My intentions were crushed. I'm not sure, which would have been the best app

oach at that time.
------------------
You're spreading yourself too thin at this point, and are very vulnerable to b

eing cut in two.  I recommend moving along the top with a move like k16 instea

d.  It's very unlikely you'll surround a stone like Q16.];B[ld]

(;W[lc]C[This move is too dangerous, play at n17 instead.  It'll give your stones 
more strength on the right side, and there's plenty of opportunities if you do
 that, such as surrounding his group.];B[nd];W[mc]C[BittenFIN: I made an empty triangle, so it was a bad move, right?
----------
In this situation, it's a fine move.];B[od]
(;W[mg]C[I recommend attacking from the top instead, such as through L16.  Your 
group on the right is very weak, while on the top you have strong support from
 D16.  This is a good time to secure the top side.];B[ke];W[ie]
TR[lc][mc][md]C[Very agressive, I wouldn't do this with your m17 stones being so weak. 
 I recommend playing up at j17 instead.];B[jd];W[id];B[je];W[jc]
;B[kc]
(;W[jb]C[BittenFIN: I wanted to surround those black stones, maybe I shoud hav
e done
 something else, cause that M17 group of mine isn't in a very good place... Or

 maybe I should have tried to connect it with the K18 group?
-------------
You could have connected them at L18, but that would've started a KO fight.  Y
ou would be able to win it, however, because black has no good threats against
 you.  Your n16 group is too weak to survive on its own, you're sacrificing it
 right now, though you've still made some good territory.];B[kb]
;W[la];B[lb];W[mb];B[ka];W[ma];B[nc]C[Very good!  I didn't see that at all, you're in a prime position now!]
;W[lf];B[le]
(;W[kf]C[No!  You're letting him get away!  See the variation.

Learn to prefer moves like k14 over L14, the net is always better than a ladde
r];B[nb];W[qf]C[BittenFIN: I couldn't get that corner, so I tried to close it.
------
This is an alright move, because it's building territory on the right, and sup
porting your stones in the center.];B[pf];W[pg];B[qe];W[of]

CR[ib]SQ[ia][ja][ka][jb][kb][jc][kc][id][jd]C[As I'm sure you'll see, you're still not secure from j18.  This sha
pe is common in games, learn to know instantly what to do.]

;B[fa];W[ea]C[BittenFIN: I didn't like this start... Black had pretty much territ
ory in t
hat corner, I thought I would propably lose, the opponent seemed to better tha

n me.
---------
Your opponent did really get the best of you, but you've got a chance still be
cause that huge wall that's been build along the top can work to your advantag
e.  This is where you make risky moves to try and get big chunks of territory,
 it's your only way to win.];B[mb];W[ga]C[This move should be saved for later in the game, the entire bottom 
half of the board is waiting for some action, and is worth many more points.]
;B[ia];W[fa];B[ce]
(;W[bg]C[BittenFIN: I wanted to have influence in that top left corner and
 in the le
ft side.
-------
Your stone is too low, play it one above.  You've got the right idea here.]

;B[gd];W[he];B[gh]C[BittenFIN: A big mistake from the opponent. I still had hope ^^

-------
Your opponent was playing way too aggressive there, see how useful that big wa
ll you had on the top was?  You had him trapped from the start!]
;W[gg];B[hh];W[ih];B[gi];W[gj];B[fi]
(;W[fj]C[Go to the right instead, he's already trapped on the left sid
e.];B[hj];W[hk];B[gl];W[ij];B[ii];W[hi]C[BittenFIN: I got those stones too o/]
;B[ik];W[ji];B[hl];W[gn]SQ[cn][qn][fq][nq]C[BittenFIN: I wanted some influence in the bottom.
----------
This isn't a good place to start though!  Your stone is in the middle of nowhe
re, with no support.  Try moving along the sides instead.];B[fk]

;W[bk];B[cl];W[cm];B[ci];W[bl]C[BittenFIN: I noticed that my opponent wasn't as good as I fir
st thought.];B[bj];W[aj];B[bi];W[ai]C[BittenFIN: I tried to kill those stones.]
;B[ah];W[ae];B[be];W[ad];B[ac];W[bc];B[cc]
(;W[ab]C[You missed your opportunity to connect at c18];B[cb]
;W[db];B[ca];W[da];B[jk];W[af]C[BittenFIN: I thought I had them, but...]
;B[ak];W[aj];B[ai];W[al];B[bd];W[ac];B[bb]C[BittenFIN: And so the black lives...]
;W[in]C[BittenFIN: More influence in the bottom! I read that straig
ht lines are goo
d in Sensei's library, so I went straight to right.
-------
Straight lines are good, but in this situation you're being very unproductive.
  You see how hight up those three stones are?  Black can go right under you, 
securing the bottom half without a fight.  Additionally, there's too much free
 space around you to be moving one space at a time.  Your stones are stronger 
as they are, but they're limited in range.];B[fm];W[fn];B[em]
;W[en];B[dn];W[dm];B[il];W[jn];B[kn];W[ko];B[km];W[lo];B[jm]
;W[mo];B[no];W[np];B[nn];W[nq]C[BittenFIN: And then down so I could have the bottom left co
rner.];B[oq];W[nr];B[or];W[ns];B[os];W[kl]C[BittenFIN: And then I tried to kill that E7 group.]

C[BittenFIN: I tried to prevent that M12 group from making ey
es by taking awa
y potential liberty. Or something like that... I'm not too familiar with the g

o terms.
-----------
Your move is good, but for other reasons.  Black's stones are pretty safe righ
t now, they're ocnnected to the bottom, though very losely.  What makes your m
ove so great isn't that it pushes on black (that's an added bonus), but that y
ou're building territory on the right side.];B[oj];W[nk];B[pj]
;W[nj];B[mi];W[mn];B[mm];W[lm]C[BittenFIN: I had noticed a bit sooner that I would propably
 win and the opp
onent would give up and now the opponent noticed the same thing and he gave up

.
I think it was a pretty close game. And I think I could have played a lot bett

er and made better choices. I'm not so happy about my group shapes and my skil

ls of eating opponent's groups. The opening has been always pretty confusing t

o me and my opponents seem to always take control of the corners and sides.
---------------
My overall advice to you is to focus on two things: the big picture, and the s
ides of the board.  You need to look all over the board and look for potential
 places to play.  Also, too many times you played either too far or two close 
to the edges of the board.  The edges and the corners are where the easy terri
tory is at, so learn how to surround them better, and make them a priority.  

You proved yourself to be very good at fighting in this game, even in the begi
nning you played well, but a few mistakes held you back.  Go is about more tha
n fighting, however.  You have to learn how to turn empty space into territory
 as well.

Good luck, and I hope this review was useful.  Feel free to email me any quest
