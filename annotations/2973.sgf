C[(This game was a little quicker than suggested, but going back through it I still didn't know why I lost.)

I'm playing black as texaspete2, and this game was pretty different from my normal style of game. Usually I try to play solidly, which allows me to aggresively attack my opponents weaknesses. But in this game we both played solidly and I never saw a point to attack. I think I slowly drifted behind, losing by 15.5, and I'm not quite sure what made me lose. Was I behind in the fuseki? Or was it poor middlegame play where I slipped behind?

rika:
hi, I'm Chun-Kit from Germany, 2k local and 3k* IGS. 
The game you presented to me is that kind of game where you missed some big points.
There are some variations (not that many I have found) I have inserted. I hope it does explain without any words.]

C[Is this joseki finished, or should I have extended to A or so? My thinking was that the lower left corner was solid for both players, so I would make the lower right corner solid also. Also, if b played elsewhere, w could invade the lowerright , and the influence b would get would be neutralized by the solid w position at k4.

rika:
the left side is settled, no need to add a stone for now. Playing the shimari is absolutely ok.]

too early. with a loose invasion on the right side, I always play the var.
There is a different story, if white's upper right stone is on 3-4.]
;W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[qg]TR[df]C[rika:
joseki is wC10, because the marked stone is on the 4th line]

(;B[nd];W[ci]C[rika:
white's last stone is too close (should be at C10 according to joseki)]

(;B[qe]C[Here I wasn't quite sure what to do, since w had no weaknesses. Is taking profit the right thing to do in this situation? Is there a better place to move?

rika:
see var for possible continuation];W[cl]
(;B[og]LB[ql:A]C[My plan with this was to play j15 or so next to expand the territory on the top. Would squeezing at A be more appropriate?

rika:
yes: the upper right side is strong, so extending from the strong side is almost overconcentrated. A is nice]
;W[qm]
(;B[ie]C[rika:
if you want to create a moyo, this is not the right place (should somewhere closer to the left like F15)]
;W[mq];B[oo];W[kg];B[kd]TR[ie][og]C[I thought I should play solidly here, since b can't afford a deep w invasion.

rika:
it's ok for now (white is just reducing, imagine the line between the two marked stones)]
;W[em]C[Perhaps I should have played around here earlier, so I wouldn't get enclosed?

after wC11 you could have played C9];B[ig]C[rika:

(;B[oj]C[My plan was to attack w on the side, and then use that influence to chase L13 down and neutralize the w influence at the bottom. Is this the right idea, or is it too late?

rika:
sound reasonable, your problem is, white's side isn't vulnerable for being attacked]

but he answered, so good for you];B[oh];W[ki];B[jh];W[mi]
(;B[ol];W[pk];B[ml];W[kk];B[ij];W[mk]C[I was thinking of playing here (n9) instead of j10, because this square is an important shape point for both sides. But then w escapes easily?

rika:
you're problem is white has friends to the lower and to the left side where he is safe]
;B[ok];W[ll];B[mm];W[lm];B[il];W[in]C[Does w have a won game by this point? Or does my yose make me lose more points?

rika:
very difficult to judge. you're only big territory is the top (some on the lower left), while white has the bottom and the left side (some on the right side).
It looks like the game will depend who makes the best in the "dame area" around the center left]

I don't like it. There are several sente moves, which are more worth than playing B18 first (see var)]
