C[Ciao Antoine!

I hope this review will help you with your Go
For any question you can find me on KGS as Wiles :)];B[pe];W[dd]

;B[pf];W[qn]C[O17 or P16 are the usual moves to finish the joseki
you can also tenuki, but must be prepared to be sealed in by  B-P17

In this kind of fuseki however, where your opponent is clearly playing for influence, playing solid moves such as O17 is usually a simple and good strategy]
;B[qm];W[qo];B[pm]
(;W[jd]C[I still think that O17 was the proper move, eliminating any bad aji]

Perhaps it was better to invade at f17 to use the black thickness on the right]

(;W[ce]C[C14 is correct shape
It is not only better eye shape, but also from the yose point of view since Black can't play A15 in sente]
;B[nb]
(;W[qb];B[kc]C[This is a big mistake by black
The left side is more important than the top];W[cm]C[After this move the game seems promising for White]
;B[fi];W[fk]C[Good, F11 seems a little too deep
It would be uninteresting and passive to defend territory at E12]
;B[ff]
(;W[ee]C[This seems a little passive instead
Black can't really cut at E16at the moment, since he is very weak now]

(;W[ig]C[Huge mistake, after this the game is over

You played a better fuseki, but made some mistakes in the middle game fighting
Too many times you seems to forget about some of your groups which get endangered
(the top right corner, the left group and finally this last mistake)
This final one was a big mistake, but you could have lost this game even earlier, since black missed the way to kill your groups.

You have to be focused through all the game.
A better opening does not assure a win, since in go there is a lot of space to make mistakes

This is the last comment

I hope to see you again in some Italian tournaments :)
