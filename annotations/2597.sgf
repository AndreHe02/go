C[Hi, I'm Sascha Pawlowski, about 15 kyu in Germany. 

In the beginning, it takes a while to get a feeling for the game.

It's a good idea to start on a small board first.

19x19 is very strategic, and it's impossible to play strategically unless one knows the tactical implications, which are more easily learned on a small board.

 When you're feeling comfortable on 9x9, you can switch to 13x13 and then to 19x19.]
;W[cn]C[In Go, it is said that the corners are worth gold, the borders silver and the center is grass. This is because making territory is most efficient in the corners and then on the borders.

So usually, players will try to take the corners first and expand on the borders and in the center.

This opening move is a little odd because it's quite outside the corner and invites d4 by black.]

(;B[dl]C[Here, a good approach would have been to play at one of the corners. This move only helps white strengthen his influence in the lower left corner.]

(;W[en]C[This is not very good shape, since black could take d4 and make this formation look very thin]

(;B[fn]C[Attaching to an opponent's stone has to be carefully considered.

At this point, it's one of your opponent's stones versus one of your's, and the opponent has the initiative, so he can put you under pressure.]

(;W[eo];B[fp]C[This is not a very good connection, white could easily separate these stones.]

(;W[em]C[This move is very slow. It separetes the black stones, but since both borders are open to them, they don't mind being disconnected. It would have been preferable to keep black from intruding the corner.]

(;B[fl]C[It's not necessary to connect these groups, it would have been more profitable to extend along the border.]
;W[bl]C[Again, securing the corner would have been preferable.]
