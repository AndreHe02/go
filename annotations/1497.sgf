Dear Reviewer:

This
was a somewhat strange game where I ended up with all the edge
territory, but my opponent made enough in the center to win.  I
normally play an influence and moyo-oriented game, but my opponent
seemed determined to give me territory and take influence himself.  By
the time I realized how big his center was getting, it was too late to
do much, and he won by 10 points.  Please tell me where I went wrong,
and how I could have handled his center territory, because even a
modest reduction of it would have won the game for me.];B[pe]
C[Alex
Thanks for submitting this game for review.

Summary:
W steadfastly builds a central moyo with no concern for corners or side.
B builds solid territory in the corners and sides

At move 81 W seals her 100+ point moyo (and the game) without B making a single attempt to invade.

Perhaps
the most surprising aspect of the game is that even though B doesn't
invade the W moyo, the score is still  fairly close. Remember though
that if this were an even game W+16....which is not so close.

Pointers
1.
Study how and when to invade moyos, and correspondingly what to do if
you are the moyo builder. Takemiya games are one source as he famously
bases his games on outside influence, forcing his opponent to invade.
These will give a sense of where and when invasions occur and the
balance of what is to be expected as a consequence.
It is hard but your game could improve a lot.
2. Direction of Play
Some moves were definitely in the wrong direction (eg right side early on).
and W largely colluded in this.
One
constantly needs a sense of where the big points are. Avoid colluding
with your opponent, and play where YOU think is big. It will generally
lead to more interesting games if you tenuki and try to "prove" your
point is bigger....even if you don't win you will have a clearer idea
why you lost!
Try "The Direction of Play" by Kajiwara.

Hope this helps

3k*];W[dp];B[pq];W[od]C[X: Fourth move of the game, and he's already
playing strangely.  Even though I want a wall, I don't want to block at
P15, because I'd be giving him fourth-line territory.];B[pd]
C[X: Instead, I decide to take fourth line territory myself and let him have a wall.

G correct];W[oc];B[pc];W[oe]
(;B[ec]C[X:
I would have liked to play at e.g. K17 to counter the influence of his
wall, but they say to play in an open corner before taking a big point
along the side, so I decided to go for a 5-3 point to counter his
influence from a distance.


G: Wrong direction. W hanes now]
(;W[jd]LB[gd:a][pg:b][of:c]C[X: Normally one extends from a wall along the third line, not the fourth, right?

Loks unnatural, slow
a looks more natural. expansive

B
should play b,c in response];B[jc]C[X: Since he decided to extend on
the fourth line, I figured this might be a good way to punish.  It was
kind of an experiment, though, and in retrospect, it may have been the
game losing move (although it's kind of hard to call a move this early
in the game "the game losing move").

G: This is not game losing move]
(;W[id]LB[pf:a]C[X:
I was expecting hane, but he decides to continue with his
thickness-oriented strategy... but I THOUGHT I was doing well, because
it looks overconcentrated to me.

G: Ws position is very....squat.
will look much better if she plays a though];B[ic];W[hc]
(;B[hb]C[G playing this way is submissive, gives W too much influence and B nothing in return

P
2nd line is line of defeat];W[gc];B[gb]C[X: It turns out that the
choice of 5-3 was fortuitous; that stone is in a good place.]
;W[ob];B[pb]LB[of:a][pf:b][fc:c]C[X:
Right now the game looks good for Black, I'd say.  White's pretty
powerful in the center, but E17 still has a way in, and Black already
has a good deal of territory.

a,b still biggest
c also

Question of whether W can utilise her influence.
shouldn't be able to!];W[pf]C[G: YES!];B[qf];W[qg];B[pg];W[of]
;B[rg];W[qh];B[rf];W[ph];B[cd]LB[pm:a][qm:b][kc:c]C[X:
In retrospect, making a shimari in the bottom right would probably have
been better, since it would counter his thickness on the right side
somewhat.

G: Wrong dirn
abc limit Ws moyo];W[kc]LB[po:a]C[ok but slow
a is better, expands moyo while attacking B];B[hd];W[kb];B[gd]
;W[op]LB[po:a]C[X:
Another unexpected shoulder hit in the corner, again forcing me to take
fourth line territory (which would make me happy ordinarily) in return
for even more central influence.  Already I was starting to get a bit
worried.


G: W should a];B[pp]C[G corrrect];W[oo];B[nr]C[X:
Rather than continuing to push, I decided to slide so he wouldn't get
influence on the bottom side.  I realize that this lets him make
territory on the right though.  Should I have played R6 instead?



G: r6/q6 is better .Bottom is fairly virgin territory easy to form a group there]
;W[po]C[correct
Now W has big moyo
game is still equal];B[qo]C[ n];W[qn];B[ro];W[pm]LB[rn:a][jp:b]
[dj:c]C[G:?? no serious cutting point here

a better localy

[ke:d][qk:e]C[X: Happy to end in sente
(G bet you were!)

and get to extend in front of my shimari in the top left.  Normally this
is the ideal extension from a keima shimari, but maybe I should have
gone one or two lines further because of the triangled stones?  Or
maybe even have just played a kakari at C6?

G This move is fine
I think a-e are all viable....but its all a question of style. Basically limitting W moyo is very important
Imagine W gets abc ?

If B c6 W d9/10 looks too good];W[gq]LB[jj:a][hj:b][eh:c]C[G abc better for W i think tho shimari is fair size]
;B[cn]C[X: I'd still say the game looks good for me.

G: Big move B moyo is biggish now];W[en];B[dl];W[fl]LB[gi:a]
[gj:b][jj:c][kp:d][jp:e][lj:f]C[X:
I think it was at around this point that I started to worry.  I was
happy with my massive moyo on the left and the fairly large corners at
the top and bottom right... but all of a sudden, his center was
starting to look big.

G B has fair amout of settled territory , but its now urgent that B invades or   aggressively reduces W moyo

a-f look good starting points, there is plenty of room for eyes for B

Note a,b expand B moyo also

Sometimes it is a good strategy to leave moyo invasion til the last moment.
Here W is virtually forced to kill a deep invasion to have any chance of winning...
B can just spend the rest of the game surviving his invasion group and that should secure victory.


However
this type of stategy is different from "suddenly my opponents moyo
looks too big". W has been building this moyo for 10-15 moves!]

(;B[bp]C[X: Maybe I should have forgone this slide and played F10.]
;W[ei]
(;B[di]C[X:
Still allowing myself to be lured in by the temptation of fourth line
territory... E10 didn't look good to me, though.];W[eh];B[fk]
C[X: Realizing now that I have to do something about the center, I decide to try to slip in this way.]
;W[gk];B[fj];W[gj];B[fi];W[gi];B[fh];W[gg]C[X:
But rather than saving his two stones and letting me into the center,
as I expected, he sacrifices them, making my left side even huger, but
now the center is basically secure.];B[gh];W[hh];B[kq]LB[hi:a]
[hg:b][gl:c]C[X:
Time to do something, but my only way in is from the bottom.  It's
probably already too late


G Hmmm
B last moves have solified W central moyo wonderfuly and have made an invasion much harder.
