C[My opponent was much stronger than he claimed to be, yet in spite of my lousy opening, somehow I managed to keep the final score close.

I have trouble finding moves with a purpose -- or at least the right purpose. I've added comments to try and let you know what I was thinking during the game.

I'd like to know not only where I could improve my game, but also if you could point out a few things I'm doing right

Thanks for doing this review!];B[pd]C[DC: Hello, my name is Dylan Carter]
;W[pq]C[DC: This play ignores blacks first play as far as direction is concerned, black can capitolise on the mistake. Var. Taken from 'The Direction of Play' by Takeo Kajiwara pg. 59. R4 or Q4 is correct direction.]

(;B[dd];W[dp];B[po]TR[pd]C[DC: Black is fully utilising the Hoshi stone.]
;W[np];B[qq]
(;W[pp]C[DC: Butting up agaist the stone is bad. You allow black to settle his shape quickly.]
;B[qp];W[cj]C[DC: Tenuki is bad, black makes the shape move.]
;B[pr];W[or]C[DC: Black is attacking your shape here by hane at the head of two stones, due the the butting mistake earlier.]
;B[qr]
(;W[nr]C[DC: To small, losing a stone at P2 is nothing to you at this stage.]
;B[jd]C[humm... suddenly I'm down on territory. what to do?

DC: The mistake a few moves back caused the loss in tempo, the last move was just small (see vars.)]
;W[qf]C[how about this? aiming to expand down the side

but didn't consider that with Black's strength across the top, r14 was no real threat...]
;B[qh]C[oops, now I'm really in trouble -- black easily now has two sides.

DC: This is the only move for Black. 

You did well to keep the margin small, the fuseki problems that occured should be your main focus to improve upon from this game.

Have one more look at the vars from move 8 and 14 to see how you can create a better game for yourself just playing directionally in the fuseki.

Black capitolised on your mistakes and played calmly knowing the game direction favoured him/her.

End of Comments.];W[of]C[try to escape...

DC: From now onwards black only needs to 'play the game out'.
