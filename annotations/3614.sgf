C[Kamtre [21k?\]: hey
Bokonon [20k\]: hi
Hi reveiwer, comment on anything either of us should've done differently, and that would be great..
I'm only gonna comment on black (me) because i don't know what the other guy could've done better, really..

Matt: 
 Hi, 
I have marked my comments with Matt: so you can easily find them. 
I have commented up around move 100. It is hard to comment past there because White is so far ahead. If you submit a more even game it will be easier to comment towards the end. 
Nevertheless I hope you find the review helpful. The main thing to take away from it is that in the opening you should play mainly on the third or fourth line.
 You should also make sure you are aware of the status of your groups and how they can get two eyes. See the cut at S9 and connection at B11. 


 Good luck with your Go.

 Matt];B[qp];W[dd];B[cp];W[qd];B[rf]LB[oc:A][od:B][qd:1]C[Matt:
  In the opening it is normal to play on the third and fourth lines As these strike the best balance between influence and territory. To play on the second line so early without good reason is playing too low. 
 An approach move against a komoku stone (eg. 1) is usually placed so as to prevent a white shimari there. So normal is to play at A or B. 
 With your move white has a number of options he can either press it down exploiting its low position or play solidly knowing that it won't be making much territory sat on the second line as it is.]
;W[qh]
(;B[rh]C[Matt:
Again 2nd line. Best to keep white sepetated then he has to look after two groups not just one.]

(;B[pf]C[Matt:
 This is very slow see variation.];W[oc];B[pd];W[pc]
(;B[rj]LB[nd:A][ne:B]C[I think this was good, was it?

Matt:
 Given the situation you need to escape with your group so that it can get space for eyes. You can play where you did or at A or B. Both of which are a little tricky to read A appears to be a mistake and B will give white a power full wall.

So you could say S10 was good but it is a move that you don't want to have to play. in the upper right your moves have made the white territory in the corner more secure and given him strong influence facing the left.  See variatio.]

(;W[qj]
(;B[ql]C[and this?

Matt:
 This is not so good. White has S9 and black is not connected out. See variation.]

(;W[dn]
(;B[bm]C[Matt:
 Again you play on the second line. White has made an unconventional approach move locally I would answer at E4 'punishing' white for not preventing the shimari.]
;W[dj];B[dl];W[ep];B[eq]C[how were these for openings?

Matt: 
 see other comments. 
The main thing to note so far is to keep play to the third and fourth lines unless there is special reason not to.]

I would play D. This may take care of whites threat at S9 and break up his chance for a moyo in the centre. E is also big but then S9 is still a worry.]

would A have been better?

 This move serves it's purpose of breaking up white at the bottom but white has more potential at the top so J17 or P12 would be better.]

 The sequence you play here lets white secure his moyo while gaining nothing for you.]

 See previous comment - White is happy to be allowed to play O16.]
;W[nd];B[se];W[sd];B[sf];W[ol]C[he started containing..];B[pn]
C[was this good?

Matt: It is playable assuming as you can now make an eye in the corner to save S14 group if needs be (see variations). but first you need to stop white from making massive territory at the top.]
