I'm not particularly proud of this game. I quit playing for several months, and this is my first attempt at restarting. I feel that I should've been able to take a greater advantage from my opponent's strange opening.

Thanks in advance for the review.

Hi, I'm Terence, I'll put T: before my comments. If you have any questions just e-mail me!]
;B[jd]C[My opponent's rank was [14k?\] which I assume means that she listed it herself. I'm nowhere near 14k and while novel openings are interesting, this didn't seem to make any sense.

I procede to take corners in the most aggressive way possible after this.

T: dont get what black is doing at all, random play. Just playing for the corners as you did is the easiest response]
;W[pp];B[fo];W[dp];B[qn];W[nq];B[no];W[pd]C[Mistake not to finish the enclosure on the lower right?

T: no, black is too weak to attack it];B[cc]C[This corner was never really developed by B. I really like this enclosure (which includes either E16 or D15) but nothing ever happened until my approach.

T: black is secure here, he wont do anything unless you do]
;W[cn];B[dm];W[qf];B[li]C[Dangling stone? Or another attempt for central influence? I'm not really sure.

T: have no idea!!];W[ci]C[Invasion to prevent too much B territory in the upper left. Too far of a jump? I was probably feeling a little more confident than I should have.

T: this is fine, there is lots of room to play in and you have loads of options]

(;W[qi]C[I was more interested in seeing how B would respond since the corner isn't effectively secured.]
;B[iq];W[fq]C[T: this is a good move];B[gq];W[fp]C[I'm not sure why, but this type of development seems to happen often in my games. Is this something I need to avoid? It worked in this case, but I've seen my corners break down in the worst kind of way in the past.

T: this looks fine to me so far];B[cj];W[bj];B[dk]
(;W[pk];B[gp]C[T: now you are enclosed and B is almost connected]
;W[eo]
(;B[ho];W[fn]C[I feel that this central area should've been much more difficult to invade. When could I have established influence earlier?

T: G4 was the important move, but this is good too. Black made two mistakes, and you capitalised on one of them]
;B[go];W[em];B[fm];W[gm];B[fl];W[gn];B[dn];W[en];B[el];W[jm]
C[I felt that I could use this stone to cause some trouble for B later. Is this an example of 'bad aji'?]
;B[bg];W[qo];B[po]
(;W[pn];B[oo];W[rn];B[qm];W[rp];B[om]C[T: I dont like the move Q6. I is allowing a weak black group to make perfect eye shape. It is best to prevent this kind of shape if at all possible. see variation at move 47]
;W[oc]C[While this move went ahead and secured the corner, I know there are still larger moves available. But B started the "small move" thing! :)]

(;W[mp];B[jr]C[Could I have killed this group? Perhaps. This time, I was willing to trade the smaller territory for the central influence.

T: the G4 group is the one that should have died];W[ln];B[rm]
;W[sn];B[sm];W[ij]C[Was this extension/invasion to deep?

T: No, not at all. Black is very weak in lots of places and D8 is now in danger, aswel as M11]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[ai];W[ak];B[ah]
(;W[jc];B[cm]C[I'm sure I should've prevented this.

T: yep, C7 was important];W[bm];B[co];W[bn];B[do];W[bp];B[bl]
;W[bk];B[lp];W[lo]C[I debated between this and L4. I think it was a coin-toss that ultimately decided it. Opinions as to one or the other?

T: the stone is dead either way];B[kp];W[jp];B[mo];W[mq];B[jo]
;W[jn];B[ko];W[io];B[ip];W[kn];B[in];W[im];B[jo]
(;W[gl];B[di]C[T: now there is little chance of killing the D9 group, again you shoul have pushed through his wall, cutting his stones.]
;W[gj];B[dh];W[bo];B[aj];W[al];B[cp];W[cq];B[bq];W[dq]C[I feel like this corner was weaker than it ended up being. Failure on B's part to destroy my territory?

T: no, he should not have got as far as he did];B[sp]C[I could've stopped this much sooner, but I was a little insulted that B would try and get me with the snapback. Not really. I was playing quickly (way too much coffee) at this point, and I almost fell for it.]
