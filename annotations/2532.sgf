C[mshadow [14k\]: hi
Acey [?\]: Heya~

I am neoKupo, who is the world famous 5k!   Hope you enjoy the review, though some introduction would have been nice.  Hope you learn from my comments.  I tried to remember to mark all of my comments by "nK", though I may have forgotten some times.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[cj];B[mc]C[This move puts you in an awkward position if w plays k4, because a play at the center of the board is extremely important, and w only looks good taking it.]
;W[jp]C[OK.];B[nq]TR[fc][fd][jj]C[The center of the board is begging to be played.  This extension doesn't truly do much, and would be better at the triangles.   Black still can play the tengen semi-effectively, though not as much as if n17 was at k17.]
;W[jq]TR[jj]C[This is slow.  Should have been at tengen.];B[pn]
TR[qm]C[This move doesn't seem to be needed, though it does develop.  proper development here would be the triangle.]
;W[gc]TR[mc]C[It may be good to note that the oogeima leaves the 3-3 point open to play.]
;B[pg]C[The advantage of Q6 at r7 shows its head.  Black's territory is wide open to invasion now.  See the variation.]

(;W[cm];B[cf];W[dg];B[cd];W[cc]
(;B[bd]C[Wrong.  See the variation.]
(;W[bg]TR[bd]C[Ace: Should I have played at D15 instead? He played there next move and now that I look over the match, it's a pretty cute move.


nk: See the variation.];B[de]
(;W[df]TR[cg]C[Ace: Oh.. that was a bad move, wasn't it... I can't see one that's much better... maybe F15? E15 seems bad, he'd just put me in atari forcing a response at D17, then he could play at E14 to gain himself good shape and influence...

NK: see the variation.  this move does nothing, it in fact makes the cut at the triangle more dangerous.]

(;B[ed]C[nk: this lets w get the top corner, while not getting sealed in.  see the variations.]
;W[dc];B[fe];W[ge];B[fg]TR[ec]C[Ace: This move was painful.

nk:  well, it shouldn't be.  this move, while b breaks out, is just what you get if your goal was to kill.  the triangle is a very important spot for both players now, since b can separate the two white groups.]
;W[bf]C[Ace: That was small, wasn't it? I should've played at maybe K17 or E17, right? I really don't like his stone at F13...


nk:  E17 was just about it...  k17 still lets the groups be cut apart.  even if w can live in the corner, there are many heavy reductions available later.]
;B[bc]C[nk: e17 is still open!  this is a good thing, letting w off easy.]
;W[bb]C[Ace: I think I should've gave him the corner and gone for gaining my own eye space at E17. Am I too aggressive?

nk:  this isn't aggresive, it is just foolish.  even as derogatory as it is, when someone plays a move like this against me, i consider them my "sente bitch", because they just responded to my move that didn't need to be responded to, and a money move is still wide open.  e17 is the only move now for both sides.]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[ac]C[doesn't do anything...w can't make any thing of this.]
;B[db]C[This was the importance of e17.];W[da];B[ea]C[Ace: I don't see why he played there. Looks to me like he should've just taken the 3 stones and played at F19 had I decided to attempt to crawl out.

nk:  crawling out would have been useless.  w was already dead.]
;W[cb];B[ca]
(;W[gb]C[let's look at priorities here.  playing this move allows black to cramp you, while you get bad shape.]
;B[jc]TR[gb]C[Ace: Ah, this move angered me, I saw it coming a mile away, but you don't always think about what you see, eh?

nk:  yes. i know what you are talking about.  see the variation if these two stones were traded.]
;W[ic]C[Ace: Didn't know what to do here, so simply played here. would K16 be better? He'd respond at J16, wouldn't he... and then I'd be in a mess. K15 would be better, wouldn't it?

nk:  this isn't all that bad.];B[jd];W[jb];B[kb];W[he]TR[fg]
C[Ace: Slightly lost so I assumed going for decent shape would be better than nothing and remembered reading about this shape... table shape, is it not?

nk:  hell if i know.  seems a good move, though.  since 2 eyes is impossible, finding  a stable shape to run out with is good.   If I were playing, I would let white live very small, and take away the tremendous influence of white's center.  the marked stone already takes away some of tengen's power.]
;B[ib];W[hb];B[ja];W[gg]C[ok.];B[id];W[hd]C[should have ignored it.  the eye was gone, and you weren't cuttable.]
;B[cq]C[wow.  this is really bad timing.  w can build something tremendous here.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er]
(;W[bq]C[nk: nonono...seal him in the corner!  see the variation]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[cr]C[nk: horrible.h3 much better.];W[gp];B[fp]
;W[fo];B[gq];W[hq]C[yuck.  connecting at g5 would have been much better, and removing the aji.]
;B[hp];W[go];B[hr];W[iq]C[hey, it turned out all right!];B[gr]
;W[ir]TR[jr][kr]C[this move doesn't accomplish anything.  are you after the points marked by the triangles??  that's about all you can get here.  you have incredible influence, you should be going for the center.]
;B[br];W[ar]TR[bp]C[should have been ignored, or blocked at the triangle..  the cut is open...]
;B[bp];W[ap];B[aq]C[WRONG.  this ko is great for black, but horrible for you.  the b group is alive, you aren't accomplishing anything by such a risky ko.]
;W[ao]C[...what? not about the ko?]
(;B[as]C[Ace: At first I was wondering why he didn't crawl along the edge playing at B5 and expecting a response at B6, does that have any thing to do with the fact that it would eventually connect with the broken bamboo joint at B13?

no. see the variations.];W[bo];B[bq];W[mp]TR[fh]C[this move isn't all that bad....it would be better to play the triangle move, then tengen.  the top right corner is also profitable.]
;B[np]
(;W[mq]TR[kq][lq][jr][kr][lr]C[Ace: After I made this move, I thought it would have been better to go at N5, where he played next, considering if there was any hope in winning, it would have been to grab influence in the middle, I'm not misled in my thinking, am I ?

nk: not at all.  but, this move was tenukiable. see variation.  also, look at the triangles for how many poitns you just got.  not a lot.]
;B[mo];W[lo];B[mn];W[lm]C[solid is better..];B[ln];W[kn];B[lp]
;W[lq];B[ko];W[jo];B[fi]C[game over.];W[ff];B[ef];W[gf]C[the w group needs to run for life now, and b messes up w's center.]
;B[eg];W[di];B[ei];W[gi];B[fk];W[ek]TR[jf]C[Ace: Perhaps the play at G9 would have been better?

i guess so, but both are bad.  you can't stop b here, your center is ruined.  it is time to expand your weak group.]

(;W[ik]TR[jf]C[ok, but still better at the triangle.];B[gm]
C[Ace: This move really confused me, I was thinking "what is he trying to do? am I supposed to respond??" I'm thinking now that I should've played up at M14 or so, the game looks pretty much lost though...

nk:  if i had played this move, it would be to reduce the possibility of w getting more points here.  see the variation a move back..]
;W[gk];B[gl];W[hk];B[el];W[dk];B[em];W[en]C[Ace: After playing this move I realized it really fairly small... I like how it guards from the cut while playing hane at the head of his two stones, but then I got the feeling something bad would happen.

nk:  this isn't hane..hane is a turn.  the cut wasn't dangerous, see the variation for that, and see the other variation for what a hane is, or http://senseis.xmp.net?hane]

;W[if]C[Ace: Here I decided I might as well attempt for life. Though, I knew he'd probably respond at F16, ruining my chances.]
;B[fd]C[(Ace: and F16 he did, I resign.)
