C[Hi namico!

I understand you are playing W in this game. I will make comments on both sides' moves, but I'll make more comments on W's moves. You are probably a beginner like me, just a bit weaker. I'm not going to make very extensive comments and I will just point out the things I consider most important. This way, after hopefully correcting the biggest flaws in your play (in my opinion :)) you can work on the others.

You should try to play lighter and make your stones work together well over larger pieces of the board (over the whole board if possible). Play a lot until you are around 10-12k. Then try to play over pro games. Don't try to understand them. Just look at the shapes. Solve many tsumego. Graded, suited to your rank.

Please remember I am only a beginner and I may be very wrong when explaining things.

Thank you for the request and have fun playing GO!
Feel free to email me with more questions.

--Miron];B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[qd]LB[pd:A][pc:B][od:C]C[This isn't good shape. A or B would be better. You invite Black to attack at C and that is difficult to deal with.]
;B[od];W[md]LB[oc:A][nc:B][pc:C][nd:D][jc:E][qf:F]C[I don't know this joseki. Maybe there is one. Anyway, I don't like this shape.

It is true that playing White A, Black B and so on to F W plays right into black's hands (B gets a lot of influence). So this stone is played in the right direction. But personally I would play at N17 instead of this (if I must play here). But it seems better to counter attack at F17. That way you force black to decide how he will play and then you have more information to help you decide about the UR corner.]
;B[nc];W[pf];B[of];W[og];B[nf]LB[pg:A]TR[md]C[Up to here it looks like some sort of perverted joseki to me. Both B and W have thin shapes with defects. But B seems to have the advantage, because now W needs to protect against the cut at A and then B has sente to attack the marked stone.]
;W[mc]TR[md]LB[pg:A][kd:B]C[This is a very bad move. It doesn't defend against the cut at A, it makes the marked stone heavy, it doesn't strengthen the marked stone, it doesn't really attack the B group. It's a negative multiple purpose move. If you really want to defend the marked stone, a light play at B would make a flexible and difficult to attack shape. But I still dislike what happens when B plays A.

See var.

(Light: a group/move that is flexible, attacking it will result in maybe capturing some of it, but the rest will become very strong. The owner of the light group may decide to abandon the whole group, because the group being "light" it doesn't hurt much when lost. Attacking light groups is difficult. Opposite to light: heavy. A heavy group is a liability, losing it is very bad. It can be attacked more effectively. The two stones are heavy because they are tied together,vulnerable and on a high position - losing them isn't very pleasant)]

(;B[pe]C[This is very effective because of the posibility to cut at A. It is much simpler then cutting directly and probably better. But if the cut was defended this wouldn't be possible.]
;W[qf]C[unpleasant, but there is no choice :)];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]
;W[rg];B[rd];W[sf];B[qc]TR[mc][md]C[This isn't good for W. He has a low wall and B got a BIG corner. Besides B can still attack the marked stones.]
;W[mf]LB[ng:A][id:B][ic:C]TR[md][mc]C[I think this is the wrong direction. Besides it is a thank-you move. B would like very much to play at A and this move is a very good reason to do so (Without this move a play at A wouldn't be urgent and he'll probably consider other plays). You can't really expect to get both this move and A! The B stone at A hurts the little influence the W stones on the R have. To defend the marked stones a play at B or C would be much better. A three space extension from a two stone wall on the 3rd and 4th line is standard shape.]
;B[ng];W[fq]LB[cf:A][fd:B][fc:C][id:D][ic:E]C[Good move. It tries to build something. But I would play A instead. That way B would be probably pushed towards the upper side at B or C and you could play D or E to settle your upper side group.]
;B[ic]C[Black extends and attacks at the same time. Very painful for W. (the upper side group is now a lot weaker.]
;W[dj]LB[ie:A]C[Good. Prevents a double wing. But I would play A to defend my upper group (with a chance to reduce B later). But that is only a personal choice. Your move is good too, probably better.]
;B[ch];W[dm]TR[mc][md][mf]LB[cm:A]C[This takes too much care in settling this group while it leaves the marked W stones weaker.

Plus this move is too high. Better at A.];B[cn]LB[dj:A][dm:B]
C[See? Now white floats. The last two stones played aren't weak, just not very useful. A was more of an invasion and B is something like a reduction. It looks like they are half hearted moves to me.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[ep];B[dr];W[eq];B[do];W[en]LB[ng:A][fq:A][eo:B]
[fn:C]TR[ng]C[Good! You have built a wall. B has a big corner, though. You whole board shape would be very nice if it wasn't for the marked B stone.   Your wall has defects.   1. an empty triangle.  (A)
2. if Black pushes at B he will have a cutting point at C.

Conclusion: It would have been very nice to have the white A stone at B. Therefore you have lost a move. Moreover B has sente. So Black is better in this fight.

See var.]
(;B[eo]LB[kh:A][eo:B][fn:C]C[Black pushes. Good. You _have to_ answer. But from B's point of view, this is an absolute kikashi. This kind of move is very powerful and should be kept unplayed until it has the maximum effect.  It doesn't do much right now. Black's timing isn't very good (it is very unprobable you would spend another move playing a stone at B - if you would, B would get a chance to play elsewhere so B isn't at all urgent for Black).

Kikashi - forcing move.   Imagine instead that black would have played a stone around A, attacking your upper side group and threatening to demolish your moyo (actually, what you have is a very thin (and very big) moyo - a potential moyo :). Later, he can push at B and then cut at C, depending on the development of the game.

Besides your walls are too far away from your Q4 stone. Looking again, you can see your overall shape looks bad. You have two weak walls which are inefficient (can be attacked) and are too far away from Q4. Instead of radiating power your walls are almost simple lumps of stones.]
;W[fo];B[nq]C[This is _tough_. Your moyo of a moyo is halved.]
;W[lq]LB[pn:A][qn:B]C[Is this the right direction? What about the other side? (say A or B)? I don't know which is better. Both your walls have bad shape.

Maybe this move should have been a little higher (M4). You can't expect to kill B here, you should try to make him live low.]
;B[pr];W[oq]LB[no:A]C[Black should have played the last move at A. Your move here is very good. But you don't continue....]
;B[or]LB[np:A]C[Black connects of course.];W[pl]LB[np:A][qq:B]
[qp:C]C[Horrible! The follow up is at A!!!

You let B do whatever he wants in the LR corner. He can go to the center (A), he can take a big corner (B, C). The stone you played is a power/influence stone (line 4). But if you leave B so strong, power doesn't help (you can't use it to attack) and influence is very small (because of B strength nearby)]
;B[oh]C[Black crushes your wall on the right side.];W[pg];B[np]
TR[np][nq][oq][or][pr][pp]C[The last two black moves were very calm. By now your shape is bad enough to fall over the cliff by itself. B doesn't need to push very hard :)

In this shape (of the marked BW stones), W is in damezumari and his two stones are easy to attack and capture. Making them strong requires at least one more stons. Too many. Abandoning them means you give B a huge ponnuki in the corner.]
;W[ph]LB[qi:A]C[Better at A I think. (gets closer to the other stones and makes some more territory - your R side becomes stronger)]
;B[oi];W[pi];B[oj];W[pj];B[lh]TR[lq]C[You extended along the 4th line, but B has destroyed your potential territory _and_ built a moyo for himself. Besides, the marked white stone is too far away from the wall on the left and too close to B thickness. One more weak position for B to exploit.]
;W[jo]C[Good! You defend your weakness. But you still have the weak upper side group :)]
;B[kf]C[... and B attacks it to collect territory.];W[gj]LB[ie:A]
[cc:B]C[I think this move is far too shy. A play at A may be too deep, but too me it seems like a dangerous reduction - it may save the weak upper side group.

But the simplest way here is to invade at B, live in sente then play the move you played now.
Living in sente at B is insured by the simplest hoshi josekis.]
;B[eh]LB[cc:A]C[B is again very calm. But now a san-san invasion at A would hurt him.]
;W[ei]C[What do you want to do with this move?];B[fh];W[fi]
C[You made a few points in gote and it's not even yose! Extremely small moves. Lost moves, I may say!!]
;B[hh]C[San-san is getting hotter :)];W[hi]C[And you should feel its heat.]
;B[ih];W[ii];B[dc]C[No more sansan invasion finished in sente!
That would have been 30+ points damage to B in sente! Have you obtained 30+ points in the center with the last moves? It looks to me you got 15 tops. And Black secured a huge chunk of territory (60 points easy).]
;W[ok];B[mj];W[mk];B[lj];W[kj]LB[mf:A][kk:B][jk:C]C[You make the same mistake as with A! B or C would have been better!]
;B[lk];W[ml]LB[kk:A]C[Now you don't protect your center. Black can slice right through it!
A would be better I think.];B[kl]C[And it starts to do so...]
;W[ln]C[This move is useless. It's on a neutral point.   There are no more comments after this. It's yose, and you already have a lot of other stuff to improve on. Yose is a complicated business and I am weak at it myself so my comments won't help much.]

;B[rj]TR[og][ph][pi][pj][qj][md][mc]C[This is the _worst_ for B if he cuts I think. Things could end up a lot better for him, even if he is very low now.

But the marked W stones are not too strong and the corner is weak. This variation probably leads to a very bloody and big fight.

I may be very wrong :)]))
