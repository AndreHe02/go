C[I won this game by resignation after a large kill, but I was appalled at how badly my stones were working together after the opening.  I'd like to find out what exactly I did wrong in this game.  No need to go into much detail in the middle game, but any comments are appreciated.

Thanks in advance for the review!];B[cd];W[pd];B[dq];W[op];B[jj]
;W[ec]C[Ben:  Earlier you mentioned you couldn't get your stones working together.  Don't forget that a viable strategy is to make moves that disrupt your opponents stones from working together as well.  Then you will find your stones working beautifully.  With that in mind I would try something in the d-10 area depending on your style of play.]
;B[gb]C[I have never, ever seen this move before.  I was at a loss as to how I should respond.

Ben:  Treat this move just like g-17only slighty worse because it does nothing for the center and it aims at staking out first line territory.  Rarely an accepted strategy in professional play.  For example you could play any number of moves here.]

(;W[fd]C[I decided that trying to split up black was a good idea, but maybe I should have just jumped out to see which side black would defend.

Ben: This is a reasonable move here as well.];B[hd]C[Ben: Now black is forced to do this so we can argue it would have been better for him to just pincer this way straight off (since g-18 isn't doing anything in this joseki until like yose).]
;W[cf]C[Thought I could kill this, but apparently not.

Ben: Nevertheless this is an appropiate move.];B[db];W[eb];B[dc]
;W[de];B[dd];W[ed];B[ce];W[ef];B[bf];W[cg];B[kc]C[I have a very thick wall... but it seems incredibly useless facing a settled group.

Ben: Think of your stones in this area as more of a reduction.  Thickness is important for flexibility not making points per se.  And you now have sente.]

(;W[mc]C[Ben:  Probably not that important.  This shape might become concentrated by black playing r-16 here later (although I wouldn't play that way right now).

It would be better to just let him approach you. For example.]
;B[qc]C[Ben: Probably not so good, black should approach at r-4.]

(;W[qd]C[Blocking at Q17 seemed wrong... I figured I could get thickness in sente then extend.  Wrong again.

Ben: Well is it wrong?  Do you think playing at q-17 is good now?  Looks like white would get a miniscule territory that would still not be large enough for unconditional life and black would get a solid corner all to himself.]
;B[pc]
(;W[oc]C[Ben: Why leave a cutting point for one or two moku?]
;B[rd];W[re];B[sd]C[Ben: Just awful for black. After s-17 white would be forced to defend.]
;W[se];B[rb];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[sb];W[oe]
(;B[qf]C[If this had been at, say, R10, I would have had another useless wall.

Ben: Actually I was kind of feeling bad for black.  You really think these stones are useless?  I think you need to realize that while white hasn't made a lot of immediate profit black hasn't made much either.  You just forced black to make a ridiculous corner worth all of about 4 points (or less) his other corner is lets say 11 so that would be a nice round number.  The middle thing is maybe 10.  You are definetely getting 10.  So he is ahead by 15.  If you got komi he would be ahead by nine.  But that is just in terms of immediate profit.  And I think the white potential is greater.]
;W[qe];B[ql]C[Ben: Looks odd to me.]
(;W[qi]C[Maybe this should have been R10.
Ben: Either is okay or playing r-4 might even be better.];B[qo]
;W[qq];B[ph]C[Ben: This looks unreasonable to me.  Why go through so much effort to take away so little?  This is like a dream position for shinogi players (people who rescue weak stones).  Now white can whittle his way through the black central potential while threatening the black lower right group and saving his r-11 stone.  That makes any moves for white here have a triple purpose.  My friend told me the other day that moves that have triple purpose are quite good.]
;W[pi]C[Ben: This is how I would play.];B[oh];W[oi]C[Ben: Good.]
;B[rj]C[Ben: See how black starts to become worried about his lower group?  But just now he had to play o-12, I guess he "blinked."]

(;W[ri]C[Ben: Eww, o-12 seemed pretty strong to me.];B[ni]CR[oi]
[pi][qi][ri]C[Ben: Black is too loose for this hane.  White can save his own stones (marked) at any time by t-13 so attacking them seems kind of pointless doesn't it?]
;W[qh]C[Ben: I would be more aggressive. Keep moving toward the center.  It's a big area still.]
;B[pg]C[Ben: There are so many big moves on the board and you both are fighting so hard for these 6 or 7points.]
;W[pf];B[qg]C[And I'm in trouble again.  I think that I was having trouble taking my opponent seriously, but I can't articulate what was wrong with my general strategy.

Ben:  Just conentrate on what is important.  Your not really in any trouble at all.  Now I would probably just play t-13 and link up and see what he does.  There is still a big cutting point on 0-12 to look forward to.  If he covers it then you have sente again.]
;W[rk]C[Ben: Wrong timing.];B[qj]C[Ben: Black is just missing a good opportunity to tenuki.]
;W[qk]C[Ben: Ask yourself how many points is s-9 really worth and can I just let it go and how much is it going to cost me if I try too hard to save it..]
;B[pj];W[pk];B[oj];W[sj]C[Nothing much to say after this point... a big fight in which I get out all of my aggression.

Ben: If I were black I would try this.]
(;B[nj];W[sk]C[Ben: This move actually doesn't have much of a point really.  You could have just played the sequence with s-7 straight away.]

;B[ol];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[mh]C[Ben: Blacks center potential is destroyed and I am not even sure if white couldn't have just cut at o-12 earlier.  It's complicated though so I will leave those variations alone.]
;W[kq]C[Ben: This is a big move.  Black's group on r-8 really only has one eye for sure.]
;B[hq];W[lm];B[dn]C[Ben: Black finally got the urge to tenuki to bad it's at a time when he should be rescuing his weak groups.  Now he just kind of falls apart.]
;W[ck];B[mm];W[ln];B[mn];W[mo];B[no];W[np]C[Ben: I think If he went p-5 now it would live.   

Don't be too worried about making instant profit.  Too many time players think that joseki is about making  points.  Joseki are not as inflexible as that.  Sometimes how solid the position is meaningful or the fact that one player ends with sente is important.  You were in quite good shape after the opening and as a result he just sort of fell apart later.

This is the end of my comments.]

;B[nk];W[pl];B[nl]C[Ben: It's a furikiwari.  Black is getting stronger in the center and white takes the side.  Probably white is ahead a little and that stands to reason.  Although white might get a little worried about his top group.]

(;W[nh];B[ri];W[qh]CR[ri][rj]TR[qf][oh][ph]C[Ben:  My thinking is that black could have got these circled plays anyway so his other stones (triangle) just constitute a big loss.  Now keep mind that what I mean is that white has a wall in the middle of the board.  Winning the actualy stones wasn't the important part.  When I play people who are even 5 or 6 kyu I get the impression they think winning stones is the important part.  It's not, it's the wall you get from winning the stones that is important.]

)))
(;W[cg]C[Ben: This area is still important and e-17 stone is still full of possibilities.  If you can't figure out why I played here it is simply because black can't extend along the c-line in an economical fashion.  White c-12 would have the same effect but would emphasize the bottom more and pressure the top less, again a matter of style.]
)
(;W[gd]C[Ben: Even this appears playable to me.])
(;W[ic];B[gd];W[lc];B[ed]C[Ben:  This is a nice way of playing as well.  Black will have to play another stone to eliminate the aji for a grand total of 5 stones played in order to decimate a single one of yours (All the while white has built a comprable territory to the right).  And he has gote as well.  Finally we can say from a tewari analysis that no player would ever play g-18 if black had first played his stones to c-16, g-16, and e-16 first ( do you recognize the joseki if you take away g-18 here?)  

The next play would be c-10 for you.]))
