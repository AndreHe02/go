C[Good job keeping the final score close... however I wanted to point out some key points where you seem to give up the game to W

;B[pq];W[cp];B[jp]C[interesting strategy... This move ignores the primary direction of the Q3 stone (that is, the corner enclousure) in order to invite W to approach around Q5]

(;W[pn]C[even with W approaching lightly,  K4 seems to call for a pincer.]

(;B[np];W[of]C[Not sure what to think about this move.. It looks like a probing move to try and get B to commit to one side of the board.  Either way 1) it's weak and lonely, so if you intend to give it trouble don't attatch to it (that only helps it get shape)  and 2) it's high, so if it's something more than a probe W's commiting himself to an influence strategy and you need to counter accordingly (for example, secure quick territories while leaving yourself ways to get into the center).]
;B[pf];W[pk]
(;B[qi]C[The presence of P14 makes this move a bit odd.  1) Its not connected to your stones above.  2) As white demonstrates, if you do want to connect it up with your stones above, it will cost you.  3) It doesn't do much by way of keeping white seperated. 4) it ignores the fact that white is staking his game on a big center.  If you feel you need to play in the upper right, why not just Q13?]

;B[dm]C[This is a bit too close to W, he can punish with something like D10.]

(;W[dn]LB[fc:D][fd:C][jd:B][cf:A]C[Here W's over developing his corner.  feel free to play elsewhere now.  If W wants to continue to atack that stone let him.  Think about A - D, these are still big points.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[cm];W[em];B[en];W[do];B[el];W[fm];B[cf]C[you've left your C7 stones lifeless and alone.  If your going to commit to a position, then settle it.  That way W can't give you any problems in the future (e.g. chasing you around the board and forcing you to live small).  Note: 1 stone doesn't commit you, 4 of them (especially when you sacrifice a stone for those 4) do.]
;W[fl]C[W is now going to give you problems in order to take some outside influence for himself.  This is probably a bit over zealous on W's part.  Nonetheless, your getting pushed around and forced into what W wants.]

C[just keep extending down the left side after this, or fight the ko. Anything but M4.

See the variations it looks like B @ B4 is sente given the size of the reduction to white's corner

And even if W does respond it looks like B wins.]
(;B[lp]C[M4 simply gives up the initiative... Look at the rest of the game and notice that W gets all the big endgame points.]

[kp][mp][lq][mq][mr][ms]C[Overall not a bad game... A couple suggestions: 

1) treat the opening more like an opening - that is, don't commit yourself to fierce battles at the start, aim for the big points.  And if your opponent drags you into a fight look for the first moment to play somwhere else.. even if that means loosing a couple stones to settle your position quickly.  What's a couple points compared to say 10 or 15.  

2) When your opponent commits himself to the center so early don't wait until move #85 to start effectively daling with him.  Play strong by heading your opponent off - both on the board and in strategy.

Hopefully this helped a bit... let me know if you have any questions.]
