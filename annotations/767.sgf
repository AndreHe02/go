RE[W+28.5]

C[I played black, and lost although I think I did the best I could.  Any advice on how I could have handled a situation better, or made a wrong choice would be appreciated.  I comment the places where I wasn't sure of my next move.

rev: All right, i will try also to do my best, but i don´t have the answer to all questions, i´m currently 9k* at igs, i am not a Master ;-)]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[de];B[pp];W[co]C[Didn't know how to respond to this, so just played D5.  It's not in the books, as far as I know, but there's nothing wrong with it, is there?]
;B[do]C[rev: i think white is bad but the problem with strange moves is that if they aren´t answered properly, they can become good ones; i don´t like d5 because it let white to settle too easily and i don´t see all the bottom as black territory so i would have played calmly at c4, it settles black, attack white and keep open options]
;W[cp];B[jp]C[rev: many times we rush to make territory, but later there is no territory at all, well, let see what happen]
;W[oq]C[rev: bad, even worse than c5 because it plays pincered]

(;B[mq]C[rev: well, i suppose black has killing aims, but believe me, being psicokiller is not good, just kill when you are sure of it, if not, try to take advantage of the weakness of the oponent, i would have played like in the variation]
;W[op];B[pq];W[pr];B[nr]C[rev: believe me, in most of the cases that kind of threath to cut only reinforce the oponent]
;W[or];B[po]C[rev: black let white to settle taking the corner and making black group weak, would be better a slugish move like r2]
;W[oo];B[pn]C[rev: ...];W[qq];B[qp];W[rq];B[rp];W[qr]C[rev: bad, locally better s2 and globally little]
;B[rs]C[rev: a bit early to think about life and death questions ...]
;W[sq]C[rev: how cheap white value sente!];B[mo]C[This white group looks weak to me, with only a single eye.  My instinct is to threaten it and give me monstrous influence on the bottom.  Was this really the right idea?  It didn't really turn out that way.

rev: is a good plan, the problem is that usually is better to make the urgent moves before the big moves, and now the urgent question is that q4 group is very weak, time ago i would have played p6, but it helps white to attack black bottom so now i would have played something like q9]
;W[on];B[pm];W[mn];B[nm]C[rev: mmm, i can´t say it´s bad, but ...]
;W[nn];B[om];W[ln];B[lo];W[kn];B[ko]C[rev: black can´t follow the dragon running so close, better moving around h5, but the question is what is black plan because is imposible to catch the dragon and the territory value of l5 is just 1 point!]
;W[qg]C[rev: mmm, very good attacking - defending move but white was so close to spoil black moho ...  i don´t know]
;B[jn]C[rev.- a big move, but remember urgent moves ...];W[jm]
;B[in];W[im];B[hn]C[Seems to me like I gained a lot from all that pushing, and I can still make threats on that group, but I'm not too sure that the white influence to the top and my potentially weak black group make up for that.

rev: i agree];W[dq];B[eq];W[dr];B[dg]C[rev: a territory so hardly built and now ..., i never would have played anything but e2]
;W[cd]C[Again, not sure how to answer.  Was there a better choice?

rev: again out of my joseki records, but again calmly c17];B[cc]
;W[bc];B[dd]C[rev: i would have played again calmly b18, d16 make white stronger and more weak d13, use to be not a good idea to develop one group if it make other weaker]
;W[ce];B[jc]C[rev: black rush too much];W[mc];B[bb]C[rev: not now, now would be better something like h16 to make k17 a good move (but what a white corner!, let start to think about R17 and of course in your not loved son, the q4 group)]
;W[bd]C[rev: so little ...];B[ee];W[cg];B[df];W[ch];B[cf]C[rev: don´t do that, let it for kos or whatever, don´t kill options (in japanese is ajikeshi or something like that)]
;W[bf]C[Now I know for certain I came out ahaid in that exchange, so feeling that I might actually be winning in the game (And tell me if I'm wrong) I feel it's safe to make a peaceful move and end my small worries of my Q4 group.

rev: well, of course on top and bottom black have POTENTIAL more territory (they need e2 and k15), white far less in left but here the problem is q4 group, if i were white a would attack it and even letting black to live i would make a very big territory in corner-right-center, let see ...]
;B[qi]C[rev: at last!, but i am more cobard, i would have played closer]
;W[rh]C[Soon that corner may not be invadable, so I plunge right in.]
;B[qc]C[rev: urgent versus big, and that big move probably will end reinforcing white, so ...]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb];B[rd];W[pb];B[qb];W[oa]
(;B[qe]C[rev: i wouldn´t force so much, black should just try to live or reduce white territory but having to keep an eye on black even now weaker group (see variations)]
;W[pe];B[qf]C[rev: very bad and risky shape, use to be better to play with good shape even going not so far not so quick in the board]
;W[pf];B[rg]C[A mistake, as I am shown.];W[rf];B[re];W[sg];B[rb]
;W[qa];B[ra]C[Is this move necessary?  I can't tell.

rev: absolutely, without black s19, white s19 or t15 or t17 are killing moves]
;W[sc];B[sb];W[ph];B[km]C[Weak enemy groups serve better than connected ones.  Perhaps I should be playing on the right more directly though, or somewhere else even?  I honestly wasn't quite sure where to play at this point.

rev: the game is not in the two white stones of k7, and if black wants them white dragon become stronger]
;W[lm];B[kl];W[ll];B[kk];W[lk];B[hl]C[rev: four moves trying to capture two lonely white stones making white dragon alive ... and let see black group]
;W[pk]C[rev: i wouldn´t play like white, but honestly, i am not able to say which and why is the right move]
;B[qk];W[rk]C[rev: again this is too complex to be read for me, but as a general rule is not good to throw in alone stones if there is not a clear secuence]
;B[ql];W[rl];B[rm];W[ri];B[rj];W[sj];B[qj];W[sk];B[oj];W[ok]
;B[nk];W[pj];B[pi]C[rev: i think black plan is not right, black try to escape from q11, but white top-right group is alive so very strong, i think black should escape from o9 threathening the white dragon]
;W[nj];B[oi];W[nl];B[ol]C[rev: bad, it helps to make little life, but is better for black to escape]
;W[mk];B[oh];W[og];B[mh];W[ef]C[I like my influence at the top, so I let these stones die.  Good idea?

rev: all right];B[ff];W[eg];B[fg];W[dh];B[ke]C[Probably not a very effective move.  :|

rev: no, i don´t see anything wrong, perhaps a bit greedy and a dubious help for black n12, but that is a matter of taste]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[ec];B[eb];W[jb];B[ib]C[rev: mmm, if you are not sure don´t do that ..., let white winning 1 point if black is going to asure 30]
;W[jd];B[id]C[rev: good];W[kc];B[ic];W[je];B[le]C[rev: generally good but here very bad, just cut at l16]
;W[jf];B[ki]C[Now I really get in that groups face.  If I had done something differently, could I have captured it?

rev: well, one should keep good shape and an empty L use to be horrible shape but even that here the best black can to is to cut again at l16]
;W[kd];B[mm]C[rev: don´t try to kill if you are not going to kill, is a wasted move]
;W[ni];B[nh];W[kj];B[jj];W[lj];B[jk];W[li];B[mi]C[rev: black must admit that white is alive, it´s hard to go against reality :(]
;W[lh];B[kh];W[lg];B[ck]C[Seems like the last big point to me.

rev: bigger than black group???];W[cm];B[ek];W[ji];B[jh];W[ii]
;B[ih];W[hi];B[fi];W[hh];B[dm]C[Perhaps the L12 stones are more important, but getting this much territory didn't seem like it could wait.

rev: all right, but why then black has moved anything from l12?]
;W[dn];B[en];W[cn];B[em];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr]C[rev: horrible shape, don´t go against reality, white is going to enter and g2 make things worse]
;W[gq];B[hq];W[gp];B[hr];W[ep];B[eo];W[fp]C[It didn't really turn out how I'd hoped however.  Any advice?  (Though not to spoil it, that group dies anyway :P)]

rev: yes, of course, just not playing at g14 (value 1 point) and playing here before white (value, the game), well, from here there is no more comment, forgive me if i have been too hard, your playing is generally good, but i think that you want to win too quickly, eating too much board and don´t accepting that the oponent plays also to win and that there are moves that HAS to be done even being "not so big", good luck!]

))
(;B[pq];W[op];B[po];W[lp];B[jo]C[rev: well, it is just an example, the question here is to have a large plan, here you let white to live or to escape, but you settle the corner and make territory (almost) in the bottom, you don´t have to try to win by 100 point, just 10 is perfect ;-)]
