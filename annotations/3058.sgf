C[hi ;)
thanks for reviewing this game. I chose this one, because i already know some of my errors ( the obvious ones) but would like to know some others, especially fuseki and middlegame... i have the feeling that i want too much in the beginning and probably i have a warped view of the truth because i felt convenient sacrificing a quite big group. I played black.
Thanks in advance for your time and thoughts.
MR: Hi. The game you sent is played on quite a high level from the point of view of whole board thinking. Did you read a book on this topic lately? On the other hand, there are some blunders in it with respect to fighting. Maybe fighting and deeper reading could be your next areas of focus.
I hope you will find the comments helpful.

(;B[fo]C[Lestard: I thought it would be better to divide white here instead of going into the corner.
MR: There is nothing wrong with entering the corner with C3. But F5 is another idea with whole board thinking.]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ir];W[po];B[pl]C[Lestard: this one should work with the upper right corner... or would you say that playing o4 or sth like that is better to keep white seperated again?
MR: I would also prefer to pincer, as white can settle himself on the lower side with the standard sequence starting with G4 anyway.]
;W[no];B[nq];W[lp];B[de]C[Lestard: I planned to cut and needed a ladder braker]

;W[ko];B[kn]C[Lestard: in this position i felt quite comfortable... should I? ;)
MR: Depends on your fighting ability. It clearly looks like a whole board fight developing. And clearly, your goal should *not* be to have the stones around L6 captured ;-)]
;W[hn];B[fm];W[hl];B[kk];W[dl];B[fk];W[gn];B[em]C[MR: Note that this move does not connect the black stones. To me this smells like aji keshi. Why not F6?]
;W[dm]
(;B[gj]C[MR: This move is clearly bad, as it invites white H10. The following moves in the game only help white.]
;W[hj]C[MR: This is the natural move for white. The sequence is good for white.]
;B[hi];W[ij];B[ii]C[MR: These moves would only be good if you really see a chance to encircle white.]
;W[jj]C[Lestard: the plan was to let white get nearer so that the cut hurts more

MR: Whom does which cut hurt more?]
(;B[kj]C[MR: But ...
This is tooth paste technique (the white group is squeezed to the open between the two black groups like tooth paste) - this is rarely a good technique!]
;W[ji]C[MR: The moves from G10 to K11 only helped white.]
(;B[dj]C[Lestard: probably here it would be better to play on the right side?
MR: Yes, as both your and white's group are weak there.];W[oj]
C[Lestard: quite nice move :/ i decided to defend the right side and sacrifice those stones... hoping for some aji :/]

(;B[pj]C[MR: This only helps white. The simplest answer for whitewould be P11, which would be a splitting attack between the two black groups.]

(;W[ki];B[ph]C[MR: Now black has at least got something as exchange. However, this is only thanks to white's mistake!]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[nc]C[Lestard: probably another slack move
MR: Not necessarily. But after this move you should kill the invading white stones in the upper right!
Of course, D14 would have been a straight forward alternative.]
;W[df];B[dg]C[MR: Should be at C13. Nearly always, after the cut D14 the correct answer is C3! Or would you play at D13 after black C13, white E14?]
;W[ef];B[cg];W[eg]C[MR: Unimportant.];B[ei]C[MR: Achieves nothing. I would play L17 instead. R4 or R5 are alternatives.]
;W[rd];B[qd]C[Lestard: afterwards i thought playing r17 might be better... white probably would find it hard to live on the right side...
MR: Yes.];W[rc];B[re];W[pb];B[ob];W[pc];B[od];W[rf];B[se]C[Lestard: I didnt see t16... ;) and that for quite a long time until white decided to play there ;) probably white was already alive before
MR: No, black R17 kills the corner group.];W[jc];B[lc]C[MR: Should be at R17. Despite this, white K17, black M17, white K15 is far too good for white.]
;W[je];B[ck];W[cr]C[Lestard [3k?\]: no problem ;) you have enough time left :)]
;B[kq];W[kp];B[bm]C[MR: I would rather continue at K3 (if white tenukis, J5 is the follow up)]

(;B[qa]C[Lestard: misread sth here ;) thought it would be a sente seki, but white had too many outside liberties.
Is there the possibility of a multistep ko? (see variation)]
;W[pa];B[sb];W[ra];B[rb];W[qb];B[oc];W[sc];B[kr]C[MR: This move does not connect. K3 is much better.]
