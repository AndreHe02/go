C[<MK> Notes to Go Teaching Ladder: I'm submitting this game for review and am interested in any comments you might have.  I've also included specific questions in my comments. Thanks!

s: Hello, and thank you for letting me review your game.  I'll prefix my comments with "s:".  Please be aware that I'm only 8 kyu, so some of my advice is sure to be incorrect.  If you have questions, you can find me on KGS as "samtregar" or email me at sam@tregar.com.]
;B[pq];W[dc]C[mvk20 [17k\]: Hello!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pk]C[<MK> I've gone with a high-Chinese opening here.  Not really sure what I'm doing, but thought I'd give it a try.  Any thoughts?

s: This is fine.  I have more experience with the low chinese opening, but I believe the strategies involved here are similar.  Your goal is to force white to invade your side of the board and then gaining strength during your counter-attack.  Since two of your stones are on the fourth line your goal is *not* to try to make territory on the right side.]
;W[qf];B[qe]C[<MK> Was it good to attach here?  I thought that white would be a bit cramped after standing up and then making a base.

s: this looks ok to me.  Combined with your stone at Q9, white is under preasure.]
;W[qj]LB[pf:A]C[<MK>Suprised me

s: Me too!  The next move is usually at A.  Follow the proverb: your opponents best move is your best move and play there your self!]
;B[qk]LB[pf:A]C[<MK>I thought this was a priority.

s: I like A better since it's a more direct threat.];W[pj];B[pf]
LB[oj:A]C[s: this is ok, but A would also be good.  The proverb says "hahn on the head of two stones."]
;W[qg];B[kd]LB[fd:A][ce:B][cj:C][fq:D]C[<MK>Was this the right distance to extend?

s: this is a poor move, in my opinion.  It seems to have no purpose.  It's on the fourth line, so it's too high to make terrritory.  But it's too far from white to be any threat.  If you want to play on the top, I think A is the move.  At this point I think B, C or D all look better though.]
;W[df]LB[de:A]C[s: good move by white, although A would be moderately safer.]
;B[fq]C[<MK> Was this a good move?  I did not expect the pincer here, and thought I could extend on the lower side.

s: Yes, this is the right idea.  Of course, when you approach a stone in the corner a pincer is always a possibility you should consider.]
;W[iq];B[cq]LB[fo:A]C[<MK> Correct response?

s: No, I think it's much too early to play on the 3-3 point.  This lets white build up influence facing the huge expanse of the left side, where he conveniently has a nice anchor on the top left.  I prefer A here.]
;W[dq]LB[cp:A]C[s: I think simply playing at A is better for white.  He should welcome the chance to build a wall here facing up.]
;B[dr];W[cp];B[bq];W[ck]LB[an:A]C[s: I like this move by white, but you should keep the monkey jump at A in store for the endgame.]
;B[gc]LB[jc:A][ci:B][dj:C]TR[kd]C[s: this would work better if the marked stone was at A.  As it is, I think it's a bit too weak to play so close to white's strength in the corner.  A better move might be B or C to try to split up white's groups.  Keeping your opponents stones separated is an important goal.]
;W[io]C[s: this is a very strange move.  This stone isn't in any danger, and this move is usually used to escape from a pincer.]
;B[lq]LB[lp:B][mp:A]TR[pk][qk]C[s: This looks like a go joke!  White played a strange move that is usually a response to a pincer, and then you played the pincer.

s: However, it's not a terrible move since it relates well to the marked stones.  It might work better in that regard at A or B.]
;W[gn]LB[fo:A][ko:B]C[s: now he runs, chase him!  Chasing weak stones is a great way to build strength and ruin your opponent's territorial ambitions.  A play at A looks good here, but B is also possible, I think.]
;B[oj]C[<MK> I wanted to attack, not to kill, but to build a wall.

s: This is a good move, but not well-timed.];W[oi];B[lk]LB[nj:A]
[ok:B]C[<MK> Was this move okay?

s: No!  I thought you wanted to build a wall.  So build it with A.  This move is much too far away to protect your weakness at B.]
;W[nj];B[ok];W[mi]LB[nk:A]C[s: white should press the attack here with A, I think.  By playing this move he gives you a second chance to build a wall.]
;B[nk];W[mj];B[kg]LB[mk:A]C[s: this move is a little too small.  It makes some territory, but that's it.  I would be tempted to complete the wall at A.  This would give you more influence for an attack on the lower left.]
;W[ei]C[s: good move.  A play around here would have been very good for black.  Now white stands a good chance of taking the entire left side.]
;B[gf]C[s: another purely territorial move, which puts no preasure on white.  This would be fine if you were ahead, but the game looks pretty close to me.]
;W[hh];B[ig];W[hk]LB[mm:A]C[<MK> This move by White seemed really big to me.  I thought maybe I had let White get too much.

s: it's fairly large, but since it doesn't put any preasure on your stones, I don't think it's too good.  Something around A seems called for.]
;B[kn]C[s: good moyo building move.  White can't let you take such a huge territory.]
;W[qc]C[<MK> This surprised me, although it shouldn't have.  Should I have done something earlier to prevent it? Or was the outcome okay for me?

s: this is a normal enough move.  When you respond you can strengthen your territory on the top, so it's not a total loss for you.]
;B[pc];W[re];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[sc];B[qb];W[rf]C[s: very small move.  There are much bigger moves for white all over the board.]
;B[ng]LB[cd:C][eg:A][fo:B]C[s: terrible move.  This gains a very small amount of territory but loses sente.  Now is the time to invade white on the left.  I think A, B or C are all possible.]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[lg];B[lf];W[lh];B[kh];W[nh];B[og];W[oh]C[s: white just spent the last 5 moves to get 2 points of territory.  What a terrible waste!]
;B[li];W[mh];B[kj];W[pg];B[of];W[qq]LB[po:A][qo:B][pp:D][qp:C]
C[<MK> Same questions as before with top right.

s: if you wanted to enclose this corner you needed to play A, B, C or D earlier.]
;B[qp];W[qr];B[pr];W[rp];B[pp];W[ro];B[qs]LB[rl:A]C[s: bad move.  This is a small endgame move at best.  White should ignore you and eat up more of your territory with A.]
;W[rr];B[rs];W[sr];B[qo];W[ss];B[ps]LB[cd:B][fo:A]C[s: very small.  If white were allowed to capture he would get 4 points in sente.  That's much too small for this stage of the game.  You should ignore and play elsewhere (tenuki).  Something around A or B would be good.]
;W[rm];B[qm];W[rn];B[rl];W[qn];B[pn];W[sq]C[<MK> White didn't need this, right?

s: correct.];B[pm]C[s: just like you didn't need that!];W[rj]
;B[jr]C[s: this is a good move, if the endgame has started.  But I think you've still got some good middle game fighting to do on the left.  You can't plan to win if you're willing to give white the entire left side of the board unchallenged!]
;W[ir];B[eb];W[bc]LB[db:A]C[s: terrible response.  Of course A is the right play, which threatens your stone and secures the corner.]
;B[ee]C[s: this is called a "thank you" move, because your opponent should "thank you" for playing it!  White wants to secure his territory on the left and by playing here you've helped him do that and gotten very little in return.]
;W[de];B[eg];W[ef];B[ff];W[dg];B[eh]C[s: another "thank you" move.  Over the next few moves you help white build a very useful wall and get just a few points of territory in return.]
;W[dh];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[fk];B[hj];W[gk];B[gj];W[ed];B[fe]
;W[ij];B[ii];W[fh];B[fg];W[gh];B[hi];W[fp]C[s: white has the right idea - attack you and secure territory at the same time.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[gq];W[gp];B[im]C[s: this is the right idea, but a bit late.]
;W[hm];B[ik];W[il];B[jj];W[jm];B[jl];W[in];B[km];W[jn];B[ko]
C[s: too small];W[dn]C[s: I don't think this move serves any purpose.]
;B[fd];W[ec];B[fc];W[db];B[fb];W[bp];B[ap]LB[ar:A][cr:B]C[s: this should be at A or B to make shape, I think.]
;W[ao];B[aq];W[bo];B[hq]LB[hr:A][cs:B]C[s: a move like this, where you run your stones head-first into a wall, is usually bad.  A or B are bother better.]
;W[hp];B[hr];W[jq];B[kr];W[jp];B[kp];W[hs];B[gs];W[is];B[js]
C[<MK> Am I right in thinking that this was my first mistake in the bottom left?

s: not your first, but certainly a big one.  This move gets you just 1 point and your stones on the left are not yet alive.]
;W[fs];B[er];W[gr];B[fr]C[<MK> 2nd mistake?

s: yes.  Black is dead now, as far as I can see.  I tried a few variations, but I couldn't find a live one.]
;W[gs]
(;B[es]C[<MK> 3rd mistake? Or was it already too late? Could something else have been better?

s: yes, your stones are already dead, so playing further must be a mistake.  I tried out a few variations, but I didn't find anything good for black.]
;W[cr];B[kq];W[ds]C[s: this was not needed.];B[sb];W[sd];B[da]
;W[ca];B[ea];W[bb];B[sm];W[sn];B[sl];W[lj];B[mk];W[ki];B[ji]

s: You played a good game, overall, and would have won if not for the capture in the lower left.  To help prevent this kind of loss in the future you should study life and death problems.

s: However, you could have compensated for the capture by invading white on the left earlier in the game and reducing his territory.  I think you need to work on searching for dual-purpose moves that expand your territory while putting preasure on your opponent.

s: I hope my comments have been useful.  Please send any questions you have to sam@tregar.com, or find me on KGS as samtregar.]
