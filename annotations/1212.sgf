C[samtregar:
Thank you for reviewing my game.  I regularly read reviewed games on this
site and they've helped me a great deal.  I'm hoping that a review of one
of my games will help me to see mistakes in my playing.  I hope to one day
become strong enough to review others games here.

RickMott: It's said that you become 2 stones stronger when reviewing
than when playing... :)    samtregar: In this
game I played black against a much more skilled friend.  He is 11k and I'm
17k, both on KGS.  I'd just beaten him in a 5 handicap game, so I thought
I'd give him a chance to win back his pride.  I lost the game but I felt
that I played well, with a few mistakes.  I've included some comments preceded by "samtregar:" to help explain my motivation behind some of my moves and the other possibilities I considered.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[eq];W[do]C[samtregar: this must be a joseki I don't know.  I tried to play it safe.

RickMott: I don't know joseki extensively either, but it seems to me
this would be better if white occupied the A19 corner, rather than
black.];B[hq]C[RickMott: A little too conservative, I think.  I would play up on the 4th line (H4).]
;W[kq];B[jc]C[RickMott: This is OK, but a bit passive.  It's a big area, but you can't tell yet
whether you should make the territory move (K17) or the influence move (K16).
Given the strong white stones facing up the left side, I would play C10 or D10
instead, which both expands your moyo and restricts white's.]
;W[fc]C[RickMott: Not what I would expect.  I was looking for a white extension in the
vicinity of C10/C11/D10/D11.];B[hd]LB[hc:A][df:B]C[samtregar:
I considered A, but I thought it would be too low with k17 nearby.  Maybe
B would have been better.

RickMott: Both A and H16 are overconcentrated with respect to K17.
B is fine.  You could also consider E17 to make white heavy, with
B as a followup.];W[fe];B[df];W[hb];B[mc]C[RickMott: Strong, but doesn't restrict white enough.  The contact move at E17
looks good to me now, to keep white from making a base so easily.  An extension
down the left side would also be good, in opposition to white's strong stones.]
;W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[dj]LB[di:A]C[samtregar: Would A have been better?

RickMott: No, but I think 3rd line instead of 4th would be
better in this situation.  You want to have an extension
to C7 as a threatened followup.  If white responds to
prevent that, you're happy; you can leave the area to
play on the right side.

This would have been better for you if you'd played
E17 first, though.  You wouldn't have to worry about
the corner at all.];W[mp];B[qn]C[RickMott: small move for white, good move for black here.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[pk]LB[qk:A][ql:C][nn:B]C[samtregar:
This move took me a long time.  I considered A and B strongly.  I decided
A didn't work after W at r8.  I eventually settled on C to try to make an
eye.

RickMott: I wouldn't play any of these moves.  I would pincer the single
stone from above, somewhere around R11/12.  Locally, your two stones are
stronger than white's single stone, so he can't easily attack you.  If you
both run out into the middle, you will always be a little stronger.  You
have Q5 in sente, since if he fails to respond you can capture R5.
Meanwhile, your pincer works well to expand your potential in the top
right.];B[ql];W[qk]C[RickMott: You still have to run, but now white is stronger and his
two stones make it harder to secure as much territory in the top
right.];B[no];W[oo]C[RickMott: This is an odd move.  White should play simply and strongly
with O4 here.];B[on];W[nn];B[nm];W[mn];B[mm];W[ln]
(;B[pl]C[RickMott: You have at least two better plays against white's corner.
See the variations from the previous move.

If you play the hane of S5, you can take a big piece of the corner.
.
You can also play a simpler variation which starts with the atari
at Q5, with followup at R4 capturing R5.];W[rl];B[rm];W[ol]
;B[ok]C[RickMott: Why cut on the outside?  Why not make an eye with P7?
White has to respond to the threat of S9 or you live immediately.
Then you can come back and make this cut.];W[oj];B[nk]C[RickMott: but white makes life easy for you.  Say thank you...]
;W[nj];B[rk];W[nl];B[mk];W[ml];B[ll];W[rj];B[sl];W[mj];B[om]
C[samtregar:
up to here I felt pretty good.  I'd made some small amount of territory.
 However, looking back, I see that white has built a wall facing the top
right corner.  It was a good trade for white, I think.

RickMott: Yes, one of the things that's hard to learn is to stop as soon
as you've secured life and look for something bigger.  You have 3 eyes.
But you can see that leaving the potential cut at P7 is what forced you
to give white sente.  That's why I wanted you to take that point before.]
;W[qf]C[RickMott: Huge swing, between this extension and a black extension.  Not
bad for you, though; you can keep white from getting a lot for his wall.  I'd
say you are ahead now, because white has little settled territory.  All you
have to do is reduce, or get even trades (expand your territory whenever
white expands his).  No heroics required; just play simple moves.]
;B[qe]C[RickMott: fine start.  You could have done S5 in sente first, though, as
shown in the analysis around move 35.];W[re];B[rd]C[RickMott: This is the smaller side.  I think you'd be better to play Q14
and allow white some small gain in the corner, in order to prevent white's
wall from making much territory.  The major battle in this area is over
where the division falls between white's upward-facing wall and black's
downward-facing stones.];W[qi]LB[rf:A]C[samtregar: I don't understand this move.  Why not A?

RickMott: Because A is a small move.  However, white's
defensive move is not needed.  This is great for you.
You should grab Q14 and be grateful.];B[rf]C[RickMott: If it's a small move for him, it's a small move for you too...]
;W[rg]C[RickMott: But as long as both of you are anwering locally, you get
another chance.  Many bigger moves for both sides:

  For black: Q14, C7, B18, C2, K2, M10, S5 -- all better than grabbing
one stone.

For white: C8, D2, S5, J4, maybe Q15 atari and connect.];B[se]
;W[pf]C[RickMott: Not the biggest of white's available moves, but wouldn't you
be happier if you had a stone here and white had gotten the two points
on the side?];B[cm]C[samtregar: my goal here was to take away his base and force him to run to the center.

RickMott: very good move!  Since this area is valuable for both, getting there
first is worth a lot.  You are *way* ahead now; just watch out for the small bottom
group.  Making it secure or running it out should be your top priority now.]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[be];B[cg];W[bg];B[bh];W[cf];B[ci];W[bc];B[ce]
;W[bf];B[bd];W[ad];B[cd];W[ab];B[ag];W[ae];B[en]C[samtregar:
he didn't run, so maybe I can seal him in and get some influence...

RickMott: Ok, but this may not be the most important area.  I'd want
to play either O15 or M10 before this move.  I still think the balance
at the top center is the key to this game.];W[eo];B[fo]C[RickMott:  Don't invite the complications of a cut, extend straight
out with F6.  Then you can get a giant moyo with something like G13
later.];W[fn];B[fm];W[gn];B[fp]C[RickMott: Is this stone important?  Maybe better to extend the upper stone to G7,
or complete your wall with D6.  The bottom two stones can take care of themselves.]
;W[dn];B[em];W[dm];B[dl];W[gm];B[fl]C[RickMott: A simple connection at E8 will save you problems later.
Or hane at G8 if you want to play center influence.];W[gl];B[fk]
;W[gk];B[gi];W[cl];B[ck];W[bl];B[bk];W[bm];B[cr]C[RickMott: This sequence was favorable for white.  He made some
territory on the right side and severely restricted your moyo
potential.  If you were going to give up the C7 stone, maybe you
should have played G8 at move 91.];W[bq];B[br]C[RickMott: small move.  You don't need it to make life, so you
should look for something bigger.  O15 is still good.  M10 restricts
white and gives the possibility of attacking the 5 white center stones
if he doesn't defend.];W[ir];B[hr];W[fj];B[ej];W[ek]C[RickMott: Ouch.  Big tactical error by black.  Your last move
should have been here, making an eye and keeping white's
center stones separated.  Now he's connected and you have
no chance to attack, your left side territory has been reduced
to almost nothing, and your hopes of a center-left moyo are
gone.  I think this was the losing move.];B[fi]C[RickMott: Very small move.  You can't get anything here.  You have to
focus on the top now, expand your territory while restricting white,
to win.  O14 seems critical.];W[gj]C[RickMott: But he answers, so you get another chance.]
;B[qq]C[RickMott: Ok, this is interesting.];W[pq];B[qp];W[po]
;B[ro];W[qr];B[rr];W[pr]C[RickMott:  Good sequence for black, and he gives you sente (he should not
have connected at Q2, that's an end-game move).];B[rq]C[RickMott: This move is not necessary.  What can White do?  Wait until he hanes
at S1 to do this.  O15 is still critical.];W[nd]C[RickMott: ouch.  Having white get here first is very bad for you.]
;B[oe]LB[nc:A]C[samtregar:
I thought O16 was too deep, and that I could probably capture it.  I guess
I was right, but it cost a lot to do it!  Probably more than it's worth.
 Maybe A would have been better?

RickMott: No, I think this is OK.  You need to play aggressively now
to have a chance.  He left a gap you could poke through, so do it!]
;W[of];B[ne];W[md];B[me];W[jb];B[kb];W[kc]
(;B[kd]C[RickMott: I think you need to go all-out here.  Why not J18 to capture K18?
Your stone at H16 is well positioned to keep white from getting away with
much.];W[lc]
(;B[ld]C[RickMott: I would atari from underneath.  See variations...]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[ka];B[ic];W[nb];B[nc];W[ma];B[oc];W[ob];B[pb]
;W[na]
(;B[lg]LB[le:A]C[samtregar: I thought this would protect the cut at A and get some territory.

RickMott: The cut at A is meaningless because you can always capture
the two stones N16-O16.  I think you can torture white's top group a bit;
it's not definitely alive yet.  Start with J18, see variations.]
;W[hg];B[if]C[RickMott: too passive.  White has left a gap again, so you should
cut him at G14.  Depending on how the fighting goes, you may either
capture the stone or manage to wedge through at F16 after initiating
the forced sequences we looked at before on the top.];W[ig]
;B[jf];W[jg];B[kg];W[ji];B[nh]LB[oh:A]C[samtregar:
I think this was more helping white than hurting him.  Would A have been
better?  I was afraid it would get killed.

RickMott: This whole sequence is good for white, bad for you.  You are
letting him push you into getting a very small territory while he gets
strong enough to connect to the bottome left unhindered.  That's why
I suggested cutting at G14 immediately, before the stone gets stronger.
Yes, I don't think you can go as deep as A, either, but this may not be
the most critical area of the board, either.  The bottom looks bigger
to me.  J3, maybe?];W[oh];B[nf];W[ng];B[mg];W[og];B[lj]C[RickMott: Yes, this is interesting.  But you have to follow it up with a move
like J10 to try to separate white's center stones, remembering you have G14
as a possibility.  You stll have a chance to win if you can destroy any chance
of white territory in the bottom center while attacking white's center group.]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[mi];B[li]C[RickMot: You don't need to respond here.  This move doesn't make you
any points and doesn't threaten any white stones.  You have to try J10
or H10.];W[hi]C[RickMott: because once white plays here first, you have no chance to
attack now.];B[fg]C[RickMott: The bottom is still bigger, I think.]
;W[ee];B[de];W[gf];B[io]C[samtregar: I was afraid of white getting a big moyo in the center.

RickMott: Right area, but I would play J3 first.  He can't get much
of a moyo because you are strong on the right center.  This is
basically OK though.];W[ho];B[ip];W[hp];B[iq]C[RickMott: Small tactical point: clamp at K2 instead, it's 4 or 5 points bigger.]

RickMott: Not many big moves left, really.];W[hc];B[gd];W[fd]
;B[hf];W[he];B[gg]TR[fk][fl][em][fm][en]C[samtregar:
at this point I forgot that the marked stones were dead, and I thought I
could capture the large white group in the middle.  Dumb.

sequence.];W[id];B[jd];W[ie];B[je];W[ge];B[hh];W[ih];B[gh];W[ef]
