C[Message to reviewer: See my questions throughout.

I'm most interested in getting strionger in my choices in the opening and
cutting out moves that are effectively 'passing' ie of no value.

If you would focus on those areas and also point out the good/right moves (on both sides) that would be very useful.

Many thanks.];B[jj]C[wild : Interesting start, but I would still stick to
the more traditional corner start. Interesting to note that Go Seigen
(widely accepted as the greatest Go player of all time) ever started
with this move (either very early in his professional career or even
before he turn professional).];W[pd];B[dp];W[dc];B[pp]C[wild : This is the intended position in relation to the intersting start.]
;W[jc]TR[jd]C[wild: With this first 3 moves, black has signalled very clearly his
intention to play with moyo strategy. Thus, I feel that this play is
too low. At least it should be played at K16.];B[de]TR[jp]C[Is this the right approach and joseki choice for black given this opening position?

wild: Frankly, I'm not very familiar with joseki. But white certainly must
not respond with the C15 joseki. Given this position, I would almost
always play K4 to continue the moyo strategy.];W[fd]C[wild : This
gives the feeling that white has played too many hands on the top side
of the board. A better alternative is to pincer.];B[cc];W[cb]
;B[cd];W[eb];B[ci]TR[dh][di][jj]C[wild
: Of course, this is standard joseki. I think D12 or even D11 may be
better in relation to black's K10.];W[nq];B[lq];W[no];B[pn]
;W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[jq];W[pr]TR[qq]C[wild
: This move is a departure from the joseki. It's not good. It does not
give white two eyes, and at the same time, it kills off any opportunity
of a 3,3 move in future. In view of the oyo on the left, black should
resist the usual response at R3. Instead it should push through at M4.

[jq][kq][lq]C[wild
: I would think that protecting black's corner at C5 is more important.
You can imagine if white is to play 3,3 now, no matter which side black
choose to block, the effectiveness of the seeds is greatly reduced.]
;W[qh];B[qj]SQ[jc][jj]C[wild
: Black should just continue with the standard joseki of 3,3. Because
of the low position of K17 and the existence of K10, the moyo build up
is not of much value to white. Of course, this brings to attention that
white's pincer is not the appropriate joseki.];W[og];B[qc];W[pc]

;B[dl]C[wild: Black no good. The value of invading the corner (which by itself is
big), has just been doubled.];W[cq]C[wild : Excellent.];B[cp]
C[Am I pushing white in the right direction with 49,  I can never tell in these situations...

wild: Both directions are no good for black. But this direction is the
lesser evil because of the longer left side that black controls..]

;W[cs]TR[jg]C[White 60 needed?  My life and death judgement is poor

wild : No. White should consider a move near K13.];B[nm]TR[ql]
C[probably needed to aim at k14 with 61 or was 61 an actually big enough?

wild : Yes, I agree K14 is bigger. But this move is not too bad locally. It prevents white's invasion at around R8.]
;W[qr]TR[cg]C[wild
: This is a big endgame move but it is not quite endgame yet. Besides,
K13 or K14, I believe white may also create some mischief at around
C13.];B[rr]C[wild : black should consider reducing white's moyo at around K14.]
;W[rh]TR[jg][jf]C[wild
: Big move, otherwise black can connect the two sides from there.
However, I'd still feel K13 or K14 is more urgent.];B[pf];W[of]
C[wild : The last two moves is an unnecessary exchange for black.]
;B[rf]C[65, 67 v poor?! should be aiming at k14?!

wild : Yes.];W[ph];B[eg];W[ef];B[df];W[bb];B[jf]C[wild : Finally. Advantage black.]
