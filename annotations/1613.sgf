is this ok, to leave r16 alone?

Sure, I cannot see a game losing move in f17. ;-)];W[df];B[jd]
;W[jp];B[ci]TR[dd][df]C[is this too soon?

The two white stones look a bit thin now. No real danger, but they are under preasure. That means, you take the initiative: good!]
;W[ck];B[ei];W[ek]TR[ci][ei]C[Ok, w played tenuki. How to punish him for this? First of all: *not* by trying to kill him. I think you tried it in the following and you were lucky that you still got a good result. The normal approach would be to drive w out in the center and build up influence or even territory somewhere, maybe at the top. You have to watch your two marked stones during that, but they should be strengthened automatically. See var. for an (conservative) example.]

(;B[bf];W[ce];B[db];W[be];B[fg];W[ff];B[gf]LB[hd:A]C[was g14 the right move? because white will cut

As I pointed out earlier, I would have taken an completly different approach. Now it is a bit difficult, because you have a weakness around A, which you want to protect. In the end you manage to do so, but maybe w could have played harder.]

(;B[fq]C[i think F3 is now needed because he has a big moyo

At least I would aggree that you have to do something against his moyo. But still I would prefer a corner-invasion. First of all, it is save: You get a group you do not longer have to worry about. Second, it is sente: After that you can still (lightly!) erase w's moyo. See var.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[fn];W[fj];B[fi];W[go];B[jr]C[k2 was maybe too far? J2 seems better

Yes, but now you see the problem of your invasion: It was too deep. You end with a heavy group which must not die, but is difficult to make alive.]

;B[gn];W[ho];B[cq]C[i though that i had enough place to escape with the f4 group so i took the corner.

I think they are not strong enough, thus I had added a stone to the 6 stones. You come in trouble with them later.]

C[to these kind of moves, do i always have to respond by connecting? since i played safe i did. but it still got annoying.

Well, not always. But this time I do not see an alternative...]
;B[km];W[ll];B[bj]C[Mh, I still think that the stones around h7 need support. see var.

I can also see your point that the other group got a bit weak, but the k12 stones aren't strong, too. They may help you to escape. But this shows that you are in big trouble and that the corner invasion was a mistake.]

(;W[bk];B[eh]
(;W[md]LB[gj:A]C[i didn think my group was safe here, was it?

Well, what is save? You can make a second eye or cut, starting with A. But you do not have an eye at the bottom (see var.). And if w plays A, he threatens the f12 eye.]

indeed. Thus, what to learn out of this? W'eak groups on the board make it easy for your opponent to push you around - and destroy all your moyos...]

Well, all in all I have two advices:

First: Do *not* try to kill. Well, if it is clearly possible to kill, or absolutly necessary, there is no choice, of course. But normaly you should make a plan what you want to gain from an attack, and play accordingly. Push your opponent around, make him play what *you* want.

Second, and even more important: Do not leave weak groups on the board, especially when you are leading. Managing all your weak groups did cost your whole upper side moyo. Go back to move #39 and compare it with the end position. Look at your moyo at the top. Can this be? Where did you gain anything for your destroyed moyo? Maybe a little bit in the lower left, but w destroyed more on the upper side than you in the lower left. Not to speak of the lower right...]
