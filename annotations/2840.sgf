C[Dear reviewer,

This is going to sound very strange, and perhaps selfish, but I want more than just advice on moves. I played this entire game panicked and feeling as though I was behind, and I'm convinced it adversely affected my decision making. So, it would be incredibly helpful if you would include positional analyses after major sequences to help me train my mind to view the board more accurately. Thanks very much!

-Joseph


Positional analyses to view the board accurately! I want to do that as well!  That's a very difficult road, but hopefully I can be of some help.    =)

Kevin (kevco on IGS)];B[pd];W[pq]MA[qo]C[This might not be the best choice. White Q3s influence is primarily towards the left. Locally it allows black to push down or flatten any future development in that direction, by playing at R5. Blacks stone would also be slightly supported by its own piece at Q16.

If the moves were reversed and Q3 was the first play, then responding at Q16 would be better than playing at D4.]
;B[dp]MA[dd]C[Blacks star points are fast plays that should mean an interest in moyo building, as opposed to white's territory start. Therefore it would be better to play in the upper left at D16 than the D4 star point. It's OK to play opposite corners, but maybe then it would be best to take a more territorial approach.]
;W[dc]C[Now because there are opposing star point stones at both sides this is fine for white.]
;B[po]MA[qo]C[I thought this was the best way to take advantage of my split hoshi opening. I was thinking I could either get a strong right side or a lot of influence on the bottom and center

true / false

I like R5 better. White really has no prospects here, so you don't have to be overly aggressive. But your play isn't bad, and I can't say for sure one is better than the other.]
;W[qo]MA[qn]C[After this move, I wanted to play an avalanche joseki... unfortunately, I have not extensively studied the avalanches, so I was playing blind -_-

You know what, I don't even know what the avalanche joseki is.  =0   My teacher recommended I NOT study joseki while a beginner. The point being, you can't possibly remember thousands of variations, and you oppenent is likely to play out of joseki. What will you do then? You should concentrate on just looking for the best play and learning a few basic joseki.

 My teacher just finally told me it is time I start studying joseki. ;-)

Next is another possible variation I like betterr.]
(;B[pp];W[qp];B[oq];W[pr]
(;B[or]MA[pn]C[I should have played at 'X', but I wanted to try to make as big a wall for my hoshi. I thought he wouldn't cut, because he wouldn't be able to fight well. Unfortunately, I was the one who fought poorly.

Can you help me by showing sequences that qould have made this less painful for me?

Yes, you have to play black at Q6 instead. See the variation.

Its hard to come up with a less painful sequence after the cut. Your simply at a disadvantage, but I'll try!]
;W[op];B[pn]C[I wasn't pleased with this move... couldn't think of anything else, though. Any suggestions?

Actually, no. Its probably the best of a bad situation.];W[np]
;B[qq]MA[qr]C[I should probably have played at 'X' if I was going to invade at all, right?

true / false

False, its an OK sacrifice that allows you to turn the Q6 group and provide a little safety in sente.]
;W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[qn];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq]C[I know I treated those two stones as a sacrifice, but it felt like I was trying to make up for a mistake.

true / false

It was the best choice in a bad situation, and at least you have sente!]
;B[mq]SQ[oq][or]TR[np][op]MA[pj]C[I wanted to play around 'X', but I was afraid that white would capture the two stones on the bottom and gain too much. I felt that, if I made these stones on the bottom live, the marked white group would be in trouble, and I would have gained.

true / false

I wouldn't say gain here, but not to attempt to save the black stones and just let white walk all over you? Bad. Keep your opponent divided, he already divided you!]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[kp];W[ko];B[jo]LB[kq:30][jp:31][kr:32]
C[I don't know why I wasn't afraid of 30 - 32... should I have just played at 31?

Yeah, K4 is where you should have played. If you had played there, white probably would have been dissapointed in the results he got from the cut.]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[kr];B[jq];W[nq];B[jr];W[mr]C[As you take sente here, this is when you want to pause for positional analysis.

Hmmmm...

White at a definite advantage. 20 solid points, no weaknesses at all. 

Black, no points, some lower left influence, a weak group on the lower right. 

But you could make great gains on your next move!]
(;B[ci]LB[pj:A][ce:B][cj:C]C[Was this the right timing and placing for the double-wing extension?

No, and its not a double wing formation. Let's go through your groups one at a time.

The most important play on the board will always have to do with the stability of a group. After that you can think about big plays such as extensions.

Q16 - safe
D4 - safe, and supported by K4
K4 - safe, backed up by D4
Q6 - not so safe, not near death, but vulnerable to being pushed around.

Backing up Q6 at Q10 (A) is probably best. see the variation.

Locally, black C15 (B) might be better. You can't really close the lower left without being inefficient, and an extension to C10 (C) allows white to chose an invasion he feels will cramp your stones.]
;W[cn]C[This is where white gets to choose the invasion, although I think it may be a few moves early.

It should have been a little better for white than it turned out.]

(;B[cl]MA[cj]LB[co:A]C[This felt right to me for some reason; should I have played A instead?

(A) at C5 probably would be better if you had black at C10 and not C11. That would cramp him more. see variation

On second thought, I am not sure, its a little over my head, as you will see in the variations. However, for sure, C11 is out of place.]

(;W[bp]C[the variation at C3 is better for white.];B[cq];W[bq]

(;B[br]LB[bq:42][jd:A]C[I've read that the exchange of 42-43 is too small for the opening... should I have left and played something like A instead?

It is a small move territory wise, but big stability wise, which is the reason it is included in joseki. However, there is a possible variation.

I don't really like either result as white gets out toward the center (I see no way to keep him confined), cramps the lower left, and has a lot of presence towards the two left side black stones.

All this unhappy stuff stems from C11.];W[cp];B[dq];W[do];B[eo]
;W[en];B[fo]C[This worked out so-so for white.]
(;W[rm]MA[rn]C[How would you react to this move? I was baffled.

First, white is running a risk leaving the lower left now. A follow up move is needed. see the variation on the next play.

You must keep your opponents seperate. Locally, S6 is the only move.

Pause for positional analysis.

Hmmm...

white, 20 points, one weak group, minimal influence

black, 20 points, one weak group, minimal influence, just a bit more because of the left.

White should consider the corner enclosure. see the variation.]

(;B[pl]C[see the variation to attack white in sente];W[rn];B[rk]
MA[qk]LB[qj:A]C[53 probably should have been at A, right? The sequence that followed was bad for me.

Or black R9];W[ql];B[pk];W[qk];B[qj];W[pj]C[Again, here black is in a bad situation and its not going to be easy.]
;B[pi];W[oj];B[qi]TR[pk][pl][pn][qn][po][pp]C[Was the upper right more important than the marked black stones as I thought?

Perhaps if you were confident you weren't going to lose 20 points by dropping the triangled stones.]
;W[nk];B[mm]C[I was trying to use multiple concepts I've learned:
1) play lightly in enemy territory
2) do not get squeezed
    (I was hoping, at worst, to squeeze him against     my marked groups)
3) give up worthless stones
    (I was hoping I could help them, though...)

Was this the right move?

1) playing lightly refers to the first stones in enemy territory. Here you just have a big heavy group.
2) squeezing refers more to reduction in eye space, this is just a flat group.
3) Yes, give up lost stones, but you tried to rescue them.

Time to tenuki, first attack the lower left white group as described earlier, then maybe black C15. Expand your group as well as attack white.]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[ol]
(;B[nn]LB[om:A]C[Could I have saved my stones with A?

I don't see it.];W[om];B[mo];W[on];B[ml];W[lo]C[As black, you ended up making your "light" stone heavy, and another weak group.]
;B[km]C[Was 73 too close to the White stones?

Probably just shouldn't have been in this situation to begin with.]
;W[kn];B[jn];W[jm];B[jl];W[im];B[gm]C[I didn't want White to connect the two stones with his group in the corner. Was this just as much of a horrid oversight as I think it to be?

I would play black F7 even with the risk. I think you can still keep the white J7 seperated.]
;W[kl]
(;B[lk]C[see the variation];W[lm]LB[kk:A]C[If White had played A instead, would I have been in serious trouble? Or did he make the right choice?

White should have played L9 (A) first.];B[kk];W[bm]C[Pause for positional analysis.

Hmmmm...

white, 40 points, one weak group, minimal influence

black, 20 points, one weak group, some influence

advantage white];B[de]MA[bl][ce]C[I felt this was the biggest point on the board.

true / false

False, white isn't quite  yet stable on the lower left, the biggest is black B8. Biggest doesn't necessarily mean largest extension or biggiest territory move.

Locally I like C15 better.];W[bl];B[ck];W[ce]C[Good play for white.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[ee]TR[ci][ck][cl]LB[df:A][dg:B]C[I didn't want to connect at A or B, because of the proximity to my marked stones. Was this a good thought, or the cause of my later downfall?

Connecting would be a wasted play. This really worked out to white's advantage.]
;W[fc]C[Pause for positional analysis.

Hmmmmm....

white, 55 points, no weak groups, no influence

black 20 points, one weak group some influence

advantage getting bigger for white];B[ge]SQ[jm][im]TR[ee][de]
[cf][ci][ck][cl][gm][jl][kk]LB[ik:A]C[I was hoping to make a moyo with the marked stones. I was looking at A to cause trouble.

It would have been a decent plan if you had seperated the white J7 group.]
;W[ic]MA[nc]C[This is a really slow white move. White O17 with the option for the corner, or to hop back towards L17 is probably better.]
;B[kd]SQ[oj][pj][nk]MA[kc]C[Was this a good thought?

Better L17. White still can destroy the center with the white P10 group. Go third line for territory.]

(;B[nc]C[Play the double hane here. see the variation];W[nb]
;B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[nh]SQ[oj][pj]MA[rf]C[I felt that even if I didn't defend the lower side and he invanded, I'd be better off by holding this point.

true / false

False, you left a big vulnerability on your underside instead of from the P10 group. Your lucky he never played S14.]
;W[ie]C[Pause for positional analysis.

Hmmmmm...

white, 65 points, no weak groups, no influence

black 20 points, some influence, one slightly weak group

game is in the bag for white.];B[hd]SQ[im][jm]MA[hc]LB[kf:A]
C[I wanted to make him heavy, then attack. Did I just destroy aji with this?

Looking back at how the game turned out, I would have breathed easier if I had simply played A, then let him attack my moyo on the left to make some solid territory for myself.

White should have played H16 (your move). He should have then cut his loss and defended at H17, moving to attack from below at J7. He can play safe, he's ahead.

This could have been a moment of opportunity, you needed some risks to get back in the game]

C[It was now when I realized I had just shot myself in the foot. One of my biggest questions is, how can I see such nearly invisible threats as the one posed at A?

This was just a good tesuji by white. I might not have caught it either. I'm sure having it played against you will go along way towards seeing it in the future.

Closing comments:

White played a more consistent terrritorial opening. It was too slow at times, but black's lost groups helped him out. Black's opening and early middle game was not consistent in plan.

White became lax in the middle game, allowing black to catch up when he shouldn't have been able to.

This is surprising because it seems white has better reading skills than black.

Black should concentrate on learning more consistent openings, the difference between a territorial third line play and an influence based fourth line play. Pick whichever you like, but stick with it.

White built strong shapes in the opening and should work on using them to be more aggressive in the middle.


I hope this helps! =)
