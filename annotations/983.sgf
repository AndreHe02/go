C[Hello, ny name is Johan Meijerink (Kyoba) Thanks for reviewing this game, I hope you will enjoy it, and try to point out the biggest mistakes, I think I played too defensive, and let b controlling the game...
Anyway have fun :)

Hello Johan, it was fun to comment this interesting game. My comments will be preceeded by <tomjk> (I am tomjk on IGS and KGS). As overall comment I like to say:
- you don't play too defensively, but on the contrary attacked too much and ended up with three weak groups on the board.  This would not be bad if also Black had three weak groups, but in this game Black fairly early had all his groups rock solid, so you were at a huge disadvantage.
- you played much better than Black in the middle-game and end-game. You were able to gain advantage from several "wasted" moves and outright blunders which Black made, which let you gradually come back into the game.

Some suggestions:
- try to avoid to have more than two weak groups on the board and make sure also your opponent has weak groups
- look out for the "big" moves which make your opponent respond. This way you keep the initiative (you already did a good job, but try to improve).

That's all, I hope some of my comments are useful. Excuse the lengthy comments, but that's the way I do it ;-)
I think you will improve quickly, as soon as you learn not to attack to relentlessly. You middle-game and end-game is surely already better than you rank indicates :)]
;B[pd];W[ep]LB[cp:A]C[<tomjk> this move indicates that white is interested to develop the lower side. It is an interesting move which I rarely play, because Black gets lots of territory in the corner once he plays somewhere around "A".]
;B[pq]C[<tomjk> good choice by Black, it gets into the way of White direction of play with the stone at E4.]
;W[dd];B[qk]LB[kp:A][jq:B]TR[ep]C[<tomjk> low chinese opening by Black. A good choice for White would be now to play around "A" or "B", as this extends from the marked stone and is where Black also wants to play next.]
;W[co]LB[kp:A][jq:B]C[<tomjk> Not so good. It does not go with the idea of the stone at E4. If you want to make a shimari (corner enclosure) it would be better to play first D3 and then this move. Now the corner is still open. Black can still invade at the 3-3 point (see variations for some possibilities). Better would have been "A" or "B" for White.]

(;B[ci]C[<tomjk> Black could also play now "A" or "B" and let White have this point.  See variation why Black should not worry right now that White could play here.]
;W[qh]LB[qo:C][kp:A][jq:B]C[<tomjk> ok, White prefers to start a fight immediately. But maybe an attack at "C" looks better, as it also takes away the shimari from Black. I would not attack like this, but play at "A" or "B" exploiting Blacks error or "C" to attack. White is at an disatvange in this position (with Blacks next move 3 against 1).]
;B[qf]
(;W[qi]C[<tomjk> not good. White must jump out into the center with a 1-point jump (see variation).]
;B[pk]
(;W[oi]C[<tomjk> Here White can play one space further away. There is a rule of thumb:" in front of a two stone wall jump 3 spaces  - in general in front of an n-stone wall jump n+1 spaces. See also variation.]

(;B[jd]C[<tomjk> Black should keep the pressure on the white stones and build territory chasing the white group. See variation.]
;W[md]TR[md]SQ[qh][oi][qi]C[<tomjk> very aggressive by White. Be careful not to create too many weak groups. Generally if you have three weak groups, it is likely that one will die in the end ;-)]

(;B[fc]TR[md]SQ[qh][oi][qi]C[<tomjk> wrong direction. Now Black should aim to keep the marked stone and the white group separated. See variation.]

(;W[dc]LB[fd:A]TR[ci]C[<tomjk> not so good. This creates a heavy group. Maybe better here at "A" and the attack the marked Black stone as in the variation.]
;B[cf]C[<tomjk> good attack from Black. You see why white's move was not so good?]
;W[ce];B[fe];W[df]C[<tomjk> very good! Getting out in the center is important!]
;B[cg];W[eg]C[<tomjk> good again! White moves into the center and keeps the two Black groups separated.]
;B[cl];W[pn]LB[og:B][nk:A]C[<tomjk> nice attacking spirit.  But note that if Black now at "A", then white has two weak groups which can become three if Black gets also to play somewhere around "B" later.]
;B[om]
(;W[po]LB[on:C][oo:A][op:B]TR[pq]C[<tomjk> again a slow move. If you want to keep the stones connected 100%, you should try maybe a move at "A" instead. "B" is more ambitious or "C" to build up strength and attack the marked Black stone afterwards.]
;B[nq];W[hq]C[<tomjk> White must get out with his two stones ... else there is trouble (see variation):]

(;B[nn];W[no];B[mo];W[np];B[mp];W[on];B[nm]LB[op:A]C[Black can play first "A", so White looses one eye and Black is protected on the lower side.]
;W[qm];B[op];W[oo]
(;B[pp]LB[qp:A]C[<tomjk> if  Black plays "A" instead, then White is dead. See variation.]
;W[qp];B[qq]
(;W[rq]LB[rp:A]C[<tomjk> overplay. - must be at "A". See variation.]
;B[rp];W[qo]
(;B[rr]LB[ro:A]C[<tomjk> Black at "A" kills White or captures a big chunk of white's group. See variations.]
;W[ro];B[sq];W[rl];B[rk];W[rn]C[<tomjk> with a little bit help from Black, White manages to live ;-) Still not a good result for white:
1. Black gets nice profit on the bottom (12 pts)
2. Black gets an impressive wall to the outside (to be used on future attacks on white's groups)
3. Black has sente (it's his move now and should immediately attack the marked white stones with a move acound "A". Black will likely capture the marked stones or get nice territory on the top.

This shows why white's invasion at R7 was not timely (created too many weak groups for White.]
;B[sm];W[sl];B[sk];W[pl];B[ql];W[rm]
(;B[ol]LB[og:A]C[<tomjk> not necessary. Black should now attack with a move around "A". See variation.]
;W[kq]LB[of:B][mg:C][og:A]TR[md][qh][oi][qi]C[<tomjk> good! Ignored the small move from Black and played a big move. But maybe the most important move is now a move at "A" or "B" or "C" to help your marked stones.]
;B[pm]LB[og:A]TR[qh][oi][qi]SQ[md]C[That move seemed useless to me, so I thought I should play somewhere else on the board.

<tomjk> yes, you are right! Good thinking! With the last two moves, Black lost all the advantage he gained by attacking the white group and building his splendig outside wall. Black should use this wall to attack the marked white stones with a splitting attack at "A" ...]
;W[jo]C[<tomjk> White neglected too long his weak stones on the top. Sooner or later Black will notice and White will be  in trouble ...]
;B[mn]LB[mq:A]C[<tomjk> another wasted move ... since Black can connect here or at "A" in any case.]
;W[jm]LB[og:A]TR[qh][oi][qi]C[<tomjk> bot players continue to fail to see the importance of "A" ;-). But with this move White's marked stones are in a little bit less danger when coming under attack :)]
;B[gg]LB[og:A]C[<tomjk> Black attacks a group which is already fairly secure... again "A" looks better.]

(;W[fh]C[<tomjk> I would now settle the white group in the left top corner (See variation) and then strenghten the weak groups on the right side ...]
;B[mf]TR[pk][qk][rk][sk][ol][nm][om][mn][nn][mo][mp]C[<tomjk> finally Black starts to use his wall (marked stones).]
;W[le]C[<tomjk> White should maybe aim to live on the side (as in my previous variation, as there is a lot of space. This also would ruin a lot of Black's territory.]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[nd];W[lf];B[mg]TR[mc][md][le][lf][qh][oi][qi]
C[<tomjk> Now is evident that White has two weak groups against strong Black formations. White has a diffcult game ahead now. It is likely that White will loose one of these groups.]
;W[lg]LB[mi:A]C[<tomjk> White should maybe instead jump now at "A". If Black now at "A", the marked white stones look dead.]

(;B[kc]LB[mi:A]C[<tomjk> Black is too greedy. He wants to capture both groups. "A" would be better, then see how White wriggles ;-)]
;W[mh]C[<tomjk> Very good! White punishs Black for his omission and is back into the game.]
;B[me];W[ld];B[jj];W[ng]C[<tomjk> good.];B[ne];W[kh]C[<tomjk> White connects his two weak groups and is back in the game. Good play!]
;B[lj];W[li];B[nj];W[ni]
(;B[oj]LB[eb:B][nb:A][bf:C][bn:D][en:E][bp:F][cq:G]C[<tomjk> another unnecessary move. Big moves for Black are "A", "B", "C" , "D", "E",  "F" or "G". For "F" see a few variations.]
;W[hi]LB[eb:B][mb:A][rg:D][cq:C]TR[pk][qk][rk][sk][ol][nm][om]
[mn][nn][mo][mp]C[<tomjk> this is a huge success for White. Good play by White, who punishes the errors Black makes. Black has not used its wall at all (marked stones). But the game is still close.The last move maybe would have been better at one of the big points "A" through "D".]
;B[dp];W[dq];B[do];W[cp];B[eo];W[fp]C[<tomjk> good sequence for White. :)]
;B[cn];W[cq]LB[eb:D][lb:H][nb:A][jf:G][rg:C][ej:F][bn:E][lr:B]
C[<tomjk> yes, correct to connect here. Now the endgame starts.
Big moves are "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G" or "H".];B[fo]
;W[go]C[<tomjk> not sente (means Black needs not to respond). Better to take big moves which Black needs to respond.]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[lq];W[jq]LB[kr:A]C[<tomjk> better at "A".];B[ko]
C[<tomjk> too small (see list of big moves in a previous comment).]

(;W[fn]LB[bn:A]TR[go]C[<tomjk> better at "A" if you want to use the marked white stone.. See variation.]
;B[lr]TR[do][eo][fo][dp]C[<tomjk> wow!  Black shouldn't give up the frour marked stones ... Black was until now still ahead in the game ...]
;W[dn]C[<tomjk> good!];B[be];W[bd];B[ae];W[ad];B[bg]
(;W[cm]C[<tomjk> better atari from the other side (see variation)]
;B[bn];W[bm]C[Should have connected the stone with d7 instead of pushing with b7...
<tomjk> yes, or previously atari from the other side with B6.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[bl];W[el];B[dl];W[ik];B[em];W[fm];B[ek];W[fk]
C[<tomjk> White should simply connect at F8.];B[fl];W[gl];B[fj]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[hj];B[gi];W[gh];B[ec]LB[eb:A]C[<tomjk> this move should be at "A", so White is likely to respond. "B" is also much bigger than this 0 point move.]
;W[ej]C[<tomjk> good!];B[dj];W[ei];B[di];W[dh];B[ch];W[dg]C[<tomjk> good move. This connects all groups.]
;B[el]C[<tomjk> another wasted move. Lets count the score to see who is ahead.
White: upper left = 10; lower left and center = 42; lower right = 2; upper right = 2; prisoners = 4
White total = 60 points
Black: left side = 20; upper side = 14; right upper corner = 18; right lower corner = 16; center = 4
Black total = 72 points
Black leads by 12 points (not considering komi)];W[hg]C[<tomjk> very good move! Makes territory, attacks the black stone and connects all groups safely. This is the move that wins the game I would say :)]
;B[ee];W[de];B[ge]LB[nb:B][jf:A][rg:F][kl:E][bo:D][is:C]C[<tomjk> Black should play one of the big moves from "A" to "F" if he wants to win.]
;W[ie]C[<tomjk> good again. White has now clearly the upper hand.]
;B[id];W[je];B[hf];W[if];B[he];W[ih];B[nb];W[eb];B[fb];W[ea]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[fa];W[rg]C[<tomjk> great!];B[rf];W[pg]C[<tomjk> better at "A" - as we see from Black's next move. ;-)]
;B[lb]C[<tomjk> This is huge. Black is back in the game again.
Black about 75 points
White about 64 points (plus komi)];W[mb];B[ma];W[pf];B[pe];W[sf]
;B[se];W[sg];B[rd];W[rj]LB[kr:A][is:B]C[<tomjk> "A" is worth 6 points in reverse sente = 12 points. You move is 1 point gote.
Black can jump to "B" and can not be cut off (is called monkey jump).]
;B[qg];W[rh];B[qj];W[sj]
(;B[mj]LB[kl:A][is:B]C[<tomjk> this Black should be at "A" or "B". See variation.]
;W[kk];B[kj];W[ll];B[jk];W[jl];B[lm];W[ml];B[km];W[kl];B[mm]
;W[nk];B[ok]C[<tomjk> good sequence for White. Now White is winning. :)]

(;W[kn]LB[kr:A]C[<tomjk> White wins easily, playing now at "A" instead.]
;B[ln];W[jn];B[is]C[<tomjk> Black gets the last big point. Now the game is on the razors edge.]
;W[jr]C[<tomjk> correct response is here at "A". White does not need to sacrifice a stone.]
;B[js];W[ks];B[kr];W[hs];B[ir];W[hr];B[ls];W[iq];B[ks];W[bo]
C[<tomjk> good!];B[an];W[ao];B[am];W[ji];B[ij];W[ii];B[ki]C[<tomjk> zero point move...]
;W[mi];B[og]C[<tomjk> does not work. As the game is very close, this is likely the loosing move for Black.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[oh];B[oe];W[pi];B[kd];W[ke];B[fg];W[ff];B[gf]
;W[ef];B[ed];W[so];B[sp];W[bc];B[lc];W[tt];B[tt]C[<tomjk> this was sure an interesting game. To summarize:
Black gets right from the beginning a huge lead in territory and also strong groups, because White sets up several weak groups, which are an easy target for Black. Black fails to attack these weak groups efficiently and plays several "wasted moves" which allow White to come back into the game.
During the middle-game and end-game White plays superior to Black and eeks out a 0,5 win.]

It was a very interesting game, went a bit too fast maybe, should have taken more time for each move, but it was more exciting this way, I played more on feeling than on playing the correct moves.. and it turned out to be a great game with only a 0,5 moku difference..]
