RE[B+R]

C[I would like to get comments for the right side of the goban. Also, the late middle game comments. Thanks.

Basti: hi I've commented this game for you. Feel free to mail me any question you have about this review.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[qo];B[qm];W[oo];B[np]C[Basti: A bad choice. See variation at next move.]

(;W[lp]C[Basti: But white's move is also wrong...];B[no];W[pm]

(;B[qp]C[Basti: Black changed the order of moves here. See the variation for the correct order. I will try to find the way to exploit blacks mistake.]

(;W[qn]C[Basti: See the variation for my attempt to punish black.]
;B[ql];W[nn];B[mn];W[nm];B[lo];W[jp];B[pj]C[Basti: Black is quite happy to play on the right side. So white's choice to play M4 was probably questionable. Also black couldn't attack as much as in the game if white had a stone in the top right because the black R8 stones wouldn't be as strong then.]
;W[dd];B[ml];W[nl];B[mk];W[rp];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq]
(;W[op]C[Basti: I think there is a better way to live.];B[oq]
;W[pn];B[jd];W[dj];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[cn]C[Basti: This move should be at D6. C6 doesn't put as much pressure on black as D6 would and goes therefore against the original purpose of E3 to attack the black stones. If you're afraid of the 3-3-point invasion - black has no time for that because he has to defend his stones first.]
;B[hp];W[ko];B[mm];W[iq];B[hq];W[in];B[gn];W[mq];B[nq]
(;W[kq]C[Basti: Suddenly you play a gote move to defend this group. Originally you tried to to attack black but then you ended up defending your own stones so your moves where rather strange.]
;B[er];W[dr];B[gl];W[fm]C[Basti: This is an Aji-Keshi. You may want to peep from the other side at a later time.]
;B[gm];W[qf]C[Basti: If black plays R15 now white will face a tough battle. Playing R17 might be the better idea.]
;B[qh];W[qc]C[Basti: White is happy to enter the corner. Now he is better then if he had played R17 instead of R14.]

;B[id];W[hc];B[kb]C[Basti: The game seems about even now. I will calculate the value of some endgame-moves so you can see yourself how well you did. My numbers probably won't be perfect but should be close. (The endgame is certainly one of the most difficult parts of Go)]
;W[fr]C[Basti: Good. This is rather big and takes the aji at C3 away.]

;B[ah];W[aj];B[bf];W[ag];B[cj];W[bk];B[ff];W[nr]C[Basti: This is worth 6 points in gote.]
;B[or];W[mr];B[ib]C[Basti: This should be worth 10 points in gote...]
;W[hb];B[ja];W[ha]C[Basti: ...but here you should Tenuki. Because you play H19 blacks move was worth 7 points in sente. Sente moves are worth twice as much as gote moves so these 7 points in sente are as much as 14 points in gote. So one can say that you have lost 4 points.]

;W[fd];B[ih]C[Basti: Here the game is really over. After the loss of these 2 stones white is 10 points behind even if he makes live with s7 now.]

;W[ks];B[im];W[jj];B[rn];W[ro];B[rm];W[sd]C[Basti: Another bad endgame-move. Usually White could play T15,T14,T16,S14 in sente. If black just plays T15 now white has effectively lost 2 points.]

(;W[hm];B[gm];W[hk]C[Basti: For example this way you could keep up your attack however...]
