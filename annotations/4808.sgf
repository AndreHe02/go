C[HI reviewer, thanks in advanced for your review.
I'm played white here, oponnent strenght is around 7k on IGS and I'm 13k on IGS.
This games was played on OGS (turn server), my strenght in this server is 9,3k and my oponnent is 6,8k

Llywelyn: Interesting game.  Some general thoughts:

* W played very passively this game.  Whenever B moved, W answered.   This lets the opponent dictate the flow of the game.  Try to tenuki after *every* move.

* Play with more "fighting spirit."  This is what my friends and I describe as "rawr."  There sere several cases in the game where W could potentially have evened things up or gotten ahead, if she  had fought aggressively.

* There were several points that it looked like W was playing a move "because it is sente" but was really aji keshi.  It removed good potential that W might have wanted to use later, without giving W more than a few points in compensation. 


Avoid aji keshi, take sente, and play with more "rawr" and I think you'll go up  in strength very quickly.]

;B[po]C[Llywelyn: B is playing for a big framework.];W[hq]C[I wasn't sure about this move, maybe L3 could be better but not sure

Llywelyn: H3 feels premature.  It is the weak spot of that shape, and so is good to keep in mind, but if you are going to invade now L3 is the spot.]
;B[gq];W[kp]C[After my review I think this move is bad, waht do you think?]

;B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[eg];B[cg];W[ce]C[Maybe I should keep this move for later

Llywelyn: This is a classic example of aji keshi. It is sente, but it just removes a  threat that you may want to use later.]
;B[be]
(;W[qf]C[I thought about O17 but not sure what was the correct direction; If I had played O17 black could do a big moyo on the right side, and me a big moyo on the top side if the answer to O17 had been R14; but if black answer to O17 had been a pincer on M17 I wasn't sure about the next moves.

Llywelyn: While it is normally bad to extend from thickness, in this case the weakness of F17 makes it more appealing.  A play at R7 might also be a good idea.]
;B[nc]C[Llywelyn: This is just about a perfect check on W's thickness.]
;W[qi]LB[qm:A]C[Llywelyn: Too conservative.  I don't know that A is the "right move" but it shows the right spirit.]
;B[ql]C[Llywelyn: B's result from W's playing R14 is just about perfect.]
;W[rd]C[Llywelyn: This forces B to do something that he wants to do anyways, and gives him the choice on how to settle.]

(;B[qc];W[rc]C[Probably this is bad because looks a yose move, maybe O5 had been better, not sure

Llywelyn: Very small at this stage, and it forces B to make a move B wants to make anyways.]
;B[kc]C[Llywelyn: F17 is now threatening to "come to life" at any time.  It may be a good idea to secure that.]

(;W[ie]LB[id:B][cj:A]C[Llywelyn: this is a bit of an odd move.  If it is trying to secure F17, then J16 is the way to go.  C10 is also very big.]
;B[cj]C[Llywelyn: B gets the last big point of the opening.]
;W[of]C[Again a doubious move,M16 or D12 better moves growing my moyo

Llywelyn:  D12 would be a bit aji keshi.  B seems strong locally, and M16 starts a fight.  B may end up playing L16 in response, which could be interesting.   L15 is a simple way to build the moyo.]
;B[no];W[oq]TR[ke]C[Better Q2 I think now

Llywelyn: P3 is aji keshi again.   Q2 is possible, as is R3, but a play at L15 looks bigger to me.]

C[This invasion was a failure, Could I to invade here?


Llywelyn: It is sometimes possible to invade here, but W's earlier move at P3 and B's stone at O5 makes it difficult.]
