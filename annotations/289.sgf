C[Dear reviewer:
Thank's for your time.
I played black in this game and I win for 14 points.
I will like your comments for improve my strength.
I think my fuseki is ok and perhaps this is the key of game.
I don't know my strength but my opponent is about 9 kyu. (Really?, what do you think).

Thank's

[Denis\]
Indeed you made a better fuseki than white and you took the lead but in the middle game, you made some errors and white came back in the game.

I hope my comments will help you thought don't take them as the truth and only the truth because I'm only 4kyu]

;B[jp]C[This is Joseki.];W[po];B[pl];W[no];B[nq];W[lo];B[mp]
LB[lq:A]C[Stronger at A. With this move you have many weak points.]
;W[mo];B[pg]LB[mp:A][mo:B][lp:C][jd:D]C[I think that because of the exchange of A for B, you need to add a move to have a stronger position. a move at C is mandatory.

Otherwise, globally, 19 is not a bad move. What about D to extend on the upper side?]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[good];W[ne];B[gc]MA[lc]C[I understand that you are trying to make both the extension from the marked stone and an approach in the upper left corner, but I dont' think it is possible in this case because my feeling is that this move is too far away from the marked stone.]
;W[pb]C[OK];B[cf]LB[qc:A][le:B]C[You are going ahead of trouble. Your position is not very strong in the upper side so I think that this double pincer is doubtful. White should now press the stone 25 to get some influence to attack the upper side.

You should play at A to secure some points in the corner and avoiding white to make an easy base or at B to reinforce the upper side.]
;W[df]C[Good.];B[dg];W[ce]LB[ef:A]C[I think white should extend at A. He would have a better position to counter attack the upper side.]
;B[ef];W[ee]C[White is now in bad position. He should not play this KO.]
;B[cg];W[qc]C[Good];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[pe]MA[pd][qd]
LB[qf:A]C[Bad shape. Avoid making this kind of shape (37 and the 2 marked stones). Better shape at A]
;W[qm];B[ql]C[This exchange is very good for black.];W[rm];B[pm]
;W[pn];B[qp];W[kq]MA[mp]LB[lq:A]C[Good. Black should think a moment about the difference if the stone X had been played at A.]
;B[kp];W[lp];B[lq];W[kr];B[lr];W[ff]LB[hr:A]C[Strange. I think white should continue on the lower side and do something with the 2 stones he just played.  Something like A seems better.]
;B[de];W[fd];B[cd];W[cc]C[Not coherent. Must take back the KO.]
;B[be]C[[Joan\] I think my opponent don't played ok in the upper left corner.

[Denis\] Indeed. Black has now a strong position on the left but the upper side is still weak. White has not much.]
;W[bc];B[qo]LB[rl:A]C[It is more urgent to reinforce the upper side. Locally, A is bigger as it almost secure a lot of points on the right side and it is sente.]
;W[rl]C[White should connect. There is no point in playing this if black cut.]

(;B[qj]LB[qn:A]C[This is a very bad move. You MUST CUT at A. With the cut, you have a strong position on the lower right corner, and a good position on the right side. White has 2 weak groups.]
;W[qn]C[Of course. White is happy to connect now.];B[ck]C[The extention is correct but I still think it is more urgent to reinforce in the upper side.]
;W[fg]LB[ic:A][jc:B]C[Strange. White should invade the upper side now at A or B.]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[fc];W[dc];B[mm];W[ro];B[rp];W[jn];B[io];W[nm]

(;B[ml]LB[nl:A]C[Wrong.  Play at A, it is mandatory. I think this is your biggest mistake because, you will have some difficulty. With a move at A, the game would have been much more easier.

Starting from now, the game will be a big fight in the center.]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[nk]MA[mm][ml][mk]C[White has cut and you have one weak group to take care about (3 marked stones). This is a very bad result for black.]
;B[ng]LB[oh:A][rk:B]C[[Joan\] I think 77 is wrong, perhaps better in A?

[Denis\] Not really better. You cannot have everything. To protect the side, play at B.]
