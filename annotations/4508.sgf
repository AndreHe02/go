Dear reviewer, many thanks in advance!

In this game,I think that I was ahead, but I couldn't put it into profit.

N: Even though you won the game in the end, you missed several opportunities to end the game sooner.
I will put a N: in front of my comments so you can tell them apart from yours.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[cq];W[qp];B[jd];W[dj];B[pj]C[N: Interesting opening, a little unusual. I don't see those moves on the starpoints on the side very often. Can't say it's bad though, especially since you get that double wing formation.]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[bo]
(;B[cp];W[co]C[N: This is a bad exchange for B. B doesn't gain anything but W gets stronger. It's better to leave the potential weakness for later.]
;B[gq];W[go]
(;B[jq]C[N: I think that move is a little small. The group in the corner is perfeclty safe, so I'd rather play an approach move to the white stone in the corner.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[fq]C[N: I think it's safe to ignore that move, can't see anything really bad happening]

;B[kj];W[lh]C[Here I need a hint!]
(;B[kh]LB[mf:A]C[perhaps its been an overplay ....

The Aji  A  from white is not realy dangerous.

N: I don't think it was an overplay, there seem to be many ways to kill that white group, see the variations on the previous move for other killing moves.

There really isn't any aji at A, W does not have enough liberties and there is a snapback. (see variation)]

I look foreward to your opinion, many thanks, Erwin

N: You had the opportunity to kill that big white group in the center, as well as some other tactical mistakes which cost you many points. For example the one in the bottom right corner at the beginning or the one in the top middle.

But you played a good endgame and won by 4.5 points, so you can't really complain :)

I hope my review helped you, feel free to email me or talk to me on kgs if you have more questions.]
