AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, I have trouble in handicap games...
I think I ve lost this game in the yose so i f you can give me some advices.
Thx.

Helcio Alexandre: Hi there. You played very well the game. My comments goes with HA.]
;W[de];B[pj];W[fq];B[cn];W[np];B[pn];W[nc]C[k4 better ?
HA: O17 is big, but I would play k4 for sure. It has nice  follow-ups in Q8 R3 as O4 get stronger.]
;B[lc]
(;W[qf]C[HA: I would play K17, or just R17. The result of R17, as you know, it's better than what you got in the game.]
;B[nd];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
;B[od];W[mc]C[HA: I would just play O18. Playing on second line so early is not a good thing.]
;B[md];W[lb];B[kc]C[What a big wall... ^_^];W[ql];B[qm];W[pl]
;B[rm];W[qo]C[HA: This seems to only help black. You lose a lot here. I would consider O8, or O7.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[oo];W[pm];B[op];W[rf];B[se];W[qi]C[HA: This move is usually bad and here is no exception. It again hurts you.]
;B[qj];W[pi];B[oj];W[nh]C[HA: This is nice];B[lh]C[HA: But black plays well here and his next move.]
;W[mi];B[mk]C[HA: This keima looks like a textbook move. Very good.]

;W[qk];B[rj];W[ri];B[on];W[dr]C[HA: The game is difficult for white. You played very well from here.]
;B[cq];W[ip]LB[iq:A]C[HA: Don't play this move if you make WD2 - BC3 exchange. Playing the joseki move at A is correct.]
;B[sg];W[sk];B[sm];W[si];B[sj];W[sf];B[dc];W[cc];B[dd]C[Ha: Shape mistake by black. Thank you!]
;W[cd];B[fd];W[ee];B[fc];W[ck]C[too far ? or a good move ?

HA: I would play C8! The point is that it is sente against Black group.]
;B[cr];W[dh];B[kq]C[HA: Now you see the problem with J4. White needs another move.]

;W[ll];B[kl];W[jh];B[km];W[kn];B[ji];W[kh];B[ki];W[jf]C[HA: Nice shape and spliting attack.]
;B[lg];W[kf];B[mf];W[mg];B[ih]
(;W[ig]C[HA: This should be H14. Here you are pushing from behind. This will give you problems later.]
;B[hh];W[hg];B[gh];W[gg];B[fh];W[ik]C[HA: The shape move is at J10.]
;B[ij];W[hk];B[fg];W[ge];B[fe];W[hc]C[HA: This starts a fight. In the end, you miss a killer move in the end of the fight.]
;B[gf];W[he];B[hf]C[HA: As black, I would start to think about the life of P16 stones.]
;W[if];B[ff];W[nf];B[me];W[jd];B[jc];W[ic];B[kb];W[mb];B[ib]
;W[hb];B[ia];W[kd];B[ld];W[kg];B[cb];W[bb];B[db];W[cf]C[I' m not sure that this move was necessary...

HA: It is necessary, but it is very small. H19 would be bigger.]
;B[ha]C[HA: Black lives :(];W[bm];B[bn];W[cm];B[fk];W[dn];B[do]
;W[an];B[en];W[bo]C[HA: This seems to be the final mistake. A Ponnuki is worth 30 points (here, it gives black the lead). After this, you lost very few points in yose mistakes, but not enough to justify the 6.5 point loss.]

HA: Welcome.
I must say that I do too have trouble giving handicap stones, but that's perhaps they are called handicap :) You lost the game on the very end, as I pointed out in the game. It was a quite big mistake and there wasn't too much to do after that, although you won a couple of points, it wasn't enough. Also, black was quite thick in the endgame which made it even harder for you. But you missed some winning chances before that point and played many bad moves early on that destroyed your pottencial at lower right conner. My final words are: try to play with more pacience and flexibility against handicap stones. It's important to leave things open and to build secure position early  on the game, so that you can fight later.]

(;W[ef]C[HA: Here you lost a point.]))
(;W[hf]C[HA: Here seems more interesting. J17 will be shape and an attacking move. And later, White can aim at J10 at the right time.]
