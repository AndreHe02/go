C[Hi--I'm Blake, somewhere in the 30-25k range, and playing white.  This is a rated game on KGS, but it's friendly, and I've edited out most of the extraneous kibitzing we did during the match.

D--Hi, I'm Darrell.  I hear you've been waiting a long time for this review, so I'll get right to it.  If you want to ask me any follow questions, feel free.

I turn move numbers on while reviewing.  Then I can refer to stones by move number from time to time.]
;B[pc];W[dd];B[dq];W[pq];B[qe]C[Blake [?\]: diagonals eh];W[gd]
C[Daedalus [26k\]: there's a name for it..can't remember what it is]
;B[co];W[cj];B[po];W[np]TR[nq]SQ[qn]C[B -- I was hoping to use my influence at the upper left, and strengthen it, with this move.  It didn't exactly work as i had planned...  would a move at the marked areas have been better?

D--No, your move is perfectly fine.  Perhaps it's the intended use that is at fault.  The move at 10 starts mapping territory out along the bottom.  The fact that your first move is on the 3rd line from the bottom makes it territorial along the bottom, rather than effective at using the influence at the top right.  But, to repeat, there is nothing at all wrong with 10.]
;B[pj]C[Black 9 and 11 are widely separated.];W[om]LB[jq:a]
[lc:b][kc:c][pm:d]C[Your move here basically forces black to take territory on the 4th line and fix his weakness.  Unwise.    Better would be any of a,b or c.  I like 'a' best.  After you get a little stronger along the bottom, you can pick a fight with a move like 'd']
;B[pm];W[on];B[pn];W[oo];B[pp];W[pl];B[ql];W[pk];B[qk]C[Black gets an awful lot out of this exchange.]

(;W[nl]LB[oj:C][ok:B][ol:A][hq:a]C[B -- I think this was a mistake.  I wanted to prevent a cut at A.  Would playing at A have been better? Or C (C would have given me a guaranteed Atari if he had played at either A or B)

It's a difficult question mainly because you've gotten into a bad situation and no move is very good at fixing it.  I would have just ignored the cut at this point and moves around 'd'  Then if white cuts, sacrifice the two stones.  See variation 2.]
;B[ok]C[And playing O8 allowed this...

Yes, but really, black is only threatening to take two stones that have no purpose.  Ignore it.  You would LOVE to see black use two entire moves to capture a mere 2 stones.]
;W[ol]C[Which cost me size.];B[nj];W[kq]LB[gq:A][hq:B]C[Was this too timid?  I think playing at either A or B might have been better.  What are the advantages of them, if any?
CGoban's "Score Estimation" feature says that this would have put the score at W+55.5 rather than W+28.5 at this point, though I'm not sure how accurate this feature is.

D-- I agree.  You have built a wall at great expense.  You must make a good extension from it and try to make a profit.  I like 'b' best.]
;B[hq]C[And, of course, letting black make this perfect extension from his corner enclosure is very painful.]
;W[ir]LB[kc:a][ho:b]C[It is much too early in the game to be plaing along the second line.

'a' is huge.  'b' I like as it flattens black.];B[hr];W[is]
C[Much too early to play on edge.  There are so many big empty spaces around the board worth much more than one or two points.]
;B[hs];W[iq];B[hp];W[ip];B[hn];W[jo]TR[np][kq]C[Enh.  here my fate in the lower left is pretty much decided.  I wanted to strengthen the connection between my left and right groups, but I think the marked stones did it already.

D--Correct.];B[ce];W[cd]C[This area was one of my biggest mistakes..

Before we look at specifics, let me say that if you believe you should kill 37, that is your primary error.  Black should live.  White should get profit by chasing black, but to expect to kill is folly.]
;B[be]LB[cg:a]C[I would move at 'a' next as white.  You strengthen 8, and take away black's best extension.]
;W[bd];B[de];W[ee]C[Good];B[dh]TR[hn][hp][hq][hr][hs][co]C[Now 8 is getting pressured.  With black's very strong marked stones, 8 is limited in where it can go easily.]
;W[ej];B[ef];W[fe];B[ff];W[df]TR[dh]C[My attack here was very badly done.  I was trying to cut, but his marked stone destroyed any chances I had--and I was very strong here before.  Disappointing, to say the least.

C[Daedalus [26k\]: :)
Blake [?\]: at this moment i could stab you in the eye and feel no remorse

B-- just a little in-game love.  really.

D--laugh.];W[fo]C[Daedalus [26k\]: lol];B[fn];W[hl];B[il];W[hk]
;B[ik];W[im]C[Daedalus [26k\]: damn..good eye

B-- Ironically, I don't know what he is talking about here.

D--102 is a good move.

If you think variation 2 is good for black, look again.]
(;B[ij]TR[jl]C[I think this was wasted on B's part, as the  K8 was pretty obvious.  (Variation on previous move)

D--agreed, but it also didn't really cost him anything since you had to answer it.]
;W[jl];B[kd];W[jd]C[Daedalus [26k\]: and don't even think avout J5

B-- hm.  J5 seems reasonably useless to me.  it puts H6 group into atari, but that's easily fixed--many times over--by B G6.  it connects my J7 cutting stone , but K7 would do that as well.]
;B[je];W[ie];B[if]CR[mc][ke][jf][kh][ni]C[Wow.  Impossible to defend that many cuts.]

(;W[ig]TR[mc][ld]C[Daedalus [26k\]: perty, ain't it?

B--He had 2 vulnerable-seeming cutting points here, but I was unable to exploit them...

D--you are correct.  The variation here is one way.  In a couple moves, I'll show you another possiblity.]
;B[jg]C[See variations];W[hf];B[jf]C[Ok, here's another chance to punch a whole in black:]

(;W[kc]C[You force him to fix his problems.  And this move does nothing good for you  (no territory expansion, no protecting a weak group).  Forcing moves are only worth making if they help you!!]
;B[md]C[Daedalus [26k\]: nope];W[ke]C[B--At this point my chances in the upper right were dead, i think.

I should have read the board better).]

;B[fk];W[jj]LB[ma:a][di:b][bh:c]C[A waste.  K10 would have been an auto-atari for him.

D--true.  Not a whole lot left to do.  'a', 'b' are best.  Then something like 'c'.]

If you got this far--thanks for reviewing the game :)

D--you're welcome.  Feel free to ask any followup questions.]
