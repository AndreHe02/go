RE[B+4.50]

C[Dear reviewer,

I played this game as White, currently 7k on KGS. I lost the game, it was a pretty close one.

In the middle I had a big problem with the black moyo, I would appreciate any advice how to handle
this kind of position better.

Thank you very much in advance!

 Peter

kobayashi: I hope my comments will help you play a little bit better.

Since I am 4k* on IGS, although that is consequence of many games played late in the night when I was too tired, I will try to give you some advice on how to become stronger kyu, not dan immediately (although fot that it is better to ask someone who is at least 1dan on IGS), since shortcuts in Go are full of pitfalls. Once you fall into one of them, you get stuck for years with no advance. You can advance very fast if you have some very strong and experienced player for your teacher.

Now, let's go back to the game...

About the game: The problem wasn't the way you invaded your opponent's moyo, but the way you played in the center. You both ignored it for a long time, and when you started to play there, you didn't make any points and you could. Also you gave away 2 stones for free in the endgame and that is what made you lose. Black missed so many valuable moves and you should use that fact, but you missed most of chances.
    I suppose that this game was played very fast or you both were so afraid of making mistakes that you couldn't think at certain moments.
    My teacher would say that we are not fighting against our opponent during the game, but against our bad habbits and shortcomings like fear, anger, thoughtlessness, chipping stones etc.]
;B[dp]C[kobayashi:
    A tip: My teacher says that it is polite to play in the upper-right corner, since in a real game that corner is the closest one to the opponent's heart.
    Although on a computer it doesn't matter, some players from East Asia might understund this move as an act of disrespect (as many may do in a real game), so it is much safer to play in the U-R corner.]
;W[cd]LB[pd:A]C[kobayashi: I can't be sure if this is wrong move here, but as Black now I'd play Q16 ('A') and then after White plays in the L-R corner, the situation would seem to be a little favouring for Black since komi is just 0.5]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[jp];W[cn]C[kobayashi: This position happend in some pro games, so it is O.K., but it is very easy to make a mistake in positions like this one  which may cost you the game.]
;B[cl]LB[ed:A][fp:B]C[Peter: To be expected, I think.

kobayashi: Well yes, but 'A' and 'B' are also good points. When playing on Internet, many players like to cause headache to their opponents by chasing their groups or making sever attacks, hoping they will answer without much thinking. In such situations you can't see everything, and pure luck or well developed sense for a good move decides.]
;W[cq]LB[dq:A][cp:B]C[kobayashi: After this move you might have been expecting Black 'B', but...]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[do]C[kobayashi: Here you (White) have made crucial mistake, you got completely surrounded by Black. See next move for explanation.]

(;W[bn]LB[cr:A][ci:D][er:B][co:C]C[kobayashi: If you have played 'A' instead, it would be completely different position. You would be able to cut off the black stone on the left and force Black to answer at 'D' or somewhere around, while your group gets out towards the center, or...

    ...If Black tries to connect his stones, you still have 'B' for later, to make some damage to Black's moyo.

    This is VERY IMPORTANT for you to understand, because after playing at 'A', if Black tries 'C', you can block at B5 and Black can't play where you just have played (see Var.). That way your stones are much more efficient and your potential in this part of the board is much greater. In the real game you got completely surrounded here, and that is one of the causes you had troubles with Black's moyo.]
;B[em]LB[ic:A][id:B]C[kobayashi: Now, I'd like you to keep one thing in mind: In the game of Go it is not the main goal to take the opponent's corner or destroy his moyo or protect your one. The main goal is to have more points than your opponent, and everything else is just a sort of means to achieve that.

    You maybe have 10 points in the corner, but you also helped Black to make between 20 and 30 secured points around G3. Now Black's moyo makes you panic.

    But, you can try to make your moyo by playing 'A' or 'B' or better, play somewhere on the right side. Anyway, I think that it is not very easy to make the game equal now if Black plays right moves.

    Maybe a good idea is to try to secure as much territory as it is possible, with significant influence to the center, and then play R3. After that, if you can keep sente, try to invade Black's moyo from the center, not by directly playing at the bottom.]
;W[ec]LB[kc:A][nc:B]C[Peter: I did not want to let black get the approach here, and develop on the top side.
But maybe this is a bit slow, I don't know.

kobayashi: It secures the corner, but Black can play 'A' or 'B' now if he wants to develop on the top, and the right side is maybe even better since you can't secure the whole top with one move. You have also to bear in mind that Black R17 is possible at any moment  if suitable for him, so you have to think how to compensate that.

    Here you have the problem of Black's possible play at Q10 and K10 wanting you to invade so he can make strong groups before attacking your top.

    Note: Of course, Black will not play R16 in the next few moves, but if you invade at R3 later, Black can compensate that by playing at R17, and vice-versa.]
;B[qj]C[kobayashi: This could be expected, because now Black has the left side if you play on the top and vice-versa. Of course, you will chose the top since it is bigger, but Black's moyo is growing so you will have to do something before it will be too late.]
;W[jd]C[kobyashi: Maybe it seems O.K. to play here, but I feel it is more natural to play closer to your weaker group, and it is the stone in the U-R corner. The only question is where exactly.]
;B[ch];W[nq]C[Peter: Black is building an impressive moyo, I feel the urge to invade.

Is this point okay? The following sequence was to be expected.
Would R3 be a better alternative? But then black will probably block at Q3 and build an
impressive wall facing the bottom.


kobayashi: Yes, I would feel the same, but it seems that any invasion favours Black who has very strong lower left side. The problem is that no matter where and how you invade, Black will secure large territory and then attack your top, which is easy, because Black can escape in any direction and connect to his other groups.
    But the group you make in the Black's moyo can hardly escape anywhere, and living there is even harder. Your only hope is that Black won't play the best equence. Now you see that white stone at C2 would be of great help to invading Black's moyo. If Black played around K10 instead on the left, his moyo would be not just impressive, but terrifying.]
;B[oq]C[kobayashi: This may be usual answer, but in this situation it helps White to succeed in his intentions, to escape by using weaknesses Black created with this move. Playing one point closer to the edge of the board would be much useful, although not much popular. The idea is to let White escape, but make him pay for that.]
;W[np];B[pn];W[lp];B[kq]C[kobayashi: Looks too slow];W[mm];B[km]
LB[kl:A][ll:B]C[kobayashi: could be at 'A' or 'B', this way White gets out easily. But anyway, Black should tenuki at the right moment and play in the top right or around K11: let say that White can have 70 points on the top ( whole four lines), then Black has the same number of points around H6 (6x11). Plus Black has the right side, and some on the left, while White's lower left corner is just a few points. It is easy to see that White is far behind in this position.]
;W[ol];B[pl]LB[ql:A]C[kobayashi: I personally would prefer 'A', since it doesn't leave so much weaknesses as this move.]
;W[mk];B[ok]C[kobayashi: L10 would be more valuable - attack and defend (territory).]
;W[qq];B[or];W[qo]
(;B[po]C[kobayashi: This is safe, but White can try to live now, see var.]
;W[qn];B[qm];W[qp];B[rm];W[rn];B[rs];W[rr];B[qs];W[ps];B[pr]
;W[qr];B[os];W[rp]C[Peter: Phew, alive. Lucky.


kobayashi: Yes, but you are still behind since you just took away some points from Black, but you earned just a few. If Black plays around L10 or K10 now, what would you do? Plus, there is invasion at R17. Your only hope is to be lucky a few more times :)]
;B[so]C[kobayashi: This should have been left for later.];W[sn]
;B[sq];W[sr];B[sp]C[kobayashi: If Black have lost, this would be the losing move. This makes only 6 points difference, and Black could return here at any time, since White would have to play on bigger points rather than protecting mere 6 points here.
    Now it is ideal to play elsewhere, like around L10, and After White escapes, R14 would be more than enough to maintain lead.]
;W[kl];B[jm];W[qg]C[kobayashi: Looks nice, although there are some weaknesses. You are probably counting that Black will invade the top so you can get more points in the corner by attacking him, like in the game.
    Invading at R17 looks too small now, but Black can attack the top in a such way that your lower group gets in danger, so you should be carefull.]
;B[nc];W[pc]C[kobayashi: You could play one point to the left.]
;B[kc];W[jc];B[kd];W[ke]C[kobayashi: This move just creates weaknesses in your position, you should play straight although Black gets out easier then, because you would have stronger group to try to make some territory around G13 later.]
;B[kb];W[ne]C[kobayashi: You don't get much with this move, since Black can play either Q18 or M15. Beware of the Black cut at K15.]
;B[jb];W[hc];B[le];W[lf]C[kobayashi: You can't kill this group, and you cant make any territory with so many cutting points. It is said that beginners play diagonally and Masters play straight. After L14 you can look for some territory in the center, but now it is very hard to make any if Black knows how to attack.]
;B[kf];W[je];B[mf];W[lg];B[me];W[mh]C[kobayashi: You save your lower group, but you could do it more efficiently, like to play a little bit to the left and try to make some territory there.]
;B[oh]C[kobayashi: This is almost the same as 'pass', because a move at K10 or J10 or J12  or J13 or anywhere around would be decisive and White could safely resign after a few moves. So you are still lucky :)]
;W[ng]C[kobayashi: This is terrible, now you have played pass-like move. Isn't the center more interesting, since Black is already alive on the top, if you can see. This is really the losing move if Black plays around the center now.]
;B[nf]C[kobayashi: You still lucky :)];W[og]C[kobayashi: But still continue to play 'pass'...]
;B[ph]C[kobayashi: ...just like Black does. I wonder, who will turn to the center first?]
;W[pg];B[qh];W[nd]C[kobayashi: Again the losing move. The last 10 moves seem like were played by absolute beginners. In situations like this, my teacher would annoy me for hours to say what I was thinking of when I played so terrible. The same thing I would ask you, just think about the ideas of all these moves. You behave like the cutting stone at L14 has 100 liberties, like it can't be captured. You are alive in the corner, and you can easily connect your lower group to the top-left and even get some points in the center, so this sequence is undoubtfully responsible for your loss, and it would be for Black's too if he had been the one who lost.]
;B[md];W[oc];B[nb];W[iq]C[Peter: Now as my N9 group more or less seems connected, I feel I should at least
try something on the bottom.

Here I would appreciate some advice about alternative moves. My attempt here failed
miserably.


kobayashi: As I already said, it could get connected to the top-left with much more profit for you, and it is still not late. Why doing anything to the bottom? What is about the center?
    If you were so lucky that Black didn't play there, you could now try to play around G12 or anywhere in the center rather than where you have played, since Black has a weakness at C10-D10 to be used in a possible fight. This way, you just helped Black to get stronger in the center.]
;B[jq];W[hn];B[hl];W[gl];B[gk];W[hm]LB[hk:A][gj:B]C[kobayashi: Now you could play at 'A' and then 'B', and enclose some territory.]
;B[il];W[jo];B[ko];W[dn];B[en];W[fo];B[eo]C[Peter: This white group looks quite dead.


kobayashi: Yes it does, but now you can't make so much in the center as before. You only acheived to make Black stronger in the center. So, if you really want to get stronger, don't try things like this. Maybe sometimes it will work, but most time will not and you'll lose.]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[cm];B[dl];W[cr];B[dr];W[ak];B[aj];W[al];B[cj]
;W[cf]C[kobayashi: This is too small comapring to the center]
;B[eg]C[kobayashi: See, you are helping Black.];W[nk]C[kobayashi: Isn't the center bigger?]
;B[oj]C[kobayashi: not much different than pass if White knows it is time to play in the center now.]
;W[om];B[pm];W[rg]C[kobayashi: PEOPLE!!!!! The CENTER counts too!]
;B[rh]C[kobayashi: Black wants to lose, and he offers you chance to win in the last 40 moves, and you didn't use it.]
;W[bi]C[kobayashi: Please, play in the center!];B[bj]
(;W[bg]C[kobayashi: Why not one point lower? See var.
    But it would be also bad, better to look at the center, how about H12?]
;B[bh];W[gj]C[kobayashi: If you hope to scare Black and make him answer unproperly, and then use this stone to get something in the center, it is OK.]
;B[fk];W[gg]C[kobayashi: At last, but wrong. With this move you won't get much points in the center, but something is better than nothing, right?]
;B[ii];W[di];B[ci];W[dg];B[dh];W[ef];B[fg];W[ff];B[of]C[kobayashi: This move is also like pass. White should continue in the center.]

(;W[pe]LB[gh:A][jh:B]C[kobayashi: How about 'A' or 'B'? See var.]
;B[jg];W[gh];B[eh]
(;W[ig]LB[jh:A]C[kobayashi: This is the last move that seriously contributed to White's loss. 'A' is decisive, see var.]
;B[jh];W[li]LB[jf:A]C[kobayashi: If you have played 'A', you might have won the game if Black would have made some mistakes later, as in the real game.]
;B[if]C[kobayashi: In this position White loses by a big margin. It is only thanks to Black's imprudent moves that White made the game close.]
;W[jf];B[hg];W[ie];B[hf];W[he];B[kg]C[Peter: Lucky me. Black could have played G14, if I read it correct.
I think, Black G14, White resigns.


kobayashi: Yes, but if this didn't happen, I mean if you played properly the last few moves, you could resign either.]

;W[ll];B[ns];W[mp];B[kj];W[nj];B[ps];C[Peter: Black wins with 4.5 points.

Thanks again for taking your time to review this game.


kobayashi: You welcome. Let mi give you just one piece of advice. Count points in yose (you should do it even earlier) very carefully, and always play on the biggest point first. Black has made so many mistakes in the game that it is real miracle he won. One of the main reasons you've lost is that you haven't made any points around H13, and you could have.
    I couldn't comment every move in the endgame, but you should look this game carefully a few times. You should try different varaiations in the endgame and check the result if you can't count points. If you keep this in mind, you won't have a headache because you lost a game by half point as it happened to me two times :)


Final comment: If you observe this position, you can see that Black's moyo isn't that big as it looked like in the opening, but you don't have any points in the center!!!!!! You could make those 5 points there, and if Black would make the same mistakes, you would win by 0.5 and you'd be happy and proudly refer to yourself as moyo-destroyer.]
