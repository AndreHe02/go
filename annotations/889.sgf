AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[I need strategic help on how to go about playing handicap matches. I made several silly mistakes which cost me a lot of territory; my main problem is fuseki.

Hello, my name is Aaron.  I am somewhere between 1d-5kyu depending on who you ask.
There is a lot written about how to play handicap
games as black, but not so much about white,
so all coments are my own invention, and are of
course subject to error :).

In general, when playing white in handicap games I think your main objective is to play flexibly.  In the beginning do not invest too many
moves in one area.  Another key theme is to attempt to keep the black stones separated, while of course trying to keep yours together.
This is of course often easier said than done.];W[qj]LB[qf:a]
C["a" is the more usual first move in handicap games.  One reason for this could be that the
corners are the easiest place to make life and
territory, so if black takes the corner you can
settle your stone and then move on.

Your move is not necessarily wrong, but I think
if you play here it is better on the side star point.
Black can try to use your low move to build
center territory.];B[pj]C[This type of contact move should be bad for black, since it will only make you strengthen
yourself.];W[qm]LB[pi:a][pk:b][qi:c][qk:d]C[I'm not sure how I would have played, but a  hane on a or b, or extending to c or d might  settle you better.]
;B[pm];W[pl];B[ol];W[pk];B[ok];W[pi];B[oj]C[Black is getting power in the center.
White has a little territory on the side];W[pg]LB[qh:a]C[I might do "a" and then switch to another part
of the board.];B[pf];W[ng];B[og];W[oh];B[of];W[qg];B[qf];W[ni]
;B[rg];W[rh];B[qh];W[ph];B[sh];W[ri];B[sf];W[si]MA[jd][dj][jp]
[om]TR[cf][cn][fq][nq]C[This move is very small, without it your group
has one eye and can easily get another.   You should probably approach one of the corners with one of the triangled moves, though
honestly i do not know which is best.

Black should ignore this move and make a big move, one of the X spots for example.]
;B[sg];W[lf]C[I think you should approach one of the
star point stones here.];B[ld];W[jc]LB[lk:A]C[I played here to prevent black from taking too much of the upper board but considered A as a possible alternative.

Moves 29 and 31 are not doing much work.
I.E. settling your own stones, making territory, or
threatening black stones.

It might be better to try and start a group in a  more wide open area.]
;B[jd];W[hc];B[kc];W[jb];B[kb];W[he]LB[id:a]C[I think "a" is more normal to make the proper shape here]
;B[me];W[nc];B[nd];W[oc];B[pc];W[jf]LB[lk:A][om:a]C[My aim here was to connect my stones in the upper-centre with the stones in the centre-right. It was my intention to play A next.

In regards to your comments at the end of the game:

I think black is at least an even position here.
They have 30 points in the upper right while
white has 10 points at the most.

You do have some influence in center, but your
group on the bottom is only loosely connected to the main group.

"A" might be a decent point to aim at.. this lightly
threatens the stone in the center and the cut at "b", but unfortunately it is black's move.]
;B[mj];W[jq];B[dj];W[ci]LB[df:a][dg:b]C["a" or "b" might be more flexible here.]

(;W[cg]TR[ee]C[Would a play at E15 have been better? This group was subsequently locked in to the side.

White is in a tough spot here, its hard to say.

SQ[bd][cd][de][cf][dg][cg][dh][bg][bh]C[75 is not a good idea. Black is thick above.
There is no room for white to extend and  running into the center does not look very promising either.

The marked white stones need one more move for life.. black can either attack them directly or  protect the cut at "a", then attack 75 or kill the stones.]

;B[en];W[fk];B[ek];W[fl];B[bo];W[co];B[cp];W[bn];B[ap]LB[ck:A]
TR[cl][cm][dm][bn][cn][co]C[At this point, I ran out of ideas for my endangered group and decided to abandon them in accordance with the saying 'Four die but six live on the third line'.  An extension at A would have made five, which is fuzzy but plausible, but I assumed that black would then play B9 and I would eventually be hemmed in. Could I have saved these?

There is definitely not enough space for two eyes, there is a small chance that you could catch black between your two white groups, but this depends on a few "ifs" that happen in the center.  Your decision to abandon these was correct. Black even spends a couple of moves to "make sure" they are dead, so this is good for you.    The move at "A" is gote death! see variation.

The main problem here was the invasion at 75 in the first place..]

;W[gq];B[gp];W[hp];B[fr];W[fo];B[ep];W[gr];B[es];W[gs]MA[om]
C[This move (113) is small.

Now is a good time to take a count.

Black has about 30 points in the upper right
                 about 35 at the bottom and left
              at least   5 at the top                          =  70 + potential 30 if he kills w

White has about 10 points at the right
                 about 20 everywhere else
                        = 30

At this point, even if you take a bulk of the remaining points in the center and on the bottom side, (which you end up doing actually...) black will be comfortably ahead.   This calls for drastic measures starting with a
cut at X, hoping that you can either get a large  kill in the center or corner.]

;B[mg];W[nf]LB[jh:a]C[This move is not good.

Black connects and now your center stones are
in slight trouble.  Whats worse is this stone ends up being captured!

To look after the center something like "a" might be better.]

;B[pr];W[qs];B[pr];W[ps];B[km];W[kn];B[je];C[Overall, I feel that I squandered the oppurtunities I had crafted at the start. It was obvious that black had some strategic blind spots which I took advantage of in the beginning to spill out from the right into the centre. However, my OWN strategic blind spots meant that I ended up defending limited territory, playing defensively whilst behind in score. Thus, my immediate needs seem to be:

- Better Fuseki (I'm generally lost on how to open in handicap games, the advantage I got in this was a lucky exploitation of my opponent's weakness)

- Confidence in aggression/assertion. I got myself into a potentially influential position by around move 42, but failed to use this position to apply adequate pressure.

- Better invasion technique. My confidence is lacking in this area because I'm not sure on how to go about dramatic invasions.

Look for the most open territory, then be sure you can live or get away in the center

All advice gratefully received :-)

You lost... but don't be discouraged.  I think 5 stones was too large of a handicap for black's
strength.    Most of the mistakes you made will be corrected simply through experience.    I think that there are three things that you can
do to help in general:

1.  Study life and death.        "Life and Death" by James davies was
     good for me, but perhaps there are others.

2.  Try to keep your stones connected and
     your opponents stones separated.

3.  Corners, side, then center.  Just be sure
     to remember that there is no ALWAYS in
    go, and sometimes a 'bad' move can be
    right.

I hope this helps you and you continue playing
and studying go.  Best of luck.
