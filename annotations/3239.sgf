C[Hello,

Lately I've played several games that I lost and I don't know why. This is one of them. I don't see obvious mistakes here and I'm wondering if the problem is in the strategy, rather than individual moves.

I'm playing as black.
Thank you for all your comments!

G : Hi. My comments will start by this G. Global comments at the end of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[po];B[np]SQ[fq]LB[mq:A]C[I don't play this often but I thought that I could create a moyo down there.

G: so far it's ok. This extension is the right idea to work with the square stone. A move at A would be too low.]
;W[lq]C[Well, white didn't like the idea. His stones seem separate now, right?

G : White is being a little reckless so soon in the game. He is indeed separated. Your stones are quite strong, so you should be able to  attack on of the two stones.]
;B[jq];W[lo];B[pm]LB[nn:A][no:B]C[White's position doesn't look very good now, I think.

G : In this position, I would prefer to play at A. It really keeps white separated.
Now if white plays B, maybe he can connect. Maybe not, but he would be able to at least build power. If white plays B, the black last stone will start to feel lonely, and could become a target.]
;W[qm];B[ql];W[rm];B[rl];W[pn];B[om]SQ[pd]C[Ok?

G : yes. Working well with the marked stone, and it starts closing white in.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[rq];W[qp];B[oq];W[rp]
(;B[mq]SQ[lo][lq]LB[nn:A]C[G : I'd rather play simple and connect at A. It still puts a lot of pressure on white's marked stones without helping him. The white right group would be closed in, with white having to add a move to live.
See variation.];W[mp]
(;B[no]C[G : see variation];W[rr];B[qs]C[G : this is a gote endgame move. White is already alive, so it's not useful. Save it for later.]
;W[mr];B[nq];W[nn];B[mo];W[lp]
(;B[mn]C[G : I think it would be a good idea to connect your groups here. See variation.]
;W[nm]
(;B[ln]C[G : Bad direction if you ask me. You're pushing white out in the open.]
;W[jo];B[kn];W[jp];B[iq];W[on]CR[jp]TR[pd]SQ[nn][nm]MA[kn][ln]
LB[jq:A]C[G : I would not be happy at all with the result. The marked white stones are now connected and poked their head in what could have been your moyo thanks to the triangle stone. The cross marked black stones are wrong, in my opinion. The first, as i said, pushes white in the wrong direction. The second induces white's circle which forces you to answer with A 
So you push white in the wrong direction AND end in gote, which allows white to connect.
As a bonus, I can tell you that the black group (with the crooss marked stones) is attackable, since it does not have two eyes yet.
From this point of view, I think you will agree that it is somewhat not successful.

See previous comments for (i hope) better sequences.];B[pj]
LB[pl:A][ok:B]C[G : weird move. Wanted to protect against the  cut at A? A move at B would be better then. See variation for a punishment.]

(;W[qf]
(;B[qh]C[G : It's the right idea to attack this stone, but maybe from the other side. Black looks a bit overconcentrated.]
;W[rd];B[nc]LB[qc:A]C[G : arg! You're offering the A spot to white so he can live easily... You should play at A yourself.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[G : now you're overconcentrated and white is comfortable.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[jc]SQ[nc][ob][pc][pd]LB[ho:A]C[Maybe I should have played a smaller extension, white cuts later on.

G : No, it's not too far. I even thought it was too close, since you have 4 very powerful marked stones
Basically, you don't even need to extend here for the safety of your stones. So your extension is territory oriented only. I don't like these sort of moves.
The lower white group is attackable. A move at A would be good I think.]
;W[hc];B[cn];W[fp];B[gp];W[eq];B[fo]C[G : good move.];W[ep]
;B[gq];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp]
(;B[cm]LB[ck:A]C[G : playing at A is better and also protects the cut (see variation).]
;W[in]TR[jo][jp][lo][lp][mp][lq][mr]SQ[fo][gp][gq]C[G : ok, now here is a very important point of strategy. In the sequence we just saw, you first played the square stones, which were very good. Why? Because they create power which can scare the triangle white group : if he gets surronded, he'll be in trouble.
So now you must absolutely seprate the two white groups, and keep this one weak.]
;B[dj]C[G : In conclusion, this move it totally in the wrong direction.]
;W[go];B[em];W[fn];B[kr];W[lr];B[ho];W[gn];B[hn];W[hm];B[hp]
;W[jm];B[ll]CR[dj][jc]SQ[co][cn][cm][dm][em][pd][pc][ob][nc]
C[G : Now what do you get for not separating white's groups? Your lower group is closed in, which is not good. I'm not even sure it is unconditionnally alive.
The white groups are nearly connected to each other, so you cannot attack anymore.
Even more.. as I said before, your group could be in danger, so you are forced to escape into a dame zone (no points to make here).

Now I marked two circled stones that are extensions from square groups. The square groups are very strong. So the circled stones should be further from them, especially the one on the left side.]
;W[kk];B[lk]C[Running like this wasn't part of my plan.

G: You have the explanation, now.];W[nk];B[kj];W[kl];B[cf];W[ch]
C[I was thinking if I should have played C17 at some point.

G: well, not now, there's better to do I think.];B[ef]C[G : good : keep white separated, and now you have C17, or F17 possibilities that would be good (not right now, maybe a bit later, it depends)]
;W[eh];B[bd]TR[ch][eh]SQ[dd][hc]LB[cc:A][dc:B]C[G : NO ! You're somewhat forcing white to play A or B or something here. It does not birng you any good to force your opponent to settle. In this situation, the strategy is to continue attacking the triangle stones, build power by doing it, and THEN see what more severe thing you can do to the square stones
You don't need to settle your own stones yet, so this move is not useful.]
;W[cc];B[fd];W[fc];B[ed];W[ec];B[de]SQ[ch][eh]C[G : well... white made territory where you could have spoiled everything, and you end in gote...
So, another point of strategy : try to build power before you settle things. Because once they are settled, your power will be of no use.

Now, you could argue that you're building power against that corner in order to attack the square stones. But it won't bring you something good for sure, since it is very difficult to catch them.

White made territory for free, and he gets sente.];W[lc]C[G : now that his upper left group is strong, he can invade.]
;B[je];W[le];B[mb];W[lb];B[pf]C[G : good move : push on a strong group to attack a weak one.]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[qe];B[pe];W[lj];B[mj]LB[ki:A]C[G : not sure about that. I prefer to play at and keep thing simple since your are strong around. It can be a good way to attack the upper stones.]
;W[li];B[mk];W[nj];B[mi];W[ki];B[ni]TR[le][lc][lb]C[G : you should save your stone in atari, it's a cutting stone. If white captures it, the triangle stones will be pretty much saved. And your move does not enclose territory, since there are those triangle stones. I agree that you have to run for your life, but you are too shy.]
;W[he]C[G : well if white does not want to capture it... ;-)]
;B[bc];W[bb];B[gg]C[G : good one.];W[gi];B[ci];W[dh];B[sm];W[rn]
;B[qg];W[sg];B[ig];W[jf]C[Cut :(

G : well, it's dangerous from white. I'll try one or two variation to see if black can resist. But this cut does not seem so strong.]

;W[ic];B[pl];W[ml];B[lm];W[ng];B[sh];W[rf];B[bf]C[G : this move is very small, but you have to live, indeed. That's also one problem when youre closed in : you have to live, and lose points by playing small moves. And it hurts to play these moves.]
;W[hr]C[I count quickly and see I' m too much behind. The lower group seems alive to me.
Black resigns.

G :
Not sure the lower group is alive as it stands.
I think I commented on the moves that seemed wrong, let's make a summary of stratic points :

- It is always a good idea to restrain / close in your opponent. Eventually he must live, so you get forcing moves around his group that can be useful. Sometime you can kill, but that should not be your goal, unless you read exactly how to do it (if you try to kill and do not succeed, you have lost all your forcing moves).
- Consequently, it is a good idea not to be closed in, so get out in the center if you feel your opponent is going to surround you.
- Very simple, but : try to separate your opponent's groups
- consequently, try to stay connected, you will avoid being attacked too much.
- Usually it is not a good idea to try to kill (i'm not saying you did). The purpose of attacking is to build power, or maybe territory, while keeping the initiative. Keeping the initiative is very important.
- Finally : do not help your opponent to settle himself, as in the uper left corner.

On your game : you are, in my opinion, too shy. You seem to be the opposite of those that cut everything they see. You should not be afraid of cutting and savagely attack you opponent ^_^. When a group is weak, apply pressure on it, make it squirm! More fighting spirit!

OK, i hope this will be useful for you. If you have any questions, I am Giroro on both IGS and KGS.]
