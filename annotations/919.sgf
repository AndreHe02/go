C[Dear reviewer,

I played the white stones in this game, under the nickname "wuwei".
I won by resignation after capturing a big group, but I am dissatisfied with the course of the game, especially the first fight, and would welcome any comment on my moves, and those I had to play.
I inserted one variation about a tsumego problem at move 58 ; could you please check it out ?]

C[aggressive but possible];B[cm];W[co]C[rather slow, the corner isn앖 safe yet, too
I앇 prefer  F4];B[cc]C[wuwei : after a long esitation, I chose to block from  the right side to build thickness there and approach  the hoshi with some support, but I suspect that the  game would have been easier if I had blocked from  the other side. Which side was best ?

No bad idea!
But in consideration of the left side it seems better  to me to block from the lower side to strengthen  those stones. Also this should be sente so you can  decide wether to attack the B lower left group or to  approach the upper right corner afterwards.
In this situation it is rather difficult to build a mojo at  the top because of the influence and potential B has  on the right side.]

C[very fearful, not necessary];W[nc]C[now the W position is much better than the B]
;B[md]C[wuwei : from here on, I don't have a clue of what's  happening.

unusual move, B tries to get influence and reduce at  once]
;W[nd]C[that seems natural to me];B[jc];W[ld]LB[pc:a][pe:b]
C[What do you want to do now?
First of all strengthen those two stones, I앇 say.
The easiest way to do so is attaching, thus I  suggest a or b.
Your move still gives B the chance to gain influence  and perhaps build a mojo on the right. 26 isn앖  wrong but somewhat irresolute.]
;B[mc];W[lc]C[Why?
Try to connect your stones to strengthen them.];B[me];W[mb]
;B[le];W[ke];B[kd]C[I don앖 see which plan either of you has.
This is a local fight so connect your stones, cut your  opponents and get access to the center or at least  enough eyespace.
BUT don앖 forget the whole board position. Both  have potential to build a mojo and there are two  weak black stones in the lower left. But at the  moment B has more secure territory.]
;W[jd]C[It seems that you try to catch two stones and get  points at the upper edge. But that압 risky because B  gets the chance to build up the right edge.]
;B[lb];W[kc];B[kb];W[kd];B[nb];W[ic];B[jb];W[ne]MA[nd][nc]C[much too optimistic!
B is much stronger here and now can even get profit  out of attacking your stones.
I앇 play on the right side and use the marked stones  as a potential threat.]
;B[id]C[aji keshi];W[ie];B[ib];W[hd];B[nf]C[important!];W[ob]
;B[ma];W[pc]C[rather late! see var.]
(;B[oe];W[oc]C[a good chance to sacrifice some stones!!
B can now play at the 3-3 point and youre in trouble];B[qd]
C[:-)];W[qc];B[of]C[???
another gift];W[rd];B[re];W[rc]C[wuwei : I wonder the status of the upper right corner  : I believe it is unconditionnaly alive with points but  I am not sure of it. I inserted a variation about that.

It is unconditionnaly alive!]
(;B[pj]C[wuwei : who is ahead at this point ?

B got much more out of the fight in the upper right.
He has secure points at the upper left as at the  bigger parts of the right edge. But the right side is  still invadable an there are still the weak stones at  the left.
W has points at the upper edge and good prospects  at the lower left.
The influences of both are similar.
I think the B position looks slightly better but as it is  W압 turn he has the initiative and there압 a good  chance to take over B압 lead.]
;W[qp]LB[ql:a]C[I앇 prefer to attack the left because you can use this  attack to gain something at the bottom.
Invading also is possible, but why not at the  weakest spot? E.g. at a.]

;W[sr]C[In the lower right you played much better than B!];B[fp]
C[very dificult now for B. He already has a weak group  near the lower right. I think B should strengthen this  group fist and try to invade deeply if necessary later  on.]

W has more points, more influence, a target to  attack at the left and a cutting point to aim at at a.]

The only exception was the upper right corner.
There you apparently had no plan and no idea what  to do.  And that seems the most important hint to you,  analyze the situation and make plans as often as  you can and change them if necessary. Try to not let  you take away by a lokal fight, keep an eye on the  whole board.
And learn to sacrifice!

Feel free to ask if you have further questions.

Bye,
