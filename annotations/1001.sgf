;B[pd]C[Hello,

Could I request a reviw for this game ?

It has been played on KGS by me as black (yfh2 - 9k KGS) against NAGAURA
(2d KGS). No hcp.
We did not review the game afterwards, and thats why I would like
someone (early dan level) to browse through it.

Of course, I lost by nearly 50 points. Therefore, there is no need to
concentrate on all aspects of game, but probably on the fuseki and a few
key stones in the middle game.
Some brief comments on yose may be usefull as well.

djna - The game overall reminds me of my game in a tournament at the weekend. I played Tony Atkins,
2d to my 1d. Early in the game we sketched out some territories had a few reductions and probing
attacks and no real fights. By the end of the game I was 7 points behind on the board and so lost
by 13 points.  What happened? Well I just didn't play efficient moves in the opening, nobody had weak
groups, nothing to attack so nothing changed and I just lost.   What about this game? A couple of mistakes and W just inexorably wins without ever really showing his
strength. There's just one move where I think W does something that shows he's got greater strength than B.
We'll see that later. But 50 points? Yes, 50 points is not so large! The recently republished book by David
Mitchell "Go Proverbs" mentions a Russian proverb: in the opening discard groups of up to 15 stones,
sente is worth more! So you only need to give up sente needlessly a couply of times and 20-30 points can go.
Matthew Macfadyen reckons that in a high handicap game if he reaches the yose 30 points behind then
he'll win! You can easily lose 25 points in the end game. So, if W decides that he's ahead and just plays  sensibly then a 50 point margin is not unexpected.]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[qj];B[qh]C[djna - I think that this is the wrong direction, it's very hard to make sense of the upper corner now. The B stone is just too
far from the corner to really help make territory and just too close to make good thickness. R8 is more usual, extending from
the shimari seems to work better.

I searched the GoGod database for this position. In several thousand professional games we reach W R10 in
less than 100 games. This reflects the comparative rarity of  the B shimari in professional go these days. Chinese
fuseki and other such patterns are fashionable. However when B makes a shimari, then W R10 is pretty common
and about half the time B answers on the right side. Sometime B plays approach moves in the upper left. When
he *does* play the right side then B *always* plays R8. There is no prefessional game in the collection with your  move!]
;W[qm]C[djna - good anyway because W gets a base, but also good because it inhibits the use of the shimari.]
;B[jd]C[djna Probably the only move otherwise a W move there is good but the B stones are just slightly too compressed.
You can't add one more stone and make enough territory to justify 4 moves and yet right now you have very little.]
;W[jp]C[djna - the meaning of the shimari is to build a framework around it, W has now pretty much made sure that your 12 points in the corner is all you are going to get. One of the stories of this game is that W always seems to have potential to grow territory. This is the first occasion where the pattern is seen.]
;B[cn]C[This is probably bad (according to W response).

My guess is C10 better (B C10, W C12, B C7). Any other good move ?

djna - yes it's quite surprising to me how effective that one space high pincer becomes. C10 is where
I would have played without really analysing the reasons.];W[dl]
;B[en]C[djna - the only alternative Ishida gives is the 3-3 invasion. W gets huge thickness and K4 is well placed.

So B pretty much has to play here. Problem is that his stones are doing little more than occupy dame points.
W D8 will not be easy to attack so C6 does seem to turn out badly.

Count D6 as the second mistake, that's going on 20 points or so points explained already!]
;W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[bl];W[ck]C[djna - this move seems a little too "good" is it an overplay? If B just plays B9 he's grovelling on the second
line and that seems very upsetting. If you ever meet a really strong player you might ask them what B might  do in this situation, I'm afraid I don't know!]
;B[oi];W[ok]C[djna - this exchange is probably more help to W than B. It's going to be tough to attack W now and yet the B moyo  doesn't seem that much stronger than it was. You've lost potential pressing moves at Q8 and Q9 and have a slightly  uneasy relationship between P11 and R12. I think F 17 is better. Another alternative might be to play B3 and ensure  that you have two eyes in the lower left - but that does seem irritatingly slow.]
;B[cf]C[djna - This feels off the point to me. You've begun to form a moyo, so why not F17? You end up with too many  little groups in the game none of which have the potential to grow points.

The D9 W group does look like it deserves to be threatened a little and perhaps that was your idea. I can't quite see  how to do this.]
;W[gc];B[cd];W[cc];B[dc]C[djna - Ishida offers this as a way to get settled.  You certianly don't want two unstable groups, so the idea might be good.]
;W[ed];B[bc];W[cb];B[be];W[bb];B[ab];W[db];B[nc]C[djna - this is  too slow, you still haven't seized the corner and you've spent 4 moves already. The good thing
is that W is now strong in the top left and so you've stopped him annoying you by attacking the K16 stone. The
bad thing is that you've played a very passive move.  Now you have a fairly solid group in the top left we would
really like to attck the D8 stone a little.

I'd like to play C11, but I can't see any move after W B9   I think that B3 to stabilise the B group and let you play aggressively might be a good idea. B3 is pretty much  double sente]
;W[bq];B[gn];W[gk]C[djna - a nice move, keeps the pressure on B and prevents an attack]
;B[hq]C[may be too greedy.

djna- this is a very bad move. Starting another group when your C6 group is under pressure is bound to lead to trouble.
It's worse than greedy, it's envious! You don't want to allow W to have anything.]
;W[hp];B[eq];W[do];B[fq]C[djna - this shows the problem you need to ignore W's peep so you lose a lot on the outside.]
;W[fo];B[bk];W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[dq];W[bo];B[co];W[cp];B[bn]
;W[ap];B[cr];W[br];B[ds]
(;W[ci]LB[er:B]C[I think W played it easy and let the B group live, but he could have severed it (see var)

djna- No W is simply winning the game. This is the move that shows his strength.

He's saying to you: "sure you can live,  but I get another move somewhere else. Your move to live
stops me getting 20 points, but has no potential for further growth. I can easily get as much somewhere
else." That C11 move threatens now squeeze two other black groups to little more than
two eyes and no potential and also build huge thickness. Watch that thickness grow.]
;B[bi];W[dn]C[djna - this is a very calm move. The difference between B and W here is strategically huge. W now is very strong on the
outside. I don't think that you had the time to play here, but now was the right time for W to do it.]
;B[fr]C[djna - better to play C12, he can't take the time to kill you yet]
;W[bh]C[djna - now you are enclosed, three groups with no real purpose]
;B[bj];W[dh];B[cm];W[dm];B[am];W[dg];B[df];W[ef];B[de];W[ee]
;B[ad]C[Probably not usefull. I had been wanting to play around O5 for a while ...

djna -  unless W can kill then there's no value in this, even if he can you probably would be better playing in the  bottom right. I think that you've effectively given W a free move.

Putting that issue to one side, just look at W's thickness. At a first glance you might be tempted to say  " well
he's only got 20 points or so, I've 12 or so, that's not such a big gap!" The thing you need to be able to see is
the value of that thickness and the potential in W's position. Your left side stones are now fixed and "dead",
they can make no further contribution to your position. W's are growing and let him play as agressively as  he wishes. You need to be able to see this coming and avoid it. Your H3 invasion was the primary cause.]
;W[np];B[mq]C[djna - Very hard to answer W's move but this jump simply ensures that W has a choice of how to seal you in. Probably O3  is better.]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[op];B[pq];W[mp];B[lq];W[lp]C[djna - In general we tell people not to use thickness to make territory, but here W's strategy seems to work quite well.
he has calmly allowed you quite a nice corner. He didn't try either of the cuts at N2 and P2, presumably because he felt
that they might lead to compilcations. He's playing a controlled game.   I can see no way for you to get a significantly different result]
;B[kj]C[djna - yes, this is the right sort of area. W is so strong you dare not be more adventurous.]
;W[kf]SQ[jd][kj]C[djna - observe how the W thickness looms over the two marked B stones.]
;B[if]C[djna - The decision to play here should come from a careful analysis of the territories. Could you play more defensively
and win? I don't think so. So you're having to attack, but we feel that B can't hope for too much, W's strength in the area
is too great.];W[jg];B[mj]C[djna - just too many places you want to play, your forces are spread thinly. I can't see a better idea for you.
Ideally you would find some forcing moves against W to gain the time to press the attack. The W wall is just
too solid for such manouvres.];W[le]SQ[ih]C[djna - no mercy from W. He's just building strength by playing forcing moves against you, and reducing your area
all the time. It almost looks like an overplay. But I can't make B near the marked point work so W is playing a nice
move.   What is happening here is that W is now getting the benefit of his investment. B is not doing anything wrong
he just has nothing to work with. Sometimes you might get lucky, an unexpected tactical sequence might
work but generally the player with thickness reaps the rewards.]
;B[lc];W[qc]C[djna - There has always been  at least a ko for W in the corner. If W had got a stone near M17 then he might have
lived unconditionally. So now is a good time for this move.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[pb]C[
djna - very aggressive, unless you *know* this works then you have to concede W a live group.

Maybe you could find a move such as M13 that both attacks the three W stones and also indirectly
patches the weakness at P16. This is really very hard to read out.]
;W[pc];B[ob];W[qb];B[sd]C[
djna - You chose to play the ko. If you were a little stronger on the outside then T17 kills directly.

You can start the ko in two circumstances:

1). You know you will win it. In that case you are preared to grant W two successive moves elsewhere. He  seems to have a lot of places where two moves will get plenty of points.

2). You don't mind losing the ko because *you* get two moves elsewhere. In this case W winning the ko
devastates your area, the R12 chain comes under attack. It's very tough to find two moves for you that are
worth losing the ko for.

So I think that you cannot play the ko.];W[sc];B[se];W[qe];B[rc]
;W[kc];B[sb]C[Should I have played L16, at the expense of the corner ? I thought I did not have good ko threats to fight this.

djna - I think you will have to concede something. If W is playing efficiently then he plays his ko threats in  *ascending*  order of size, so the next ko threat wlll be worse!]
;W[kd];B[ii];W[ig];B[ei];W[cj];B[gi];W[li];B[lj];W[ji];B[hg]
C[There is probably better than H13 (E11 was probably not best already), but I could not find out waht (and time was short)

djna - your problem is that your chain is not well linked and W is strong, we are not surprised that some
piece is cut. If the W chain at L 17 could be pressured then you would have some chance.]
;W[hh];B[ih];W[gg];B[jh];W[kh];B[jj];W[hi];B[ij];W[hj]C[djna - W is not overplaying just taking a little profit and making sure B can't grow. You are not really doing much
wrong, this kind of outcome is always likely.


I don't think that there are important events  from this point on. The outcome of the game is already determined.
B makes occasional mistakes such as adding stones to G6 and missing playing L8, but these are not errors  of understanding.

To me the interesting features of the game is how W is always happy to build strength and allow territory to  accumulate later.]
