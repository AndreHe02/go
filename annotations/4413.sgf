C[review submitted by karegon, whom played white.

one comment i would like to add is that although my rank is displayed as 22k, it should in fact be BC.

K- hello, thanks for submitting your game for review. I hope you find my comments useful, but if I miss the point of some of your questions or you would simply like more info, please just email me & i'll be happy to help]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[ee]LB[cc:D][dc:B][cd:C][dd:A]C[was this a little to deep into the centre? i feel on reflection i may have been better served playing the star point.

K- have you heard of the "shin fuseki" period of Japanese go? it usually translates as "new opening" and refers to a period in the 1930's when younger japanese professionals experimented with "new" opening moves such as this one, the 5-5 point.
 
Any moves on the 5th line are by their nature not likely to make territory underneath since the opponent can simply play on the 3rd line.

The general opinion these days is that the 5-5 point only works if you have a special strategy, in other words it is difficult to make it work to your advantage.

The more usual opening points are the star points (A), 3-4 points (B, C), and the 3-3 points (D). Each has specific characteristics and balance between territory & influence.]
;B[pj];W[ej]C[once again, i feel i may have been to bold playing towards the centre.

K- I agree];B[jd];W[jg]TR[ee][ej]MA[dd][dj][jp]C[on reflection, i feel this was a mistake, as black then plays L4.

K- as a general principle, moves in the opening are best played on the 3rd & 4th lines, because it is much easier to make territory in corners & along edges than in the centre. If you had played the 3 marked stones at the points marked x you would now have a good flexible opening position (known as the "4 star opening").

Often the thing that makes a move good or bad is just the timing. Your move here is a good point but you have played it too early - the big points around the edges are more urgent]
;B[kp];W[ip];B[gp];W[hr]MA[fq]C[from this move untill move 26, i feel i could have done so much more to prevent the black invasion. maybe playing this move at G3 instead would have been a wise begining?

K- I suggest x to start to make corner territory. Your marked stone is not in danger because you can jump out to J6]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[cq];W[bo];B[fq]
(;W[fr]C[K- timing again, there are more important places to play at this time, see variations for example - you might even consider sacrificing your stones on the lower side to make bigger gains elsewhere]
;B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[es];B[gr];W[fs];B[cr];W[gs];B[gq];W[go]
TR[ip][dr][fr][hr][es][fs][gs]C[K- your best plan for saving your marked group now is to play elsewhere, aiming to build up strength in the centre and aiming to connect up]
;B[hq];W[ir];B[iq];W[jq];B[jp];W[kq];B[lq];W[lp];B[kr];W[jr]
;B[lr];W[ko];B[jo];W[io];B[jn];W[jm];B[lo];W[kn];B[mp]
(;W[km]C[i feel i may have been better served to take the intitive here and play J6 to threaten the K6 group. would that have been a wise move?

K- it would certainly be a forcing move which you could use to make your centre facing stones stronger, see variation. But go is about balance so black would also get stronger as you can see.]
;B[in];W[hn];B[ho];W[gn];B[im]
(;W[il]C[K- you should not play out a losing ladder, see variation for suggestion: it strengthens your side moyo and makes the ladder work if black ignores]
;B[hm];W[gm];B[hl];W[hk];B[gl];W[fl];B[gk];W[gj];B[fk];W[ek]
;B[ik]C[would i have been better sevred to play the E9 stone at k10, or would it have been better to push black in a straight line towards the centre instead of the ladder?

K- unfortunately there is no move that can protect both weaknesses here, see my comment on move 54]
;W[em];B[jl];W[hj];B[kl];W[mm]C[silly move. i realy should have payed more attention to where this was leading.

i feel conifdent that M7 instead would have saved this group.

K- M7 is certainly the move that gains most liberties but I'm afraid black is overwhelmingly strong in this area so I do not think you can save this group if black plays correctly]
;B[lm];W[ln];B[mn];W[bq]MA[nd][pf]C[K- for this move, you have sente. It is a good time to look around the whole board to assess the overall situation & where is the biggest, most important place to play.

The loss of that white group (caused by the ladder) is a big loss. It means you have no way of reducing black's territory in the lower right corner, plus black has a good (but not yet solid) framework all up the right side & along half of the top side - you will need to invade here before it becomes solid. Also black has killed your group along the bottom edge (again due to the ladder).

Looking at white, you have territory in the lower left and a framework all up the left side, & a loose framework in the top left centre.

You need to ask yourself, in the context of your assessment of both players' positions, what is the best play?

I'm afraid the loss of white's group is so big that you should really resign at this point. However, if you play on (it's good practice after all!), I would suggest your top priority should be to invade black's moyo in the top right (at points marked x), however you should also take the first opportunity to reinforce the top left corner and make it yours.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[fo];W[dn]TR[em][gm][gn]C[maybe E6 would have been better?

K- yes, it would make the bamboo joint with the marked stones]
;B[fn];W[fm];B[fp];W[br]C[Goner: Hi karegon];B[en];W[dm];B[do]
C[silly mistake to let this happen. i feel i shall have to pay more attention to this in the future.

K- snapbacks can be hard to spot];W[cn];B[fc];W[mi]MA[nc][nd]
[pf][qf]C[could i have extended this stone a little further?

K- rather than extending, you need to be invading at one the marked points]
;B[pg];W[ok];B[pk];W[lk];B[ml];W[nm];B[ll];W[ol];B[pm];W[nj]
;B[nl];W[om];B[oo];W[pn];B[qn];W[pl];B[qm];W[on];B[po];W[ng]
MA[nc][nd]C[i feel i could have played a little deeper deeper into the top of the board here.

K- yes, at marked points for example];B[md];W[hd];B[hc];W[gc]
;B[gb];W[gd];B[ic];W[fb];B[eb];W[ec];B[fa];W[fd];B[dc];W[ed]
;B[dd];W[fb]C[in hindsight, i realise i spent far to much effort caputing and having recaptured this position over the course of the game. a mistake i hope not to make in the future.

K- yes, ko is small & unimportant];B[db];W[ce]C[maybe D15 instead?

K- yes];B[de];W[df];B[cd];W[be];B[bd];W[ad];B[ac];W[ae];B[bb]
;W[ca]C[i spent a little while thinking about how i could invade this space and force black down to one eye. this seems to have been a mistake.

i assume that the key point for this would have been B18, hence blacks haste to place a stone there.

K- in fact you cannot kill this group if black defends correctly, however you lose nothing by trying - it gives you practice and maybe black will make a mistake!]
;B[cb];W[hb];B[fc];W[ha];B[ib];W[ga]MA[qc]C[silly mistake. where would have been a better move?

K- at x];B[ia];W[fb]C[to little to late maybe?

K- you have nothing to gain here];B[fj];W[fi];B[cg];W[ch]MA[cf]
C[not sure if this was the correct way to react to this stone.

K- safer to connect at x];B[cf];W[bg]C[B14 instead?

K- you cannot save these stones now];B[bf];W[dg];B[af];W[bh]

;B[fc];W[ei];B[kd];W[me]MA[qc]C[about here is where i attempt to invade the top section of the board, without much success. any comment on where i could have done better would be extremly helpfull.

K- firstly, timing: the best time to invade here was earlier, see my previous comments

secondly, the only weakspot now is the 3-3 point at x];B[nd]
;W[oe];B[qc];W[pf];B[qf];W[qg];B[pe];W[of];B[qh]C[im happy with what i did from here to 194. any comments on how it played out?

K- yeah, works out ok, reduces black & strengthens white];W[rg]
;B[rf];W[ph];B[rh];W[og];B[sg];W[pg];B[pi];W[qi]MA[ql]C[silly mistake. S9 or S10 may have been stronger plays? or maybe not at all?

K- you need to play at x first];B[ri];W[qj];B[qk];W[rj];B[rk]
;W[oi];B[oj];W[nk];B[mk];W[lj]C[i feared losing the M9 stone here. was this the corect move to play?

K- it is a good solid play, but you still have a weakpoint at K11, so it may be better to sacrifice this stone and play at K10 instead]
;B[mj];W[li];B[ij];W[ji];B[ii];W[ih];B[kj];W[ki];B[ne];W[nf]
;B[le]C[maybe i should have played M16 sooner?

K- it's not a big point so not to worry];W[lf]C[im not sure if this was a good move or if i would have been better to play N14?

K- your move was correct];B[mf];W[mg];B[je];W[kf];B[od];W[nn]
;B[no];W[ag];B[bp];W[ap];B[bs];W[ar]C[in hindsight this was a mistake. i feel mayeb A3 would have givven this group more of a chance?

K- your move was not a mistake, either is ok];B[cs];W[ao];B[hi]
;W[gi];B[jj];W[kk];B[me];W[jk];B[il];W[ql];B[rl];W[ni];B[tt]
;W[aq]C[unsure as to why black didnt play this at some point. am i missing something?

K- black could not capture so the points were just dame's anyway]
;B[qq];W[tt];B[tt]C[both passed, ending the game.

i forgot to take the stone at F17.

K- doesn't matter, the ko point at F18 is dame anyway (although in this game it has been incorrectly scored as a point for black)]

all in all, im happy with this game. a big loss for white with many mistakes. but the best way to learn is to make the mistakes and understand WHY they were mistakes.

also, thank you in advance to whomever takes the time to either review or observe this game.

K- ok, I suggest that there are 2 main lessons for you here:
1) Play your opening moves on the 3rd & 4th lines mostly, and try to build secure points on the edges before jumping into the middle!
2) Do not play ladders that don't work!! The point you lost this game was when you played the ladder.

Thanks for sending this game in for review. I hope you find my comments helpful.
