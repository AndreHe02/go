C[Mike (lotharius) and I (cheney) play against each other all the
time.  This competition and a few books has allowed us to advance
to 11k*.  Now we seem to be stuck.  Currently, neither of us
has an advantage and the usual game is determined by the Komi.
I've sent this game in to gain insight into where our weaknesses
are.  I'd particularly appreciate suggestions about the midgame.

HI THERE -- ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE ASKED ME TO COMMENT ON BOTH YOUR
WEAKNESS AND THAT OF YOUR FRIEND, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DO SO BECAUSE
I AM NOT HEARING ANYTHING FROM HIM.  I WILL DO MY BEST, HOWEVER.

MIKE LEPORE (sergeant, coffee on IGS)];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[ec]
;B[gc];W[fd]LB[de:B][ee:A]C[THIS IS THE FIRST BAD MOVE OF THE GAME FOR WHITE.  F16 ALLOWS
BLACK TO GET STRONG WITH G16.  NEVER MAKE YOUR OPPONENT STRONG
UNLESS IT ACCOMPLISHES SOMETHING FOR YOU IN THE PROCESS.  HERE
WHITE GETS NO SHAPE, NOTHING FROM THIS EXCHANGE.    INSTEAD OF WHITE SIX, PLAYING MORE LIGHTLY  SUCH AS AT A OR B
WOULD BE BETTER.];B[gd]C[I
felt like this "joseki" favored me but I'm curious if lotharius
or I missed
a punishing move

YOU ARE RIGHT --  WHITE DID THE WRONG THING AND YOU ARE CAPITALIZING.]
;W[cb]C[THIS THREE MOVE SEQUENCE OF WHITE IS SEEN IN A JOSEKI WHERE BLACK'S
PINCER IS ONE MOVE FARTHER AWAY (AT H17).  MAYBE THAT IS WHAT
WHITE WAS THINKING ABOUT -- HERE HE IS TOO CRAMPED.];B[cg];W[bc]
LB[kc:A][bd:B]
(;B[kc]LB[cd:A][cg:B]C[THERE IS A  WEAKNESS YOUR A AND B STONES HAVE.  WHITE HAS TWO
WAYS TO PENETRATE, UNDERNEATH AND ON TOP.  THEREFORE, THE IDEAL
SITUATION IS TO FIX YOUR WEAKNESS WHILE THREATENING WHITE AT
THE SAME TIME.  SEE THE VARIATION.

IF YOU ARE GOING TO PLAY ELSEWHERE, DON'T PLAY L17 AS YOU DID.
GO IS ALL ABOUT EFFICIENCY AND NOW YOU ARE OVERCONCENTRATED AT
THE TOP.
THE LOWER RIGHT IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST PLACE TO PLAY IF YOU
MUST TENUKI.];W[qp];B[qj]LB[cd:A][cg:B]C[I feel like this
was my first big error and I should have played 13 on the left
side maybe
c9

YOU CAN STILL FIX WITH THE EARLIER VARIATION.  C9 STILL LEAVES
A WEAKNESS FOR YOUR A AND B STONES.];W[dj];B[cc]C[THIS MOVE IS USED IN PREPARATION FOR E16, BUT IT IS ACTUALLY
MAKING WHITE STRONG AND YOU ARE STILL WITHOUT A BASE.];W[bb]
;B[ed];W[fc];B[fe];W[ge];B[ee];W[dc]LB[bd:B][dd:A]
(;B[dd]C[SEE VARIATION];W[gb];B[id]C[THIS MOVE SEEMS PASSIVE -- LIKE YOU ARE GIVING TOO MUCH AWAY.
I THINK THE HANE AT H18 IS BETTER.  LUCKY FOR BLACK, WHITE MAKES
A MISTAKE.];W[ic]LB[hb:A]C[THIS WAS AN OVERPLAY FOR WHITE.  JUST EXTENDING TO A WOULD HAVE
BEEN ENOUGH AND WHITE WOULD HAVE KEPT SENTE.

REMEMBER -- BECAUSE YOU DID NOT FIX YOUR STONES EARLIER, WHITE'S
PLAY AT D10 FORCED THE SEQUENCE TO THIS POINT.    THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROFIT FROM ATTACKING YOUR OPPONENT'S
WEAK STONES BEFORE HE DOES IT TO YOU.];B[hb];W[hd];B[hc];W[fb]
;B[he]LB[gf:B][gh:A]C[AFTER MOVE 31, BLACK HAS A HUGE TOP AND HIS D16 GROUP IS IN NO
IMMEDIATE DANGER.  EVEN THOUGH IT IS WHITE'S MOVE I LIKE BLACK'S
CHANCES HERE.]
(;W[gh]LB[gh:B][dj:A]C[I
felt  W's move 32 was wrong.  Is the extending to g14  proper
or am I not
seeing a "net". It seems to me the nose tesuji fails.

YOU ARE RIGHT -- THE NOSE TESUJI DOES NOT WORK HERE.  BUT PERSONALLY
I THINK IT IS A BIT TOO EARLY FOR WHITE TO PULL THE
STONE OUT WITH G14.  IT JUST GIVES BLACK A TARGET TO CHASE INTO
WHITE'S FRAMEWORK.
SEE THE VARIATION.
   HOWEVER, WHITE'S ACTUAL PLAY AT B IS BAD BECAUSE:  1) IT INVITES BLACK TO PLAY G14, COMPLETELY SOLIDIFYING BLACK'S
STONES, AND  2)  THE LINK BETWEEN THE A AND B STONES IS WEAK, ESPECIALLY GIVEN
THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE BLACK STONES.  WHITE IS UNLIKELY TO
BUILD AN EFFECTIVE MOYO THIS WAY.];B[gf]C[33 IS GOOD -- TAKING AWAY ALL YOUR WEAKNESSES LEAVES YOU FREE
TO ATTACK/INVADE WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT MULTIPLE PARTS OF THE
BOARD.];W[kp];B[hm]LB[bj:C][ej:D][fq:A][iq:B]C[35 IS INTERESTING.  IT GOES TO THE ISSUE OF INVASION VERSUS REDUCTION.
IN MY OPINION, AN INVADING MOVE SUCH AS A OR B IS APPROPRIATE.
EVEN IF WHITE GETS THICK AS A RESULT OF YOUR INVASION, YOU STILL
HAVE MOVES SUCH AS C OR D TO BREAK INTO WHITE'S TERRITORY.

HOWEVER, I AM NOT SURE THAT 35 IS WRONG -- JUST WANTED TO TELL
YOU WHAT I AM THINKING ABOUT HERE.];W[oj];B[ph];W[pl];B[iq]
;W[qc]C[WHITE'S INVASION SEEMS LIKE AN INEVITABILITY.  FOR BLACK TO TAKE
TIME TO PROTECT THE CORNER WOULD BE TOO SLOW.  THUS, WHITE GETS
THE CORNER (PROBABLY IN SENTE) BUT HE HAS LITTLE SOLID TERRITORY
OF HIS OWN JUST YET.];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]
;W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[jq]LB[kq:A]C[I'm
curious about the sequence i played between here and move 67.
It seemed
that not living in the corner in excahnge for the position on
the outside
was proper.  However, it seems W may have missed a move that
could have left
me with  nothing by playing move 64 at c6.

I'LL COMMENT AS WE GO ALONG BETWEEN HERE AND MOVE 67.  HOWEVER,
IF YOU ARE GOING TO INVADE AT THE 3-3 POINT (YOUR NEXT MOVE),
YOU CAN ALMOST ALWAYS LIVE IN THE CORNER _AND_ KEEP SENTE.  IN
THIS CASE SENTE WOULD AMOUNT TO EASILY SAVING THE BLACK STONES
IN THE MIDDLE.

FOR WHITE -- DON'T ATTACK WEAK STONES BY TOUCHING THEM.  TOUCH
A WEAK STONE AND IT GETS STRONG.  BETTER TO PLAY 52 AT A];B[cq]
;W[dq];B[cp]LB[co:A][do:B]
(;W[co]C[WHITE SHOULD BE THINKING OF THE SEQUENCE PLAYED IN THE VARIATION
-- GIVES BLACK A BIG CORNER BUT IT TAKES SENTE

I AM NOT SAYING WHITE FOLLOWING JOSEKI IS WRONG HERE -- JUST
BE THINKING  ABOUT THE WHOLE BOARD.];B[dr];W[er];B[do];W[cr]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[eo];W[br]C[C6?

YES THIS WAS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR WHITE.

WHITE 64 AT C6 WOULD HAVE MADE IT VERY HARD ON BLACK

GENERAL INVASION COMMENT:
ACTUALLY YOU BOTH DID THE SAME THING IN THE CORNER INVASTIONS,
PLAYING D2 BEFORE B5.  THIS IS NOT GOOD PRACTICE.  IT GIVES THE
OPPONENT MORE OPTIONS.];B[cn];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[dm]LB[dl:A]
TR[gh][dj]C[NOW THE MARKED WHITE STONES ARE IN BLACK'S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE

THIS IS A KEY MOMENT IN THE GAME.

WHITE 74 IS A BAD MOVE.  WHITE IS HOPING BLACK WILL TIMIDLY CAVE
WITH A DEFENSIVE MOVE.  IN FACT IT IS THE PERFECT TIME FOR BLACK
TO KEEP ATTACKING.

(;B[cj]LB[ji:C][kj:A][kk:B]C[Is there a way to get a better result  by playing 89 at E12?

AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME WHITE ALREADY HAS DECENT SHAPE AND
A LIKELY CONNECTION TO THE K7 STONE, BUT SEE THE VARIATION FOR
A POSSIBILITY.

HOWEVER, IF YOU PLAYED 89 AT E12, WHITE MAY BE BETTER OFF IGNORING
YOU, SACRIFICING THE TWO STONES AND INSTEAD START SEALING OFF
HIS TERRITORY WITH A, B, OR C.];W[eh];B[kk]C[BLACK TAKES ADVANTAGE.]

(;B[go]C[I felt 115 was small.  Is there anyway to cut around H9 and disconnect
the white groups.

I THINK BLACK'S BEST BET AT THIS POINT IS TO PLAY DOWN WITH L8,
THREATENING TO DISCONNECT THE TWO MIDDLE GROUPS
AND LEAVE AT LEAST ONE OF THEM WITHOUT EYES.  YOU PROBABLY WON'T
MAKE A BIG KILL BUT YOU MAY GET SOMETHING.  SEE THE FIRST VARIATION
FOR ONE POSSIBLE CONTINUATION.

ME TOO, BECAUSE IT ALMOST ALWAYS MEANS BOTH SIDES HAD NUMEROUS
CHANCES TO WIN BUT THE MISTAKES CONTINUED.

HOWEVER, MISTAKES ONLY MATTER WHEN THE OPPENENT TAKES ADVANTAGE
OF THEM.  BLACK NOT ATTACKING WHITE'S WEAKNESSES PROPERLY IN
THE MIDDLE GAME IS WHAT KEPT HIM FROM WINNING.  WHITE ALSO HAD
SEVERAL CHANCES THAT HE MISSED.    IN ALL -- IT WAS A GOOD, COMPETITIVE GAME.  THANK YOU FOR THE
CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT.

****POINT 1****
BLACK SEEMED QUITE AGGRESIVE IN THIS GAME, TRYING TO FIND CUTTING
POINTS AND KILL.  BLACK SET HIMSELF UP NICELY EARLY ON TO WIN
WITHOUT NEEDING TO  KILL.

BLACK LIKES TO FIGHT, BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING A GOOD FIGHTER
IS SETTING YOURSELF UP TO FIGHT FROM A FAVORABLE POSITION.  CONSCOUSLY
THINKING ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU PLAY IS HOW TO IMPOROVE YOUR MIDDLE
GAME.    ****POINT 2****
A FAMOUS PROFESSIONAL SAID THAT GOOD GO PLAY IS 98% PATIENCE.
YOUR COMMENTS INDICATE THAT YOU SEE MANY OF YOUR OWN MISTAKES.
IT IS HARD WHEN PLAYING ON THE INTERNET, BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THAT GO IS ABOUT FOCUS. TAKE YOUR TIME.  MAKE SURE ALL YOUR INTERNET
GAMES ARE 1/8 OR LONGER.    ACTUALLY FORCE YOURSELF TO DO A POINT COUNT IN THE MIDDLE GAME.
THREE MINUTES
TO VERIFY THAT YOU ARE AHEAD MAY KEEP YOU FROM TAKING UNNECESSARY
CHANCES.  THIS TAKES SOME OF THE FUN OUT OF GO BUT IT WILL MAKE
YOU  STRONGER.

GOOD LUCK AND LOOK FOR ME ON IGS -- I'LL BE HAPPY TO PLAY WITH
YOU.
