;B[pd]C[hi, this is a game i played on kiseido go server.
I'm a 10 kyu player playing black
my opponent is an 11 kyu player];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[qj];W[dj]
;B[ed];W[gd]SQ[cc][ef]CR[dc]C[i actually never played in this situation.

My joseki tutor says C17 and E14 are good ...

but i played D17 in the game ...
is that a bad move ? How to abuse it ?


- D17 seems slow.  It doesn't do much for getting eyespace, particularly since E16 is already on the fourth line.  E14 helps to flatten white's position along the left side, while also preparing for a counterattack on the pincer stone.

C17 would be bad here.  The black group would settle itself without much difficulty, but white would have an excellent wall with his stones working together.]
;B[dc];W[df]C[did he go to soft on me here ?


- I like this move more than defending the corner.  Black's group is being confined to one area of the board, and is vulnerable.  It's easy enough to live by ducking into the corner, but then white can easily play along the top.]
;B[de]C[This just helps white to connect.];W[ce];B[ef]
(;W[dg];B[ge];W[he]TR[jc][nc][hd][nd][jp][np][jq][nq]C[i think this was too agressive of my opponent
however it did help him to cut me at e15 ...
good or bad move?

is playing a move like h16 or k17, o16, o17 better ?
or is bottum edge more important ?



- H16 is no good; black can just keep building influence on the outside.  If white wants to develop up here, J16 is lighter and better.  Overall, it's bigger to play at the bottom.  Both black and white want to expand their moyos around K4, which makes it a very important area.]
;B[hd]C[A little aggressive.  It seems better to fix up the shape with G14.]

(;W[fe];B[gf];W[ee];B[fd];W[dd]C[is this result still good for black ? ( i think so)

- Definitely better for black.  White's group was already safe, and capturing the black stone doesn't help develop or make territory.]
;B[gc]C[Excellent for black; the original white pincer was useless.  White's stones are all clustered in one area of the board now, while black has influence to counter any attacks.  It'll be very hard for white to get any meaningful territory now.]
;W[cc]C[Small; this doesn't threaten the black group at all.  The bottom is much bigger.]

(;B[db]C[(me trying to keep sente)


- Also small.  Both groups are completely secure.  Even if white follows up with E17, black can ignore it again, and take another big point.]
;W[cb];B[fq]C[No reason to approach so closely.  Black can develop quite well around K4.  This move gives white the opportunity to attack the stone and build thickness via a pincer around J4.  

White can cede the corner territory without caring too much, as D10 will allow a nice amount along the left side should black invade.]

(;W[nc]LB[lc:F][oc:A][ld:E][nd:B][ne:D][pf:C]C[what is the best joseki to play here, (in this situation)

should i play:

P17 (looks like his k17 stone after the joseki might be to close to my left side wall)

or

O16 avoid him of running to the center at all cost, while building influence ...

or

Q14 perfect shape on right side

or

O15 after he will reply at sansan i'll play q17 and settle a big territory while closing his group in on the right side, giving me a lot of influence again

or

M16 a high pincer ... ?

or

M17 low pincer securing the left side ... (he MIGHT play O15 ... then i get the chance to play Q14 making that nice shape again)



- White would do better to play around P10 rather than here, to see what black's response is before plunging in.

Having said that, black's strength on the top should be used as much as possible here.  A pincer around M16 or M17 drives white away from that thickness, so would be counterproductive.

Attaching at O16 leaves the corner open, and doesn't do much to seal off the top or center.  Likewise with O15, only it's even less severe.

Q14 and P17 are best overall.  Either will allow black to start a severe attack , while starting to make territory.]

(;B[nd]C[Black is only encouraging white to strengthen his stone by playing this way.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[kc]C[White's basically safe now.  The standard followup for black here would be P10, which would work very well overall.]
;B[me];W[ke]C[M16 is better, making white's group safe, and preventing any moves in sente by black while keeping some followups in place later on.]
;B[ld]C[Regarding the direction of play here:  it's going to be hard for black to make a significant amount of territory in the center, due to the white stones on the left side.  Black would do better to play on a larger scale, such as by consolidating the right side, securing a base along the bottom, or reducing white's potential on the left by playing on the outside of the D4-D10 stones.

The top is small at this point; white certainly can't make any territory there, and with the center so open right now, it will take several moves for black to ever get territory.  

White shouldn't care any more about the L15 or H15 stones.]
;W[mc];B[kd];W[jd];B[le];W[jc];B[kf];W[ie];B[je];W[oj]C[A big point, though now that black has all the thickness in the upper right, probably a bit late.  Black should now think about the best way to attack white, by driving the stone towards his wall.]
;B[ph]C[did i defend the right side ?

(i guess i did)



- No.  Now white will dodge _away_ from the thick wall, where there's more space for eyes to be had anyway.

White should skip lightly into the center now, and try to leave as much potential in the lower right and bottom as possible for later.  If he can secure the group without giving black much thickness on the bottom, he can invade again either on the right side or the bottom.]
;W[qn]C[An overplay.  Now black can split the white stones with Q8.  One of the groups should be killed this way.

Either jumping out into the center or playing at R9 would be better (the upper right is black's territory, so white's not giving anything away by letting black secure it further with Q10, etc.)]
;B[qo]C[This actually helps white, by making him come a step closer to connecting his stones.]

(;W[pn];B[np];W[qk];B[jq]
(;W[qq]C[Too early.  White should secure the right side group before invading here, as black will become thick, enabling him to attack it severely.]
;B[ro];W[oq];B[op];W[nq]C[(this move of white was wrong i think)
i think this should have been at q3
i guess he lost the game here


- Q3 would only cause white to be completely sealed in the corner, making a small life.  Black would get the bottom, as well as a solid wall facing the white group on the right side to counterattack.

That being said, O2 would do more for getting eyespace in the corner than O3 if white wanted to live there.

White still isn't in bad shape, even if black gets the lower right.  Looking at the territory in the upper left and upper right, white is slightly behind, but has more potential.  There's not much for either side at the top.  The keys for white will be saving the right side group without ceding too much territory in the center for black and getting some more territory on the bottom left.]
;B[pq];W[mp]C[Skipping out to M3 is better if white's going to abandon the corner.  This way leaves a cutting point, and allows black to get stronger on the right side, which in turn weakens the white group.

White may be trying to play away from the black stones at the bottom in the hopes of attacking them.  This won't work until he strengthens his other positions, so there's no urgency for black to defend there.]

(should white play the other side at R14 or Q14 instead of O15 ?)


- White wouldn't mind this at all.  The black pincer is too close to the wall, and is effectively driving white away from the thickness.  White can always slide into the corner if worse comes to worse, but ignoring M17 and playing around R14 could be an interesting followup, leaving the potential of reactivating O17 later.]
;W[ne];B[pf])
(;B[ld]C[best reaction for white ?


- It's not so good for white to run out now, but now black gets nothing on the top or in the corner; the wall is completely wasted, since white can easily live.  Just sliding to the sides to easily make life followed by capping at P10 should be fine.]
