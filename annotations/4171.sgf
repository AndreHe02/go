C[I played this game with my friend about 2 weeks ago. This game took more than an hour. Since we didn't use our time very well for some moves, we both made several silly mistakes. Nevertheless, I think this game is pretty interesting, so I ask this game to be reviewed.]

It's more or less a trick play. With correct replies, B should get the best result]

I think you're at least 20pt ahead here];W[ih];B[jf];W[hg]
(;B[le]C[I think this is an overplay. I played it without thinking further ><. Or is this okay? I was thinking of K16 as an alternative. Which is better?

I don't like the move in the game, K16 looks OK to me -- but what about L17 and crosscut?]
;W[ie]C[At this point I didn't know what to play.];B[id];W[je]
;B[jd];W[ke];B[kc];W[lc];B[kb]C[Here I was afraid if he played m18, which he didn't.]

(;W[ld];B[lb];W[fq];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[cp]C[I was not sure how to respond this too. will c3 work? I think the move in the actual game is too soft

I agree .. C3 seems like the only move];B[eq];W[cq]
(;B[er];W[cn]
(;B[gq]C[now the F3 stone is already very light for W so G3 is very slow]

;W[pe];B[oe];W[pf];B[qd];W[re]C[I think this move is premature. Should he have pushed along with q11 instead?

I don't think so - living in the corner is big];B[pi]

;W[ip];B[jn];W[gr];B[go];W[fq];B[bo];W[co];B[bn]C[misread the variation for this move]

(;W[ck]C[He messed up with this move. He said he was misreading something, but he didn't explain further]
;B[cl];W[bm];B[cm];W[bl];B[ak];W[en]
(;B[bp]C[this move looks like it should be somewhere in the center - W cannot get two eyes in the corner, see the variation.]

(;B[dk];W[dm];B[ck];W[gm];B[hn];W[hl];B[ik]C[Do this move really threaten white's connection? I was thinking of something like f8 later if white tenuki. But i'm not really sure either

I think there is some danger, see the variation]
(;W[hk];B[on]C[this move loses quite a few points compared to R8 - but somehow the whole B group has become a little weak after the mistakes in the lower left so I guess this is the price you have to pay.]
;W[ql];B[kh];W[me];B[ne];W[mf];B[po];W[qo];B[ol]C[Is the exchange q5-r5 okay? After I played it, I thought it was unnecessary, but my friend told me it's ok

it's very hard to say, but I prefer the move in the game - I will show the variation I think will happenif you play O2:]

(;B[do];W[dr]C[Actually I missed the fact that white's group in the lower left is alive, so after he played here, I thought this is a disaster. But I ended up getting points too. Did he make a mistake?

not here, but the cut is what leads up to his mistake where he doesn't play J10 and has to live in a very inconvenient way.]
;B[dn];W[bq];B[fk];W[nd]C[I think this is too hasty. He should have played J10 instead?

I think it's just a bad move -- it doesn't gain anything and B gets a chance to play a sente before answering. Since the life of the whole W group is at stake, he should be more careful. J10 is definitly the correct move. W lost around 8 points from this mistake alone.]

;B[in];W[ii];B[jm];W[ig]C[After this, we just played the yose very quickly because the place we were playing in was closing soon. And in the end I won by more than 10 points. He got the big point at A15

Thank you for spending your time for our game :). At last, could you please comment for overall? Thx]
