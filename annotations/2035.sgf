AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, here's that review :-)]PL[W];W[nq]
(;B[pm]C[Really quite a big gap here, Q6, R6 are more usual plays here]
;W[fq]C[These two W stones are quite far apart = vunerable]

(;B[dm];W[jp]TR[hq][lq]C[This is a formation that is usually good for W - a bit loose, but W's stones are starting to work together.

See alternative play for D7

NB there are weaknesses at the marked points for W, see alternatives for G5

It's interesting how many times the 3 space extension on the 3rd and 4th line appears in this game, it appears twice in this formation. See how many more of you game it appears in.]

(;B[go]C[A very high move, declaring central influence as a goal, NB there are weaknesses in W's formation that this helps W to patch up, so it's a kind move, thankyou :-)]
;W[hp];B[in]C[consistent strategy];W[nc];B[pg];W[fc];B[fe];W[gd]
;B[hf];W[jd]C[At this point I have nearly two sides for investing 8 stones, but you are working towards a large moyo - a good strategy]

(;B[jf]C[This move isn't sente, so I can make a move else where, I'd like to play inside your moyo somewhere ... C11

but the double approach looked good to me];W[cf];B[dh]C[Nice pincer]
;W[cd];B[df];W[cg];B[ch];W[dc];B[ed]C[This move only really helps W, there are still bigger points on the board to play]
;W[ec];B[hd];W[hc];B[id];W[ic]TR[hd][id][hf][jf]C[Very good shape :-)]
;B[ld]TR[lc][kd][md]SQ[kc][mc]C[Just missed the good invaision point by 1.

(;B[ge]C[Here you try and force me to capture, rather than defend at j14 - gainign solidity]
;W[if]C[you need to watch out for the possibility of this snapback]
;B[ig];W[ie]C[now you have defects in your wall - see variation]
;B[gg]C[so you need another move to patch them up - therefore W has sente

NB: there are still defects though, W can peep at H13 to get a start in the centre]
;W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[See variation, this gives W too much.];W[dq];B[ep]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[bh];B[bi];W[dg]C[Note B12 was left vunerable, whilst W made more sente moves. If B plays at B13 later W plays B14 making the move gote for B, so W is happy to leave this B13 - it's done its job for now]
;B[eg];W[de];B[ef]C[Now F16 is gote for W, so ...];W[qq]C[Juding by the play in the left hand corner, this looks good to W, can steal perhaps 20 points with this move]
;B[pq]C[Better ;-)];W[qp];B[qo];W[pr]
(;B[lp]LB[lq:B][or:A]TR[pm][in][qo][pp]C[This is the move I asked you to remind me of...

Two things here: -

1) The lower right corner is still being fought out, W can easily live with P3, 
     and the lower left is pretty much alive. So this move is threatening to split two live groups apart.

2) With strength on both sides, as illustrated, the deeper invasion of M3 is better. 
    This move just induces W to play M3, and reinforce his position, whilst weakening M4, thus
    W will probably get sente, to come back and link up at P3.

See the variations at 'A' and 'B'];W[lq]
(;B[ko]C[M3 weakened M4, and playing L5 - to try and reach J6 leaves W with a nice sente move to patch up a weakness at L4.

This doesn't demand an answer so isn't sente];W[kp];B[lo];W[mp]
;B[mo];W[no]TR[mp][lq][nq]C[This is called the "trumpet connection".

http://senseis.xmp.net/?TrumpetConnection

In this instance W got the opportunity to play O5 threatening to break into B's interior, so as this is B's strategy, it is probably sente.]
;B[nn];W[qj]C[Nothing interesting left on the bottom - W switches to the side

If W escapes to the centre and lives, then the game looks pretty even, though with those
huge walls (top and bottom), W will have a tough fight, the best strategy is to keep W thin, 
which may involve chasing W into the centre I'm affraid.

Question 1: Which is weakest area for B, top-left or bottom left?
Question 2: How much is the upper right really worth?]
(;B[oj];W[rg]
(;B[qf]C[This drives W along the bottom, allowing the stones to gain some "width" and hence eye space]
;W[rf];B[qe];W[rm]C[According to the proverb on the 2nd line 8 live, this is now 8 stones long, but still not alive, there are options to push W lower than the second line.

Result: W+56

Thankyou for the game - Six easy points to improve your game: -

1) Look at the 3-3 invaisions behind the 4-4 point
2) Look at W's moves and see if your prepared to let W get away with it - esp B10 sequence earlier
3) Keep W thin, try to remove potential eyes.
4) See if a move is really necessary before playing it (F7, B5).
5) Look at the 3 space extension 3rd line / 4th line
6) Aviod empty triangles - you'll find later on that they are *sometimes* the correct move, 
    but "usually" they are wrong.

have fun!
