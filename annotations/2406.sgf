C[Comment from white is denote by W>
Comment from black is denote by B>

W> I seems to made quite a few mistake in the end game. Would I win if I made the correct end game sequence. Beside the end game, is there any way I could have won?]
;B[cj];W[jk];B[dc];W[jc];B[ek];W[ce]C[W> Should I L7 first before i attack? I was afraid that if i defence first, then black terrority will be to hard to break.

You did alright...your k11and k3 stones should be fine, unless black is much stronger than you.  An extension up the left side from black's formation in the lower left is always very good for him, so you were right to place your stone on the left side.  But now you need some real territory.]
;B[cg]C[B> Should i go for that pincer or maybe G11??

Hmm...I would say the pincer is good.  You have a solid lead on territory, and now you can keep up pressure on white to make more.]
;W[ee];B[fc]C[Yes];W[cc];B[cb];W[bc];B[eg]C[Although it doesn't look very big, I might actually play b12.  If you take away white's base and make him float, he will be in some trouble whether or not your e7 stone is there.  After black b12, white has to either dash for the right side, letting you build up some territory on the top and in the lower left quadrant, or quibble over eye space in the top left.]
;W[dd];B[ec]C[B> I am wondering if E11 is a good defend?

Looks ok...the other option would be e10, but its risky - I like yours.]
;W[df];B[dg]C[Did you consider c8 instead?  that would put considerable pressure on white (along with b12 - that is still a very big move).]
;W[bf]C[See white is safer now];B[ge]C[B> Maybe i should block at B7 rather than G9.

No..as white now has some eye space, b7 is pretty small.  But I wouldn't play G9 either - it doesn't seem to me to be doing much.  Approach one of the white stones in the corners, preferably while extending your positions at the top or bottom.]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[ef];B[ff]C[B> I felt that this F8 might be overplay. I should have go L7

Once you had played g9, you were right to try to secure that connection - but f8 leaves some potential for white later.  I would consider F7.]
;W[hb]C[W> Would K9 be better than H12? I was thinking maybe i could force black to defence then do K9.

Well now that black has G9 on the board as a connection, your move is not as effective a threat to black's top left stones.  You can still cut (see variation), but as you can see it could lead to issues.  K9 is bigger here, or L8 or k8.]

(;B[hc]C[B> Maybe G12 is better than H11

They are both ok, but consider playing on the right side...if white makes a good play there, then dives into the space at the bottom center of the board, it will be a close game.]

(;W[ic]C[W> Should I G12 rather than J11?

I like G12, it forces black to reply (otherwise you play through the gap at g11, cut at h10, and take his h11 stone), then you can play a big extension on the right side.]
;B[gb];W[hd];B[gc];W[gd]C[W> K8 seems to be a better move rather than G10

Well k8 would of course be bigger territory wise (I would actually go k7 now), but your move has very interesting possibilities.]
;B[fd]C[B> I should have put J12 instead of F10];W[ia];B[he]
;W[id];B[ki]C[Well white had several opportunities to claim the right side, but black got there first.]
;W[gk]C[Consider a pincer instead - get a sizeable chunk of land, and when black extends, then make your extension on the bottom.]
;B[kf]C[Good - normally that move would be questionable, but in this case you are ahead so it gives you a little extra to match white's gain, it helps your G9-G10-F8 stones against possible cuts later on, and it completely ruins white's chances of major territory on the right.  Plus you now have m11, which could cause problems for white.]
;W[ke]C[And that is a good response.];B[kk];W[kl];B[lk]C[B> Is M2 a better choice than M3?

No];W[lf]C[W> Should I M2 rather than M8?

Tough call - I would have to say M2, because your group at the bottom will look pretty constricted after black m2.]
;B[ll];W[jm];B[kg];W[lg];B[lh];W[jf];B[jg];W[if];B[le]C[W> I thought I'll be able to connect J8 and K8 back. Black move M9 was unexpected. Is there any way for white to save J8 and K8?

There is an escape for white's 2 stones (variation), but you can't avoid being cut.  Good tesuji for black.]

(;W[ld];B[je];W[kd];B[ie];W[fj]C[W> Would it be better if I K4 then F4 or G5?

Not really...but you could try to get your j8 and k8 stones out of trouble.  Another big area is the upper left - black's group could actually be in trouble after the cut at f9 (which black must answer).  But your move is fine.]
;B[fl]C[Good.  White is short on space, so make it difficult for him.]
;W[gl];B[gi];W[gj]C[W> F3 seems better than G4. It connect the stones and also threaten black F2.

Neither is really necessary - two diagonal stones are connected whatever black does.  If you want to contest the center territory, I would either play the variation that I showed before with the j8 and k8 stones, or play f5.  Black's stone was a little overplayed, so F5 will take advantage of that by threatening G6.  And it will lay a position to contest the territory around d5-e5.]
;B[hi];W[hj];B[ij];W[jj];B[ii];W[ik];B[ej];W[fi];B[fh];W[kj]
;B[lj];W[bb];B[ca];W[fe]C[You might as well play b13 immediately, you make a couple points and you save sente anyway.]
;B[eb]C[You have the right idea, but now white has a double threat with the cut at g8.  You needed to make that safe first.]
;W[gf];B[hf];W[fg];B[gg];W[ff];B[ig];W[ba];B[ga];W[eh];B[gh]
;W[ch]C[W> Should I connect at E5 first or attack at C6? Connecting seem to thicken black defence and reduce my chance to try attack B6.

Actually I don't think you can capture any stones, either way.]
;B[dh];W[bi];B[ci];W[ah];B[ch];W[bj]C[You made the most of black's weakness]
;B[bk];W[ai];B[ei]C[What do you have to worry about?  White doesn't threaten anything by cutting your groups, and for points there are bigger places to play.]
;W[fk];B[el]
(;W[lm]C[W> White end game sequence seem to be wrong. Should I K5, then H13?

Now that there is nothing very big left, you should do whatever lets you keep sente.  H13 gives black sente (atari at k13, white j12, black plays k10 and you must defend).  And the move you made is much bigger than k5.  You made the right one.]
;B[ji]C[W> I think black should G1 then K5.

Black should probably play n7, then n2 is also an important sente move (because if he then gets to play n1 you cannot fill at L1, you have to give up your m1 stone).  After that the g1 sequence.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[gm]C[You still have problems if black can play n2 then n1.  Be careful..]
;B[mg];W[me];B[mh]C[Black didn't have to give up sente like that.]
;W[cf]C[W> Should I connect N8 and H13 before C8? C8 seems dangerous if black took it, althought i think white can still connect at E10.

Youre about out of good sente moves so now the best is probably a3 (black ataris, you connect at a7 to start a ko).  Or actually h13 is bigger.   But your move is good - it took away a big ko threat for black.]
;B[ha];W[ib];B[ak];W[km]C[Play n8 or k10 instead.  These are both threats for black.]
;B[aj];W[ag];B[ml];W[ed]C[W> I seems to missed a lot of better move. N8 and K10 seems to be better than E10.

This is basically dame, its only value is to stop a black ko threat at c10 - but there are no kos.  play k10 or n8 or j2.]
;B[mf];W[le];B[jd]C[Black got them first.];W[kc]C[W> I thought I K10 is unimportant, so I didn't bother to connect at K10. Looks like it cost me 1 pts here.]
