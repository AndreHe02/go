RE[B+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[Alex: Hi, thanks for reviewing this game.  I think I need help with the late fuseki/early middlegame stage: if I can't see any weak groups, then I have trouble choosing a direction of play.  Of course, any other comments you can make will be much appreciated.

I was playing white, no komi.

--------

Hi
I left in the variations I looked at.  Not many of them are likely to be right, though.]
;B[pd];W[cq];B[dp]C[Alex: This took me by surprise!  I tried something a bit "experimental" in reply; what would be the sensible move here?

--------

I would just play the normal joseki]
(;W[jj];B[dd];W[cp];B[do];W[er];B[gp]C[Alex: I wondered about playing B6 here, but I wanted to get to the empty corner first.

--------

b6 is really big...];W[pp];B[co];W[bo]C[Alex: Was this a mistake?

--------

after this exchange his side wall is a lot better.  you only want to make this kind of exchange if you need it for corner life.]
;B[bn];W[ap];B[cm];W[cf];B[ch];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[de];W[bf]
;B[eg]C[your tengen doesn't look so bad now.
w still seems kind of short on points. i would like to build a big area, but it's going to be hard cause b is hard to attack.]
;W[kc];B[ic];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[qf]C[Alex: Up to this point I was feeling reasonably happy.  This is where I start to have trouble choosing a direction.  What would you do here?

--------

hmm, it's hard to decide.

biggest open space is the right side, so i'd play somewhere on the r line.]

(;W[je]C[this isn't so bad i think.  at least you are paying attention to your weakest group...  but maybe there is an invasion or something instead.  it's hard to attack b though.]
;B[ie]
(;W[jf]C[this way seems to be helping b a lot more than w.  usually w hanes here.]
;B[jd];W[kd]C[this exchange seems bad to me.];B[qn];W[nq];B[qj]
C[Alex: Same question: what to do next?  I wondered about invading at R12, R8 or D10, but I thought I had enough territory and didn't need to make the game complicated.

--------

i think w is definitely behind in terr.  you will have to take away some of the right side i think.  but it's hard.  also, turning the corner at j14 is a big shape move.  if he ignores you should be able to destroy most of the territory of his upper left group.

if he plays there first it opens up the l15 cut for you too. so it may be double sente.]

(;W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[pf]C[hmm, w's last 3 moves...  make b's two large extensions on the right suddenly a lot stronger.  i guess you're trying to build territory in the middle...  but it is tough.]
;W[of];B[pj]
(;W[oe]C[Alex: I think this was a mistake.  I thought about P10, and worried that my three stones would be short of liberties, but now I look at it again I don't see a problem.  Please check the variations...

--------
this is not sente, is it?  so you ignored his turn at q10.  another move there for b will make all your recent moves useless.]
;B[nj]C[Alex: And now, here, I went a little bit crazy...

--------

so you made q11 12 13 wall, and in the process you let b's right side become territory.  in exchange you were hoping for center points, but now you didn't get them.]
;W[ok]C[um...  this is tough to make work.];B[oj];W[ql]
(;B[rl]C[b wants the stone to get cut off???  he should just slide into the corner and live.]
;W[rm]
(;B[rk]C[why b???  force w to make a big corner?];W[qm];B[on]

(;W[qo]C[Alex: Would S6 be better here?  Please look at the variation.

--------];B[rn]
(;W[om];B[pn]
(;W[ro]C[forcing him to connect?  just for the points?];B[sm]
;W[so];B[sn];W[nm];B[nn];W[mm];B[mn];W[lk];B[lm];W[nk];B[mj]
;W[ll];B[lj];W[km];B[ln];W[kj];B[mg];W[ng];B[mh]C[Alex: Again, I look at the board and have no idea what is most important!

--------

w behind on points now.

invading the left would be nice.  i still like the turn at j14.  it's sente.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd];W[ob]
(;B[rc]
(;W[qb];B[rb]
(;W[pc]C[Alex: I guess P16 instead would be better shape.  I was trying to keep sente here, but I was sorry later...

--------];B[od]C[Alex: I was thinking that black's position around D12 or E14 looks thin, and there should be some way to take advantage of it.  But perhaps I need to defend at N14 first?

--------];W[gf];B[me]
(;W[ne]C[Alex: I think this is a mistake, I can play M14 instead.

--------];B[ke];W[lf];B[kf]C[you have to save k14 stones.  you won't be able to kill the cutting stones and building m15 stones up won't help you at  all since they're just facing the living b group.]

(;W[lg];B[kg];W[lh];B[kh];W[li]C[why?];B[ig]C[Alex: Now, what is the best way to handle the G14 stone?  I think I tried for too much here.

--------
losing those stones is so painful.];W[hd]C[i like this and the next move.]

(;W[bh];B[ej]C[whoah, giving up invading stones totally?];W[gi]
;B[hj];W[hm]C[Alex: Despite all my mistakes, I feel as though the game is still close, perhaps I'm just a little bit behind (5 points or so).  Do you agree?

--------

yeah it doesn't look completely bad for w.  but top group is a worry.]

(;B[lq];W[hq];B[iq];W[gq];B[ir];W[mr];B[fq];W[fr];B[hp]
(;W[gr]C[Alex: This is small, I should play F7 or N11 instead?

--------

it's small but it preserves j4 cut which may be useful later.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[fm];W[gl];B[ik];W[jl];B[il];W[im];B[jk];W[kk]
;B[ki];W[mf];B[nh];W[fk];B[fj];W[ek];B[le]C[Alex: Now I should defend my top group...but I counted and worked out that I'm about 10 points behind, so I tried something interesting instead, hoping that my opponent wouldn't know how to kill...

--------];W[hf];B[if];W[gg]C[Alex: I was expecting black to defend around H15, then I can capture the three stones at J9, then I think it's fairly close.  But black wasn't silly...

--------];B[qa]
(;W[pb];B[lb]C[Alex: Well, it looks like my group is dead now.  I tried a couple of cheap tricks, but the game really ends here.  Thanks for reviewing.

--------]
(;W[mb];B[kb];W[lc];B[jc];W[gd]C[Alex: This should be at G17, but even so, capturing the D15 group isn't big enough.

--------];B[fa];W[re];B[rf];W[ga];B[gb];W[fb];B[ea];W[ra];B[sa]
;W[pa];B[na];W[rd];B[qe];W[ra];B[se];W[sb];B[sd]C[Alex: This is where I resigned.

--------

it was hard to say much about this game.

good luck!
