If white have an eye around K9 and black in F8 don't, then white won't even have to eat the inner black group.

Your move in K9 give him an eye.

If you don't see a way to remove him all the eyes, then you should just try to reduce its territory. See Variation.]

;W[hr];B[mg];W[ic]C[kilroy [8k\]: thanks
darudaru [8k\]: Thanks.

where can i improve my game?

1) Don't save some stones in gote when they are not usefull for the tactic.

2) If you know that by applying 1) you will have to leave some stones to the opponent, play those stones only if really needed or if it is usefull.

3) In order to apply 2) simply, train yourself to play straight.

4) Try to predict where the other player will play. Suppose that he is as intelligent than you when you try to predict. Never think that he will not see what you see.

5) Be patient, and don't let the greed blind you. To let the opponent get some points is ok if at the same time you take about the same on another part of the board. 

6) Train yourself more with some life and death problems. You can train on the website http://www.goproblems.com

Good luck,
Vincent])
