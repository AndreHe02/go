AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[MaxDWolf [24k\]: Hi
Klops [19k\]: hi
Mokurai [6k\]: Hi];W[nq];B[pn]LB[no:A]C[I now usually play at A.

M: With a five-stone handicap, your concern is to expand your influence. You must work to confine White, but avoid fighting White directly. You will make more mistakes if you get into a lot of close infighting, and White will take advantage. The move you made is better for you than A.]
;W[jp];B[gq];W[hp];B[iq]LB[gp:A]C[I'm guessing it would have been better to play at A rather than running out underneath.

M: The move you made is fine. It reduce's White's base. A move at A cedes the bottom center to White.]
;W[ip];B[jq];W[lp];B[lq]C[M: A very good result for Black. White has no eye space or shape. The little influence White's wall creates toward the center is countered by Black's center handicap stone.]
;W[pq];B[mp]LB[qp:a][qq:b]C[M: Cutting White in two is a good idea, but it lets White invade the corner at a and get a base.

Blocking White out of the corner at b is better.];W[kq];B[kr]
;W[kp];B[mq];W[qp];B[qo];W[op];B[oo];W[np];B[no];W[nr]C[M: White will get about 10 points in the corner, and Black has a comparable territory along the bottom. Breaking even is a good result in a handicap game.

However, Black has done better than break even. The White stones in the center bottom are very weak, while the Black stones at the lower right have good shape and radiate influence.]
;B[mo];W[hq]C[M: This group of White stones is not dead, but Black can press hard all around it, confining it to a very small life, and at the same time building powerful Black walls on the outside.

White would do better to abandon this group for a while, and start in another corner.]
;B[hr];W[gp];B[fq];W[im];B[gm]LB[mr:a][lr:b]C[Despite my nervousness about the vulnerability at A, I felt that it was more important to contain white. I felt that the two groups could manage on their own.

M: The vulnerability is not at a, but at b. However, Black is right to press White. Good move.]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[hk];B[fl]LB[hl:a][il:b]C[M: Black needs to press White harder. Cut at a or b instead.]
;W[dl]LB[dk:a][dj:b]C[This extension is too narrow to form a base with enough room for eyes. White should extend to a instead. 

In this position, Black should attack at b.];B[cg]LB[fj:A][dj:a]
C[I was thinking A at first to continue my reach for the center, but felt it more important to protect the corner.

M: Both moves are too timid. The star point b is right for attacking the two White stones on the right, and cutting is right in the center.]
;W[ej];B[fj]C[M: Keeping White divided here is good.];W[gk]
;B[fk];W[kn];B[ci]LB[cj:A][cn:B][ei:a][lm:b]C[This doesn't feel bold enough. Perhaps A or B?

C is better. D is better still.];W[cp];B[do];W[co];B[dj];W[dk]
;B[ek];W[cj];B[ei];W[bk]C[M: This White group is alive. Black should attack the group in the middle.]
;B[en];W[dm];B[hj]C[M: Black's influence is becoming very powerful above this line.]
;W[hm]C[M: White has shape to make one eye, but nothing yet for the second.]
;B[gn]LB[cq:A][lm:a]C[Perhaps I should have played at A?

M: The move you made is too heavy, making a connection where there is no threat. A is indeed somewhat better, but b is much better. A confines White a bit, and makes Black's territory on the bottom a bit stronger, but b threatens to kill thirteen White stones, while greatly increasing Black's influence on the right.]
;W[dq]C[Because I think this was big.

M: This is a mistake. White extends a living group to take a small profit in the corner, but leaves the center group in mortal danger.

Life and death is bigger than expansion.];B[eq];W[lk]LB[kl:a]
C[M: White has not yet escaped, but is coming close. A Black play at a would threaten to cut off this White stone and surround the beleaguered White group.]
;B[jl]C[M: Definitely the right idea, though not the vital point.]
;W[kl]C[M: White gets the vital point for moving out, but is not yet alive. Now is the time to press harder.]
;B[dr]C[M: No.];W[cr];B[cq];W[bq];B[jm]C[M: Black should surround White, not invade where there is no territory.]
;W[ik];B[jk];W[km];B[jn]C[M: White no longer has eye shape here, but can escape. Black would have done better to build a wall around White, and let White have a few points of territory here.]
;W[hn];B[ko]C[M: White cannot be cut here.];W[lo];B[jo];W[mn]
;B[ho];W[io];B[go];W[in];B[ij]LB[li:a]C[M: Not bad, but a would be far better. It also strengthens the Black wall, but at the same time threatens to enclose White again.]
;W[ok]LB[pi:a]C[M: White is reaching toward the edge of the board and at the same time making eye shape in the middle. It is vital to confine White to a narrow base on the edge. Black can attack at a, driving White toward Black's thickness in the corner.]
;B[kk]C[M: This move accomplishes nothing.];W[om]LB[ln:a]C[M: White definitely has shape for one eye in the middle, even with the false eye at a.]
;B[pm]C[M: Better.];W[pl]LB[qg:a]C[Klops [19k\]: beginning to doubt it was worth all that bother  !-How could it not be?

M: Black needed only to focus on building a wall all the way around the White group, filling the largest gaps first. It is not too late to do so, starting at a, even though it is no longer possible to kill this White group.

Smaller fights should be ignored. Infighting should be avoided wherever practical.]
;B[rp]C[M: Don't bother with this group until near the end. You can neither kill it nor gain any useful outside influence by walling it in.]
;W[qq];B[po];W[rq];B[nm]LB[so:A][qh:a]C[Perhaps I should have protected at A, but I wanted to maintain opportunities to attack the group in the center.

M: Definitely not A, and not here either. You are asking to be cut here. Much better is b, or somewhere nearby.]
;W[nn];B[on];W[ol];B[ql]C[Klops [19k\]: biting my knuckles now.
!-Did he see an opportunity that I was missing?];W[ph];B[pg]
LB[qf:a][qg:b]C[M: The right direction, but too close in, inviting a fight. Either a or b is better for wall-building. Remember that you are still ahead on the board, and can afford to let White have some territory.]
;W[og]C[.];B[of]LB[qg:a]C[M: A stone at A gives much better shape, and narrows White's base.]
;W[qg];B[ng];W[oh]C[M: White should capture.];B[qf];W[rg];B[rf]
C[M: Blocking the way into the corner is good.];W[qi]LB[lh:a]
C[M: Now is Black's chance to close the wall all the way across the board, for example at point a. White can still invade this large Black territory, but with correct play Black can confine White to a very small area.]
;B[qj];W[li];B[il]C[M: Pointless. You can't cut this bamboo joint formation in normal play.]
;W[gd]C[M: This White invasion is far bigger than the three white stones you are attacking.]
;B[hl]C[M: White cheerfully sacrifices the three stones.];W[ml]
C[M: Unnecessary.];B[kh]LB[jd:A][gf:B]C[Perhaps A or B would have been wiser?

M: This move would have been very good, if you had made it sooner. A move at A is in the right direction, to protect territory along the side. It might be better to move one line closer to the white stone. B, protecting the center, is definitely wrong.]
;W[nh];B[mg];W[lh];B[lg];W[ki];B[ji]LB[jd:a][cc:b][qc:c]C[M: Black's wall is excellent. Let us count territory.  White has about 15 points on the left, 10 points in the lower right corner, and 15 in the middle right, for a total of about 40. Black has 12 points along the bottom, 10 along the lower right, and  a huge area at the top. Even after White invades, with good play Black could have 30-40 points here, more than enough to win. If Black had played a few more stones here, say a, b, and c, instead of other useless points, this region could be worth 100 points or more.]
;W[kd]C[M: An overplay. A play at the star point would be sounder. Of course White has to overplay in order to break up this large Black territory.]
;B[id]LB[fc:a][mc:b]C[M: This is the right way to challenge White's overplay, if you know how to fight it. If not, a or b is better.]
;W[hd];B[ic]LB[je:a]C[M: It is preferable to connect toward the center at a (which also presses on the White stone to the right). But splitting the White stones in this way is not bad.]
;W[ec];B[dc]C[M: Good. White's base is too narrow for life.]
;W[db];B[fc]LB[cb:a]C[M: Confining White at a is the right direction, since White does not have eye space on the side. There will be time to attack the base of the White group afterward. The actual move allows White to make life in the corner.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ee];B[de];W[cc]C[M: White is alive in the corner now.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[ef];W[eb];B[cf];W[mc];W[ce];B[dg];W[cd];B[df]
;W[nc];B[he]LB[pc:D][nd:B][ke:C][jg:A][oc:a]C[Perhaps A, B, C or D?

M: E. Block White out of the corner, and restrict the White group to a narrow base. The actual move attacks two stones that are already dead.]
;W[pc];B[kc];W[md];B[ke]LB[qc:a]C[M: Play at A.];W[lc];B[jd]
;W[ld];B[kb]LB[qc:a]C[M: Play at a to kill the Black group. First block both ends of the group, then push to the edge.]
;W[lb];B[ne];W[qd]C[M: With this move, the White group is alive.]
;B[od];W[oc];B[rd];W[rc];B[qe];W[qc]LB[sd:a][sg:b][ri:c][sp:d]
[mr:e][br:f][bj:g][be:h][fb:i][la:j][le:k][me:l][mh:m][kj:n]
[pj:o][fp:p]C[M: This group is worth 40 points to White--15 in territory, and 25 by denying Black territory.

Let us estimate territories again.
White 15+15+12+19+8 = 69
Black 12+12+4+43 = 71

Black also has three prisoners. The game is close.

Now comes the endgame. Territories have been established, and only a few points around the edges remain to be settled. There are endgame moves for Black at points a-j around the edges, and at k-p inside.]
;B[sg];W[sh];B[sf];W[ri];B[oj]LB[pj:A][rj:B][qk:C][fb:a][sc:b]
[sb:c][sd:d][rb:e]C[Obviously a foolish move. Better perhaps to peep at A or solidify my position w. B or C?

M: Of those moves, B is worth the most, preventing a significant White invasion. Point D is similar. But these are all gote moves, in which you allow your opponent to choose the next area to play in. 

In these endgame situations, you need to find sente plays first, where the other player has to finish, and you choose the next fight. A play at e is an example. (Black e, White f, Black g, White h.)]
;W[pj];B[pk]C[{blush} No comment needed here. :-(];W[qk];B[rk]
;W[rj];B[rl];W[ro];B[rn];W[so];B[sn];W[sp];B[sr]C[M: Pointless.]
;W[rr]C[M: Black has sente.];B[bj]C[M: This move is gote.];W[ck]
;B[ai]C[M: Now White has sente.];W[bf]C[M: White makes a gote move.]
;B[bg];W[af];B[ag];W[bd]C[M: Black has sente again.];B[fb]C[M: A gote move. White has sente again, and makes a gote move.]
;W[le]C[M: Sente.];B[lf];W[ca]C[M: Pointless. White has given up sente while gaining nothing.]
;B[mh]C[M: Sente. Worth one point.];W[mi];B[nd]C[M: This point, lying between the White and Black lines, is called dame. It is worthless. Black has given up sente.]
;W[sd]C[M: This move gains White two points.];B[se]LB[re:a]
C[M: Black gains nothing by making ko rather than connecting at a.]
;W[re];B[me]C[M: Gote. Worth one point.];W[pf]C[M: Worth two points (one stone captured, and one point that Black must fill) plus ko (one point for whoever fills it).]
;B[pe];W[kf]C[M: Worthless, but keeps sente.];B[je];W[ka]C[M: Sente.]
;B[ja];W[la];B[ib];W[fa]C[M: Sente.];B[ga];W[ea];B[gc];W[kg]
;B[jh];W[nf]C[M: Worthless.];B[mf]C[M: In Japanese rules, Black's capture gains one prisoner but loses one point of territory, so White's play neither gains nor loses. In Chinese rules, White loses a point for the prisoner removed, and Black gets a point for the stone added, so Black comes out ahead.]
;W[cs]LB[ds:a]C[M: A White play at a is better.];B[fp]LB[ds:a]
;W[ln];B[em]C[M: Gote, gaining one point.];W[bn]C[M: Not needed.]
;B[sk]LB[mr:a]C[M: A play at a is better.];W[lr];B[jr];W[mr]
;B[qm]C[M: Not needed. White cannot invade.];W[ds];B[es]C[Again, I duck my head in shame.

M: This move is correct. It prevents a White invasion at the cost of ko.]
;W[dq];B[ks]LB[er:a]C[And again.

M: This time you are right. You must connect at a.];W[er];B[fr]
;W[fs];B[gs];W[es]C[M: White has gained six points here. Two prisoners, one point of territory, and three points of territory denied to Black.]
;B[nk];W[nl]C[.];B[is]C[MaxDWolf [24k\]: time!

M: Not needed.];W[sj];B[ls];W[ms]C[.];B[lj]C[M: White can capture this stone.]
;W[mj];B[kj];W[ak];B[rd];W[aj];B[bi];W[sc];B[pg];W[re];B[pf]
;W[rd];B[el]C[M: Dame.];W[ha]C[M: Meaningless.];B[gb];W[ia]
;B[hb];C[M:
space + prisoners+komi = score
Black 56 +15 = 71
White 74+13+0.5 = 87.5
White wins by 16.5

Learning to narrow the opponent's base and how to kill narrow groups would strengthen Black's play by about three stones. 

A Go proverb says, On the third line, four stones die, six stones live. Get someone to show you, practice both sides and then play this game over, looking for all of the places where you can apply it, such as move 37. 

If you're wondering, five stones on the third line lives or dies depending on who moves first.]
