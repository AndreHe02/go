C[Hi!
This is the first time I ask for a analyse of any of my game. I know that I should play against real people but I am too afraid I suppose :)
Here I played against Gnugo, and it's one of my first 19x19 game I've played.

my comment will begin by my name
i'm not a professionnal so it will be done as i am
i hope it will improve you game as any comment  make you think "is this comment good or not ?"]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pq];B[qo];W[pl];B[qq]C[playing againt your opponent reinforce him
and makes begining of complicated game
 you also intend to live small in the corner];W[qr];B[pp];W[oq]
;B[rq]C[Henri

I think , yes you worried white opening
but your way to go in the corner is small
i would have prefered an option who can work with your moves to the D4 stone (your firts move)

the move number 7 at P5];W[fp]C[Henri

S3 was not so good because you loose sente];B[dn]C[henri
--
The purpose of white at F4 is to build in the bottom
so black D6 don't put pressure on white stone
and is a bit slow if he wants influence];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cr]

white is happy in the bottom
he begin a big moyo];B[nc];W[fd];B[df];W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[cb]
;W[jc];B[pg];W[ch];B[cj]C[Thought that this was a sound thing to do. I hoped that I sooner could play E12, but white won that one.
--
henri the area between D14 and D6 (your moves 13 and 21) is too large. You can't think it's black territory.]

Henri
I think it's more important to have a solid group before attack.]
;W[eh];B[ff];W[gh];B[jf]C[tried to connect my group at the same time that I tried to cut whites groups
--
you can think this only if your opponent play very bad. the area is too large. white can split your groups easily. playing H14 for example]

--
Henri

in anywayr they were too far from O17 
so even you connect it, you looses sente, points, and stiil have weak groups]

(;B[mb];W[na];B[oc]C[could push at N19 too, but I thought that I gained one point by P17
--
henri see variation before];W[pc];B[lc]C[normally I would play N19, but here I thought (probably wrong) about the potential Ko-threat at N17 and at the same time block the big white group.

Henri
as your group is till weak,  M16 would have be better than M17, as it connect your stones]
