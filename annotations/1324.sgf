C[hi, thanks in advance for reviewing this game for me, I felt that both me and my opponent played very well this game, and I cannot find any major mistakes on my own, so I have decided to send this one in for review to see what sort of mistakes that I make that I cannnot personally see right now.

I did have quite a few general questions about some plays though, so I have added questions whenever I was unsure overall (more questions than I origonally intended, but perhaps it will help you to review for me, since you will get to see what I was thinking), and feel free to add comments wherever I may have made a mistake and totally missed somethng.]

;B[jq];W[ce]C[is this ok to do right here or is the bottom right considered more urgent?]
;B[jc];W[qj]C[here I felt that I had to do some sort of invasion, I did not want him to get a good double wing formation. but looking at it now, I see that and move in this area by black would be overcontreated, so I am starting to wonder if a play near d9 would have been better. what do you think?



klin: Play on the right side is correct.  Otherwise B can form a good shape. Either R10 or Q11 is OK.]
;B[qh];W[oj];B[cn];W[cj]C[is it good to pincer here, or would it be preferable to play f3, I picked this pincer because I thought it worked very well with the upper left



klin: Either one is OK.];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo]
;B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[go]C[is this ok? I was debating between this and H17, this sort of seemed better because it gave me g3 later to reduce him, but H17 looks like in a bigger area]
;B[fc];W[oh];B[qf];W[jo]C[here I wanted to start to build something big looking in the middle to scare him into invading so it would be easier to destroy his top territory, but he played patient all game



klin: Good];B[lp];W[gq];B[fr];W[je]C[another middle move, but I was starting to get impatient about the top territory he had (its a problem of mine to worry too much about my opponents moyo)]
;B[hd];W[kc]C[here I was at a loss for what to do, on retrospect I see that this destroyed what I had built in the middle and did not destroy enough territory of blacks, but I cannot see any really good white moves, do you see anything better?



klin: W K15 can play at F15.  If B H16, B H14.  E10 is another good point. K15, L17 are also playable, just a different strategy.]

C[klin: W O16 can P18, if B O16, B Q18 enter the corner.];B[ob]
;W[mf]C[this move felt strange because of the relationship with p12, I could not see any better moves though, perhaps it was something I should have read before invading and adjusted accordingly



klin: W is heavy now.];B[if];W[dg];B[io];W[in];B[ip];W[hn]C[I was very happy to get to play this]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[kn];W[jg];B[jf];W[gh]C[white left side huge now, I felt a little better than before, but still black is thick up top, so attack should not be too hard for black...who do you think is better off here?



klin: W not bad.  B's problem was J5 and the moves after that.  Cutting one W stone is not big.]
;B[hi];W[gi]C[I could not see any better response here, I knew he would ikkentobi downward next, and it would hurt my moyo, but I couldn't see anything else]
;B[hk];W[fk]C[I felt bad doing this, but I suppose it is still 6 lines of territory (if I keep it), so it shouldn't be so bad



klin: Not bad];B[gl];W[fl];B[gm];W[fm]C[klin: W F7 should E6.  B can't cut W]
;B[gn];W[fn];B[ho]C[klin: Now W lost big.];W[ln]C[here I wanted to make the right side big, is it the right idea, or it there something better out there to do?]
;B[ko];W[nn];B[ng];W[mg]C[here I felt like I was getting pushed around, but I suppose I knew that it was going to happen eventually due to the gap I left]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[ni];W[kh];B[ih]C[klin: W should play at P14 now to see how B reponses.]
;W[ig];B[hg];W[hh];B[lh];W[li];B[lg];W[mi];B[jh];W[nj];B[rj]
;W[qk]C[klin: W R9 too soft.  Should S9];B[rk];W[rl];B[qi];W[ql]
C[I felt that I had lost alot of my side in this, but still not too bad, white probably still ahead here is what I counted...was there anything more that I could have done about blacks plays since the attack at o13, or was what I did ok?]
;B[mm];W[nm];B[mk];W[oi];B[ee];W[gp];B[eg];W[eh]C[klin: W E12 should D12]
;B[cf];W[df];B[cd];W[de]C[I did not even see that black sould play these moves here, I was noit paying enough attention, but it was still not so bad to get to play g4, and this sequence ended in my sente (of course it had better, considering how much I lost)



I don't have any other questions for the rest of the yose, but please look through the early part of it, just in case I did something grossly out of order...thanks agian
