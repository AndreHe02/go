AB[dp][pd][pp]C[*h* there are two types of power in this game 1- influence 2- real territory
in this game it seem like you went mostly for real territory
i would suggest you try to even it out a little; or just experiement in playing for influence so you know that you do not always need to go for the real territory.]

(;W[dc];B[fd]C[mqmoore [19k?\]: thanks for the game];W[de];B[cg]
;W[be]C[*h* this shape is odd to me I dont like it but it seems fine
here, we are in a handicapp game so that means black already has 3 extra stones.  do we need to use 3 moves to secure the corner?  I suggest securing the corner with one move.  3-3 or 4-4 then use the next moves attacking black's corners!  we must be efficient in handi games!]
;B[eb];W[ci];B[eh];W[cl];B[cn];W[fq];B[jp];W[iq];B[jq];W[jr]
C[*h* this move seems slow to me; a end game type move
it is not flexible and commits you even more to these stones maybe j4 is better?  moving you toward the outside; you can go for points or run if danger arises!]
;B[kr];W[ir];B[ip];W[qn];B[ro];W[qk];B[pi];W[nc];B[pb]C[*h* just to pause here; look at all your stones!  they are all on the 3rd line; this represents territory.  going all out on the 3rd line is ok; i mean there are different styles out there but i think you should also use the 4th line which represents power and quickness.  in a handi we need to be fast too not just gather points!]
;W[kc];B[jd];W[ic];B[jc];W[jb];B[nb];W[gb];B[hc];W[hb]C[at this point in the opening i felt pretty good - felt i had established 5 solid bases against the 3 stone handicap]

2- play faster (experiment with the 4th line)
3- keep playing - as you gain experience you will gain strength - its just natural.
