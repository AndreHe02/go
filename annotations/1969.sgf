AB[pd][dp]C[TF: I played this game recently on KGS (actually I playing very bad :).

TF: Please can you give some statements about my playing. I have made some comments, to show where my focal interest is.


Yes, it all goes wrong for you after white invades on the right at move 65.

Apart from that I think that you play a lot of good moves in this game, although I have found a few othre things to comment on.

Anyway, after the invasion you play several poor moves. I have suggested some alternatives. I think you sould analyse what happens after the alternative moves yourself. You will learn more that way, and I have run out of time to explore the variations myself.

;B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn]C[So far so good.];B[em];W[cm]
(;B[fp]C[The problem is with your last two moves. You don't really need both of them.

Look at the variations.];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[qj]
;W[qm]C[As white I would prefer N3.];B[nq]C[Good.];W[pq];B[no]
C[Good.];W[pn]C[This is very timid by white.];B[cj]C[This is the point at which you wish you had a better move around here.

You could also consider something like O7, but the move you play is OK too.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed]C[What is wrong with the normal move (Hane at E17?)]
;W[ec];B[gd]C[I don't understand why you jump here?

White is pushing from behind, which is bad. All you have to do is say "thank you very much" and extend solidly. The jump just lets white put cracks in your wall.]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[fc];B[ge];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce]TR[af][bf]C[You should play the hanging connection at C14. That makes more eye-shape. 

Also, in the endgame, white can hane-and-connect in sente, which means that you have lost the two marked points for no reason. YOu can't just give up two points of territory like that!]
;W[el];B[dl];W[dm];B[dk];W[fm];B[en];W[in]C[This is good for you. White's cut has not really gained him anything, and you now have a weak group to attack.

How can you profit by attacking it?

Well, you have two moyos near the weak group. You should be able to expand or solidify one of them while attacking.]
;B[hn]LB[gp:A]C[If, when you played here, you plan was to defend the area at the bottom, then this is good. (Before, white had some aji at A, in a few moves time that possibility has gone.]
;W[hm];B[ho];W[im];B[ko]C[TF: To passive? Perhaps playing around F10 instaead?

I think that this is OK. The bottom area is now territory, and it is quite big. This move also keeps white weak, because it makes black strong in this area, so there is less for white to aim at when he has to defend.]
;W[hj];B[fj];W[hh];B[gi];W[ig]
(;B[fg]C[This move is a bit timid. White could not break in. (See the variation.)]
;W[or]C[white got now some big points];B[nr];W[qb];B[gc]C[Good. 

This is a big move, and it is nice to see that you are not always answering your opponent.]
;W[qh]TR[nd]C[Right, yes, this is where the main problem in the game is.

Let us roughtly estimate the territory just before this move:

White:

Top left: 10
Top right: 10
Bottom left: 15-
Bottom right: 20+

Total: 55

Black:

Left: 25
Bottom: 25 
Right: Well, it is hard to say, becase as we see, this area is invadable. However, those 4 stones should definitely be worth more than 5 points, so black should be ahead.

The other thing to note is that before this invasion, all the black stones are safe, whereas the white stones in the middle as still a bit weak, which is another plus for black.

OK, so how to answer this invasion?

By the way, white's invasion is certainly a good move, but that is OK, you have to allow you opponent some good moves. Black has not cause to panic.

White has invaded, and invasion stones are always weak, so we get to choose how to attack.

The things to think about are:

 * White has a waek group in the middle. If we build thinkness on the right, we can use it to attack in the middle.

 * White has a strong group at the top. You can't attack strong groups, but you can play leanign attacks against them. In this case, the marked point is the most likely leaning attack.

* The invasion tries to split black in to two parts, both of which might become weak groups. Obviously we don't want that to happen in we can avoid it.]

(;B[oi]C[TF: The next moves doesnt look good for me...

Yes, this is not normally a good move.];W[oh]
(;B[pi]C[This is very bad. You are forcing white to connect and make a strong shape.]
;W[ph];B[oc]LB[nd:A][nh:B]C[This is crude. A leaning attack is a good idea, but A is the right point.It might be nest to play the hane at B first. (Notice that it is an eye-stealing tesuji shape as will as hane at the head of 3 stones. How can you resist a move like that!)]
;W[ob];B[nd];W[nh];B[ok]LB[mj:A]C[This is very timid, and it is a bad time to be timid, you must keep the pressure on white.

A seems the natural move to me.];W[mc];B[rc]C[Now the game is difficult for you. You are seriously cut in half.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[of];B[le];W[lg];B[nm];W[ke];B[ld];W[kd]
(;B[re]C[before playing here, There is something else to try.]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[ll]C[TF: White has made alot of profit while attacking.

Exactly. White is now winning.

Compared to the previous count, you have 5 points on the right, bringing your total to 55, and white has gained about 15 points in the middle. 

White should be comfortably ahead. 

You must have played a good endgame to only lose by 11.5 points.]
