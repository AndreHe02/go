C[Dear reviewer,

I played Black this game and won by 0.5, because my oppenent didn't have komi. It would be great if you can make some comments on my play (espetially, I'm interested in fuseki and yose). I'm really bad at yose, and often miss the biggest moves.
Thanks for your time.];B[pp];W[dp]C[Ogronom [5k\]: hi];B[qd]

(;B[qk];W[on];B[np];W[rp]C[Because white can't make two eyes here due to black R3 and R9 , I'd prefer not playing S4.  Instead, plan on running out to N6 or/and pressing with Q10 later.]
;B[qq]C[This is good because it works with R9 to pressure white]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[ql];B[ok]MA[nc][qd][qk]C[Is this move is bad?
My opponent didn't use (at least directly) Q9 weakness, but is this move ok, if my plan was to build moyo between marked stones

I might have played black Q9 solid instead, since after white wedge at Q9, there's still cuts at R10 or P10 to help white.]
;W[rq]
(;B[jq]C[I'm also not sure about this move.
is S2 better?

I like black S2 to keep white from having two eyes.

Now white can play R2 and no more attack !];W[oq];B[op];W[qr]
;B[nq];W[pr]C[
black's attack fizzled];B[fd]C[The plan was to extend upper right moyo.
Again is this too far? G16 (G17) better?
Any comments about possible josekies here?

Idea looks good, any move around here seems fine to me in conjunction with the O17 and P9 stones.]
;W[df];B[jc]C[
I would have preferred L16 or J16.  This K17 leaves probes at both M17 or H17 for white.  The L16 or J16 would make at least one of those impossible.  Better to fix one of your weaknesses than half fix two of them.

Also, white has shoulder play later at L16 .  

The high moves instead are more in keeping with moyo building.]
;W[fc]C[What is the best answer in this situation?
Was K17 a mistake?]
(;B[ec];W[ed];B[gc]C[
Instead of this atari, please consider possibility of D17.  Makes it harder for white.]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[fe]C[
too easy for white];W[pc]
(;B[pd]C[Wrong direction?];W[oc];B[nb]C[
Instead of letting white out, how about O16 for black (not P16 !) makes good profit for black]
;W[od]C[
black let white take away all the big profit.

Too bad for black  :-(];B[pf];W[of];B[pe]C[
black Q13 looks more profitable];W[oe];B[me]C[
as black, i would have probably played Q12 to make sure profit and patiently wait for opportunity to attack white]
;W[oh]C[
What if white had hane'd at Q13 instead ?  Black is lucky here perhaps !]
;B[ph];W[pg];B[qg];W[og];B[pi];W[qc];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[mf]
;B[lf];W[mg]C[
What about white crosscut instead ?];B[lg]C[
I might like solid M15 connection for black instead of this push.]
;W[lh];B[kh];W[li]C[
white double hane looks better, threatens to catch the N15 stone]
;B[cn]C[
This might be a coffee break move.  Defined by Guo Juan , a coffee break move is one that is calmly played elsewhere when there's a fight that's begging to happen.  In this case, since black is strong on top and top right, black should perhaps attack the white stones up there.  Maybe start with O11 ?]
;W[fq];B[bp]C[
For black, I might prefer C12 instead of B4.];W[cq]C[
What if white had played D10 instead of C3 ?];B[ck];W[ci];B[cg]
C[
What if white answers this at D13 and then when black plays C12 white plays D11 ?  I'm not sure, but black should think about that before playing C13.]
;W[cj];B[dg]C[
perhaps white let black off the hook again];W[ef]C[
Now black's upper territory might disappear while black is busy protecting the D13 stones.]
;B[bk];W[cf];B[bg];W[bf]C[
what about white E12 instead ?];B[eh];W[ej]C[
i like white F14 instead ?

I really wanted to either see black expand the top black territory in this exchange, or I wanted to see white trash the top territory while attacking black's left side stones.  I don't see either happening, so perhaps both players missed opportunities here.]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[dj];W[di];B[dk];W[ei];B[fi];W[fj];B[gi];W[fm]
C[
what about white peep at F13 ?

what aboute white cut at M15 ?

Fun game.
