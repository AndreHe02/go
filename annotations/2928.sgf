C[I won with black by time when I was about 7 pts ahead.
I have some questions put as comments, but I would like a general review too.

[DP OK, hope you enjoy the review. I have answered your questions at the points where they arise in the game. Generally, things you did well in the game were a) thinking about the score at several points so you knew how things were going b) fighting skill was good in the middle game c) your handling of the W group up top which you surrounded rather than trying to kill. Things which need a little attention d) endgame - it starts earlier than you realise - keep an eye on that.  This was a game where you went ahead in the middle game and then very nearly lost it in the endgame.  e) consider the whole board position - a lot of your moves are focused on where the current fight is, rather than thinking - he can have a couple of stones here in exchange for me getting a big point at Q10 or something.  f) in the fights, you get quite close with contact plays which makes it easier for W to defend and make shape.\]]

(;B[fq]C[[DP Unusual - G4 is more standard\]];W[dk]C[[DP This is a small move by W compared to F6 on the junction point between W and B\]]
;B[cq]C[Too slow? I wanted to have some atsumi there.

[DP Not sure what atsumi is, but if you wanted aji see the sequence from earlier as to how the G4 move might provide that. I still feel that F6 is the key point here\]]
;W[bq];B[dp];W[co];B[cr];W[gp]C[[DP This is why G4 would have been better earlier. But the big move for W would have been F6, especially since your attack in the corner has strengthened the W wall\]]
;B[fp];W[ho];B[dl]C[I was concerned with the left side, but now I think I could have played at D11. When I played here I planned to have a wall as finally developed, but I did not think he would play E11.

[DP F6 is critical here, to influence the left hand side and also to keep W separated. D11 would have been better by being further away from thickness.  This is a very defensive move (because it is a contact play). It helps W develop D9 safely\]]

(;W[cm]C[[DP Unnecessarily cautious from W\]];B[fk];W[ei]C[[DP Now W cannot cut at E10 because E11 would capture in a ladder\]]
;B[ej]
(;W[dg]C[[DP Don't like this W move - better G7 for instance\]]

(;B[bg]C[I think this is good... is it?

[DP W is letting you get away with a lot here (see comment at move 28) - so you might as well take advantage. However, playing threatening to link your groups with a move like G8 would possibly gain you more. Note how this group will haunt you throughout the game!\]]
;W[cg];B[bh];W[bf]
(;B[fd]C[Planning to do something with the cut at C14 (eg if later playing D15, or maybe B15...) or some profit on the top side.

[DP This is too close.  Your previous exchange with W on the LHS has strengthened him noticeably, and you are now playing too close to thickness.  Also, that exchange has made G7 into a real threat since you can no longer effectively separate W, although the sequence is long and complicated. Given both your LHS groups have centre presence, making a san-ren-sei at Q10 would really dominate the game, putting strong pressure on the W H5 stones from a distance\]]

(;W[ec];B[fc];W[nq]C[Where should I play next? I did not want make it easy to G4-H5, but probably playing P3 and Q6 would give me sente to play K16 or K17...

[DP I like your play at M3. The pincer is ideal to split and attack W groups\]]
;B[lq]
(;W[pr]C[[DP This is a mistake by W - the R3 corner invasion is correct here. Then B has to choose between making a wall facing up the RHS which would be ideal if Q10 were in place, or making the wall facing along the bottom to gain influence against the H5 stones. Tough decision - either is playable\]]
;B[qq];W[no]
(;B[lo]C[Should I have played P6 or R6 instead? (see var.2)

[DP No, you want to keep the pressure on W - this is the best way. A long way further on this pressure tells and you get to split W at O4\]]
;W[gm]C[[DP OK, this is a great move by W, but has W read out all the possibilities? Danger for B lurks if so!!\]]
;B[fm]C[Trying to cut the two groups apart, while not weakening F9 group.

[DP Yes, this is the right way to start, and has been the focal point of the game so far\]]
;W[fl];B[gn]C[[DP I think F6 is a little safer\]]
(;W[hn]C[[DP W should not be playing with these stones given all the cutting points in his shape. Thoughts should be on keeping B separated, for a later attack against F9 stones\]]
;B[hm];W[fn];B[go];W[im];B[hl];W[il]C[[DP Big mistake by W - B can now link all his groups and W is very exposed in the centre\]]
;B[gl];W[jo];B[iq];W[kp];B[kq]C[Here I decided to get the bottom side.

[DP You should be concentrating on keeping W weak and separated. M4 much better\]]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[mo];B[jp];W[ko];B[mq]C[I should have played O4 here...

[DP Yes, it's a big move here - but you do get it next time!\]]

(;W[ln]C[...and he should have played O4 here. Right?

[DP Yep, right on there. Then he would get to attack two weak B stones at M5 against his wall\]]
;B[np];W[pn]
(;B[oo]C[[DP Too much contact play - better to develop with something like L16 at the top\]]
;W[on];B[jc]C[I played here because I felt more comfortable (strong), and I though we were even. Now I feel K16 would be a better point, and I think white is a bit ahead.

[DP Think L16 preferable, given 2 stone wall.  Score? B has about 35 on the bottom, about 5 on LHS and can hope for around 10 at the top as it currently stands - so about 50.  W has about 15 on the LHS, another 15 if he gets the top left (which is still invadable) and should get around 15 in the centre from that wall.  Plus 5 komi, so again around 50 points.  It's very close. In such circumstances, thinking opponent is a bit ahead is always a good thing!\]]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[lc];B[je]C[I think in this attack white lost his advantage. Black better now?

[DP Much the same so far - B groups are looking better but W is using his thickness  around row 5 nicely\]]
;W[qh]C[I knew he would play this... is my response ok?

[DP Yes, you don't want to play near this thickness, and this shores up your group whilst putting Q18 and friends under attack\]]
;B[qb];W[ob];B[kb];W[mb]C[Could I kill this group?

[DP Probably not - see variation\]]
(;B[me];W[md];B[ne]C[Since I think I could not kill, I decide to use it to buid a wall and (since I felt better) share the points in the center.

[DP Excellent thinking. If you can't see how to kill it, torture it from the outside and take profit instead\]]
;W[ld];B[nd];W[lb];B[qj]
(;W[oj]C[Mistake? I think he felt getting the center was enough, but probably P11 would have been the move

[DP I would have played P12 and pushed you against the thickness, again looking to break through around M15 as well\]]
;B[pi];W[oi];B[ph]C[Now my only concern was the cut at G9.

[DP not too much of a problem as you demonstrate with your variations\]]

(;W[gi]C[Probably better to cut at G9? See var.2 and var.3.]
;B[gj];W[hk];B[gk]C[I got confident due to the connection at G7.

[DP Don't forget it's actually a ko!\]];W[hj];B[fi]

C[[DP This is tiny move when there are things lurking around such as the ko corner invasion at C17 and R9 on the RHS\]]

(;B[mh]C[[DP Fair enough, but how about that top left corner ko to demoralize W?\]]
;W[li];B[mi];W[mj];B[lj]C[[DP Now is the time to think about the endgame moves, not piddling around for a point or two in the centre.  They're huge and still open. B2 is B's sente, R9 is enormous, as is F18 as an alternative to the invasion\]]
;W[nj];B[lh]C[I wanted to play L11 here (helped by J9 cut), but I counted and I felt a bit ahead... so I decided not to fight.

[DP Right decision not to fight - but once you had thought that, you should have considered endgame moves\]]

;B[bk];W[bl];B[aj];W[ff];B[gf]C[Wrong.

[DP Well, yes - your thoughts are correct that it's endgame time now, but you're missing the big endgame points.  Still up for grabs here are F18, S4, B2, S8 to name some of the larger ones. Let's count the score approximately. B has still around 30 on the bottom, 5 LHS, 20 RHS, 10 top for a total of 65, whilst W has 10 top left, 5 top right, 25 in the centre, and around 10 on the LHS with 5 komi, for a total of 55.  You're about 10 points ahead, with sente.  If you play F18, B2 and S4 I reckon this improves to about 45 on the bottom, 15 at the top giving you another 20 points and so you would be about 30 ahead.  Compare this (B 85 vs W 55) to the score at move 170\]]
