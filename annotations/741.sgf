C[applinc [14k\]: Hi, my name is Charles.  I played black in this game and won by 55 points.  Though this seems like a very good win I think this was well played by both sides.  That is why I am submitting it for review.

My endgame comment is at move 168];B[pd]C[godzilla [12k\]: hi
godzilla [12k\]: you dont need handi?];W[dp]C[applinc [15k\]: no]
;B[cd]C[godzilla [12k\]: good man];W[qp];B[ic]LB[ec:A]C[applinc [14k\]: Decided to go for the low chinese opening.  I have not studied opening's much though.

Black at A would be the conventional move.];W[kp]LB[oq:A]C[Likewise.]
;B[cn];W[co]C[applinc [14k\]: I remembered this is a bad move on whites part since I get an iron pillar with a 3 point jump.]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[cj];W[pj];B[jj]LB[cq:B][oq:A]C[applinc [14k\]: I liked this framework when I saw it, but did not let it go to my head.

Jumping into the center looks pretty meaningless at this point.  It's really time for
black to start an attack at A or B to limit the extent of White's territory.]
;W[qf];B[nd]C[At this point the board looks a little loose, but basicly sound for both players.]
;W[rd]LB[ed:A][cf:B]C[I think this is the wrong direction to start pressing black - it only invites
him to shore up his positon.  White should be eyeing the long term possibility
of the huge moyo black is clearly hoping for.  Starting a fight at A or B would make
sense to me.  White cannot hope to win if black retains all the area he is claiming.]
;B[qc];W[op]LB[oq:A]C[this doesn't close the corner.  A would be better.  But really, white cannot expect to
defend the entire area mapped, and should be more concerned with what black is  up to.  The previous advice to open the upper-left corner stands.]
;B[po]C[applinc [14k\]: The next few moves were my attempt at an invasion, but It did not seem to work.

The place to invade is on the inside.];W[pp]C[white says "thank you, I wanted to do that"]
;B[pl];W[pn]LB[qk:A]C[weak as black is locally, this is a tiny move.  Black has claimed 2/3 of the board,  and White is trying to take back 5 points.  If you MUST play locallyt, then something
like A is better because it lends support to the weak group on top.  White shouldn't
try to kill black, just force him into a compact shape while taking a matching territory.

But (last time to say it) the big moves are elsewhere.  White's problem is not that black
will make a few points on the side.];B[on]LB[qh:A]C[black needs to learn that not all stones need to be saved.  Rather than defending
this poor victim, he should open a second front, perhaps at A, and give white some
difficult choices to make.];W[pm];B[om];W[oo];B[qm];W[qn];B[rn]
;W[qo];B[qk];W[ol];B[nl];W[ok];B[qi];W[qj];B[rj]C[the silly fight continues.]
;W[rm];B[rk];W[pi];B[rl];W[ql];B[qh];W[ph];B[qm];W[no];B[nm]
;W[ql];B[qg];W[pk];B[pg];W[lk];B[km]C[applinc [14k\]: I thought either I can save O-7 group or use it to get the outside thickness.

The black group is probably beyond saving, and even if it can
be saved, saving it is not the biggest move.];W[lm];B[ll];W[kl]
;B[ml];W[ln];B[jl];W[kk];B[mj];W[mk];B[nk];W[nj];B[ni]C[Surely black must realise he has lost the the fight now.  This is pointless
and counterproductive to building a better position.];W[oj]
;B[jm];W[mi];B[lj];W[kj];B[li];W[ki];B[lh];W[ji];B[jk];W[mh]
;B[mg];W[nh];B[ng];W[oh];B[jg]C[applinc [14k\]: I did this since it looked right, was a better spot available ?

This was a long and silly fight over a few scraps in the center, where
huge tracts are available elsewhere.  These last 10 moves or so would
have made excellent Ko threats at some later point.];W[fc]C[applinc [14k\]: These next few moves were a failed invasion by white.  but did I handle it right should white have not given this up later in the game?]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[df];W[ej]C[applinc [14k\]: White seemed to lose F-17 with this tenuki.

RIght.  Maybe he thought it was not a tenuki.];B[ff];W[ee];B[ef]
;W[de];B[ce];W[dc];B[cc];W[db];B[ii];W[mm];B[ip];W[hq];B[hp]
C[applinc [14k\]: J-3 or H-6 look better in hindsight.];W[jo]
;B[iq]C[applinc [14k\]: Again, H-6 feels better now, but it look good in the game when I played it.]
;W[gq];B[gn];W[in];B[hm];W[kh];B[lg];W[im];B[il];W[hl];B[hk]
;W[hn];B[gl]C[applinc [14k\]: With this, I felt the game was over.  I played very cautiously from here.]
;W[go];B[fn];W[cb];B[bb];W[hb];B[ib];W[he];B[hc];W[gb];B[ge]
;W[og];B[kg];W[nn];B[of]LB[rc:A];W[pf]LB[rc:A]C[not a good choice for white.  Black is too strong to be worried
about this cut.  'a' has a good chance chance of making a live  group.
.];B[oe];W[rc];B[rf];W[qe]C[trying to save everything is a mistake]
;B[re];W[qd];B[pc];W[bn]C[It's clearly a mistake for white to leave the upper right cornet at this point.]
;B[bm];W[bo];B[lr];W[jr];B[jq];W[kq];B[kr];W[ir];B[rq];W[qq]
;B[sm];W[ro];B[qm];W[pl];B[so];W[sp];B[rp];W[sn];B[ha];W[rm]
LB[rm:56]C[White can't ignore H19 !];B[ca]C[applinc [14k\]: OK, I know I killed white, but that was from white's mistake, can white live after this hane?]

(;W[dd]LB[eb:A]C[A is still alive I think (see variation). You have to go for
shape - more important than number of spaces.];B[eb];W[da];B[gd]
;W[ga];B[fb];W[gc];B[hd];W[fe];B[ea]LB[fa:A]C[applinc [15k\]: seki spot I think

No, white is dead.  Black plays A next making bulky five];W[cm]
C[desperation. Not a sound attack, but there are no sound attacks
at this point.  The correct move is to resign.  The rest of the game  is just tactical practice.

Overall, white is a little weaker on tactics, but his severe problem is that  he has no concept of where the big moves are.  Think about where the
ultimate territories will lie, and move to affect them first, no matter what
your opponent is trying to do.  It is not always correct to respond to locally
"forcing" moves.

Black basicly was lucky in this game, because white only very reluctantly
challenged black's overly ambitous framework, and then did so incompetantly.]

applinc [14k\]: Anyway, thanks ahead of time for reviewing this game.  I fealt I played strongly throughout at my level.  I don't play at a 15k level, that was why I did not take the handicap in the beginning. Again, thanks.]
