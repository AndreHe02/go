;W[dp];B[pq];W[pj];B[dd]C[Good move.];W[jd];B[qo];W[qf];B[nc]
;W[fc];B[cf];W[db];B[cc];W[rd];B[qc]LB[hc:a]C[Black is quite solid everywhere now, white is thin. Black should consider an invasion at [a\] sometime near future.

Instead of r17 I would have played on the lower side, probably on the starpoint. Defending everywhere in the fuseki is not a good fuseki strategy IMHO. The top right group could have been treated more lightly. However, black is now soid there so bothe the white groups are now a bit thin.]
;W[jp];B[cn];W[fp];B[bp]LB[dk:a][dj:b]C[I think either [a\] or [b\] wuld have been better - the corner woudl still be open for an invasion, and black stones would work better withe the top left stones. By playing the stone played black is aboout to take a rather low position on the side.]
;W[cl];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr]LB[dn:a]N[Mistake in direction.]C[The corner is small - instead of this hane b should play out at [a\]. (seems slow, but is the best move to move out). Black does not want to see white play [a\] or the place above it or e7.]
;W[er];B[cr];W[ci]LB[ch:a][cb:b]C[[a\] might have been better move here - after it, [b\] becames a nasty move. Also I would still have preferred a move to block black lower left groups access to the center.]
;B[lq]LB[lo:a][dn:b]C[The biggest move on the board. I might have played it one line higher as there is some danger that white will play [a\] and then [b\] to create a large center moyo.]
;W[kq];B[lp];W[dn];B[co]LB[ql:a][jo:b]C[Slow. Black is answering whites moves everywhere. [a\] instead would be booth large and severe. Black must also prepare to lean at [b\] in order to prevent w from creating a monster moyo in the center.]
;W[qm]C[Very big.];B[do];W[dm];B[eo]LB[lc:a][gn:b]C[Black gave sente away again. White can easily tenuki to take a big/urgent point now [a\]. And later if white gets to play around [b\], black gets nowhere with these stones.]
;W[lc]C[This strenghtens white a lot, weakens black a lot and even creates a thin moyo on the top.]
;B[rc]LB[ne:a]C[Good - although [a\] also seems good soo that w won't get all the center.]
;W[cb];B[bb]LB[iq:a][qh:b]C[Slow. Black is again answeting to every white move. Black should tenuki and treat these stones lightly as there is little territory in the corner.

Ideas for a move instead are for example [a\] and [b\], both of which are very severe and big.]
;W[ba];B[bc];W[bg];B[bf]C[Black got abpoout  4-5 points with 6 stones  - not a good result in fuseki.]
;W[cg];B[qk]LB[qh:a]C[Wrong spot. [a\] is better as white is weaker over there.]
;W[qj];B[pl]CR[qm][qj][pj]N[Bad shape]C[This move is bad because of the marked stones. The r7 stone sits right in the vital point.   There really are not any good answers for white r10, proving that r9 must also have been bad.]
;W[pm];B[ol];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[rn];W[om];B[nl];W[nm];B[oj]
SQ[nl][ol][pl][ql][qk]LB[ml:a][nj:b][rm:c]N[Novel move]C[Simple [a\] is better creating liberties. I myself would probably have played [b\] - away from the white thickness. Also Cutting at [c\] is tempting but after that black will get a really bad shape so it probably would not be that interesting before the marked stones get stronger.]
;W[rm];B[oo]LB[ml:a][ll:b][lk:c][mj:d][mi:e][lj:f]N[Wrong direction]
C[This black group you defend is already strong. Your move does not really make it much bigger either. Instead helping the weak group it would have been best to play something from [a\] to [f\].]
;W[oi];B[ml];W[no];B[np];W[mo];B[op]LB[ni:a][nj:b][mj:c]C[No need to connect here. You should treat the marked stone lightly as its only purpouse in the game seem to be it's sole existance. Instead [a\], potentially at some point leading to white [b\], black [c\] -combination, defending the weak group woudl have been good idea.]
;W[ni];B[kl];W[fe];B[lo]C[Finally a tenuki, but what a timing... now the top left group is in trouble.]

;W[hf];B[ee];W[eg];B[ff];W[fd];B[df];W[ho];B[ln];W[nn]C[White should have left these stones go and taken sente.]
;B[mb];W[lb];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[og];B[fr]LB[kr:a][lr:b]C[[b\] is probbaly best local move, [a\] is not so good as it is gote.]

;W[an];B[ac]LB[cp:a][is:b][dh:c]C[Small. Even [a\] bigger. This move is only 0.5 points, [a\] is one point. The biggest move is [b\]. [c\] is a one pointer threathening a sente one point move.]

N[General comment]C[You follow the opponent a bit too much - sente is very valuable, especially in the fuseki.  Also you should realize that you both make severe moves (moves that threathen the opponent), and moves that prevent the opponent from making severe moves against you. Especially in the fuseki, it is always fun to find a move that threathens to do two things.]
