;B[qd]C[Hi. I'm edgy.  I hope you find my review useful.  If you have any questions, please email me.  Also, remember that a stronger player might see things entirely differently from me.  If you don't agree with what I say, you should play as you think best.

I'm told that you played Black, so "you" in these comments refers to Black.

In summary, your tactics seem OK, but  you need to think on a larger scale.    For example, the invasion of the left side starting at the 7th move worked out all right tactically, but was a strategic disaster.  The same for the sequence on the lower side starting around 57.

In both cases, White gained great influence even though Black survived.  This gave White a big edge in the subsequent play.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]LB[oc:a][od:b]C[You can't really call this "wrong", but usually in this opening, Black wants to make a shimari at 'a' or 'b' (P17 or P16).  This works well with the stone on the lower side.  Also, Black could approach one of the White stones.]
;W[jp];B[dj]LB[cj:a]C[I can understand not wanting to let White take this point, but possibly playing 'a' (C10)  instead might be better--it's easier to make a base for your stones on the third line.  Your move is more oriented towards the center, but that might work better if you had a higher position on the right.]
;W[cm];B[cf]C[This is too wide an extension.  When White invades between the two stones, Black can get in trouble.  Even if you manage to survive the attack, the opponent can make a thick position.

Usually when you're invading, you make smaller extensions, because the opponent is locally stronger.

With a small extension, you can carve out some of the opponent's territory while not letting him get super-thick.]
;W[ch];B[ef];W[fd];B[gf];W[dg];B[df];W[bj]LB[fh:a]C['a' might be even more severe, though this is quite safe.]
;B[eh];W[di];B[ei];W[ej]
(;B[dh]C[This doesn't do much for Black.  See the variation for an alternative.]
;W[ci]
(;B[cg];W[fj]C[Now Black's influence is less, and White is threatening to surround the whole lower-left quarter of the board.

The main result of Black's invasion is that White has made a lot of territory on the left side.]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[jd]LB[cc:a]C[Perhaps an invasion at 'a' (C17)?  This is probably OK, though.]
;W[bd];B[oc]LB[hi:a]C[Maybe a trifle slow.  Extending to 'a' (H11) might be better.]
;W[hi]C[This is big.  White can aim at shutting in the Black group, and at making more influence toward the bottom left.]
;B[gh];W[hc];B[ic];W[fi]C[This isn't too helpful for White.]
;B[fh];W[he];B[hf];W[hh];B[ie];W[ig];B[hg]LB[if:a]C[I think 'a' (J14)  is better, connecting your groups.]
;W[if];B[ih];W[ii];B[jh];W[kf]LB[kg:a][ji:b]C[Oops.  This doesn't help.  'a' (L13) instead still leaves a complicated fight, or White could just extend his wall to 'b' (K11).

Over and over, you seem to out-fight White tactically, but the strategic result of the fight is good for White!]
;B[jf];W[kg]C[Not sure about this.  What are those two stones going to do?]
;B[jg];W[pg];B[qg]LB[pi:a]C[This is not a good attack against that stone. A contact play tends to strengthen the stone it's played against.  Instead, attack the weak stone from a distance:  'a' (Q11) is one possibility.]
;W[qh];B[qf];W[pi];B[ji]C[Good move.  I think White is ahead already, and this can lead either to a push into the center to threaten the lower side and the left, or to an attack against White's group on the right.]
;W[ik];B[gq]LB[ok:a]C[Another idea would be to harass White's group on the right, perhaps starting with 'a' (P9), which also starts to mark out a moyo in the lower right.  Always look for moves that do two things instead of just one.]
;W[eq]C[Good move by white, strengtening his corner and and avoiding contact with the invading stone.]
;B[jr]LB[cq:a]C[I'm not sure this should work.  One point closer to the other stone might be better.  This is another big extension as part of an invasion, and again White gets a good result even though Black survives.

An invasion at the 3-3 point in the lower left ('a') is still possible later, by the way.]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[gp];B[iq];W[hp];B[ip];W[io];B[fq];W[fp];B[fr]
LB[lq:a]C[Black should consider 'a' (M3), running out towards the corner and securing a bit of territory on the lower side.]
;W[pk]C[This strengthens the White group, and reduces Black's prospects on the right.]
;B[ql];W[pl];B[pm];W[jq];B[ir];W[er];B[gr]LB[lq:a][gs:b]C[This is bad.  Black sould probably still play at M3 ('a') to avoid being shut in; or he can play G1 ('b') to make eyes for the group.

It's usually best not to let your groups get shut in.]
(;W[nf]C["Although I am barely alive on the lower left, I have just strengthened
white's moyo in the
lower left!"

Well, it took me a while to convince myself that Black is really alive--see the variations.  White should still press you as he gets even more thickness that way.

If you actually saw how Black lives, your tactics are pretty good!

In any case, you have indeed strengthened White. I doubt a corner invasion would work any more.]
;B[pf];W[og];B[md];W[rh];B[rg]LB[se:a][lh:b][lq:c][om:d]C[This seems small. The "monkey jump" at 'a' (T15) is only worth about 9 points.  Since Black is a bit behind here, maybe he should try something else, perhaps 'b'(M12) trying to attack White, or even just 'c' or 'd' (M3 or P7) trying to expand Black's lower right territory.]
;W[le];B[ld];W[mp]C[Now Black can't expand much in this area.]
;B[mr];W[pn];B[qn]LB[om:a]C[Since Black is behind, maybe 'a' (P7) would be better in hopes of complicating things.]

;W[oq];B[qq];W[nn];B[kq]C[This capture is very small.  Black is behind by over 20 points.   An invasion at one or both of the 3-3 points might be tried. Except for that, there's no way for Black to try to win.

I don't have any comment about the rest of the game.];W[mn]
