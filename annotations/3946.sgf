C[mschlat: The file says I'm 17k, but that's actually 17k? on KGS.  I'm guessing I'm somewhat weaker than that.  I'm looking for "big picture" kind of advice.  I often find myself in games alternating between moves that are too big and gote moves.

Hello, I'm Hugo and I'll be your reviewer for today...  You're looking for big-picture advice, so I'll aim to avoid 'this move was good or bad' (which is only useful knowledge if you get to play this game again) in favour of 'this type of thing is bad' (which should be useful for all your games.  As you go through the game you'll see where I've marked these problems.  So, points to improve:

A) You invade where you think you can get away with it based on what looks open, instead of invading based on being behind in the balance of territory.  This is greedy / jealous - learn to appreciate that both of you deserve some territory, all you want is a _little bit_ more than the other guy to win.

B) You must not push on connections between stones that you don't then cut.  You have some good plans, and you can see weaknesses with cutting points.  But you don't punish them.  You often approach the cut forcing your opponent to connect - which is horrible!  Either cut directly, and fight, or leave it well alone - don't force your opponent to connect, he'll thank you for it.

C) You (and your opponent) quite often come up with 'interesting variations' on the standard contact responses.  This is definitely what makes a good player great - knowing when to ignore the standard responses - but most of the time in your games you'll find that actually a standard response is called for ;).  For a partial list see here - http://senseis.xmp.net/?BasicInstinct really learn these.  Maybe play on KGS, and watch some high-dan games, try and see how many times they just play a standard response when in contact, and how many times they come up with something else.  It'll suprise you.

Phew!  The review was written in many passes, so some of the comments may not perfectly well tie in with one another, but I hope it's helpful.  Good luck with your future games, and well done for getting your games reviewed - a brilliant way to improve.

(;B[jd]C[This is an example of A) - although not by you - as b at the moment, I wouldn't invade, after all why not make k3 yourself as black?  Much better to make b area bigger and force w to invade, then w is at a disadvantage.  For me, I like d5 best of all for b right now.  See variation.]
;W[co];B[fp];W[cq]C[mschlat: I have not learned joseki yet, so I don't know if this is appropriate.]
;B[ce]C[C) Standard response calls b to hane, I think joseki would have him play at c2.  That's where i would play as b anyway.]
;W[hc];B[fd];W[fc];B[hd]C[Good.  Not an example of C), standard response is hane, but here that probably isn't what we want, better to start to build this wall.  But it is very thin - w should probably push through at e16 now, making a tiger's mouth.]

(;W[dd]C[This is probably the weirdest move of the game, it should definitely have been as in the variation.]
;B[ee];W[de]C[mschlat: Attempting to cut black.

Great!  I approve of the sentiment.];B[df]
(;W[dl]C[B) CATASTROPHIC!  d8 makes a mockery of the previous d15-for-d14 exchange.  It doesn't matter if you cut at e14 or c14, but you HAVE to cut at one of them.  If you don't want to, then don't play d15 - it's meaningless to help your opponent to connect his stones up for free.

I prefer the simple c14 cut, it secures you the entire corner - the other cut allows b to settle on the left, and you can't really pressure b stones that much on the right since he can treat them lightly.  But you will at least ruin his wall.]
;B[ic];W[oc]C[mschlat: Okay, I'm guessing that ignoring this attachment was a big mistake, but I was looking for large moves and securing the corner seemed appropriate.

Yes, this is a C) mistake.  From a hane, we usually extend.  Here h18 is the perfect move for w, helps with connection to f17.  Other extend option is g17 which is also good, but something is needed so that w doesn't fall apart here.]
;B[gc];W[gb];B[hb];W[fa];B[dj]
(;W[dh]C[mschlat: Trying to invade.

A classic example of A), the best example in the game so far.  This is a truly horrible move.  b has very strong potential above this w stone, a full 9 stones there, which should be exerting a huge control over much of the board.  With d10 black is asking for a very modest amount of territory.  By invading, w is giving b exactly what he wants - something to strongly attack.  Play might go as follows:

(Note that for this example I'm ignoring the cuts at c14 and e14, as you do in the game - in fact they're crucial and c14 should have been played ages ago).]

(;B[eh];W[cg]C[mschlat: Intending to cut at C14

B) Again, CATASTROPHIC.  You're certainly not intending to cut at c14!  You're begging your opponent to connect at c14, which is not the same thing at all!  Once b connects, w is going to be in a horrible position.  Right now is your chance - cut immediately.

C) Also not the standard response - attach hane means you would usually play e11 or e13.  Actually neither of these are perfect since that's going up onto the 5th line quite early in the opening, so I'd go with either the cut at c14 (of course) or maybe c10 as an attachment to get your invading stone out.]
;B[dg]C[Unbelievable response by black!  Truly horrible.]
(;W[ci];B[di]C[Again, incredible play by b, he's betting his whole game on the fact that you connect at c12 and he has time to go back to c14, not a gamble I'd take.]

(;W[cj];B[cf];W[ck];B[ec]C[mschlat: And now I'm in trouble.  I had thought of E16 earlier, but thought other moves were bigger.]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[cb];B[ga];W[ea];B[da];W[db];B[bc];W[hp]C[mschlat: I abandon the upper left corner since I do not see any chance for eyespace.

Another example of A).  In this game you're now quite well behind, thanks to the monster mistake in the top left, but there is always hope.  But to win you have to have more territory than your opponent - and the best way to do this is to make lots for yourself, not try to prevent the opponent from getting any.  q10 is the move for w here, or perhaps r10.  b response to this should be k4, a very strong pincer that works perfectly with his corner q4.  w has to save this one stone and b can take profit on the bottom - see variation for one possibility]

(;B[jp];W[hn];B[hq]C[And here we have b doing pretty much exactly that - taking profit on the bottom.  The two w stones are having absolutely no territory-making effect whatsoever.]
;W[ch]C[mschlat: This looks small, but I was hoping to set up a cut at E11 and it secures the left side somewhat.

True, but it's a C) type mistake - you should continue at j3 or g3.  If you don't, then his connection at the bottom was far too easy - after b j3, your two white stones are doing nothing useful at all.  You must hane here.]
;B[qg]C[mschlat: And this hurts a lot.  My next move just expands me towards b's strong position.]
;W[lc]C[This is okay for w, irritating for b that you are rendering his thickness pretty useless now, he can't really use it to attack you now, so I think this is fine for w.]
;B[ld];W[md]C[Excellent!  A good C) type response.];B[le];W[me]
;B[mf];W[fk]C[mschlat: Aiming at E11 and hoping to take some center territory.]
;B[gj];W[fj]C[Excellent C) again, after the diagonal we usually extend in whichever direction we prefer.  g9 makes more sense to me, works to build a little territory, unless you are anticipating b f11 followed by w g11 cut which is commendable - but a bit brave :)]
;B[fi];W[qj]C[mschlat: Another try at invasion.

Good, now this is NOT an example of A).  Here you are well behind on solid territory, and you've run out of places to expand your area - an invasion now is absolutely necessary to try to recover the fact that you are well behind.  Here you have two avenues of escape - the base to r7, or one-point-jump to p10.  p10 would be worse for you (no definite territory, running towards middle under strong b influence) so b will pick an approach like r6 or maybe r7.]
;B[ql];W[oj];B[mj];W[og]C[mschlat: Attempting to cut off R13.

Good.  And sure enough, you continue to do exactly that.  This is NOT an example of B), this is good play.]
;B[of];W[pf]C[Excellent.  Any other move on the board (except perhaps o14) for w now would be another example of B) play - i.e. p13 is worthless unless you actually do cut him off.

This doesn't seem to work in the game.  But this is mostly because your reading wasn't quite up to it, and that's okay, you just need practice.]

(;W[jn]C[mschlat: I'm not sure why I lose the initiative here.  I'm making my opponent play heavy, but I can't capture the O14 group and can't save the O12 group (I think).  So I try to extend influence below.

You've still got a shot at it actually, though it's slim.  See variation.]

;W[nq];B[kn];W[ip];B[iq];W[jr]C[mschlat: Aiming to cut at K3.

I think you mean 'aiming to force him to connect at k3'.  Don't think of this as aiming to cut - it's not.  You're aiming to force him to connect here.  Which usually is bad.  But here it's okay - your w group is under heavy attack on the bottom, and this is a good forcing move to help find eyespace.  You're expecting (probably) b k3, w l2.]
;B[kq];W[kr]C[Classic example of B) play, this time by b.  This is rubbish!  Absolutely rubbish.  He's pushed where he had no intention of cutting - if he cut at m2 you'd just capture it anyway, and have your eyes all sorted.  He still hasn't protected his cut, so he's going to have to waste another stone there - really poor play by b.  B should in future remember to leave the l3 l2 play unplayed - for a start it would make a fabulous ko threat later.]
;B[jm];W[jo];B[ko];W[jq];B[gp]C[mschlat: This move I ignore to my later peril.

Yes, the old double-atari move, and especially galling when it happens to this shape, because I always consider this shape to be very strong - I've been bitten by this on a number of occasions.  Still nothing like having your stones captured to learn about weakness.]
