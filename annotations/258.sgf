C[(zee) I played white in
this game but I know I could have done better... Pls let me
know where I can improve. Thanks...

Summary:

1.  You made a lot of good moves in this game, but I believe
that you are capable of making better ones.  Some of your
moves were on the slow side -- locally, they made sense, but
perhaps they weren't the biggest or fastest moves available.

2.  You did very well in the lower right corner, except you
didn't finish what you started -- you could have killed
White's group!  I think your game would immediately benefit
if you reviewed life and death situations.

3.  About the lower left corner:  I know that moyos can look
intimidating.  But if you analyze the whole-board situation
calmly and time your reduction or invasion properly, you
should be able to handle most moyos without doing anything
fancy.  In this game, you waited too long to invade.

I have made other comments throughout the game
record.];B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[ce];W[jc]C[Good.  Big
point for both sides.];B[jq]
(;W[cj]LB[cn:a]C[(zee) afraid of black'd double formation

Comment:

I agree that the left side is important, but I disagree with
the move that you chose.

The general principle is that you play in the middle *only
when both sides are the same size*.  Here, the bottom is
much bigger than the top, so you should play closer to the
bottom.

I think the simple approach at a would have worked out
better for you.  (The variation shows one possible joseki.)]
;B[cl]C[This is not a comfortable situation for White.  On
the one hand, White wants to help his single stone, but on
the other hand, Black has a "double wing."

One way to play here would be to immediately invade at the
3-3 point --  you might be able to end in sente and then
come back to help the single stone.

Even if you end in gote and Black is able to squeeze the
single White stone on C10, that stone may still prove
useful.

But once Black closes the corner, I think you are falling
behind, because the corner looks bigger that the upper left
side.]
(;W[cg]C[This is the natural move to help the single White
stone, but in this case, invading at 3-3 first may be
better.];B[ek]LB[ej:a][fk:b][cq:c]C[Black is attacking the
two stones and expanding the lower left corner into a moyo.

The goal here is to help the two stones *and* invade at the
3-3 point.

Here, I would attach at a.  If Black responds at b, then I
would dive immediately into the lower left corner at c.]
(;W[eg]C[This is too slow, and gives Black a chance to close
the lower left corner.];B[dq]LB[hq:a][cn:b]C[This is
painful.  It looks like White is falling behind, but the
game certainly isn't over yet.

In this case, closing the corner may be worth something like
20 points in gote for Black.

However, the Black position is far from complete.  Depening
on what develops on the outside, White may be able to invade
at a or b.  White may also try to reduce from the outside.

As a matter of timing, though, it is too early to worry
about the lower left.  The general rule is to develop your
own potential first before invading or
reducing.];W[pj]C[Good!  Build up your position on the right
side.];B[np]C[It looks like Black is trying to develop a
huge moyo on the bottom.

The key here is to be patient.  Develop your own potential,
and then at the right time, reduce or invade.];W[pn]C[(zee)
Now I am concerned about Black's lower left moyo..don't know
what to do with it.

Comment:

I agree that Black's moyo looks big, but White also has a
lot of potential on the right side and on the top right.

It is absolutely vital, if you want to raise the standard of
your play, to understand that it takes a lot of moves to
turn a moyo into solid territory.

Of course, Black can make a lot of gote moves and make his
moyo safe from invasion -- but each time he makes one of
those gote moves, you can make a big move somewhere else on
the board!

When your opponent has a moyo, you have to make sure that
you have compensation somewhere else on the board.  This
means either secure territory or your own moyo.

So, the way to handle a moyo is to keep developing and, at
the right moment, reduce or invade (or both!).

Keep making big moves!];B[qq]C[The timing of this invasion
is wrong.  It helps White a lot.];W[pq]C[Good.  Split
Black.];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nq];B[ro]LB[fc:a][pf:b][jo:c][hq:d]
[in:e][hp:f][cn:g]TR[ek][dp][dq]C[Black
lost a lot on this exchange.

If you are really worried about Black's moyo, now is a good
time to do something about it!

There are big fuseki points left at a or b, but letting
Black take the point at c looks bad.

Making a deep invasion, say at d, looks dangerous because of
the marked Black stones.

My suggestion is to play a light reducing move, say at e,
which prepares for an invasion at d if Black does not
respond.  If Black makes the normal response at f, then you
can take the big fuseki point at a.

Later in the game, you may be able to invade at g.]
(;W[mp]C[I'm not sure what the meaning of this move is.  It
is gote, and doesn't look particularly relevant to the whole
board.  There is no reason to attack the single, unimportant
Black stone or to help the White group.];B[ql]C[This looks like an overplay.]
;W[rn]TR[ro]C[Good.  Try to punish Black by cutting off his
stone.];B[qo];W[qn];B[ol];W[po]LB[so:a]C[This looks like a
nice, thick move -- it threatens to kill the corner at a, so
it should be sente.];B[qf]LB[so:a]C[This is a mistake --
White may now kill the corner by playing the hane at a.

Apparently, neither player realizes that the corner is
killable for the remainder of the game.

If you want to improve the level of your play as quickly as
possible, you must learn to recognize these types of
standard life-and-death positions.

Aside from the life and death question, this looks like an
overplay because Black already has one weak group and now
may have two.]
(;W[qe]LB[qd:a]C[This looks like the right idea, but I don't
think it fits the present situation exactly.

In general, when you are attacking, you don't want to attach
to your opponent's stones.  I think the move at a is
better.];B[pf];W[nd];B[ng]C[This is a common situation --
Black has two weak groups, and White only has one.  White
almost always comes out ahead in this situation because
Black has to make dame moves to help both groups.]
(;W[nj]LB[qj:a][qk:b][rl:c]C[I'm not sure I agree with this
move.  It's the right idea, but it leaves a weakness at a.  How about exchanging b for c first, and then jumping
out?];B[qj];W[qi];B[pi]C[This cross-cut seems a little hard
to handle.  It looks like Black has now settled his two
groups, which gives him a big lead (assuming that he fixes
the lower right corner!).];W[oj]LB[pk:a]C[a looks better.]
(;B[ph]LB[rj:a]C[Black missed an opportunity here.  He
should just descend at
a];W[qk]C[Yes.];B[rj];W[rk];B[ri];W[rl]LB[pk:a]C[The solid
connection at a is simpler and better.];B[gc];W[je]LB[hq:a]
[ip:b][io:c][hn:d]C[This move is way
too slow.  It is very urgent to do something about the lower
left.

Invading at a looks very dangerous.  I would suggest a
reducing move at around b, c, or d.];B[jl];W[ml]C[Again, too slow.]
;B[ei]LB[qc:a]C[Black should
just invade at a, and the game is over.];W[re]C[This is
wrong.  You must help your three
stones.];B[rf]C[Inconsistent.  Black must continue to attack
the three
stones.];W[di];B[ii];W[gq]LB[jo:a][gi:b][bk:c][db:d]C[(zee)
was this bad? what else?

It looks like it  is too late to invade.  If Black simply
responds at a, I'm not sure how White can live.

At this point, your only reasonable option in the lower left
is to reduce Black's territory as much as you can in sente
by playing moves at the border, such as a, b, c, etc.

You can also invade the upper left at d and, of course, you
can kill the lower right corner.];B[go]TR[jq]LB[jo:a]C[This is not correct, and leads to
unnecessary fighting.  Black must simply jump to
a.];W[ip];B[iq];W[hp];B[jp];W[in];B[hm]LB[kn:a]C[Again, the
wrong direction.  I think White is probably dead if Black
plays at a.];W[jm]LB[jo:a]C[Why not hane at a first?];B[kn]
;W[km];B[lq]C[Black has suffered a big loss.  If White
can kill the Black stones, he is back in the game.]
(;W[lp]LB[mr:a]C[This move is wrong as a matter of
principle.

To live here, Black is going to have to make at least one
eye at the edge of the board.

Therefore, White must squeeze Black from the sides, and not
from the top.

If White starts with a, I think he has a reasonable chance
to kill Black.];B[mr];W[kr]C[Good try.];B[kq]
(;W[mq]LB[hr:a]C[You might still be able to kill Black by
squeezing him at
a.];B[hq];W[gp];B[gr];W[fr];B[hr];W[fo]LB[eq:a][dr:b]C[Playing
at a is better because of the followup move at
b.];B[lr];W[mn]LB[cn:a]TR[fo]C[This move is not necessary,
and is again too slow.

You are behind, and must try to catch up.

How about the invasion at a?  It might work, now that you
have the marked stone in place.
