C[geqv: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
Karthago: yes!];B[pd]C[Hello,
and first, thanks for reviewing my game! I really appreciate it.
My name is Karthago and I play black in this game. My rank is about 18kyu, the one of my opponent 17.
Komi.-5.5


Hi Karthago,
I'm Antoine, KGS 5k. I'll try to do my best !
My comments will begin with [A\].];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk]C[low chinese opening]
;W[ce]C[[A\] I think this is a strange idea from White... but well, many pro games have been played that way, so it must be ok.]

(;B[jd]LB[cn:C][qo:A][jp:D][fq:B]C[I was wondering if this was the best move. It seems to enlargen my moyo all the way on the right side of the board.
Would a corner enclosure at A be a good idea?

[A\]
This is a simple and nice move. It serves two purposes : take the extension of the white enclosure and extend your moyo.
A would not be the right direction with the chinese pattern.
B is a possible strategy too.
But given the upper left enclosure, I think K16 is the best choice.]

(;W[jq];B[cn]LB[kp:A]C[I really did not know where to move. I was also thinking about A, because of the bigger moyo I would get

[A\] This move seems natural to me.
I think A is a very good idea too, leading to a moyo game.

www.gobase.org has 3 pro games with the same start, they all went C6 ;-)]
;W[co];B[dn];W[cl]
(;B[fp]TR[dn][dp]C[Trying to block, because white took my base

[A\] C8 is difficult to answer. I don't know which is the best choice.
I think Black has to somehow pressure the corner in order to prepare a pincer against C8.

This move doesn't look too good because of the marked shape, creating an obvious cut for white.]
;W[fq]
(;B[gq]LB[ci:B][cj:A]C[Seems to be an overplay

[A\] Yes I think so. But I don't really see a good move here locally, so maybe you could switch to a pincer at A or B ?]
;W[gp];B[fo]C[[A\] Good move];W[gr]
(;B[hq]LB[cj:B][eq:A]C[[A\] Saving this stone is not important. I'd go for the corner with A (keeping in mind that the pincer at B is still important)]
;W[hr]LB[eq:A]C[[A\] Still A...];B[hp];W[iq]
(;B[ip]LB[en:B][eo:C][jp:A]C[[A\] Bad move ! It does almost nothing, except making the ladder work. But there are much better ways to capture the stone. Because :
- white A is sente
- it doesn't patch the potential cut problem at B/C
- the stone is still not captured (white might play a ladder breaker later)

See variations.];W[ep]C[[A\] Black missed the chance to attck the corner]

(;B[el]C[[A\] This looks too slow. Black didn't obtain much in the corner sequence, whereas White has a big corner and now the opportunity to play on the left side.]
;W[cj];B[ej]C[[A\] Good direction.]
(;W[jj]LB[ko:A]C[[A\] Not very good from White who could just play A and destroy the black central potential.]

(;B[jp]LB[ch:A][ci:B][ko:C]C[I thought long about this move and if it would be good to cap at A or rather B.
Then I decided to play my strategy of outward influence some more

[A\] Yes, important move. But you could have begun by pressing on the left in sente, before coming back to this move (see variations)
I think jumping at C is better than this move, too];W[kp];B[ko]
;W[lo]
(;B[fr];W[eq];B[ir];W[jr];B[kq];W[lp];B[kr];W[is];B[mq]TR[lo]
[kp][lp]C[Although the separation worked, it seems to me, that it will be quite troublesome and lead to complications. Furthermore it does not stick with the strategy of outward influence, except if I manage to kill the white triangle group.

[A\] Good job in cutting off those three stones ! (see variation at move 33 for a better way to do it)
About complcations, you shouldn't be afraid of them ! Moyo games often end up with big battles.
Now Black has a good game. By attacking the white stones, Black should be able to build solid territory in the center or on the borders. The strategy now is not necessarily killing, but getting profit from the attack.]
;W[jo]
(;B[go]C[This might have been a mistake...

[A\] Difficult to decide. If you save the L5 stone, you'll be attacked on the left. But I thin it's better.]
;W[kn]LB[gc:C][ch:A][po:B]C[[A\] Now it becomes very difficult to attack the center white stones. But black can simply attack on the left at A or take a big point at B or C. Black looks ahead]
;B[jm]C[[A\] Good spot for attacking];W[er]C[[A\] useless move by white at a very important time...]
;B[po]C[[A\] Big !];W[qc];B[qd]LB[jd:B][qk:A]C[Here, I wanted to block to the right side to make use of the bottom and the A stone. B I could rather use for some outward influence later.

[A\] I think it's the good direction, even if A is a little far away]
;W[pc]
(;B[od]LB[oc:A]C[[A\] usual move is A];W[oc];B[nd];W[rk]C[I not sure how to manage that kind of invasions. It did not even seem to promising to me, but in the end white was alive.

[A\] strange invasion...];B[rj];W[rl]

(;B[mj]LB[nc:D][lg:A][ch:C][nh:B]C[This move was a mistake of course, I did not think of Geta. Anyway, I think, all the other moves before may have been wrong too, because they made white really strong.

[A\] Strange move indeed... It's like giving white an eye for free ! I think I'd just go A, B, C (the left is still unsettled) or D.]
;W[nj];B[mi];W[nh];B[nk];W[ni];B[ml];W[lk];B[ok];W[mm]
(;B[nm]LB[ph:B][mn:A]C[[A\] B can take away the eye by playing at A. So he should either play it to attack and try to kill, or switch to B in sente since white has to come back to make a second eye.]
;W[mn];B[ph];W[rd]C[[A\] Black has lost the initiative, so the attack on white failed]

;W[di]
(;B[hl]LB[gl:A]C[[A\] A would be better for making eyes ; but W looks already dead in the center]
;W[gc]C[[A\] the last very big point];B[cg]LB[nc:A][ge:B]C[Either the invasion was too deep, or I didn't respond in the right way...
I also thought about playing A or something around B

[A\] Yes it looks too deep. A and B are the biggest spots.]

Thank you very much again for reviewing my game and showing me some of my mistakes.
I would also appreciate some general comment on what to improve.

--Karthago--


[A\] Yes, the loss at D6 and F12 decided the game.
Overall it's difficult to give you general advice. I think you have a good sense of direction. Honestly if I didn't know your level, I would have said better than 18k ! I think you'll improve very fast by playing and watching stronger people play.
Maybe you have been a little too kind with white, a little afraid of complications and fighting. For example, you could have attacked C8 and C10 stones earlier, or you could have fought more in the center. The S6 group could have been killed too.
So that would be my advice :
1. don't be too passive and follow your opponent over the board !
2. in middle game always try to find a way of playing that lets keep (or take back) the initiative.

Hope it helps,
See you,
