C[Hi reviewer. Thanks for your time. I take white in this game, and lose by a handful of points.

[Y\] Hi, I'm Yan, currently 2k on both IGS and KGS.   I went through the game a few times already.  It's a very interesting game.  Both played well.  There are plays both sides can be more efficient, I will try to point out them as we go along.  I hope my comments will be helpful for you in your studies.  At the end, I will make some general comments on what I think is the most critical areas you may want to work on.  I think that's where you would gain the most.  After all, local moves are just local moves.  Once you get the ideas right, your game will naturally become better.  Thanks.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[oq];W[dq];B[pn];W[od];B[mc]C[I don't know any of these joseki, felt that attaching at r17 would be natural, but my feeling is it would result in the variation shown. a) is this right, and b) is this indeed better for black, and c)are there other options? (my choice, attach at r15, looks pretty awful.)

[Y\].  It's not good to memorize the josekis.  So it's fine that you don't know any josekis.  Eventually you will come to the level where you know the good points locally.  

In a pincing situation, black's main intention is to reduce your base.  It's an attacking move.  A quite severe one in your case.  But since black is not very strong here you have a lot of options.  Attaching at r17 is a good move.  You can also o15.  The point here is to separate the black's stones.  Since black is not strong here, he will inevitably end up with one weak group.]

(;W[qe];B[pd];W[pe];B[oc];W[rd];B[nd];W[qc];B[oe];W[qg]C[[Y\] White ended gote.  Also black got strong influence on the top side.   This is no so good for white.]
;B[fc]C[Given the fiasco in the upper right, how would you respond to this?

[Y\]:  It's a hard move since black is so strong on the right side.  I think your game move was all right.  Attaching makes black stronger, but it's not so ideal for black either since you don't want to use two strong groups to surround one area.  That's usually inefficient.  In your case, it's a bit unfortunate since the area is quite big:-).]

(;W[fd]C[[Y\].  I tried H17, didn't turn out so well.  C14 is playable.  You can leave this area untouch and reduce it later.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[cd];B[ge];W[of]C[[Y\]: I don't like this move.  Black is very strong here.  You want to play away from the strength.  Here you only made black even stronger.  White is not in danger here.]
;B[nf];W[ng]C[[Y\]: Good.  Black cannot atari.];B[mg]
(;W[og]C[[Y\]: Good solid move.]
(;B[mf]C[[Y\]: Solid move.  At first I thought it was a bit inefficient for black.  White cannot do much here.  But white may be able to atari and extend.  See variation. 

Let's look at the result.  Now black is getting more influence in the center.  A reducing move at k15 would be too deep for white.  White on the other hand settled the right group and has the possibility to entend further down towards the bottom.   But remember go stones is placed one by one on the board, so you don't get to play all the big points first all the time.  It's usually trading the big points between pros in their games.  So it's important to keep balance between territory and power.  White has less than half the territory black has right now...]
;W[gf]C[[Y\]: Very urgent move.   Hane on top of two stones.  So this is good.]
;B[hf];W[fg];B[hg];W[dk]C[Would it be ok to play k4 first? After this move, black k4 makes me jealous... wish I had that point...

[Y\]:  K4 is playable.  But this move is very big too and I don't see anything wrong with it. I would play here too to get some territory.  K4 invites black possibly c6.  You will have to give up some area to black, either the right or the bottom.  Either way looks less satisfatory to me.]
;B[jp]
(;W[pl]C[[Y\]  Also consider g3.  It's big move too. Works well with d9.  It also aims to slide in at k2.  So in terms of efficiency g3 may be better.  Q8 is good if you know how to reduce q6-p3 group.]
;B[do]
(;W[co]C[f4 or g3 better?

[Y\] g3.  c5 invites d4 and e3.  You may also consider pincer at d7.  That way you may be able to settle the top group and treats the bottom lightly.]
;B[dp];W[cp];B[eq];W[dr];B[dn]
(;W[cn]C[[Y\] Slow.  E2 is better.];B[er];W[qq]C[Any other moves leap out at you at this point? I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to invade the lower side soon, so inviting black to build a wall there seems peverse... but I can't see anything much worth doing if black gets a move around here. Your thoughts?

[Y\]: Invading is always very hard because you are outnumbered.  The professionals and dan players work very hard never to get into a situations like this.]
;B[pp];W[ro];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[ql];B[rl];W[dm];B[fn]C[[Y\] Black is getter soft now.  I think s9 is much bigger.]
;W[jn];B[jo];W[ln];B[mo];W[lo];B[lp];W[mp]
(;B[lq]C[[Y\]  Wrong move for black.  n6 or o5 is better.];W[no]
C[I think black can get out of the ladder, but will probably suffer a loss anyway, because of the cut at r6 and the scattering of white stones facing the centre, even if they are weak unto death. Apparently my opponent agreed. But are we deluding each other?

[Y\]: This is a mistake for black.  Very good result for white.]
;B[mq];W[mn];B[fj];W[ei]
(;B[in]C[s9 is much bigger.  at least ten points difference.  Likely to be more.]

[ak][aj][ai][ah][ag][af][ae][ad][ac][ab][aa]C[Thanks for your comments.While I'm sure a bit of endgame could have helped a lot here, I'm more interested in your comments on how to deal with the corners... particularly the upper right, but the other three look doubtful too in review. Thanks again!

[Y\]: I enjoyed reviewing the game.   It's a good game and each side did their best.  I'm surprised that 9kyu's are so strong:-).

A few general comments:

1) Don't worry about large frameworks in the beginning.  It's not good to build a large frameworks.  You don't see them a lot in pro games.  The larger the framework, the hard it is to defend.  Instead you should focus on making your group strong for attacking later on.

2) Remember cut and connect.  You want to connect with your own groups and cut your opponents group for easy attack.  This is fundamental.

3) Don't play close to strong groups.  This apply to your own group as well.  If black extended to K17 instead of F17, then it's not good for black.

I think 3 points is good to remember.  Again, thanks for the submission.  Hope you would improve steadily, and most importently just enjoy the game.]

You were worried about the right side.  Don't.  It's still open.   White can easily reduce black in this area.  When the time comes, you can continue with q10 or q9, o10, etc., depending which side you want to jump out to...]
