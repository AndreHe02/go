C[hello, my name is David (CalimeroGo) and I play black

Hi, my name is Peter.  I will review this game generally, focussing on your play, but also pointing out W's mistakes, and how you can get profit out of it (if you didn't).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[fq];W[cn];B[ip];W[dj];B[cf];W[ch]
LB[jd:C][pj:B][mp:A]C[This move is very small.  You can now take a point that's much bigger.  'a' comes to mind, because if W plays there he limits you, but 'b' or 'c also seems possible.]
;B[gd]LB[jd:A]TR[ch]C[This is an okay move.  You could've played a bit bigger, at 'a' for example, but 'a' could complicate things if then W would play here where you played.  So it's more a matter of style than of correctness.

In any case: you're expanding into wide empty territory, whereas W's last move (triangle) was purely defensive and made him almost no points.]
;W[lq]C[Yes, this is the best move, because it extends W, and at the same time it limits B.  For this reason, it feels like double points, and it was a very big move for B as well.]

(;B[jq]LB[pj:A][mq:B][nq:C]C[Very, very small.  'a' would be much better.  If W starts threatening your bottom group you can run out.  Check out the variation that I've added to this move, which starts with 'a'.

A good point about this move is the following.  Usually, W would've played at 'b'.  This is safer for him.  By playing the way you did, you have the possibility of playing 'c' later if he doesn't react.  So your move is possibly sente, depending on how much W dislikes the invasion at 'c'.

But the fact that it's small is more important than the possibility of sente.]
;W[mo]C[You got lucky :-)]
(;B[qq]LB[pi:A][pj:B]SQ[np][op][qp]C[This is too early, I think.  An invasion like this will strengthen W on the outside, and he will probably get sente.  Suppose W builds a wall (rectangles), then plays at 'a', then he has a nice moyo (potential territory), and you will be behind.

So it's better for you to play at 'b'.  Look at the variation to see the result of black 'b'.]

(;B[mr]C[first sorry for my english if he's bad

23: i think Black N2 is too bad ihad play Q2

Peter's comments:
I don't think this is so bad for B.  It's an exchange: B takes the bottom, W takes the corner.]
;W[pr]
(;B[os]C[This move isn't so good.  It's simpler to capture the W stone.  See variation.]
;W[qr];B[rq]C[Yes, this doesn't work for B.  You have seen the result in the game.]
;W[rr];B[rp];W[ro];B[np]C[here black wasn't better on M2?

Peter's comments:
Yes, M2 is a very good move.  You should've played M2.];W[no]
;B[lp]LB[lr:A]C[In the game, you see why this is a mistake.  It's a complicated move.  It's easier to play at 'a' now, that is a safe connection.]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[lr];B[kp];W[ms]LB[pi:A]C[W is too fast with the capture: he can first play 'a' and capture later.]
;B[kn]LB[dr:A]C[is L6 could be stronger on L7?

L7 is better, if you want to run.  But that is not the most important place on the board now.  I think, because you had a problem in the corner, you are now very afraid for your group.  But your group is okay.  For example, if you play 'a' later, you are almost alive.

So it's much better to make a very big move instead.  I have said this many times already.  The biggest point on the board is 'b'.  If W plays here, he makes a very big moyo.  So if B plays there, he limits W's possibilities.]

[qr][rr][sr][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[W is already building on his moyo.  Later, if he can play at 'a', he will be in a very good position.

Try to see this big-scale.  Imagine 'a' being a white stone.  W is building a very big framework.  I have added rectangles, so you can feel it.  I've also added rectangles in W's other frameworks, and triangles in B's frameworks.

W's right side framework is the biggest on the board, if he plays 'a'.  But you can play 'a' or 'b' and stop him from becoming so big.

Also, W can play 'c' later, reducing you, or 'd'.  'e' is not determined: it can become a W group, or B territory.]
;B[kl];W[qf];B[oe];W[pi]LB[ml:B][kn:A][dr:G][er:D][fr:F][ir:E]
[jr:C]C[W has now built his moyo (potential territory).  It's still open a bit, but it's complicated to reduce it.

W managed to build a big moyo, because B helped him.  When B played 'a', he said: "White, please play 'b' !".

In your next game, try to estimate what your opponent will do after you play your move.  Try to see big territories in advance.  And if you have the possibility to reduce, try to do it.

One of the most difficult parts in go is understanding if a group is safe.  Try to see moves that can make you alive.  For example, in the bottom group, W can threaten you by playing 'c' or 'd'.  If he plays these moves, you can play 'e' and 'f'.  This is a bit small, but afterwards you can run away.  So it's not necessary to run away immediately.

If W blocks you from the top, you cannot run away.  But then you can play 'g', which makes your eye space bigger.

So with this group, if you cannot escape, you can live, and if you cannot live, you can escape.  So it's not necessary to escape now.  Playing a big move was better.

Sorry if I repeat myself a lot about this, but I think this is the most important part of the game.  The rectangles is a mistake, but everybody makes some calculation mistakes.  Playing more, makes you stronger in calculation.  But if you learn large-scale strategy, you can make your games more comfortable for you, and your enemy will be in a more difficult situation.]
;B[pg]C[This is a good reduction of W's potential territory.]

;W[ok];B[nk];W[nl];B[nh]LB[oh:A]C[was O12 necesary??

Peter's comments:
Yes, very necessary.  If W plays P12 ('a'), you have a double atari.

This has been a very good series of moves.  You have kept W as small as possible.

Now, in the next move, I will talk about large scale again.]
;W[mk]LB[je:B][ki:A]SQ[pd][oe][of][pg][nh][ph][oi][nj][nk]C[Look at the large scale now.  You have built a very nice wall (triangles).  Now you can use this wall to build a moyo yourself.  For example, imagine that you play 'a', or 'b' if you want to be more defensive.

Now the B framework would be the whole top, and maybe a bit more in the center.  This framework would be so big, that it's bigger than W's bottom and right (including all the prisoners).  So W must invade, and then you can use your wall to attack him.

Playing this way, you can make the game easy for you: you are big, you are strong, and he is weak and you can attack him.  This is very fun if you can do this !  :-)]

(;B[le]SQ[mf][nf][lg][mg][mh][mi]C[P13 instead of M15 to made stones on O12 alive?

Peter's comments:
Yes, P13 is a very important move.  It's unfortunate you didn't see it :-(

If B plays P13, then W's rectangled stones are in danger.  This is good !  See the variation for a possible continuation.

If W plays P13, his stones are safe, so B cannot get the profit that I show in the variation.

So P13 is much, much more important because of this attack, than because of the stones you lose.]
;W[og]C[White knows this sequence.];B[kf]LB[gf:A]C[Okay, you make your wall strong.  Now a B stone at 'a' would look nice: big moyo.]

;W[gk];B[gj];W[fj];B[gi];W[fi];B[fh]C[Okay, here the balance is better for B: you are now working on a moyo.  The wall left, and the wall right, are helping to make the top very strong.  So you started with a sequence that wasn't very good, and you made it good now.]
