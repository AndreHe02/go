RE[W+10.50]

C[Many thanks to the reviewer. This is a game where I didn't make any overly obvious (to me) tactical blunders, yet still lost.

I have included my thoughts, please correct them if they are wrong and explain.

Hi,
I'm Tim
I play on KGS as newsman, 4k

I agree you didn't make big tactical blunders, the areas to work on are strategic and especially direction of play and finding the largest move.

I've made comments throughout as I saw fit. Hope it helps.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dq];W[cc];B[qf];W[rd]LB[qi:1]
(;B[qe]C[I don't understand this move.
When white plays S16 he is staking out the corner. In the beginning it is important to make your stones strong.  When he plays P14 next, your two stones are overconcentrated and weak, so you have to scramble to defend them. 
See my variations];W[of];B[qd]C[This is even worse, You can't push through here, and your three stones are heavy and unflexible. It is better to play light, especially in the beginning. Make moves that give you options, not ones that force you to later defend a weak group. This move only forces white to make himself stronger, and does little for you, as I will show you.]
;W[qc];B[pe];W[od]
(;B[pc]C[I was thinking of following up with s17 and then s15

Neither way works. I'm not sure why you are so determined to break into the corner at this point. It is only one corner. There is a whole empty board. You now have four heavy, awkward stones to defend, while white is playing flexibly and lightly, giving himself lots of options. Better to play around R10, claim the side, let white have the corner and move on.]
;W[oc];B[pb]C[but I then thought it might be good to leave some aji there. I'm pretty sure this is a mistake. 


leaving the aji is a good idea, unfortunately, you are destroying them by continuing to play here. You are forcing white to become stronger. Try not to force your opponent into a strong shape. Try to force your opponent into a bad shape.]
;W[qb];B[oe];W[ne];B[ob];W[nb];B[nd];W[nc];B[nf];W[md];B[og]
;W[mf];B[ng];W[mg]C[OK, this is a good point for comparison. You have a small group on the side. In exchange, you opponent has a strong group on the side PLUS the corner. This was a bad exchange for you. By attacking the aji too early, you forced your opponent to become strong on the side as well. Compare this to the one variation I showed you where you gave him the corner but had groups on both sides of him. Strategically this is much weaker.]
;B[nh];W[mh]MA[pk][qn][cn][dd]C[Here, I don't mind crawling along the sixth line.

crawling along the sixth line looks promising, but the area you are trying to claim is wide open for an invasion. White could jump in at R8-9 and easily make a living group. A move for you around Q9, threatening to claim the whole side, is much stronger. In fact, any of the Xs are worth more than extending just one more stone. 
Think this way. It is still the opening. There are four corners. You are still making all your moves in only one. It is OK to play tenuki and move somewhere else, especially if it is worth more points and gives you stronger groups, or disrupts your opponent's development.]
;B[ni];W[qn]C[Now your opponent jumps into the one large area you have spent the whole game building. All your work is about to go to waste, but luckily your opponent also makes a strategic mistake.]
;B[pn]MA[pm]
(;W[qp]C[R4 is absolutely wrong for white. If white wants the corner, he should just have invaded it. Now he getspushed into the corner while you build a strong wall. This exchange is good for you. But see my variation for how white should have played.]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[po];W[qq];B[rn];W[pq];B[rp];W[rq];B[so];W[nq]
;B[np]LB[co:1][de:2][ed:3][dj:4][jq:5]C[At this point, I need to say politely, enough already. You are letting white decide the direction of the game. Every time white plays a stone, you answer that stone. I see no reason for O4, It does very little for you. You have a very strong group on the side, but playing close to a large group is inefficient. it is better to play farther. The general rule is to play away from strength. That is true for you own strength, and when approaching your opponent's strong groups as well.
Any of the other numbered moves are bigger. You are making a move worth only a few points when there are many very large points left on the open parts of the board.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[mo];B[mn];W[op];B[oo];W[oq]C[For example, have you really gained anything here? Sure you are stronger, but so is white, plus white now has more influence on the side.]
;B[mi];W[li];B[lj];W[ki]C[probably along here should I be making a play against his moyo?

Yes];B[kj];W[co];B[cp];W[dm];B[do];W[cn];B[en]C[I'm thinking I'll drive a wedge into him]
;W[ek];B[el];W[dl];B[fk]C[You have gone from playing too tight to playing too loose. I'm not sure why white doesn't try to drive through at E7 and cut you up into little groups. Your stones are not as strong as they look. Plus, look where they face. They face the bottom side and a wall of white stones.]
;W[ej];B[fj];W[dh]LB[lq:1]C[A move around J10 is warranted here to secure the side. Heck, you've gone to all the work, and white's moyo still has lots of room for an invasion. Before making the J10 move, though, try a forcing move first. A forcing move is one you opponent has to answer that does them no good but can't harm you.]

(;B[ei];W[di];B[fh];W[eh];B[fi];W[cf]MA[ff]
(;B[dj]MA[fh]LB[ff:1]C[I don't get this move. It is an endgame threat, or a ko threat, since it is doomed to failure. Why not jump straight into the moyo with 1? White has a huge moyo, but it is open at the top and your stone at F12 allows you to jump right in. A move like 1 would destroy a large part of his moyo. See variation for one example.]
;W[dk];B[cj];W[ck];B[ci]C[White misplays here. He is too worried about the black invaders, who should be dead. He should instead make a move around F14 to secure his moyo, instead, he gets distracted and lets you into his moyo.]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[aj];B[ai];W[bl];B[dg]C[I think this is a tactical mistake by white. He should play E13 himself, I think.]

(;W[cg];B[eg]C[This is bad for white because it gives you the forcing move at E13. Good for you to play it.]
;W[ch]
(;B[ff]C[You could have jumped farther in. A move like F15 or G14 are also OK, see variations for what happens if white tries to cut.]
;W[ee];B[fe];W[fd];B[gd];W[fc];B[gc];W[id];B[ji];W[jh];B[ii]
;W[ih]
(;B[hi]C[This is another enough already play. How many points are you saving with this move? Two or three maybe? White can't cut into your moyo this way. Instead, you are still wide open at the bottom. How about playing M3-J10 now?]
;W[kg];B[he];W[ie];B[ic];W[jc];B[ib];W[jb];B[if]C[Once again, you are only making a few points here. The group is safe, so defence isn't the issue. Look for the next biggest move. I think you know where it is by now.]
;W[jf];B[hg];W[ln];B[lm];W[mm];B[nn];W[km];B[lo];W[ko];B[kn]
;W[lp];B[ln];W[kp];B[jn];W[hp]C[Well, someone finally took the bottom, unfortunately it wasn't you. Now your stones around E6 are starting to look weak. You have lost a huge chunk of territroy here. Had you played in this area first you should have won.]

44 on the side
30 on the bottom
37 on the top

and for black:
about 97 in the middle.

So black is behind and must force white with the largest moves possible, though it is probably too late already.

However, and move at E1 is very small, only worth one point. white doesn't even need to defend it, though he does.]

What are your suggestions for areas to study?


My suggestions are based on what I've mentioned throughout. 

- try to stop and look for the biggest move on the whole board. A small tactical move in one area may not be as important as a large move somewhere else. If you lose a bit in the first area, you will gain more in the second and be further ahead.

- pay attention to the direction of play. There is a lot of good material on this. Play away from strength - both yours and your opponent's. 

- learn about light and heavy groups, and about thin and thick stones. It is good to be thick, and to play light. It is back to be heavy or thin. The beginning exchange in the first corner was a good example of you making your stones heavy. The example I showed with the forcing move at M3 followed by J10 is light and flexible. This is a powerful concept once you understand it.

- don't move so slowly. You can often make bigger jumps, both away from your own groups or into enemy territory. There are useful tesuji for doing this. I showed you one where you can sacrifice the two stones to get a big jump into white's moyo. Think bigger.

Overall, your basic tactics are sound, but you need to look at the whole board and find the biggest move. Don't be afraid to tenuki once your group is secure and move to another part of the board.

Also, you spent a lot of time following white around. That's often a good way to lose. Force your opponent to follow you. Take control of the board. If you decide where the action is going to take place, you will find your winning percentage increase.  

thanks for letting me review your game. If you have any further questions feel free to ask. And if you find me online, feel free to challenge me.
