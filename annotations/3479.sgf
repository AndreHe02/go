C[ida [19k\]: hi
ida [19k\]: good game


Hello I'm Yannick (5k on IGS) and I will prefix my comments with /Y]
;B[pp]C[

/Y 
In Go, it is considered good manner for black to start in the upper-right corner]
;W[cd]C[Jaydee [19k\]: hi];B[dp];W[qd];B[oc];W[pc]C[
/Y 
W is making the B stone stronger by attaching to it...]
(;B[ld]C[
/Y
Unfortunately B does not use this opportunity, see var];W[fc]
;B[hc]LB[od:1]C[
/Y
1 is a vital point is this position, W or B should play there at the first occasion, see var]

(;W[gd];B[hd];W[he];B[ie];W[gf];B[cg];W[ci]LB[cg:1][dp:2]C[I believe that I should have been able to take advantage of this area, but I was unable to do so effectively.

/Y
What was your aim with playing the stone 1 ? 
The stone 1 is totally disconnected from your group at the top. It is also too far from the stone 2. In short the stone 1 is too close from the W group (which is very solid). The stone 1 is weak so B should not expect to take advantage here.]
;B[ei];W[dh];B[ck];W[eh]LB[cg:1][ei:2][dj:4][ck:3]C[
/Y
Here B obtains an adequate result by sacrificing the stone 1, however this is thanks to the kindness of W. Indeed what happens if W plays at 4 instead of E12 ? All B stones 1, 2 and 3 are seperated, which is bad.]
;B[ej];W[cn]LB[eh:3][ej:1][dp:2]C[Is this an overplay?  How should I answer it?

/Y 
I don't think this invasion is an overplay because the B group 1 is still quite weak (it is close to the W group 3 which is already alive) and the B stone 2 is not settled either.
However because locally B has an advantage, B can make profit by attacking the lone W stone.]

(;B[dm]C[
/Y
This is a strong attack];W[cp]LB[cq:2][dq:1]C[
/Y
Here a B answer at 1 is too mild, B must answer at 2 (see var)]

/Y 
W is handed the corner];W[cq];B[dn];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq]
;W[do];B[eo];W[co]C[
/Y 
This result is quite good for B anyway because of the very powerful influence obtained on the bottom part of the board.]
;B[cm]C[
/Y
This move is quite small. It is not important at this time because it serves only to reduce by a few points the W territory.]
;W[bm];B[bl];W[am]C[/Y
useless move by W...];B[al]C[
/Y 
and useless move by B.];W[bn]C[
/Y
W has saved 2 points... still useless :)];B[jp]LB[pn:2][np:1]
C[/Y
I think the idea is good however it is too close from your very strong wall. In general it is bad to play close to strong stones (whether they are yours or not).
It is better to play around 1 or 2];W[nq]LB[qn:1]C[
/Y 
W plays on the wrong side, it was better at 1 because here the W stone is at disadvantage.
"don't play close to strong stones", it applies here as well :)]
;B[qm];W[kq];B[jq];W[no]
(;B[qf];W[pe];B[pi];W[pf];B[qg];W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[/Y
B is blocking at the wrong side, cf. var];W[pq]C[/Y 
W happily connects and settles his group in the corner
This is a pity for B because now all the influence it has on the bottom side is wasted]
;B[rp]LB[rq:1]C[/Y 
What is the purpose of this move ? If B wants to reduce the corner (which is not advisable as there are bigger points elsewhere) why not play at 1 ?]
;W[rq];B[jm];W[hh];B[jg];W[ne];B[me];W[nf];B[nd];W[od];B[nc]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[pk]LB[nk:1]C[I think this is an over play, but I don't know how to fight it.

/Y 
I don't think this is an overplay because the W stone can easily flee to 1 and then connect to a W group either above or below.]

(;B[qk];W[pl];B[pm]LB[ql:1]C[/Y
B is led by the misconception that W should be punished but this is too strong and B should play at 1 instead]

W should connect at 1 to avoid all the problems that arose later in the game]
;B[nk];W[om];B[oq]LB[op:1]C[When white filled the ko that allowed me to take the corner.  Was this the right decision for white?

/Y 
W should play 1 because it has a lot of local ko threats and even if losing the ko he can connect to the W group above (see var)]

/Y
This is not an invasion by W but a reduction. It is not an overplay because the W stone 1 is connected to the stones 2 and 3.]

In conclusion the key to the game was that B was too submissive at two key moments and let W settle easily into B zone of influence (in the bottom left and bottom right corners).]
