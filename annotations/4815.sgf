C[Hi guys,

Thanks for the interesting game. I thought B was doing very well in the beginning. W played slowly by putting too much emphasis on his upper right group which I thought didn't really need the attention.

Once that was finished, B was ahead, but never did anything effective against W's growing left hand side. Opportunities were missed throughout the game.

Anyways, specific comments are within. Please e-mail me if there are any questions.

Best,

C[I don't like this.

Usually the 'kick' (R15) is only played when B can follow up with a strong attack on the white stones. If it was B R10 instead of W R10, then the kick would be perfect.

In this case, B has no such attack. In fact, W Q14 makes W R10 the perfect extension from a two stone wall. (Plus, the corner is still reducible in sente.)]
;W[pf];B[nd]
(;W[dj];B[fc];W[fd]C[This move is ok but I think it lets B off easy. B has a weak spot at M17 that he wants to protect, and this sequence allows him to do so.

I would have tried some sort of pincer (H17, H16).

I can't totally dismiss F16 though since it works well with your D10 stone.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc];B[jc]C[This is a nice dual-purpose move for B.]
;W[fq]C[Tenuki is fine, but keep an eye on D14.

I think F3 is the right direction but don't think that it totally covers up the 3-3 invasion.
---
I'm not sure this was the right choice; I wanted to do something on the bottom side and also prevent the 3-3 invasion under my 4-4 stone. I figured I could jump here and skip the last stone in the joseki because I already head D-10.]
;B[jp]C[Yeah, no real obvious moves for B here (at least to me). I would start trying to break up the W left hand side, which looks pretty thin. C6 seems like the simple option, and C14 the more complicated one.

---
I couldn't think of a good direct counter to this move, so I just let it be.]
;W[oj]C[Seems unnecesary - your group is hardly weak. Maybe something like M4 instead. Allowing P8 reduces your possibilities in the lower right without helping yourself too much.

---
Honestly I had no idea what move would be good now, so I just strengthened my weakest group when in doubt, in a way that I thought was sente.]
;B[ol];W[ge]C[I like it.

---
I wanted to extend my left-side moyo, and this move seemed a good way to do it.]
;B[hd];W[mk]C[Not much to gain here.];B[nf]C[I like it!];W[oe]
C[I couldn't find a good continuation from this.

This seemed the best way for me to react to P15.];B[ne];W[od]
;B[oc];W[qd]LB[pc:B][qd:A];B[qc];W[rd];B[pe];W[re]C[---
I figured giving up the two stones on Q15 was worth it to get a base like this]
;B[of];W[rl]C[This ended up being great for B. P15 didn't really have any good continuations.

Also, why are you playing S8? With two settled groups, it is just an endgame move.]
;B[rm]C[I know S7 is big but let's start doing something about the W left hand side!]

(;B[pg]LB[pg:A][ok:B]
(;W[qg];B[ok]C[This seems like a good spot to pause. If I were to pick a winner here I would say B by a fairly large margin. He has tons of secured territory while W's is still thin.

I think the main reason for this is W's focus on his right hand side group. Usually, defensive moves don't gain much and are played out of necessity. When you play defensive moves unnecessarily, it is just slow. I think W should look at his group at move 21 and repeat to himself - "this group is not weak!".

B's play has been pretty solid thus far, although I would have liked to seen some moves on the left hand side, before W gets a chance to solidify.]
;W[io]C[---
This was the best move I could think of to enlarge my left side moyo.]

(;B[fj]C[I don't like the sequence that starts here. W is really thin so you should try to split. Reduction is not ambitious enough!

I've included some variations showing how B can simply split W. I don't claim these variations to be even close to what the optimal moves are - they are just examples.]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[ek];B[gj]
(;W[jr]C[W should secure his left hand side.

---
Now seemed the appropriate time for this reduction.]

For the remainder of the fight in the middle I wasn't really sure what was going on. Any advice about this fight would be particularily helpful.]

Well, that's pretty much the game. B was leading, but ended up giving W a HUGE left hand side. I know it can feel uncomfortable to invade a moyo when you are leading, but it has to be done. Besides, W was so thin that it wasn't really that much of an invasion.]
