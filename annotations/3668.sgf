C[Dear Reviewer, this is one of those game I lost without knowing why, I thought that I played fairly well but in the end I was 20points short.

Joonas Tyystj√§rvi: you seem to play somewhat passive moves with too much focus on territory and defending. Try to consider multi-purpose moves that do more than just defend a weakness. I've added some variations and answers to your questions.]
;B[dp];W[pd]C[vatapa [7k\]: thx u2];B[dc];W[pp];B[ci];W[gd]
;B[nq];W[pn];B[jp];W[de]C[JT: good move. Letting white split like this goes kind of against the idea of the "low chinese fuseki".]
;B[cd]
(;W[cn]LB[ce:A]C[JT: better at A, see the variations];B[co]
;W[dn];B[fq];W[ck];B[ce]C[JT: this way, black gets to connect]

[gm:B]C[JT: if you're not going to defend the cut, it might be better to play here straight away instead of A (although B might be a better shape)]
;B[cg]
(;W[jd]LB[lq:A]C[JT: this is not so important. With your strong group in the left, you could invade at A.]
;B[nd];W[pf];B[pc]

JT: not really - black becomes too thick. See the variations.]
;B[oc]
(;W[qj]LB[qb:A]C[JT: this is nonurgent - A is a must.];B[qb]
LB[qh:A][ql:B]C[JT: this is way too big to let black play here. Note that the white moyo is still open at A and B.]
;W[qd];B[kc]
(;W[pr]C[JT: the "elbow hit" should usually be answered (and it shouldn't usually be played unless absolutely necessary). Also, this move is kind of slow in this situation.]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[jc]
(;W[ig]LB[nf:A]C[JT: this move feels kind of slack - these stones are in no real trouble and the shape is not so good. Also, it leaves black an attacking move at A, which would be a nice point for white to build his moyo.]

Ps.: I'm always open-minded for book recommentions. :=)

JT: From the books I've read, I can recommend "Tesuji" and "Attack and Defense" if you haven't read them yet. "501 opening problems" isn't bad if you feel uncertain in the opening, although you shouldn't take its answers as the absolute truth. "A way of play for the 21st century" is great, but I think it's out of print. Most problem books are pretty good - reading is pretty much the most important skill in go.]
