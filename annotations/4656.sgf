AB[dp][pd]C[Thanks for reviewing.  I'm feeling relatively clueless.  I was black in this game and was surprised in the end not to have won.  (Without counting, it looked to me that I had a lead.)

JC: You're welcome. I'm "jewdan," and I will precede my comments with "JC".]
PL[W];W[pp];B[dc];W[de];B[fd];W[ch];B[jc]C[In retrospect, I thnk I probably should have gone to C-16?

JC: C16 is probably the best local move, but I feel it is not yet a good move for a few reasons:

* C12 treats D15 lightly. This means that the threat that C16 poses of undermining D15's base is very likely to be ignored, and White will happily develop other situations until he feels it is necessary to work on D15's behalf.

* With this in mind, the most likely response (if any) will be to secure a base for C12. This means a play at a point like C9, which infringes on your D4's direction of play (the direction in which a group is best used by playing). This makes a kakari (approach) at F3 even more attractive, as that will stifle the hoshi completely.

* If, for some reason, White decides to play the secure but badly cramped C15, there is little aji (potential) left in this situation. That means that fun moves like C14 that would make for an interesting middle game disappear.

* Finally, White will probably tenuki (play elsewhere). This means that black has played three moves in one corner as opposed to White's two, and White will take the lead elsewhere. Having too many moves in one corner, or even on one side, in the beginning is bad, somewhat like moving a single piece multiple times in chess's opening.

Now, let's look at K17. If White attaches at C17, you'll hane at C18, White will withdraw to C16, and you will finish off the sequence with B18. In this position, it will look as though White had played C17 instead of C12, except that the C12 stone should be at C11. This means that White has ruined his own position, so I get the feeling White is reluctant to snatch C17 after this. Beyond this, it is the proper distance from both of your upper corners, and it is also in Q16's direction of play.

Long story short, it's difficult to fault this move. It might be more interesting to tenuki at perhaps O3 (since one does not want to overdevelop any one side), but I think this move is correct.]
;W[qj];B[nq];W[lq]
(;B[qq]C[Probably not the best choice of joseki - should White have made a wall facing R-10?

JC: Yes, the best response to your invasion of the san-san is R10. Because R10 is so good for White, you should play M4 instead. See the variation.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[po];W[np];B[pn]
C[JC: Sorry, this should not work. Black has to play R6 here. White has no way to save the stone or even cause trouble, so he would likely leave and play F3 to get something for his troubles.

See the variation on White's next move to see why this fails.]

(;W[fq];B[fp]C[Would c-6 have been better?  I was afraid of giving up too big a moyo to white on the bottom side.

JC: C6 is no good; White will leap up to F5 and will have possibly evened the game out. However, fearing moyos (or perhaps anything) is not good motivation for any kind of move. Play what is needed.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[go];B[eq]
(;W[fn]C[JC: The solid extension at G6 is better for White, since it allows him to keep sente. See variations.]
;B[gq];W[hq];B[gr];W[hr];B[fr];W[gn]
(;B[cm]C[JC: I think you can go to C8. Even if White invades at C6, his upper right is weak, and you can build thickness to attack him at C14. See variation.]
;W[ck];B[en]C[JC: White is starting to threaten a moyo in the center. Taking a couple of points with E6 is not right; stopping the moyo before it starts with E7 is.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[el];B[no];W[mp];B[mo]C[JC: It is best to leave O5 a kikashi (forcing move) and take the big point at R13.]
;W[qg];B[cd]C[JC: White need not respond to this move. Black should respond to the kakari at O16.

See the variation on White's next move.]
(;W[ce]
(;B[ff]C[JC: The top is larger than the center. The proverb "Corner, sides, center" is usually true.

See variation.];W[nc]
(;B[nd]C[JC: This does not seem to be a viable response. The purpose of this move is to quickly develop shape that exerts influence along the side. White is settled on said side. It may be better to tsuki (attach) at P17.

See variation.]
(;W[od]C[JC: I would attach at Q17; this move can help Black threaten White's stones on the top.]

(;B[pc]C[JC: I believe the atari at P17 is the correct move here. This move allows White to develop at his own discretion.]
;W[oe];B[md]C[JC: This stone is not worth saving; it's not doing anything.Playing P17 to force White to address this stone makes more sense. After White connects at P17, Black has two groups to worry about instead of only one.]
;W[oc];B[pe];W[of];B[pf];W[lf];B[pg];W[qh];B[mc]TR[jc][fd][ff]
LB[je:A][ke:B]C[JC: This move is in the wrong direction of play. White's stones want a center position, and this move hands allows him to take that. Also, your stones at F16, F14, and K17 (marked) want you to jump out in the vicinity of A.

To work all of the stones on the top together, you should play L15 (B).]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[jd];B[id];W[ie];B[hd];W[he]C[JC: A worthless push. Black should take this opportunity to punish White in the center somehow. See variations.]

(;B[ge];W[ig];B[ql];W[re];B[rc];W[rd];B[pb];W[mb];B[lb]LB[jk:A]
C[JC: This is an endgame gote move. I think that playing K9 (A) would be like an ear-reddening move.]
;W[rb];B[sc];W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[ra];W[lo];B[ml]C[JC: This move is a good move, but I like K9 better. Black has about 65 points, and White needs to build territory in the center to catch up, so playing in an area at which he could start forming multiple territories seems right to me.]

C[JC: This move does not work, and it damages the chances of other moves like G12 or E12 by eliminating White's aji in this area.]
;W[dl];B[dj];W[cj];B[fj]C[These stones end up captured.  Was this invasion ill-advised or poorly executed, or maybe both?

JC: Well, since there was no way to make it work, it wasn't poorly executed ^_^;]

MA[hs][os][ln][dg][qk][cl][qf][oi]C[JC: Small, reverse sente, and bad shape. When you have sente, use it!

In Go, there are four types of moves or sequences of moves:
* double sente: sente for both sides
* sente: sente for one side
* reverse sente: gote that removes opponent's sente
* gote: a small move that needs no response

Throughout the game, you want to play these moves in the order listed here (unless one of these moves has a much larger value than one higher in the hierarchy, such as a thirty-point gote move as opposed to a five point reverse sente).

In this situation, you played a one-point reverse sente when A17 nearby is three points. There are also several fairly large sente plays left; they are marked on the board for you.]
;W[ac];B[bb]C[JC: Again, hane at A18. You're costing yourself the points you lost by...]
;W[ab];B[dg]C[JC: Good. White played reverse sente and you responded with sente.]

;W[qf];B[se];W[rg];B[sd];W[sf];B[sb];W[lm];B[mm]C[JC: Just because he plays here doesn't mean you have to. You need to play the sente sequences at H1 and P1 before responding here.]
;W[gs];B[os];W[nr];B[qe]C[JC: Fine, but O1 is still sente.]

C[JC: Small. Play sente!];W[ee];B[ed]C[JC: This move is small. Again, play sente!]
;W[ba]
(;B[cb]C[JC: You've cost yourself again... you need to be less afraid of the hane. It may have cost you in the past, but unless the circumstances are just right, it is almost always the best response to a first-line invasion like this.]
;W[ad];B[ca];W[oo];B[on];W[ps];B[qs];W[fs];B[es];W[hs]
(;B[dn]C[JC: ... what? Even if you take the point at C8, there is no danger here. See variation.]
;W[cl]C[JC: You took an unnecessary gote, and he took reverse sente. You need to appreciate what this means: sequences like this are what cost you the game.]
;B[eh]C[JC: If you're looking to preserve points, F15 is your spot.]
;W[fe];B[gd]C[JC: Don't do this just yet... capture a ko to take a point and wait for him to play E14 before you respond.

On this specific board, this did not really change the outcome, but you need to overcome playing like this.]

Black: 82 territories + 11 prisoners = 93
Result: W+3

JC: Not too bad a game. You played some four ranks higher than yourself with only two stones and came within four moku of winning (though it should only be three; I've never heard of a one-point komi in handicap games before). These points could easily have been accounted for at the stones marked with circles where you restrained yourself out of fear and gave him the chance to come back.

I've got to say, some of your moves surprised me as I would not have tried them myself (to preserve my dignity, I did not mention which ones they are). You showed that you can read, so you're easily ready to step over this obstacle of cowardly moves.

Once you're done looking at this review, you might want to try playing Benjamin again... he might be in for a surprise ^_^]
