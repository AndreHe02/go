C[Jeff: Hi!  I'll post all my comments under the heading "Jeff".  This is my first review and I was about a 15kyu before I took a month or so off.  Let's see how things are...and don't forget to check out my end of the game comments on the very last move.  (I'll try to talk about black as 'male' and white as 'female', but I tend to forget).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[ce]C[boingo [25k?\]: i'm on dialup if i disconnect i'll be back

Jeff: Black probably should keep to a more basic beginning that he understands until he becomes a stronger player.]

[gn][rn]C[Jeff: By this point you should see your opponent's massive framework and ask yourself whether you can make a bigger one.  If the answer is questionable, then I recommend invading and reducing.]

(;W[nc];B[lc]C[Jeff: Because of black's real move 47, it is a bad idea to double approach now.]

Jeff: Yes, truthfully, you probably shouldn't have gotten away with that right side life, but black was very forgiving in order to seal off the center.]

;B[ml];W[tt]C[Jeff: END OF GAME COMMENTS:
White had a really good concept of making bases and keeping them.  She should keep her options open in the beginning of the game though.  An easy way to do this without trying is to try to expand the frameworks up into the center after they have a base.  Try to gain a whole board perspective even when fighting in a small local area.  Ask where is this going?  What is this accomplishing?  And when in doubt play elsewhere because it is most likely worth more points.

If you have questions or comments or I upset you or maybe something I said was wrong, or anything, please feel free to email me at: drgnslyr@twcny.rr.com otherwise talk to me on KGS or IGS(Dragon go server or littlegolem too): Jeff223]

(;W[dj]C[Jeff: It would be to much if black would take this point so you must protect against him taking it.  (Extend 3 spaces from a 2 stone wall is the general rule.)]
)
(;W[cj]C[Jeff: This stone looks awfully lonely which is why I don't think c5 is a very good play in this case.  It can be though - when you own both corners or already have a pincer in place.]
)))
(;B[dc]TR[ed][fd][gd][hd][id][jd][kd][ld][md][nd][od]C[Jeff: This is how black should close the corner.  You should always try to close the corners (3-3 and 4-4 points are considered closed) first.  Then move on to approaches and extensions along the sides.  Then finally go out to the middle of the board.

The problem with black here is that his shimari (corner enclosure) is facing his other stone.  This works well on this side.  But it is only one of four sides.  Approaching the bottom left like he does next is not efficient use of stones.]
;W[oq]C[Jeff: Corners first! :)]))
