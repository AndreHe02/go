;B[pd]C[Black: funkhauser (me)
White: Sel

I'm
not sure what my strength is. I can beat the GNU Go program pretty
consistently with two handicap stones. My opponent was listed as 25k on
IGS.];W[dp];B[ec]C[D17 better?

E17 is an exotic move compared to D17, but it is still playable.]
;W[pp];B[cn];W[dc];B[eb]LB[dd:A][ed:B][db:C]TR[de][cd]C[Not sure about this.

This move is probably ok. There are a lot of choices here, for example A-C. I couldn't say which is best. Actually w's move is a little unusual. It would more typically be at one of the triangles.]
;W[db];B[dd];W[cd];B[de];W[ce];B[df]C[Trying to build thickness.

Good plan.];W[cf];B[cg];W[cc];B[cp]LB[fd:A]C[This move is ok, but you have to remember that you have cutting points in your wall. A move at A could be fairly big, but is not absolutely urgent. Left like it is, w could find a way to exploit these cutting points.]
;W[cq];B[do];W[dq];B[jp]LB[bp:A]C[A move at A would have avoided the bad shape mentioned later and threatened to take more territory in the corner.
The game move is big too, so maybe it is an ok trade.];W[bp]
;B[co]C[This just seems unwieldy, I probably could have done better.

Yes, you have a bad shape here that you could have avoided.]
;W[bo];B[qn];W[qo];B[pn];W[np];B[mq]LB[qj:A][pj:B][gq:C][hq:D]
TR[jp]C[Making a base.

A good goal, but the classic move in this seqence is an extension from your 2 stone wall to A or B and I think that is better here, especially since it works so well with your other stones to make a giant framework involving the upper right 3/4 of the board. The framework has one flaw in the cutting points already mentioned. Now it has another. Often times one can work around one flaw in a major strategic position, but the more flaws there are, the more it ceases to be a useful part of your game plan.

The triangle stone on the other hand is high so it can easily run into the center. If w takes away the chance for the game move, b can play in the other direction at Cor D. This is a miai situation.

I don't think that the game move is horrible, but it is not the best given the situation on the whole board.]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[kq];W[nn];B[ol]LB[qj:A][qq:B]C[Trying to neutralize white's center influence

I would still play a lower extension. If w somehow succeeds in playing A for example, your group is going to be weak. If your right group is secure, you could invade at B and connect to either the right or the bottom.]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[or];B[ms];W[os]C[
Last few moves are small and belong in end game. Focus of interest is b's flawed but huge framework. If b can solidfy it before w mounts multiple invasions he is in good shape. Otherwise, w has 3 corners and so is ahead in secure territory.]
;B[mm]C[Trying to close white off to keep him from leaking out into the center.

Same comment as earlier applies here.];W[mn];B[lm];W[ln];B[kn]
;W[ko];B[jn]LB[jd:A][qh:B][mc:C][fq:D]C[I
feel like I'm building plenty of thickness, but not really forming any
territory. What's wrong with my play here?

You are lucky that w is responding to all of your moves and adding stones to an  overconcentrated group. You have built up a wall, but again it has cutting points. You need to step back and make territory claiming moves like A-C or even D. Go is a game of balance along multiple conflicting dimensions. You are playing exclusively for influence. Influence is very useful, but overemphasis of it leads to a wide open position like you have here.]
;W[qq]C[W doesn't need this move to live. Now is the perfect time for a big territory grabbing move by b.]
;B[pg]C[Strengthening the side.

Good!  Hard to say where the perfect point is, but the idea is right!]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[lc:A][kc:B]C[Keeping white out of my area.

This is good. You could also consider a pincer at say A or B which would work well with your wall.]
;W[nd]LB[pg:A][kc:B][jc:C]C[
This is really a fairly big mistake by w. The game move is joseki when there is no stone at A, but in this situation w needs to extend in the direction of B or C. b exploits this mistake beautifully in the next move.]
;B[jd]C[Trying to claim this area, and putting a little pressure on the O17 group.

Good move!];W[kc];B[jc];W[kd];B[ke];W[le];B[kf];W[lf];B[lg]
;W[od];B[pb]LB[ob:A][pc:B]C[Obviously not the best move. I tend to make this mistake a lot.

Well, the exchange is gote for w, so it is not too bad. A would be aggressive. B would be secure.]

[df][jc][jd][ke][kf][lg][lm][kn][jn][mm][ol][pn][qn]CR[cn][co]
[cp][do]C[Not
sure why I played here. Surely there's something a lot better. Perhaps
playing in the bottom left?

Yes, this seems misplaced, although it does tend to keep w out of your right side. A is a good territory move, but now you have some better claim on territory. In fact, if you can keep it all, you are way ahead. Now would be a good time to find your biggest weaknesses and fix them in sente if you can.  Each of the triangled walls has cutting points which would be nice to fix, but it is hard to do so in sente. Instead, I suggest playing B which w will probably regard as sente and then C which will make a claim on the right side. I think that this also helps the circle stones which are borderline due to their bad shape.]
;W[nf];B[nh]LB[ng:A]C[Sealing him in

Your last move would make A perfect for this. Note that this time there is no risk of a troublesome atari.]
;W[mg]C[N];B[lh]LB[ng:A]C[N12 seemed to weak

You are probably right, but it would have been fine if you had played at A earlier.]
;W[mh];B[mi];W[ng];B[oi]LB[oh:A]C[Here is your hanging connection mistake again. A is the good strong move here. Note the differences between this position and the diagonal hane that I suggest earlier. Careful study of these little details that you have already identified in your games will make you improve a great deal.]

Probably. See alternate line.];W[oh];B[ni]LB[ph:A]TR[nj][mj]
[nk][mk][nl][ml][oj][ok]C[You really don't want w to play A so play here yourself and let him have the stone. If all he does is come out into the triangle area you haven't lost much, but you don't want him in the right side.]

;W[kb];B[jg]LB[bg:A][bn:B][gq:C]C[That formation seemed to have a lot of cutting points, so I wanted to shore one up. Was I vulnerable?

Yes, a whole sequence of cutting points like this can usually be exploited one way or another. It is somewhat less of a problem here because of the relative closeness of the other b wall. Maybe you could still do the A and B or C moves first.]
;W[hb];B[ic];W[gb];B[ia];W[fb]
(;B[gd]LB[ed:A]C[E19 would have been better I think.

Yes, you need to think about the cutting point at A, but it seems to work out. (See alternate)]
;W[ea];B[ep]LB[gq:A]C[Trying to make territory on the bottom.

A is much much better for that.];W[eq];B[en]C[Would F4 have been better?

Yes, absolutely. Your hanging connection mistake again.];W[fq]
;B[fp];W[gq];B[hp];W[gp];B[go];W[hq];B[iq]C[J4 instead?
  Yes, reading out the atari chances of your opponent is not that hard and pays you big dividends.]

Both moves give up territory along the left side even if played correctly. See alternates. This is why b wanted A for himself if he could get it.]
;W[cm]
(;B[dl]C[Big mistake. I was trying to keep him from pushing out, but all I succeeded in doing was losing eight stones.

Yes];W[em];B[el]C[I saw that I'd lost the stones after the move at D8 and decided to stick with the plan to seal him in.

Good idea.];W[dn];B[dm]LB[cl:A]C[Probably a waste of a move.

Yes. If you were going to play here, play A to seal him in some more.]

C[Optimistically,
I would have liked it if all that center were my territory, but it
seemed too open. This seemed like a way to make it more solid.

I see want you are thinking, but your walls are now close enough to each other that I think you can fight off his attacks on your cutting points if you are careful. I like moves like A-C better. They secure additional territory for you and threaten his. Also there is a real weakness at the top at D.]

don't know that the connection was really necessary, but I guess it
made me feel more confiedent about the area at the bottom.

Without it b has no certain life at bottom. See alternate.]
;W[iq];B[lo]LB[kr:A][is:B]C[
Never mind this. Connect at A. It is worth a few points on its own and threatens to connect at B.]
;W[mo];B[is]C[Connecting
the stone at H2 seemed more important than filling in at L5. But the
cutting point at L2 messes that plan up. I didn't notice it.

Yes.];W[kr];B[lr]C[Now, that connection earlier seems like a good idea.]

C[I
was pretty pleased with my play once he started attacking inside my big
area. Did I make any really big mistakes with that? Overall, what are
some weaknesses I should work on? Obviously, I must strengthen my
reading ability, and concentrate on the responses my opponent will make
to my moves. What else?

As I said, most of your defending moves in the center were not needed, but since, as you say your reading needs work, you probably would have had trouble catching only the few truly dangerous moves by w here. It is certainly better to be over cautious than lose the game due to a big blunder at this point. Watch for snapbacks, double atari's, and shortage of liberties chances in particular in these situations.

Besides the reading, I would say to look at when to switch from influence seeking moves to territory seeking moves as a whole board strategic issue. You win here because w did not understand how important this issue can be either.

You show good insight into some of your mistakes in the post mortem. Obviously w did not take sufficient advantage of them and made his own.]
