C[R: Hi. I hope my comments helps you. My nick is egymonk 2k at KGS. 

----
hi thanks for helping me review my game.
this is a game from kgs of 30min for each player. i'm black.
since i don't often play on kgs i'm not sure how accurate is my rank 
(8k) and that's why i wanted to try playing a game with someone a bit 
stronger (my opponent is 1k as you see) but i didn't feel he was very 
strong although i still lost the game.
you will find more question about some moves later but i  also hope you
 can help change some bad habits in both playing and thinking as i'm 
sure all beginners have many. because i'm more afraid of the mistakes 
that i make and don't even notice than the ones i already know that i 
don't understand.
thank you again.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[co];B[ec];W[qf];B[jd]
;W[of]C[i felt weird about 
this move. i don't understand it very much.

---

R: I can see nothing strange about it. W try to force black to deffend 
and build strong shape in harmony with lower side.];B[ne]C[so i'm not sure the way i defended is right?


R: Its not clear what B would to achieve. Its too high to clearly 
deffend the corner (& upper side) but slow to really threaten white.

To deffend its ok to play O16.];W[nf];B[me]C[here i chose to push since pushing on the 5th line is 
good for me. if i'm wrong here please tell me if not does it mean that 
my opponebt's last move is bad?

R: Well, its a bit risky for me to critise 1k players :) But I agree 
with you. O14-N15 exchange is not realy good for white.];W[lg]

(;B[qn]C[here i'm trying to prevent him from making a big moyo.


R: Sure. That a good paln. But you should choose postition that leave 
you two extension possibilites. See variatons.];W[ql]C[R: this pincer is natural answer, and very good for white.]
;B[on];W[np];B[ol]C[i was hesitating whether i should play this or the 
N6 but i finally chose this because at the same time i can get my 
stones out and press my opponent's stones. was i right?

R: You shouldnt press down white since you can invade around R10.

After jump out (n6) B is safe and either r10 or BR corner is open for 
attack.];W[pj];B[lm];W[qo]C[R:]
(;B[oo]C[
R: I think its a "thank you" move.
If you want to deffend R6, try something like R7. Much better shape and
 there is a nice attack opportunitiy at either r9 or r3.]
(;W[rn]C[
R: Hmm. I think white SHOULD answer that peep.
So that p5 is not realy good (strengthening white for nothing).]

C[after that small fight i 
thought that afet my stones were not in danger anymore the best was to 
extend here.

R: Absolutely right. This fight was favor black.
However i feel marked shape weak. I would try to attack it instead of 
simply extend.

(BTW Optimal extension from top left shimari would be at C01.)]
;W[lo];B[dq]C[here thinking that my stone in right side were safe i 
chose to ignore my opponent's move and make some profit here while i 
still have the chance. but later i proved to be wrong. or did i make a 
mistake in the fight? anyway.....];W[fp];B[fq];W[ep];B[eq];W[dp]
;B[bq];W[bp];B[gp]TR[lo][lp][kq][mq][mr]C[is this the right way
 to play this corner sequence? since in the normal joseki after black 
E3 white should play at H4 but he didn't so that's why i played here.

R: maybe it would be more favorable to quickly destroy potential extension space of the weak white group]
;W[go];B[hp];W[ho];B[ip];W[mn]C[here is the move that proved me wrong. 
so shouldnt i have ignored my opponent's previous move or is it a 
mistake in the coming fight the problem?
would the move in the variation have solved the problem?

R: yes variation is ok, corner destruction you made is much better than the few prisoners white's get.

However you can fight. and get some reasonable result. There are many white shapes to attack.]

(;B[no]C[1st  until i played this move i was still under the illusion 
that O4 was a real eye hehe.];W[mm];B[ml];W[ln];B[lj]C[R: W can cut this way.]

;W[pk];B[pi];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[nj]TR[oi]SQ[nk][ml][lm]C[the last moves were 
played to build a wall to attack the upper white group after i realized
 that it was hopeless for my group in the right corner.

R:  good idea. But you should deffend the marked cutting point instead if you attack the upper group. Your Marked  stones are worthless no need to deffend them.]
;W[ll];B[mk];W[km];B[jg]C[with this move i was trying to make a big 
moyo by attacking the white group.

R: thats good strategy (p11 cut is hurts thought now.).];W[jh]
C[and then it gets complicated.];B[kh];W[kg]
(;B[ji]C[R: Proverb says "crosscut?  extend"it will be difficult to chase white this way.]
;W[ih];B[hj]C[R: its dangerous. .  It would be better to keep your stones connected and threaten white.]

;B[ie];W[kf];B[he];W[cq];B[cr];W[br];B[cp];W[bd]C[until here i was thinking that if i could make enough profit in
 the upper area it would be enough to make up for my loss in the down 
right corner. but....

R: yes its a standard move to invade shimari in the corner. White goal to make a "sabaki" (light group) there and ruin territory. 

However you can close it in the corner if you like.];B[be];W[bc]

(;B[rg]C[R: yes, as turned out that is not a big ko threat.

Let white to connect. This is only 18 points.
After connecting the ko white can attack many points. So that its better to simply  eliminate  further attack posibilites instead of ko threat, let white connect and take sente. 

I think black was far ahead before this happen, and taking sente now B can still win even letting white live.]
;W[bb]C[well here it was over.];B[rf];W[sd]C[S13 was a mistake!!! it was not a real threat after all.]

;B[ee];W[fc];B[df];W[dd];B[cm]C[i guess i should have resigned here but just kept 
trying anyway.


R: Yes. This is the end of the game. 

However O12  reverse sente is the biggest move on the board now i think.

Some gerneal comments:  I think in this game you played good whole board strategy. Even better than you opponent what is really surpirsing considering the supposed level difference. 

To improve your style I suggest you to concentrate on solid connections techniques and a little bit more life and death (never hurts :-).

And soon you wont be defeated easily by any 1k-s I'm sure!
