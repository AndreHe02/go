C[krv: I'm playing white.

Two times I've tryed (after the game) to count score.
I've interested if my counts are right.
Also I insert several questions and variants during the game.
All other coments are welcome too.

Thank you for spending your time

Mimulus:  Nice game.  Black got the better of you in most of the fighting and had the game wrapped up until your persistence paid off and  you found your chance to pounce at the end.   I hope I can provide some insight into how you might have avoided the complicated fights and  made things easier for yourself.  In general, I think you needed to pay more attention to making your own groups safe before attacking.  It's a mistake I make alot in my games because it often feels too slow.  But we must have faith that the attacking power of a strong group can achieve more than we might think.  Always keep in mind that any of my opinions could be wrong, too.  Please try and verify my assertions for yourself. Thanks for the opportunity to review your play!]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[qp];B[jd];W[qf]C[krv: I frequently use this fuseki and still in doubt what move is better. I consider R14, C14, C10, Q10, C5 and K4

Mimulus:  Those all seem fine.  My personal choice would be D5, because it's important to complete one corner when you've played two 3-4 stones to open with.]
;B[pj];W[qc]LB[nc:A][nd:B][of:C][co:D]C[Mimulus:  Not sure that jumping into the corner is the best response to such a loose pincer at this stage.  It gives black the chance to build strong influence that works perfectly with black's other stones.   I prefer A, B, or maybe C or tenuki, in which case I'd play D.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]
(;B[oc]LB[me:B][pf:A]C[Mimulus:  This move is premature and only helps strengthen white.  Better to play A, B, or in some cases possibly tenuki.]
;W[ob];B[me]LB[dk:C][co:B][jp:A]C[krv: is P14 possible play?

Mimulus:  For white?  You're likely to create a weak group, helping black in the process.  If it's going to happen at all, aiding that stone is something that should probably  wait.  Right now it's better to focus on big plays like A, B, or C, for example.]
;W[dj];B[qn]
(;W[oq]C[krv: How to play here? Is P4 better?

Mimulus: P4 is good too, but I think I prefer your game move since it's a bit more consistent with your territory-minded strategy so far.]
;B[iq]
(;W[gq]TR[qp][oq]C[krv: or better L3?

Mimulus:  G3 would be my choice since it helps the weaker D3 stone.  The marked stones are stronger, and can thus better withstand the pressure of black's extension without adding another stone.]
;B[lq];W[cf]C[Mimulus:  Good];B[fd];W[bd];B[ch]LB[cc:A]C[Mimulus:  Black should just play at A.]
;W[cc]LB[dc:A]TR[ch]C[Mimulus:  Good.  This is both big on points, and gives your stones a base.  Black would like to block at A, but that leaves the marked stone vulnerable.]
;B[dc]
(;W[cm]LB[cj:A]TR[ch]C[Mimulus:  Okay, but not as far reaching as A.  See var.]
;B[co]LB[eg:B][eh:A]TR[ch]C[Mimulus:  This is unnecessary for black.  Now black has two weak stones (trianged) instead of just the one at c12.  A or B look like the direction I'd like to go in as black.]

(;W[bf]LB[cb:A]C[krv: How to make life here?

Mimulus:  A makes more eyespace than your move, and is also worth a lot more points since it gives you the corner instead of letting black have it.]
;B[bg]LB[bc:A]C[Mimulus:  Black should cut at A, instead.  I don't think white can live then.]
;W[cb];B[af]TR[ce][bf][cf]SQ[cb][cc][bd]C[Mimulus:  The squared stones are called the tripod group, and are unconditionally alive.  Don't worry about losing the triangled stones.  Take sente to play somewhere else.]

(;W[be]C[krv: Is D18 better?

Mimulus:  Tenuki would be best.  The exchange of White A for Black B means White then has to defend with one more move.]

C[Mimulus:  A would save it.];B[bb]LB[bb:A]C[Mimulus:  A killed it.  The 1,2 and 2,2 points are often key in corner life and death problems.  Trying looking at them first when you're in struggles like this.]
;W[ae];B[bc];W[ag];B[ah];W[io]LB[fh:A]TR[eg][dh][ci][ei][cj]
[dj]C[ Mimulus:  I'd recommend doing something to strengthen the marked group first.  A might be a bit too slow but somehow I like it.  If black gets to play there and then a move somewhere central.  That moyo will be too strong.]

[dh][ci][ei][cj][dj]C[krv: Is this move ok? How about J7?

Mimulus:  It's okay.  I'd prefer going after the marked stones, first with A, then maybe with B.  You won't kill them,  but in chasing black, you could reap benefits like strengthening your squared group which could become weak if black decides to attack it first.  Actually, as I look at it, a black peep at C would be bad news for you.  Probably best to secure that group with C right now.]
;B[kq];W[lp];B[jp];W[jo];B[mp];W[ko];B[nq];W[mo]LB[oo:A]C[Mimulus:  A would give better flexibility to the corner group.]
;B[no]
(;W[ln]LB[fh:A]C[krv: N6 better?

Mimulus:  This is better than N6.   That stone could cause trouble, especially after a black peep at A and this just seems simpler.]

(;B[mn]LB[ro:A][or:B]C[Are my O3, R4 in danger? How to defent they ageinst Q3?

Mimulus:  Yes, that shimari is facing alot of pressure now.  A good reason why p4 earlier would have helped by keeping you from being shut in.  A seems fine.  B would be another possibility.]

(;W[gj]LB[fh:C][ai:B][aj:A]C[krv: When I need to break connect with A11?
Which way to attack is better?

Mimulus:  Black should play at A to connect and if Black doesn't, White should play at B to cut black off.  As long as black can connect and has the play at C, white is at a disadvantage here.]
;B[fh]C[Mimulus:  Ouch.];W[fi];B[gl]LB[gh:B][aj:A]C[Mimulus:  Should be at A.  Then Black would be safe and connected and White still needs eyes.  B also makes for problems.]
;W[fm];B[fl]
(;W[ai]C[Mimulus: See var.];B[bh]LB[gh:A]C[krv: Should I play B11 now?

Mimulus: To make the A11 plan complete, B11or B10 is necessary since black can still make a ko to connect.  But  I still prefer A.  It gives your group more life, which is more important here than attacking the black group]
;W[ik];B[bi];W[bj]
(;B[il]C[Mimulus:  Black should play the ko!  See var.  Black  has many escape moves as ko threats and the group will surely break out if white wins the ko.]

Mimulus:  Gosh.  I don't know.  It's all pretty complicated here, especially with two kos in the works.  I would just play at  A instead.  Then your group is completely safe, Black's once looming moyo is erased,  and black still has to figure out how to make another eye or play the ko to make that lower left group live.]

C[krv: Should I fint better ko treat? Is A18 enough?
Or simple ignore this ko?

Mimulus:  I don't think this ko will help black.  The ko to stop is the one that starts when black plays A.  I'd play there now. When black fills the ko, capture at B and then any struggling black does is probably just going to help you.]
