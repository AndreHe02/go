C[Hi, I'm Funaru-10k, your Reviewer. I hope i'll help you to improve your play. :)]
;B[jc];W[dd];B[ij]C[moehome: think it would have been better to play on L4/ K3 or C4/D3

funaru: No, this move is totally ok. But maybe it's better for you at your strenght to play at the star-points, because you can avoid difficult josekis this way.]
;W[ck];B[je]C[maybe this one is too small

funaru: Might seem so, but I think it's big enough.];W[kk];B[kj]
C[too close, isn't it?

funaru: yes, at this stage of the game you should better first care about carving out  territories losely, this play leads to a fight.]
;W[jj]C[funaru: see my variation here]
(;B[jk]C[funaru: This is too greedy. You want to kill the white stone, but thats not possible, because it gets 3 liberties and you have only 2 with two stones. 
It would be better to give the atari from the other side];W[ji]
LB[kj:1][jk:2]TR[ik]C[funaru: that doesn't look very good for you. You have a bad cut and white has more liberties. You should care for]
;B[jh];W[ii];B[hi]SQ[ik]C[funaru: It's getting worse for you, white can give a double-atari. 
> You have left too much cuts with your play, because you were probably trying to kill the whole whithe group. You should not be so agressive. ;)]
;W[ik];B[hj];W[ih];B[hg];W[ig];B[if];W[jf];B[jg];W[kf];B[kg]
C[should I threat the group at J5 instead?

funaru: Even that would be useless, becaus white can catch the black stone on k3. Maybe try to kill the white two stones in a ladder at m8, but you shoud also care about the cuts.]
;W[lg];B[kh];W[ki];B[lh];W[lf];B[li];W[lj];B[hh];W[jl]C[funaru: I would play at h9, it's a better shape.]
;B[gf];W[id];B[jd];W[ie];B[hf]C[better to play at J11? 

funaru: Not at all. The stone which is atari is a quite usefu cutting-stonel.]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[gd];B[hd];W[he];B[hc];W[ge];B[fd];W[hb];B[gc]
;W[jb];B[fe]C[funaru: White failed to care about the liberties of his group.]
;W[kd];B[kb];W[kc];B[ja];W[lb];B[jb];W[ke];B[ha]C[this one necerssary?

funaru: No it isn't. This white stone can never escape.];W[ef]
;B[fh]C[should I have attacked lower?

funaru: Yes. First attack the corners! The middle is too small.]
;W[dh];B[fj];W[gk];B[hk];W[hl];B[gj]C[this one is unnecerssary, as well, isn't it?

funaru: Yes, it's small and not sente. Very big was an invasion at c11!]
;W[fk];B[ek];W[el]C[funaru: F2 doesn't work. See my variation.]

(;B[dl]C[should be at F2, or E4

funaru: E4 is ok.];W[ej];B[dk];W[fm];B[dj];W[ei];B[dm];W[gm]
;B[em];W[fl];B[cj];W[bk];B[bj];W[ak];B[bm]C[was that group @ B3 already dead?

funaru: Yes, nearly dead. C11 is still huge!];W[ch];B[bh];W[bg]
C[funaru: Be careful, white can play at B5 and your stone is catched.]
;B[ee]TR[fd][fe]C[funaru: This is a bad shape, called empty triangle. You should avoid it if you'r able to.]
;W[de];B[dc]C[funaru: if white plays at e11, you are in trouble.]
;W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[ca];W[ba];B[da];W[ab];B[cd];W[bd];B[bb]
C[that one was foolish, wasn't it?

Funaru: As foolish as c10 before. But at your level it's not bad to test everything.
You were lucky, because white made several mistakes from now on.]
;W[bc];B[ce];W[ec];B[df];W[ed];B[eb];W[be];B[cf];W[eg];B[fc]
;W[bi];B[de]C[not needed again?!

funaru: Right.  Now A4 was the important move!];W[aj]C[funaru: White is living again...]
