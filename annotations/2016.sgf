RE[W+25.5]

C[[Hello.
I'm ziggystar and playing as black. My opponent AbbaddonsGo was rated as 28k at IGS but I think he is about 5 stones better. I'm requesting this review for both him and me. So please comment on both player's moves.

I was expecting to have an easy win because of the difference in stones. But during midgame one of my groups was struggling badly and it seemed to me that I would lose the game.
But in the end I managed to accumulate some smaller victories and won by around 40 points.

Thank you for the review.\]

[G\] Hi, I will precede my comments with [G\]. I will try to comment on anything I can.  
Please feel free to ask more questions by email (gbohus@yahoo.com)  if something is not clear. I have inserted some uncommented variations -- think of them as thought experiments. They are just other ways thing could have turned out and you can try to judge if they are better or worth for the player who might have played
differently.

[G\] I was wondering why you didn't play with some handicap. I understand it's up to black on IGS to set the handicap as the first move.

[G\] Some general comments follow, more are in the game.
0. You both seem to be stronger than your IGS rank. (AbaddonsGo is 24k on IGS when I write this.)
1. You follow through local fights to the point where they are worth much less than any of several other moves elsewhere on the board. You should stop
after each move and look around the board to see where else you could play.
2. You both missed some big moves. These were mostly on the left where black could have taken away a lot of territory which white took as granted.
3. Black is a little timid; she(?) had several chances of capturing small white groups and getting some territory when she defended instead.

;B[fp];W[hp];B[fn];W[go]C[[G\] I'm not sure this is such a great idea. Black will almost certainly connect which only makes it stronger.]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[gn]
(;W[hn];B[gj];W[jd]C[white: I played somewhere else because I thought the marked (X) group would later easily become alive. (partly because I underestimated my opponent)

[G\] (For some reason I don't see the marks, but I assume you are talking about h4, g5, h6.) Well, it is quite open on the right but it's not a strong group for sure. K16 is quite a big point, so it's ok. 

[G\] You seem to take it for granted that the lower left corner is yours but an invasion at C5 could be quite successful. I inserted some variations.]

(;B[pj];W[nc]LB[pf:B][qf:A]C[white: Probably not a good move. Strengthening blacks right side while gaining not very much. R14/15 (A/B) would probably be better.]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[nf];W[me];B[mf];W[lf];B[lg]C[[G\] Too many cutpoints on blacks side.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[qh]MA[mg][of][pe]LB[pj:A]C[white: I thought I would be able to exploit black's weaknesses around P16 (X) or sneak under Q10 (A)

[G\] Black certainly has many cutpoints which you have marked.]

(;W[rc]C[[G\] I probably would have defended and kept black separated. See var. for one possible continuation.]
;B[oc];W[sd];B[rb];W[sc];B[sb]C[[G\] An endgame move worth about 2 points while half the board is empty. These can be also kept as small ko threats.]
;W[se];B[hd]C[white: Seemed like overplay to me. Turned out to become a living group.

[G\] Looks like there is enough room there to live especially that black might be able to connect out. White looks a little cramped now.]
;W[hf];B[if];W[ie];B[he];W[gf]
(;B[fc]C[[G\] I think black had a chance to kill the white group here. See some possible variations.]
;W[hc];B[id];W[je];B[ic];W[jc]
(;B[hb]C[[G\] Again, a little less defensive play, namely k18 by black might have been trouble for white.]

;W[ge];B[jb];W[kb]
(;B[ia]C[[G\] Same comment for black: this group is already alive without that move.]
;W[dj]C[[G\] Big move. Could have been made earlier probably, although I realize that at this stage of your go playing life more immediate points seem to be worth more.]
;B[jp]MA[fn][fo][fp][gn]C[white: That's the move that changed the game for me. Now the marked (X) stones are in trouble.

[G\] Your marks are on the black stones... (?) White can run north-north-east and south. I experimented with a couple of variations.]

(;W[io]LB[gp:A]C[white: This move looked wrong to me after black G4 (A).]
;B[gp];W[ho]C[[G\] Not a nice shape.];B[hm];W[hq];B[jn];W[jo]
LB[hq:A]C[white: After gaining some liberties with H3 (A) I'm now trying to create many cutting points which finally worked.
[G\] Yes. Now and in the next few moves black made the typical beginner's mistake of trying to kill a group from too close and hence creating cutpoints. A distance of two or three from the group you're trying to kill is better.]

Now I count:
white (X) around 90
black (O) around 90, too

Still open.


Criticism on territory evaluation is welcome.

[G\] Looks ok to me but you should be aware that not all of this settled yet. Both the big black moyo in the center and white's big left
are quite invadable, especially the latter.];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr]

(;W[kr]C[*AbaddonsGo*: i think it was too soon for me to play someone of your strength
ziggystar: Why?
ziggystar: You seem to win.
ziggystar: At least it's not decided for me.
*AbaddonsGo*: it looks pretty clear to me, hmmm

[G\] No need to defend here. Your group is quite safe and this is only worth a few points. See variation on what happens if you play elsewhere.]
;B[gg];W[ee]C[*AbaddonsGo*: altho this game is fun, because many people at my rank dont play correctly]

;W[hg];B[hh];W[ih];B[jh]LB[jg:A]C[white: I think black shoud have connected here at (A) instead.
[G\] I would prefer that, too. (From black's point of view.)]
;W[ii];B[ji];W[jg]C[ziggystar: Snapback.
*AbaddonsGo*: just saw it];B[ij];W[hi];B[gh];W[ik]MA[jk][jl]
C[white: No real gain from this sequence as it turned out the marked (X) stones were dead.

[G\] Definitely. White even lost a liberty with this move.]
;B[hl];W[jj];B[hj];W[jf];B[li];W[fj];B[kj]C[[G\] Ok so far, but black has to keep in mind to connect at F11 when white does at J13. On the other hand if black had connected now, white would probably also have done so as otherwise the three stones will be lost.  The four white stones in the center pose no threat. In short I would prefer black G11 here.]
;W[ig];B[kk]LB[gi:A]C[white: Mistake by black. Shoudl be G11 (A).

[G\] Yes.];W[gi]C[*AbaddonsGo*: i saw that, played it out, and saw ti was safe, but i forgot to save it ..
ziggystar: Right.];B[fk];W[ej];B[dl];W[el]C[white: This intrusion went a little deeper than I had expected.

[G\] You can't cut that black stone.];B[em];W[dm];B[ek]
(;W[dk]C[[G\] Wrong side, see variation.];B[cl];W[qk]C[[G\] Wow. White is in danger on two thirds of the left side (bottom and middle). This is no time to tenuki.]
;B[ql]
(;W[rl];B[qm];W[pl]LB[oh:A]C[white: Aiming at P12 (A)

[G\] Clearly 8-).];B[ol]C[[G\] ... and you'll get it, too. See variation starting at move 152 for handling it differently.]

;W[eq];B[fq];W[fr];B[nk];W[rm];B[rn];W[eb];B[fb];W[ck]LB[dh:A]
