C[[Vador\] Hi, I'm your reviewer. Sorry if some of my comments are not very clear or accurate, my english is quite poor and I haven't played go for a while. So don't take everything I say for sure.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[qp];B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[gq];B[dj];W[de]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[fd];W[ci];B[cj];W[di]
(;B[ff]TR[ci][di][cj][dj]C[[Vador\] I think this move is questionnable, the position on the left side being very unsettled (two stones facing two stones).]
;W[fi]
(;B[eg]C[[Vador\] This move is too slow, it only asks W to reinforce.]
;W[cg];B[qn]TR[qj][op][oq]C[[Vador\] I wouldn't play on this side, but that doesn't mean it's a bad move. I would prefer a kakari at P3 or P4, or an extension at R10.]
;W[po];B[pl];W[qg];B[nc]C[[Vador\] Playing low here doesn't make much sense with the huge strength on the NW corner. But maybe it's just me.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[qi];W[np];B[ej];W[ei];B[pf];W[qf]
(;B[oi]C[[Vador\] Here, too, I think this is not so good. Leaning against W is what I would play.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[og]
(;B[nf]C[[Vador\] This is giving too much, I think.];W[nh]C[[Vador\] Letting W out is not what you could expect from the initial position.]
;B[nj];W[je]C[[Vador\] W sees the moyo, and invades.]
(;B[ld]C[[Vador\] Now this is very shy ! Your stones are strong, attack !]
;W[jc]
(;B[hc]C[[Vador\] Again, this is not enough, I think.];W[jh]
;B[kq];W[jq];B[mq];W[nq];B[jp];W[iq];B[lp]C[[Vador\] A bit slow... M5 would be faster, or even M6.]

C[I learned the hard way that this invasion doesn't work if there is a white stone at O4.

[Vador\] It's a bit premature, you can wait for this to work, and prepare your route to the center at L6 for example.]
;W[os];B[oq];W[pq];B[qr];W[qq];B[ro]C[I understood that the group at Q2 was dead and decided to cut my losses.

[Vador\] Again this is an endgame move. Secure your south group.]
;W[rr];B[rp];W[mp]C[[Vador\] This makes the eye at M3 false. Living is better than taking a few points. This is the difference between middle game and endgame.]
;B[lo];W[nm]C[[Vador\] Fortunately, your opponent lets you escape for free.]

;B[rb]TR[bd][mg][bj]SQ[ll]C[This was probably not the biggest move on the board. But where is the biggest move?

[Vador\] It is sure a big move. Other big moves are B16 or B10, or even N13 (I don't know if every W group here is settled), but it's more urgent to settle the south group by linking it to the E group (M8 or something like this).]

(;B[nb]C[[Vador\] This is too submissive, I think.];W[mc];B[md]
;W[lc];B[kd];W[jd];B[kc];W[kb];B[jb]C[A little unreasonable. Better spent at J18?

[Vador\] Sure !];W[ib];B[hb];W[ja];B[ma];W[lb];B[pi]C[[Vador\] W has taken a huge part of what could have been yours on the North !]
;W[ni];B[ol]C[[Vador\] This is what makes you loose this game : answering about everything W plays. I don't know if there is a big threat here for W, but it sure can't be big enough for you to answer submissively, and let W take another big point like B10 !]
;W[bj]C[[Vador\] Here you are, letting W have all the big sente moves.]
;B[bk];W[bi];B[cl];W[bd]C[[Vador\] See ?];B[bc];W[dd];B[cc]
;W[be];B[ed]C[[Vador\] This looks small !];W[sb];B[ra];W[rq]

;B[ch];W[bh];B[ia];W[lm];B[km];W[ha];B[qe]C[[Vador\] I don't think this is a threat big enough !]
;W[re]C[[Vador\] Fortunately, W answers !];B[ia];W[fo]C[[Vador\] Now this is small ! End the ko, which is HUGE !]
;B[en];W[ha];B[bg];W[cf];B[ia];W[go];B[fb]C[[Vador\] See ? You ended giving it in the end !]

;W[aj];B[qd];W[la];B[na];W[ke];B[nd]C[[Vador\] I don't think W can harm you here. So it's another occasion for you to take sente to W.]

;W[ia];B[sp];W[sa];B[pb];W[tt];B[tt]C[You can check your score with the score command, type 'done' when finished.
Click on a group of stones to mark it dead and remove it from the board.

[Vador\] So it's 1.5 for the bad ? Well, I think you lost this game in the end. Just try not to answer everything (even if it's a threat, maybe you have something bigger to take elsewhere, and in sente, so that you can revert to the original threat after this).

Just review your endgame, you'll see that W took ALL the sente points, while you took none, even answering some of his gote moves !

The beginning was not bad, I think, your strategy was consistent. Just don't let your opponent win a lost game !]
;W[tt]C[Game 104 CarlJung is removing @ B13

You have typed done.

)
(;B[bi]C[[Vador\] ... or this. But I don't know how things could develop.

The point is there are two unsettled groups on the left side, so it's a "live or escape" fight against the two of them. I think I would prefer 'for B) the E11 option.]
