C[Hi, this game is a big mess *huge fault of my own*.  Anyhow any comments would be good.  On how I can punish white, or where do i hold back too much or go too deep. Thanks!  I have went through the game and made some brief comments of my own.  Thanks for the review.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ed]LB[cc:A][cd:B][ce:C]C[Corner invasion at a, b or c is urgent, due to the takamoku.]
;B[jc]LB[cc:A][hc:B][ci:C]C[White can consider playing a.

Having extension at b or c miai.];W[qj];B[cd];W[cc]LB[dc:A]
C[Should i have answered this at "A"?

No, that is overplaying.];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[hc];B[df]C[Tenuki here also an option for black.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc]LB[ph:A]C[White should defend at A.]
;W[qn];B[nq];W[rp]LB[qh:A]C[You should consider playing a before white jump.]
;B[qq];W[oj]LB[je:A][cn:B][fq:C]C[Maybe black should play a.

b or c is actually miai, since the top left and bottom right corners are already secured.]
;B[fq]TR[df]C[Right side to approch? or C5 is better because i have more potentional to develop on that side ebcause of D14 stones.  This seems too low to me.

Yes, D14 is in a high position, so the left side got better potential, so you see it as bigger so to speak.]
;W[dn]LB[cl:A]C[White should play C6 (3rd line) instead.

Now A become a very good point for black, creating a moyo (extension) and threaten white corner group.]
;B[dr]C[This is over-reliant on joseki.];W[cq];B[iq]LB[ck:A]
C[White should play A, since the top left black group is strong.]
;W[cj]LB[dm:A][je:B]C[For me, I will pick up a fight at A first.

If I can managed to get sente, I go back to play B.];B[je]
(;W[he]C[Slow move for white, pls look at the variation.]
(;B[of]C[I wanted to do something about the huge space whtie has there.

If i take the count right now ... white has 52ish points

black .. 42ish points

so I wanted to reduce white some and build a bit of moyo for my self ...

Idea is correct but the approach is wrong.

Pls look at the variation.]
(;W[ph]C[Another slow move, white should reduce the lower moyo.]

(;B[ib]
(;W[hb]C[White just can't reply...

If you reply, you are letting your opponent get 6 points in sente.]
;B[on]
(;W[pm]C[White just cant answer like this...

Pls look at the variation.];B[jn]C[bad Idea?

Winning move.]
(;W[lo]C[White L6 is sort of the deepest he can go.

This move can be suicidal.];B[lm];W[ip]C[I would really like to know how to answer this :(.]
;B[jp];W[jq]C[This is almost like trick play.

I think you fell into the trap.]
(;B[kp]C[Bad way to reply, pls look at the variation.];W[hq]
;B[ir];W[hr]
(;B[hp];W[io];B[jr];W[gp]C[You shouldn't  play H4 if you don't have the ladder in favour.]
;B[ho];W[hn];B[cl]C[*confused* play ...

No need for H5 even if you want to break the ladder.];W[go]
;B[el];W[cg]LB[cf:A][dg:B]C[How do i answer this? I considered A, but that seemed slow :(.

A or B is quite necessary for the safety of the group.];B[ej]
;W[eh]LB[di:A]C[Weakness in white's shape at A.]
(;B[gl]LB[di:A]C[You can play A also, pls look at the variation.]

LB[di:A]C[Still aiming at A, I guess.];W[gh]LB[cb:A][hf:B][fg:C]
C[Here, either you choose to make 2 eyes at A...

Or you can play B to attach out, have C as sente in mind.];B[hg]
;W[gg];B[gf];W[hf]C[*start of a very messy sequence* *I don't know what I was thinking, I was trying to make my group alive :*(*]
;B[ig];W[bb]LB[ab:A]C[Black A is sente, should not be omitted, you look very dangerous here.]
;B[cf]LB[bg:A]C[If white play A, you look like done with...]
;W[dj];B[ab];W[ba]LB[bg:A]C[Black A is crucial here.];B[dk]
;W[bg];B[dd]
(;W[fd]LB[bf:A]C[This white is over-defensive.

Here, you need to play A to be safe.

Pls look at the variation.];B[di];W[ei]C[Reckless cut by white.]
;B[ci];W[ee];B[ef]LB[de:A][ad:B][dh:C]C[Chance for white...

Since A and B is miai... Only 1 eye for black... 

So white should connect at C first.];W[de];B[ce]LB[dh:A]C[Last chance for white to play A.]

;W[gj];B[hi]LB[hk:A]C[Wee I lived .. but didn't seem good to me :(.

White should play A to kill, need not to be bother about cut when surrounding is in favour.]

C[* You can stop review here, after this the game is some what pointless, but if you wish to review further and help me with end game that will be great :D thanks.


Overall, you did very well for this game.

In order to improve, pay more attention to the detail.

When there is a need to defend, by all mean please :)
