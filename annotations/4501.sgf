C[Hello, I am a 12k on KGS; my opponent is 11k. I am playing as black. During this game, I developed a large central influence, but had a hard time making any use of it. I ended up winning, but I probably squandered a lot of opportunities throughout. I'm also sure my direction of play during the opening was wrong, but I'm not sure how. Please make comments mainly for black, but some for white would be appreciated as well.

-After reviewing your game, I have few things that I'd like to point out:
1. Attacking is important. If there is a weak group, attack it if you think you can gain something out of it or even kill it. In this game you left some of your opponents weak groups unharmed even though by attacking them you could have won by twenty points or so. Do not simply make territory, make territory while you are attacking. 
2. "There is no territory in the center". Center moyos look big, but you'll end up with a little territory, because they can be attacked from four sides. Use influence and thickness to make territory while you are attacking.

I'm sorry but I don't have much to say about the direction of play. I thought it was ok. in addition, I'd recommend you to read the following senseis library pages:

I enjoyed reviewing your game, I hope you'll find it helpful and sorry that it took so long :) Feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions!]

C[I wasn't exactly sure how to deal with this loose pincer, and so I counterattacked like this. Any way I could have done this better?

-No, this is a good move because of your two 4-4 stones. I would have played this myself]

LB[fe:A]C[It seemed safe enough to play this, as he had just jumped into an area where I was strong.

-Yes, it is safe. You could have been even more aggressive (for example at A) because of your overwhelming strength in this part of the board.]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[ei];B[jd]LB[di:A]C[Was this play OK, or would a play around Q10 have been better? It was hard to decide during the game.

-I think you should have played at A. Now you're just giving up your chance to attack. If white now plays at A, he can live in sente (variation). You could easily benefit from attacking and after that play at K16]

C[-You should block loosely! This move forces white to play at B, and after that depending on your answer either at C or D, which are both bad for you. Therefore at A is better than at Q15. White can't invade the corner because after that you could kill the whole L16 group]
;W[of];B[og];W[pf];B[qe];W[pg];B[ql]C[I felt this play was reasonable at this point, because it was being supported by my wall on O13.

-Actually, O13 group is weak because it's floating and it does not have much influence on the stone at R8. Still, R8 is a reasonable move. It can be used to further harass the L16 group later in the game and it lessens whites influence nicely in that area]

(;B[hg]C[-Wrong direction, you should lean against H16 group to attack the D13 group (variation), now you're just forcing it to connect. Besides, making territory in the center is at the moment small]
;W[gf];B[gg];W[ff];B[hj]LB[gk:A][ik:C][gl:B]C[Trying to strengthen my moyo in the center.

-Creating territory in the center, even at this point of the game is very small. Even if all goes surprisingly well, you will have only ~15 points in the center. Why not attack D13? It is very weak, you could have possibly killed it. If you are sure you want to play in the center, be more greedy and play at A or B. in addition to being small, H10 leaves a weak spotat C]
