C[As white in this game I had as usual big problems. Often I did not know exactly what to do.

I eventually lost by time ...
I believe the game was close to about 5 points or so.

I added some notes to the moves which I had the most difficulties with.

Thanks for reviewing the game.

[gromit\] Hi Tomas, I'll do my best to help you out, if some questions remain, please contact me.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[My opponent seemed to aim at two corner enclosures, so my thoughts were:
If Black P17 then I would play R9, if then Black R5 or R6 I would play R12 stabilizing my gruop (if B R11 I play R6). Would this be ok?

[gromit\]
Your reasonning is partially right. I will add two things:
- if Black P17 I prefer R10 or R11, see varoations.
- if you don't want black to make two corner enclosures, which is quite possible, you may want to approach the remaining corner after P17. There will be a pincer, which will extend Black corner enclosure at the same time, but it's still playable.

Therefore I decided to play D16.

[gromit\]
good.]
(;B[cj]C[I was surprised.
Is this equally good as a corner enclosure?

[gromit\]
It's a hard question, even for players much stronger than me.
I guess I'd rather play a corner enclosure or at least a corner approach, but it's very difficult to call that a bad move. Black avoids a White SanRenSei. It seems a bit 'jealous' to me, but why not...]
;W[oc];B[jc]LB[od:B][pe:A]TR[dd]C[Another surprise ... looks good to me, since Black can extend either to N17 or G17.

[gromit\]
It does not look that good to me:
the main question is, "what is the purpose of a pincer?". The usual answer is, to put pressure on the pincered stone, to avoid its stabilizing itself too easily.
However as the marked stone (D16) is white, the pincer stone is itself quite unsecure. If it has to defend itself by playing moves like G17, it will not be attacking at the same time...
Moreover it's a bit too far to put pressure on P17 as M17 is still possible for White.

Black is really 'jealous' again, he tries to say "there will be no white territory on the board" but he creates weak groups all over the board.
A calm move like A or B, or if you really want to pincer a closer pincer would seem better.]
;W[lc]C[I decide to stabilize my own group before engaging in any fight.

Maybe I should have played first P15?

[gromit\]
Yes!

If you want to stabilize you have the edge (as you played) and the corner, so you'd better separate Black, avoid encirclement and play P15 first. Black will almost surely answer on the right side to protect his corner stone and then you can choose, either to get eye shape in the corner (may be R17) or to block black as you did, or even to counter-pincer him around H17.]
;B[gc];W[cf]LB[ec:B][pe:A]TR[gc][cj]C[My idea was to stabilize myself and put the C10 stone a bit under pressure...

[gromit\]
The marked stones are a bit far from the corner, so they don't put that much pressure on White and they don't feel WHite pressure that much.
The C10 stone has still plenty of room on the side or towards the center, and as Black has two weak groups there your corner group is not under such a forceful attack.
I'd rather take the initiative to reinforce my only weak group at the top (around A, and pushing a bit), then may be block/ attack Black's group at the top (around B), and only then play around where you played.

If Black now plays around D or E18 he will get stabilisation in sente (keeping the initiative) and can then attack your top border group.]
;B[db];W[cc]C[... stabilizing my group, probably too passive?

[gromit\]
Yes, see my comment two moves before.];B[cm];W[gq]LB[co:A]C[[gromit\]
White is letting Black stabilize himself everywhere, as your top left group is now strong you can attack (for instance around A).
Another possibility is to play tenuki and go back to the top right (White and Black are weak there).]
;B[cq];W[cp]TR[cj][cm]C[The idea was to let Black live below, build a wall and then attack later when the occasion arises the group C7 and C10.

[gromit\]
That's exactly the right idea, Black should have exploited the defect around B4. His two marked stone should end up under severe attack.]

(;B[dq]C[... strange ... I expected the sequence Black B4, White B5, Black B3 and White C5 ...

Is this black move a good move here with White G3 in place?

[gromit\]
No it's not good, you're perfectly right...
I add the suggested play as a variation for later comparison purposes.]
;W[bq]C[I decide to play B3 and see what happens ...

[gromit\]
Yes, let's let Black find a way :)];B[br]
(;W[bp]C[I thought very long for this move.
Possible other moves where either B5 or E3.

I discarded B5 quickly since it would allow A3 in sente and then some Black move around E3.

[gromit\]
very good thinking.

I tought long about E3 and the implications (see variation).

I am still not sure what is better. Could you give me your opinion, please?

[gromit\]
See in the variation, but you made the right choice. Let Black struggle to live and be strong to attack C7.]
;B[fq];W[fp];B[eq];W[ep]C[[gromit\]
Aren't you pretty happy with your wall?

White's wall has no defect and Black is still not alive.];B[ar]
;W[fr];B[er];W[gr];B[cs]C[Black gets 5 points, I have a nice wall which looks down menacingly to C7 and C10, I have a defect at G4, but ... I get out sente!

[gromit\]
If you compare again with the 'usual' sequence, Black is smaller, you end up sente in both, you have a very small defect in both. So White can be satisfied.]

(;W[qo]C[Probably wrong direction?

I tought long here if not attacking from O4 or so ... but then the saying says not try to build up territory in front of your strenght but to use it to fight ...

... also Black would get R5 himself, too good to allow!

[gromit\]
Three remarks:
- O4 is not so bad: see the variation, it may even be better than R5.
- There are other big points that may be more important, like in the top right (that seems to be the highest priority now).
- finally you built a wall to attack C7 C10, you could attack them now.]
;B[mq]C[[gromit\]
Now the influence of White on the bottom is reduced and the G4 weakness may come into play :(]
;W[qf]C[The idea was here to get Black respond locally, then I build up some wall and then play later around Q10 to map out some moyo ...

[gromit\]
ok, I said this zone was urgent, however it seems strange to play R5 and then leave it alone. You're creating a weak group.
Moreoverif Black splits you up (Q15) you now have 3 weak groups only in this par of the board (Black has one: the corner), White should play Q15 himself and Press Black down...]
;B[pe]C[[gromit\]
ouch.];W[pf];B[oe];W[me]C[I think I had to play here, even if I wanted to play desperately at P14, but the group P17, M17 started looking very weak there ...

[gromit\]
It is weak, so you have to do something.
The corner will be vital for both at some point but it would be too early now (Black would jump out and seal White in).]
;B[of];W[og];B[pb]C[[gromit\]
Black's timing is not bad...
May be White could have sled in the corner on previous move, but it is hard anyway.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[ob];B[qb];W[re]C[Seems now like a huge error ... since it does not really threaten the live of the black group. :(
Should have been better at Q10 or P5?

[gromit\]
I do not agree, Black has to answer, and even S16 is not enough for unconditionnal life! (L+1 group)
However it's true that it is small ans does not help much any of White's groups, especially the M17 one which is i such danger that Q10 would be too early (I'd rather play Q9 if I played there).]
;B[qk]C[Black gets to play the BIG point :(

[gromit\]
Well, White left R5 alone a long time ago, so it's not really a surprise. However Blck takes risks: if white can live on the right and on the top, his corner group is dead...
As R5 is not so easy to capture White could protect around R11 and then try to punish Black for not protecting his group.]
;W[oo]C[Here I did not know what to play.
R11 came to my mind, but seemed just to weaken R5.

[gromit\]
yes, but you have to make a choice...

Pushing at S8 or so would provoke Black R12 (which Black  played anyway)

[gromit\]
and would not improve white's shape that much

S3 would have provoked Black P5 sealing me in.

[gromit\]
Yes

I think I should've played R13 here ... what do you think?

[gromit\]
R13??
No R11 is may be the least bad play, there will still be a lot of aji in the R5 stone and you have now a prey in the corner.]
;B[qh]C[[gromit\]
Black is right to attack and at the same time reinforce, however he has a burden in the corner. Black would like to be able to cut already. May be get out at O13 first and if White protects his cut jump out at P9]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[oi];B[pj]C[[gromit\]
Black is getting himself under attack :(
Now that white is out here and at P5 Black will have a hard time.]
;W[qq]C[I wanted to play O13, but my group in the corner started to look weak, so I played here.

[gromit\]
O13 would have been better: P5 is weak but almost out and has friends to go to on the left side.
If Black seals, White can then live in the corner.
After O13 the Black top right group looks dead.

What would be the actually the best move in this position?]

I wanted to make a wall at M2 and M3 (in sente of course) and I read out that the cut here would be a problem, so this is why I played here.

Comments?

[gromit\]
M2-M3 is not very big...
the cut doesn't seem to be a problem (Black puts himself in atari).
The two weak groups White has in the upper right are a bigger problem.
N13 or the like would help and threaten T18.];B[pr];W[lq];B[mp]
;W[lr];B[mr];W[di]C[The idea is now to get through attacking moves some kind of wall facing the center to build up some moyo.

But maybe it would have been better to play M4 or L5 first?

[gromit\]
Yes, if you leave M2-M3 alone they become weak (not a wall!) M4 will be sente for Black...
If you keep the pressure with M4 none of the two Black groups of the bottom right is alive!

Moreover, there is not much to be built in the center-top region as Black has already a settled group there.
If you want to attack you have now plenty of other preys...]
;B[bh];W[ch];B[bg];W[fc]C[Not a good move I think, since there is no continuation for me in sente ... :(

You can play G16 after F17, if Black wants the F17 stone you can turn around (see var).]

My last move was at F6. At this point I belive that I am still slightly in advantage ... but of course I don't know the optimal endgame sequence here . ;-)

My count during the game (yes, I regularly count during the game!):

White about 56 points
Black about 44 + 4 prisoners

[gromit\]
That seems about right.

As a general comment about this game, B never tried to build territory anywhere, but only to destroy W's, doing so he created a great number of weak groups, of which at least two should have died.

W didn't really atack those B groups severely, however W attacked a bit and then moved back to build a little territory, which gives him the edge in points.

What you (W) could do to improve, is to try (to count may be less often but) to evaluate much more often the status of ALL the groups on the board. More specifically, are they alive yet? Do they have more than one direction to escape/make eyes?
You did a good job of not letting B seal you and you sealed him in often, so you should also work on your life and death ability, there are lots of books and web pages with a lot of problems, that should give you a good basis.

Last point, try to be more consistent in your strategy: first you don' want to play O4 because it builds territory in front of your thickness (which it does not), then you end up building a wall even closer with M2-M3...
When you approach at R5, you should back up this approach before anything else, not play tenuki.

Well, it was an interesting game to look at, good luck for your improvement and feel free to contact me, by mail, or online on a server if you see me (I'm not there much recently but...).]
