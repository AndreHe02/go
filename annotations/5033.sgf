C[[MAFU\]
Hello! I'm very happy that you like to review my game. I (4k) was playing black against a stronger player (about 5dan). I decided to play a territory based game until i see an opening and a way to attack fiercely. I was going to play complicated if i sense an advantage out of it. Of course, i could not win, but nevertheless i tried to play an "even" game. He did ofc not play at full strength (at least i guess so).

Please point out all mistakes by black, the figthing was intense very soon and i am sure that i missed a ton of good moves. ;)

Hi :) I will try to write my opinions for both sides, at least try to explain the moves.
Its hard to play an opening against a stronger player to force him to do some risky invasion, because he knows he doesnt need to do so. But its true that you must create some difficult unreadable situation and hope that you will be the lucky one with more liberties.]
;B[qe];W[dd];B[oq];W[qp];B[pn]C[[MAFU\]
ofcourse this joseki crazy against a considerable stronger player, but i wanted to try it anyways :)

Playing taisha agains a 5d is a suicide :D There is simply no way to play it better. Its good to try it, even against stronger oponent, but dan players usually know how to play a joseki. But i have done so too, so... :))]

C[I think this is the most simple variation];W[ql];B[mp]C[[MAFU\]
this move makes it easy for white to mess up

It doesnt appear so to me. The white's response seems to be one way road. White o3 hurts the corner group much and there is no way to capture him.]

(;W[nq];B[mq];W[no]C[[MAFU\]
...... but white did not mess up :(];B[nr]C[DangoMouse [-\]: tricksy hobitses

:DDD];W[mo];B[ol];W[ko]
(;B[rq]C[[MAFU\]
should be m2

This move is huge territorialy and isn't bad, it takes away whites base. But its too slow, the move at the right side is important.
m2 slightly strengthens black and makes it a bit harder for white to clost the bottom side, but s3 is better.]
;W[pj];B[ln];W[lo]C[unfortunately white can now descent to the side, which is good for him.]

(;B[ll]C[[MAFU\]
some shape in the center and w is still not too strong, the result is not too terrible for b

Strengthening the center is necesary. This is also ok.];W[lq]
C[[MAFU\]
at least r15 is doing a good gob :)

if white had a stone there, it would be a problem. r15 is a vital point now, white would be in trouble. (weaknes at s7 makes living hard)]

(;B[mr];W[hp];B[eq]C[White is behind in territory, so he needs to do something about it.]

(;W[cp]C[This is a misstake, it induces a difficult unfavourable fight. White needs to care about the bottom group and bot. left now.]

(;B[en]C[[MAFU\]
i wanted something to connect to for the M8
D5 might be bad for b

Don't be so afraid! You wrote about fierce attacking and now, when you have a perfect possibility, your only goal is a connection :)]
;W[cn]C[[MAFU\]
is this joseki?

no.
but white is maybe aware of his weaknes and doesn't want to let you force against the corner more than necesary.]

(;B[fq];W[gr]C[You must be always aware of your goal. Now the focus was to attackt white b., but now its connected, so you lost your chance.]

i thought about pushing once more at M13, then playing at c13.
but w had the same thoughts and played there before me :(]
(;B[cj]C[[MAFU\]
i am not sure, but i think this move is needed for b

this is way too submisive. f17 is now the point.];W[bo];B[bn]
;W[ap];B[cm];W[pc];B[nc]C[[MAFU\]
i have no idea here. was o17 correct? just letting w live here seems to good for him

Yes, this looks well. white cant play any usual variation, he has to struggle.]

(;W[lc]C[[MAFU\]
again, i have no idea.

this sacrifices the corner. You should have taken it, its big.]

(;B[fc];W[nb]C[[MAFU\]
this was a nice answer by w.

allowing this was a big misstake, now all your stones in the area are endangered instead of making a lot of points.]

nice move
now my plan does not work :(

letting S7 die would be such a huge point loss, that i decided this is unacceptable
but since the cutting stones are lost then, all aji around j2 is lost and white can even think about attacking K7 again

what do you mean by lost? this doesnt take them.];B[rk];W[rj]

After this desaster i felt blacks last hope gone, so i resigned here. We agreed that it was a good game.

Maybe you could note the most important weaknesses in my general play here, so that i can work on them :)

Thanks again for looking at the game!

You play quite well. The main misstake was missing the attack opportunity on the bottom and letting white to play o18. 
You are welcome :)])
