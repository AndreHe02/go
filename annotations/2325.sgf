C[Munisai:  Hi, reviewer, and thank you very much in advance!

Munisai:  I felt that my opponent (playing black) and I were fairly matched in this game.  However, after reviewing it, I have the feeling that I was generally too aggressive and that I often missed the correct direction of play.

Munisai:  Any comments would be welcome.  I am specifically interested in moves you identify as being small or misdirected.  I have added comments about my thoughts where appropriate and tried to add variations when I could think of them as I reviewed the game.

Munisai:  Thanks again!];B[dd];W[pp];B[pc];W[cp];B[jd];W[ip]
C[Munisai;  Perhaps a kakari at the top right, instead?  I felt like this was a good way to see my opponent's intentions, but now, I feel like I gave him too much momentum.

I don't think this is too slow.  The high Chinese opening is a widely accepted opening.  With the way this is going, it looks like it will be a moyo game.]
;B[pe]C[I think this is way too slow.  Q10 would be nice, I think.  It's kind of a big point for both of your formations.]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[pl]C[Munisai:  Feels right for white, but black has a big moyo.

Your moyo is bigger.];B[cn];W[cl];B[dp];W[dq];B[eq];W[do];B[cq]
C[Munisai:  Bad for black?

No, a crosscut is a good idea when you're invading.  Connecting would make Black heavy.]
;W[ep];B[dr];W[dp];B[fq]
(;W[fp]C[I think this is a mistake.  See variation.];B[ir];W[gq]
;B[gr];W[er];B[fr];W[cr];B[es]C[Munisai:  Good for white.];W[kq]
;B[hq];W[hp];B[gp];W[go];B[br];W[bq];B[cs];W[cf]C[Munisai:  I think this was too aggressive.  I haven't captured the stone at C6 yet (?), so this seems like too large an extension.

I agree.  I think a two point jump would be fine.  You would have a huge framework.  It would also leave the upper left corner loose enough that you could invade later.]
;B[df];W[dg];B[ef];W[ce];B[cd];W[ch]C[Munisai:  He allows me to patch up my large extension rather nicely.

Yes.  You also have nice potential for expansion at F12.];B[qq]
C[Munisai:  Black leaves a hole at F16.  Too early for 3-3 invasion?  It will give white massive thickness.

I think this invasion is ok.  Your stones are going to wind up a bit overconcentrated - the stones to the left will be too close to your thickness.  It is important for Black to keep sente in this invasion.]
;W[pq]C[Munisai:  Picked the wrong side.];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro]
;W[qn];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nq];B[rn];W[rm];B[kr];W[lr]C[Munisai:  Wrong.  Should have been M3.  Cede a low position to black and take thickness instead.]
;B[jq];W[jp];B[lq];W[lp];B[mq];W[mp];B[mr];W[md]C[Munisai:  Too aggressive (and early) an invasion, I think.  What would you have done instead?

Munisai:  I was hoping to either make a position at the top or sacrifice the stone for thickness towards the center.  That would have worked well with my bottom thickness.

I really like F12.  I believe the line through F12 and E13 is the key line between the moyos.  Whoever pushes across that line first will get the advantage.  I think F12 also starts to work toward starting something in the upper left around F16.]
;B[mc];W[ld];B[lc];W[lg]C[Munisai:  It feels like black replied submissively to what might have been an overplay.

Yes, he did.  You should not attach to stones that you are trying to attack.  You attack to force your opponent to reply and give you time to become stable.  He helped you out.]
;B[jg];W[ki]C[I think this would be better as a one-point jump because it's harder to cut.]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[oi];W[ng]C[Munisai:  I could either block (O10? O9?) or threaten a cut.  I decided on the latter but don't think this is the right move for it, now that I look at it!]
;B[nk];W[pg];B[qg];W[pi];B[og]
(;W[oj]C[This is a mistake.  Should be at P12.];B[ph];W[ni]
;B[oh];W[nh];B[nf];W[mf];B[ne]C[Munisai:  Black gets a large corner.  White has a big moyo, but there are many cutting points.

Munisai:  I think I got fairly lucky in the last ten moves or so; black's responses confused me.

I'm still dying for you to play F12.];W[fc]C[Munisai:  This would likely be better as a more defensive move.  J11 and G10 were both tempting.

F12!  F12!  It's too early for this.  This will help strengthen Black toward the center, and that's the last thing you want right now.]
;B[fd];W[dc];B[gc];W[cc];B[ec]C[This is a big mistake for Black.  Should be B16.]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[bd];B[db];W[cb];B[ea]C[Munisai:  Good for black, but considering the move I made, I think I was lucky.]
;W[ih];B[jh];W[ji];B[ii];W[hh];B[eh];W[gg]C[Munisai:  Again, I could either block or threaten to invade/cut.  I chose to be aggressive again, but I think it was the right choice this time.]
;B[eg];W[gi];B[ej];W[fk];B[el];W[fl];B[fn]C[Munisai:  White has a nice center territory sketched out.  My opponent gave me the chance to build a good wall.

Munisai:  At this point, I think I have the advantage if I can secure the left side.  My estimate during the game was:
Black bottom right:  9 points
Black bottom:  13 points
Black top:  55 points
White center and right:  70 points
White top left:  13 points.
White bottom left:  ?  In trouble, but I have sente.

The situation on the left is complicated enough that I don't feel confident telling you what you should do :)  It looks to me like you should protect at F5, then try to cut Black apart.]
;W[dm];B[em];W[dn];B[cj];W[ek]C[Munisai:  He wrecked side territory instead of the center.  Seems like a fair trade to me, especially since he might still be able to make mischief in the center.]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[fj];W[gj];B[in]C[Munisai:  Takes the vital point.  Must white defend?

I don't think so.  I would play G6, which catches the stones on the left.  Then you don't care if Black cuts - you just connect to one side or the other.]
;W[ho];B[hf]C[Munisai:  Good defensive move.]
(;W[gf]C[Munisai:  At this point, I think I have a won game.  Black's top territory is huge, but so is the white center territory.  If I had stopped and realized that in the game, I would have played more cautiously, but instead, I play too recklessly and almost lose it all.

I would have cut through from the left.  See variation.  At this point, CGoban says you're up by 30.  You should be able to win by playing fairly conservative.]
;B[ge];W[if]C[Munisai:  White overplay.

No, this is fine.];B[jf]
(;W[je]C[This is the overplay.  Should be at H15.];B[ie];W[ke]
;B[ig];W[kd];B[kc];W[nd];B[od];W[nc];B[nb]
(;W[oc]C[P18 is a lot better.  See variations.];B[ob];W[pb]
C[Munisai;  Another white overplay.  Getting too eager.

Yeah, this doesn't work too well.  You should probably play S11.  That's worth a lot.  D15 is still big, too.]
;B[qc];W[jc];B[id];W[mb];B[lb]LB[na:1][oa:2];W[ma];B[la];W[kb]
;B[na];W[jb];B[pa];W[mb]C[Munisai:  Not reading correctly; wasted move.  Should have defended at L12 or similar.]
;B[me];W[kf];B[kg];W[lf];B[lh];W[mg]C[Munisai:  Big mistake that I didn't see until after the game.  Play at M11?

Yeah, M11 is better, but you need to be careful.  You're running out of liberties.]
;B[li];W[kh]C[Munisai:  Big mistake that I didn't see until afterwords.  Black could take the entire center away now.]

(;B[nj]C[Munisai:  Black didn't see it until a few moves later; despite the luck, I should have lost the game here.

Yep.  See variation.];W[lj]

;B[ok]
(;W[li]C[Munisai:  White doesn't need to defend here.  Play Q10 instead.  It felt like snapback, and I reacted before thinking it through.

Right.  This is a terrible move.];B[pk];W[pj];B[qk];W[ql];B[rk]

(;B[sp]C[Munisai:  Isn't this unnecessary?  If so, play Q7.

The corner may be killable, but probably not by someone at your level.  In any case, if Black plays Q7, and White tries to kill the group, he catches some white stones.  See variation.]
;W[pm];B[nn];W[no];B[nr];W[oq];B[os];W[rj]C[Munisai:  I'm fairly certain black is dead here, but I promptly forgot the sequence after my opponent responded.  :p

I don't think so.  It's 3 liberties to 3, and it's Black's turn.  Unless you have a trick up your sleeve, he should win.]
;B[sj]
(;W[sk];B[ri]
(;W[kl];B[qi]
(;W[ei]C[Munisai:  The left side still has a lot of cutting points, and  this is attempt to take some territory while solidifying it.

Play D15.  You might only get to capture the two stones, but if so, it's in sente.  If Black tries to save the two stones, he's in big trouble.]
;B[fi];W[di];B[fh];W[dj];B[gh];W[hg];B[ff]C[Munisai:  Unecessary, I believe.  Play  J14 instead.

Yes.];W[if];B[he];W[iq]C[Munisai:  Small.  I should have kept defending the side; it's too early for ko.

Right.];B[de];W[kq]C[Munisai:  Too early.  Defend at D12.];B[jr]

;B[jf];W[jg];B[gp];W[kq]C[Munisai:  Wrong ko-threat.  Play R19 or just about anything else...  The other ko is worth more.

I'm not sure what the big deal is here.  You would prefer to play at L4 because it keeps your groups connected.  Let him have G3.]

Wow!  That is close.  Losing the group at Q10 was huge for you.  Your analysis of where you made mistakes was pretty good.  I didn't have much work to do here :)  I think that F12 in the opening would have been really big, if you haven't gotten that idea by now :)  I didn't notice too many places where your moves were too small.  Mostly your losses came from fighting, and missed opportunities.]
