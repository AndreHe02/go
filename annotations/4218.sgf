C[I see many pro games where they wait before answering corner approaches. So i try it here... But i really dont quite understand when it's appropriate to do so, or the theory behind it. What about here?

SGF:  In this case it is inappropriate.  The two B stones on the right are both on the 3rd line and so this is an unbalanced situation.  If W presses at 'A' it is unlikely that B will get a good result.  If the approach were against a different corner then the tenuki is playable.]
;W[qc]SQ[qn]C[SGF:  This does not take advantage of B's misdirection of play.  In fact, B welcomes this move as it allows him to get up onto the 4th line so as to balance the marked move.]

(;B[np]C[SGF: There is an obvious temptation to make this pincer once W has played tenuki.  But the top right is more important.  B needs to establish a position on the right.  See the variation.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qq]LB[qo:A]SQ[np]C[SGF:  This is better when the marked stone is on the 3rd line.  I would recommend simply playing at 'A']

(;W[pq]C[SGF:  This is the wrong direction and let's B get away with his overplay.  See the variation.]

(;B[rp]LB[qp:A]C[Can you show a few alternatives here?

SGF: Move is weak.  There is only one move to consider: 'A']

(;W[qo]LB[qm:A]C[SGF:  I prefer the cut at 'A'.  A couple of possibilities are shown.]
;B[ro]
(;W[mo]LB[kp:B][kq:A]C[SGF:  This is the wrong direction.  B can easily dodge away to 'A' and W gains very little.  W does better to make a pincer at 'B'.  See variations.]

(;B[ql]C[is this too slow?? maybe s17 better?

SGF:  Definitely too slow.  Playing 'A' is best.  W has made a mistake by playing 'A' and so B must take advantage.  See variations.]
;W[mp]LB[kq:A][lq:B]C[SGF:  This is a very tight move. W feels over concentrated.  This move is subject to an attack at 'A'.  I would play 'B'.]

(;B[en]LB[fo:A][kq:B]C[This seems to be moyo juncture....

SGF:  True.  But is it the biggest point.  It does not seem urgent.  If W strengthen at 'A', then B can invade at 'B' and expect to live.  The variation shown seems preferable.]

(;W[fo]LB[qe:B][kq:A]C[SGF:  B can still invade at 'A' so this is not as big as it looks.  I would play 'B'.]
;B[fn]LB[dj:A]C[SGF:  Very bad.  This reduced the chance of an invasin below and makes 'A' overconcentrated.  Now is the time to invade if B wants to play on the lower side, but the top is actually bigger.]
;W[gn];B[gm];W[hn]
(;B[fd]LB[jd:A]C[SGF:  W has a very large territory at the bottom now and it can no longer be invaded.  This move looks big but the 3-3 is still open and there are a lot of weak points in the moyo. B's left side may look as big as W's bottom, but it is far less secure.  This move is not going to win for B.  I would go all the way to 'A'.]
;W[hc];B[hm];W[im]C[I didnt expect hane here... I was hoping for J6-H16 exchange... But i feel that i didnt handle J7 well... what do you think?]
;B[in]C[SGF: This is unreasonable.]
(;W[jm]C[SGF:  If W ataris first it is not so easy on B.  See variations]
;B[kn]C[SGF: Nice move.  Punished W for his oversight.];W[km]
;B[io];W[hp];B[ln];W[ml];B[mq]
(;W[lq]C[SGF:  W does better to protect behind.  B does not have a lot of room to manouver.]
;B[nr]
(;W[lr];B[nm]
(;W[mm]C[SGF: Wrong direction.  You cannot afford to let B capture the corner stones - it is way too big.]
;B[nn];W[mn];B[no]C[Feels like white got better end of the deal here... and sente too...

SGF:  This is a diaster for W.  A few moves ago he had a huge territory at the bottom.  Now what he has left is barely bigger than B's corner.]
;W[pd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ph]LB[og:B][pi:A]SQ[ml]C[SGF:  I can see the reason for this move but because the marked W stone is strong there is a good reduction point at 'A'. and a move at 'B' to help W build a moyo at the top. I think it is safe to extend along the 3rd line.]
;W[pj]TR[pi][qj][pk]SQ[ph][ql]C[SGF:  This is almost never correct.  Invade the B extenion is usually best done at one of the triangle points.]
;B[qj];W[ok];B[nl]LB[pi:A];W[qi];B[pi];W[qk];B[rj];W[rk];B[ri]
;W[nk]
(;B[pl]LB[mk:A]C[SGF: W should ignore this move.  Connecting is a small yose move.  B should have cut at 'A'.]
;W[pk];B[cq]SQ[hc][fd]C[SGF:  Not big enough.  The two marked stones define the boundary between two moyos and this is the important area.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[dq];B[br];W[cr];B[bq];W[ch]LB[he:A]TR[pf][pg]
C[I guess white is abit behind at the moemnt... i suppose the invasion is warranted...

SGF:  Not necessarily.  The top left 3-3 is still open.  If W plays 'A' then he can invade there iF B defends.  W can also press at the marked points, so he has prospects of a moyo himself.]
;B[bj];W[eh]
(;B[fg]TR[hc]C[SGF: I think a leaning attack against the marked stone has a better chance.  See the variation for one possible sequence.]
;W[fh]
(;B[dg]LB[gg:A]C[Please comment on this and following moves in this fight.

SGF: This move is not really sente.  See the comment on the next move.  If B simply plays 'A' then he is still threatening the W stones, but also severely restricting the W moyo.]

(;W[dh]LB[gg:A]C[SGF: This is not so good.  It is a heavy move.  If B cuts thorough here then W is not so bad becasue he can invade at the 3-3.  See the variation at 'A'.]
;B[gg]TR[dg][dh]C[SGF: As it turns out, B gets this move anyway, but that is because the marked exchange was bad for W.]
;W[eg]
(;B[jc]LB[ec:A]C[SGF: This is premature. If B blocks then W does not have time to stop this move so it is probably B's privilege anyway.  Plus B needs to reenforce his stones so that he can resistance a W placement at 'A'.  As it stands, all W needs to do it play 'A' in response to this pincer and he is in a good position.]
;W[he]
(;B[mc]LB[je:A]C[SGF: Wrong direction.  This is not a threat against the corner.  B needs to keep up the pressure on the 2 W stones by jumping to 'A'.  But as explained eariler, the threat again W is not very strong at this stage.  This means that B really does not have a good move here, and this emphasizes how the pincer was premature.]
;W[ec];B[fc]C[SGF: Very dangerous. B is not strong enough to let W push through.]

(;W[fb]LB[ed:A]C[SGF: W can push through at 'A'.  See the variations.]
;B[db];W[eb];B[dc];W[ed];B[ee];W[gc];B[de];W[fe];B[mk];W[ni]
;B[lk];W[kk];B[gh]LB[mi:C][ni:B][mk:A]C[SGF:  If B is going to absandon them, I see no point in the last two moves.  B would have done better to play this area first and then decide what to do at the right.  The cut at 'A' is only correct is there is a change of capturing the W stones.  It is very likely that a jump to 'B' or 'C', threatening to cut, woud be more useful, but this cannot be determined until the left side is settled.]

(;W[ej]C[SGF: See variation.];B[kj]C[SGF: Nive move];W[jk]C[SGF:  W needs to be careful.  The B move is not absolute sente and W has two weak groups to take care of.]
;B[mh];W[nh];B[mg];W[mi];B[li];W[ng];B[mf]
(;W[of]LB[pg:A]C[SGF: W should connect by playing 'A' in sente.  Admittedly, this is sente, but it does not gain as much.]
