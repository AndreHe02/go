C[I played this game with black in IGS. At the time of the match both me and my opponent were 18k*. I won by 15 points (with 5.5 komi for white). I would like to receive comments as to where I could have played better.  I have commented the motivation behind several of my moves (my comments start with nojb) and I would appreciate any observation you might have on them.

Thanks a lot,
nojb.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[cd];B[qo];W[jd];B[ec]C[It might be better to aproach one line higher (e16) that way you are les deep inside whites influence on the upper side

Maybe also an aproach from the other side would be more helpfull for teh right side
that way youre aproaching stones is working nicely with youre low left corner]

(;W[gc]C[this makes white overconcentrated better to play frome the c16 stone

eg d14];B[ee];W[df]C[(nojb) I didn't answer this locally because I knew I could flee into the center if white played d18 or something like it stealing away my (little) eye space. White was building a nice territorial framework in the upper side and I didn't want to be left behind.]

(;W[dc];B[db];W[cb];B[dd];W[cc];B[ef];W[de];B[ed];W[dg]C[(nojb) I exchanged the corner, which wasn't so big after all because of the his stones in the third line, for a nice wall.

this is a serious misjudgment I think

there is no wall but there is a weak group of black stones, a nice target for white to atack, also w has a rather big corner

to not awser localy has become a mistake I think now white has the initiative.]

;B[ok];W[cn];B[co]C[(nojb) I played this because white would end up a little overconcentrated because of the stone in c10 and I would consolidate a little more my territory at the bottom.

Good ! B atackes the white stone since he has a stone at c 10
Remember though by playing c5 insted of C4 the corner remains open.
Do Not consider the corner terretory (jet)];W[dn];B[fq]C[usualy one line higer to atack the white stones a bit more]

(;W[gm];B[gn];W[hn];B[hm];W[hl];B[im];W[fn];B[go]C[(nojb) I decide to exchange my four stones for an opportunity to make a lot more territory in the right.

These stones are very big since they are cuting stones.

this may not be so good as you think the low side is not jet terretory as well]

(;W[es];B[gq];W[fs];B[gs]C[(nojb) If white plays g2, I atari playing f2, white takes the stone, and I atari at h2.]
;W[aq]C[(nojb) White wants a ko. I played the ko and lost it, but I got some things in return. Is there any way to avoid it?

doesnt look like it w has more libreties in the corner

hard ko fight for black];B[fr];W[as];B[ap];W[bn];B[ar];W[rg]
;B[rh];W[aq];B[sh]C[(nojb) This ko threat also eliminates the possibility of a second ko threat by white in the same place.]
;W[si];B[ar];W[sn]C[(nojb) I don't know If I should have answered this, but I didn't want to let white into my large territory.


count the ko it is worth like 30 points so do not awnser here, not a good idea

in fact I am suprised w awnserd at t11 
also here the ko is bigger];B[so];W[aq];B[dh]C[(nojb) I don't know if this is large enough, but if white played at d12, he would get a nice chunk of teritory in the left side.]

(;W[lh];B[pc]
(;W[qc];B[pb];W[qb];B[ob];W[lc]C[(nojb) White could have killed my by playing n18 ?

looks like a better move than this
 this gives b 2 eyes
