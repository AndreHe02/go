(;B[cc]C[K> The general advice about the 3-3 point invasion is not to hurry into it. At this stage in the game, you need to keep you routes to the centre open, and a 3-3 invasion can often get trapped in the corner. Also, you are leaving the bottom right corner very vulnerable to a white move around O3. See variation.]

(;B[hc]C[K> Looking at the whole board, you need to decide what you are trying to achieve. Think in terms of how are your stones going to work together? This stone for instance is unlikely to be able to link to the stones in the top left corner - for that you would need G18 or H19. See variations for possible alternatives - and remember, the theme is: making your stones work together.]

C[K> Yes - you have got a double approach on this corner (although I would have suggested a closer approach with this stone (O16 or O17)). At this point you need to be thinking in terms of pressing home your advantage. Attack!]
;W[ph]
(;B[qh]C[K> I guess you are thinking of linking along the edge here. But see variation.]
;W[qi];B[rh];W[pj]C[K> Going back to the theme of stones working together, your Q8 stone is now cut off from the other stones on the right side.

There is an important general point here: if you play into contact with the opponent, it will make him stronger. It may also make you stronger, and/or kill his group - but most often it will make him stronger. This is what has happened here - your contact play at R12 allowed him to strengthen his stones to the point that he got more from the exhange than you did. You have got a group with space for 1 eye (you need to go into the corner to make a second) and maybe a route out to the centre. But he has strengthened his stones around R11, separated your Q8 stone from friendly forces, and possibly got a chance to link to his stone in the corner.

So a rule of thumb to take from this is: generally, use contact for defence not attack.]
;B[ol]C[K> these black stones could be attacked by white at N7 because the solid extension is quite slow - generally a 1 space jump to O8 might be worth considering instead.

But... taking a quick assessment of the lower right corner, both your groups need defending. In terms of minimising the damage, you might need to weigh up which group can be sacrificed. From that perspective, it looks like your corner is more in need of reinforcement than the stone at Q8.]
;W[np]
(;B[lp]C[K> By choosing the pincer response, you are effectively offering the corner as a sacrifice. See variation.]

;W[rk];B[nd];W[od];B[je];W[id];B[jd];W[ic];B[ie];W[hd]C[K> You got the advantage in this exchange - sacrificing 1 stone for influence.

But you need to be aware of you weak spot at N11. White could play here, which is deep inside an area of the board that you want to make into your territory, and while you play a defensive move or 2 to protect the cutting point at O10, white could jump out into the centre, ruining your territory. See variation after next move.

Consequently I would suggest a move like G14 or M8 for your next move - they both forestall white's invasion by cutting off escape routes.]

(;B[bo]C[K> You can respond to white's invading stone at C7 in 2 ways: you can defend against it or attack it.

For defence, play a contact move, such as C6.
For attack, play a surrounding move such as a cap at E7.

In this case, the defence is probably better because it allows you to solidify your corner in the process. See variation.]

K> Most of my comments are during the opening & early middle game, because that is where the foundations are laid for later. If you can fight well in the middle game, that is good, but if your opponent outplays you in the opening  then you will have to fight even better later to stay in the game.

My top tips from this game: 1) look for ways to make your stones work together, 2) use contact mainly for defence not attack.

(;B[of]C[K> Suddenly white is in the same predicament as you found your lower right corner in later on. Moreover, the stone at Q12 is looking a bit weak - once you have finished with white's corner you could play around N8 or N9 to attack it on a large scale, with the useful second threat against white's stones in the lower right.]

(;B[np]C[K> This is a standard joseki from the 1 point high pincer. As with any joseki, it is just as important to understand what the moves are trying to achieve as to memorise the moves themselves. In this joseki, white is under pressure and needs to either make eye space in the corner or along the right side, or to escape into the centre. Black chooses to protect the corner and side, allowing the escape to the centre.

Note that with black playing O4, it is white that is under pressure. If black omits that and white gets it instead, the tables are turned and black is in danger.]
;W[rp]C[K> threatens R3 and R8/S8];B[qm]C[K> a breakout along the edge is a bigger threat so black defends against that]

C[K> So black has defended both edges at the expense of white reducing the corner and breaking out into the centre. If later in the game black manages to cut off white's route to the centre, S3 becomes a big point for white to make space for a second eye.

And black ends with sente.]))
