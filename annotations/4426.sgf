/// you are right :)
let's calculate roughly the territory of w and b:

w: 8+3+18 = 29
b: 19+4=23

b seems poorer at territory points but influence is also important. you should make use of the influence, "transform" it into territory.

actually b41 is not very good to make your territory more. but it really increases your influence.

I think A here is the greatest move of white. (but it's just my opinion.)]
