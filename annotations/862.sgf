C[Jeff: I'm about a 15 kyu AGA, playing Black. Bruce is about 14 kyu playing white.

Sylvain: Hi Jeff, I'll do my best to give Bruce and you some helpful comments.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[qd];B[ip]LB[qn:B][ep:A]C[Jeff: I like the high Chinese opening, but clearly I'm not using
it well. Any tips to maximize the use of this opening would be
appreciated.

Sylvain: Well, the first important tip I'd like to give is this one: if you want to "maximize" your use of the Chinese opening, you have to keep in mind what it's basic aim is.
The Chinese opening is an influence (thickness?) fuseki [opening\], it thus will come into play by building large moyos [territorial frameworks\], threatening to turn them into huge territories, and most of all attacking.
We'll see later how to turn that into real plays.]
(;W[ep]LB[dj:B][pj:C][qn:A]C[Bruce: I don't like playing inside the Chinese opening like this
- it creates a weak group that black gets to chase.

Sylvain: Yes, I agree!! So don't do it.
I know it might seem strange, but there is no compelling need to play (already) inside black's framework.
Common alternative plays are marked on the board (A, B or C for instance).
However, your stone is far from being weak. It's very common when playing against the Chinese fuseki to get a sequence as shown in the variation, thus playing at the very place you played but when you're even more surrounded.]
;B[do]LB[eo:C][go:A][cq:B]C[Jeff: Too conservative?
Bruce: Should I have responded as I did?  Or Play C3? or stand
up at E5?

Sylvain: D5 seems fine to me as it builds territory while attacking; D6 builds a bit more and would be more standard but D5 puts a big pressure on white.

Concerning C3, E5 and G5, my answer is next and in the variations...]

(;W[go]TR[fo][fp]SQ[fm][en]C[Sylvain: my main concern with G5 is not its direction. Going out into the center is good as C3 would not allow you to get any safe base.
E5 is in the right direction too, but would help black in his building of territory along the left side.
G5 leaves a weakness at the two triangled spots, and that might be problematic for escaping, however it's not bad at all.
The problem is to get *ahead* of black and *solid* (thus not playing the squared spots that would get white cut into pieces).
One way to do that is shown in the last variation.];B[in]C[Sylvain: very good.]
;W[cq]LB[fm:A]C[Sylvain: I still do not think it is of any use... better jump out at A]

(;B[cj]C[Sylvain: the corner is more important now. As long as black keeps his pressure on white, white will have to get out and thus help black reinforcing his left side...]

(;W[dp]C[Sylvain: I think white could have been more severe, and gain immediate life (see var.)]

(;B[bp]C[Jeff: Was this move too small?
Bruce: I think B3 would have been better?

Sylvain: The move is small because it's bad shape and thus only takes a few points gote (see variation for how white gets them).
B3 is too greedy, see variation.]
(;W[qn]C[Sylvain: this is not a bad move, but it is not urgent. The most important thing for white is to get his lower left group safe (remember that the Chinese fuseki wants to attack).
If black plays B3 white doesn't even have one eye...
If blackplays around F6 white is trapped...

Moreover, locally speaking, I'd rather play high (Q6) to make it hard for black to build a big moyo around P6.]
;B[on]C[Sylvain: good direction. Attacking white's floating group would be good too.]
;W[pk];B[jd]TR[oc]C[Bruce: I think 17 was at the wrong place because it allowed me
to make the extension at M16...Where should black have gone?

Sylvain: I'll repeat myself, go and attack white's group, that is what the chinese fuseki is built for.
Locally, I'd rather approach a corner (other than 3-3) than play in the middle of the border, so around P17.]

(;W[ld]C[Sylvain: white seems happy with this move, but it leaves lots of weaknesses (O17 for instance). O16 seems more balanced withj the right side. It's also strange to push black towards the relatively weak stone at D16 rather than in the other direction (see var).]
;B[gd]C[Sylvain: as the white stone is alone, there's no pressure on black...]
;W[cf];B[nd]C[Jeff: I was also considering approaching at c12 and invading
at Q13 or R13.

Sylvain: It's a bit early to invade (especially compared to the lower left), but as black is not pressured it's a good idea. However O17, aiming at sliding in the corner (R17) is a double purpose-play that could be better.]
;W[lf]C[Sylvain: M14 doesn't cut black!! (N15 or L15 is better), see var.]

(;B[qf]C[Bruce: I had no idea what to do after Jeff played 23 - Becuase
R16 was low, I decided to go for a shoulder hit and split his
stones.

Sylvain: that's a very good idea, white splits black and gets out in the center towards M14.]
;W[pe];B[qi]C[Sylvain: R14 was strange, now black has 3 weak groups in the upper part of the board :(]
;W[oi]C[Jeff: I believe I came off badly in the resulting fight.

Sylvain: the reason is not your fighting skills but the fact that you let your stones be split in that part of the board.]
;B[of];W[pf];B[pg];W[og];B[oh];W[ng];B[nh];W[mg]C[Bruce: I'm starting to get really worried here about my "group"
on the right side...there is a huge cut potential between R6
and Q9.

Sylvain: black still has to cope with Q12 to get one of his groups a bit safer, thus you can continue your attack, you should however keep in mind that before you play P15 the black stones have still some potential.]
;B[qh];W[qj]TR[pi]C[Sylvain: Q11 threatening to cut first, then R10 and black is still weak.]
;B[rj];W[rk];B[pj];W[qk];B[oj];W[ok];B[nj];W[qp]C[Bruce: I'm feeling a lot better about them now!

Sylvain: you left black settle his stones, but he of course did this gote so you can sttle yours.
If you had played Q11 black would be even more weak...];B[po]
;W[qo];B[nk]C[Bruce: It was important for me to play at O9, but Jeff got there
first. Any ideas on how a play at O9 or N8 could have been accomplished?

Sylvain: if white wants to play O9 or N8, then he has to play them before R4.
However I'm not sure that it was that important as O8 is still possible (if black P8 white P7).]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[pr];B[or];W[ec]C[Bruce: I've been expecting a corner invasion at any time.  I
wanted to protect and push the weak, floating group.

Sylvain: as long as the group is weak you don't fear any invasion (which would probably result in that group's death).
Because G16 is far, and M16 not completely safe, I'd rather attck from the opposite direction.]
;B[nl]C[Sylvain: the center becomes big for black, but he's very careless with his upper side group :(]
;W[hq]C[Bruce: It's about time I played here...Should this have been
a higher priority?

Sylvain: yes ;) see before...];B[dq];W[eq];B[bq];W[iq];B[jq]
;W[kb]TR[jr]C[Bruce: I think 60 was a mistake - probably should have been at
M17?

Sylvain: the problem is that the lower side group is still not alive!
K2 is very big (and sente) for both sides.
If white plays there, he's almost alive, and black has to reinforce his territory, which gets tiny.
If blck plays there, white has to capture D3, and is still not completely alive. Black's territory is big and solid.

Locally, M17 or L17 is nice, but L18 is not so bad.];B[lc];W[kc]
;B[mc];W[kd];B[pc];W[qc];B[pb]C[Sylvain: white should now play P15 and give black a hard time...]

(;W[qb];B[pd];W[qe];B[la];W[nb];B[lb]C[Jeff: Could white have killed me at this point?

Sylvain: black *is* dead...];W[oe];B[od]
(;W[nc]C[Sylvain: better from the other direction];B[rf];W[dr]
C[Bruce: I should have played N16 and killed black !

Sylvain: yes!
locally K2 is sente and thus better than D2.];B[ch]TR[md][gf]
[ki][jr]C[Sylvain: why? this is very small.
G14 to help the 2 stones, N16 to try to live, K2 to close territory, L11 to build on a large scale, would have been better.]
;W[he];B[hd];W[hf]C[Bruce: This, I think is my best move so far.  Black is going
to have to stuggle for life now.

Sylvain: may be G14 would help keeping black far from C12...]
;B[fe];W[eg];B[jb];W[ka];B[jc];W[kf]C[Sylvain: I'm not sure to understand this move... (N16 locally)]
;B[fb];W[eb];B[fc];W[hb];B[hc];W[ib];B[ja];W[id]C[Bruce: I got sloppy here - I should have played G18.

Sylvain: J16 is not good but G18 doesn't kill either (seki [both alive\] at best).]
;B[ic];W[ie];B[ge];W[gg];B[ef];W[dg];B[ed];W[dc]C[Bruce: Did I have any other choice here?  104 was gote.

Sylvain: tenuki [play elsewhere\], if black captures (can white resist to D17 at D18???) he only gets two stones gote for an already living group...]
;B[md];W[mb];B[ne];W[nf];B[sc]C[Bruce: I hate Monkey jumps!  There went 10 pts of potential territory.

Sylvain: but you should be happy, it's an endgame move played too early, and gote here!
10 pts is less than 35 (the approximate value of the black group), see var.]

(;W[kp]C[Bruce: I had no clear plan here, other than to try and separate
left from right.  I think this turned out poorly.

Sylvain: I wouldn't attack when isolated in the middle of such a black strength.
K2 is the best, or if you want to fight, at least cut at K4 instead of threatening to do so...]
;B[jp];W[kq];B[jr];W[nr]C[Bruce: I wanted to take advantage of cutting points on this black
'wall' - but I didn't see this simple response!

Sylvain: in the worst case black will give you his two stones, so it's not a real weakness...]
;B[nq];W[pn];B[no];W[fm]C[Now that black is at K2, I have to escape (and put more pressure
on black group to the right.

Sylvain: you don't need to escape thanks to D2, and you don't put pressure on a group solid as a rock that can connect itself from above or below L3-L4.]
;B[dl];W[kn];B[jl]C[Sylvain: yes.];W[ll];B[lk]C[Sylvain: L10 better.]
;W[kk];B[kl];W[lm];B[mk]C[Sylvain: M10 better (connects and threatens L9).]
;W[kj];B[hl]C[Sylvain: it's simpler to connect at L2, but not that bad to reinforce J6-K8]
;W[fl];B[kr]C[Sylvain: yes!];W[mh];B[mi];W[ik];B[ij]C[Jeff: Clearly I should have connected. I thought this was some
sort of tesuji, I suppose.

Sylvain: agreed.];W[hk];B[hj];W[gk]C[Sylvain: black should be careful not to lose all the white captured stones (if white J7 the two black cutting stones are bad!).]
;B[gj];W[fj];B[fi];W[fh];B[ej];W[fk];B[jk]C[Sylvain: it's getting worse, these stones will get caught and let the white group free :(]
;W[jj];B[ji];W[ki];B[li];W[kh];B[mr]C[Sylvain: K6 or K7 is still very big!!! (white inside dead).]
;W[im]C[Sylvain: too bad, 30 points gone...];B[ho];W[gn];B[gp]
;W[gq];B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[jm];B[mm];W[eo];B[dn];W[de];B[ee]
;W[ir];B[is];W[hs];B[js];W[hr]C[Bruce: There has to be a better sequence - so I can come out
of this with Sente?

Sylvain: yes, not add H2! if black G1 or G2 then H2 and after F3, double atari at F4...]
;B[hp];W[fp];B[ob]C[Jeff: Was this move necessary for life? I thought it was.

Sylvain: yes it is, and it's only seki (white O19 black Q19).]
;W[rg]C[Sylvain:???];B[rh]
(;W[re]C[Sylvain: this is not correct, you should close the corner, see var.]
;B[se];W[ei];B[di];W[gi];B[cg];W[bf];B[ag];W[bg];B[bh];W[qq]
;B[df];W[br]
(;B[rb]C[Sylvain: after D14 you have B15 as big yose [endgame move\] sente see var.]
;W[mq];B[lq];W[om];B[nm];W[ms];B[ns];W[dm];B[em]C[I knew I was behind, so I decided to play aggressively. Alas,
it was simply reckless.

Sylvain: yes C7 would have been better];W[cm];B[cn];W[en];B[el]
;W[bn];B[co];W[cl];B[dk];W[aq]C[Jeff: Black Resigns
Bruce: I was disappointed that both top black groups found life.
I think that the game was very close - a move or two differently
would have changed the entire course of the game.

Sylvain: that's true, white's lower left floating group, then all black's upper side weak groups, then finally white group inside black's center could (should?) all have died...

Anyway, you both showed good things but might need to work on:
- life and death,
- not creating too many weak groups,
- life and death again,
- using proverbs (push towards your own strength, get a base then jump out, etc.),
- life again once more,
- enjoying go and play a lot!

I hope you find this review helpful, if you have any question (even on another go-related topic) you can get in touch with me by e-mail: <Sylvain.Soliman@m4x.org>.]
