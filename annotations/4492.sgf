C[*OK, I'm putting in a few extra comments with a single * because I was kind of rushed when we were reviewing the game.
*Not his fault, my sister also wanted the computer.  Sorry it has taken me so long to submit it.
*We had to reopen the game to review it because we didn't know how to switch control and he had clicked the review button.--Bette
Bette [24k\]: hi :)
Arngrim [28k?\]: Hi!
Bette [24k\]: ok your here :)
Arngrim [28k?\]: Thanks for the lesson!

RS: Hi Bette. My user id on Dragon Go Server is 'rasa'. There I'm 9 kyu. Let me start off with a disclaimer. If any player higher then me says something different, believe her/him. In the e-mail from GTL, I was asked to review for Black, however you are White. I will therefore review for W. If I didn't answer that burning question you referred to. Let me know which one it was and I'll gladly answer it.]
;B[pd]C[Arngrim [24k?\]: HI
Arngrim [28k?\]: How long have you been playing?];W[cp];B[cd]
;W[fq]C[Bette [24k\]: off and on for a while, recently i hadn't played much, i've never really gotten that far
Bette [24k\]: but i think i have a couple things to say plus one good idea
Arngrim [28k?\]: ShootÂ¨!

RS: W should play in the lower right first. Normally letting B get into a 3rd corner is stategically not good, eventhough there was no harm in this game.]
;B[pp];W[cl];B[ed]C[RS: With Be16, B lets W get a double-wing formation as she did in the next move. Not good. B could have played k3 or k4 to prevent this.]
;W[jp]C[RS: Good idea W. B is still spread out enough for an invasion if he plays at q/r10. Another idea would be for W to play d11. B's formation in the upper left suggests he wants to play c11 or d10/11. With Wd11, you make an extension AND prevent him from making an ideal extension. 2 birds with 1 stone.]
;B[oq]C[RS: B, it would be much better if you played c10/11.]
;W[mq];B[pj];W[dh]C[Bette [24k\]: i was establishing a base, while you were claiming territory
Bette [24k\]: both good things
Arngrim [28k?\]: ok

RS: W is strong on this side. W should play at k17 or L17.]
;B[jd]C[Arngrim [24k?\]: please tell me what I did wrong in a rewiev after the game.
Bette [24k\]: sure if i can
*At this point I still didn't know who was better, so his comment kind of took me off guard]
;W[cf]C[Arngrim [28k?\]: I feel that I should have challenged you sooner

RS: This is a minor extension. W can still invade at the top or right side.]
;B[pm]C[Arngrim [24k?\]: Lag!
Arngrim [28k?\]: BTW ther's a lesson in "chinese go school" right now
Bette [24k\]: grr, i keep trying to type wehn this isn't active
Arngrim [28k?\]: LOL
Bette [24k\]: well they know more than me i'm sure
Bette [24k\]: my good idea was that after i go through it, we send it to the teaching ladder
Arngrim [28k?\]: But you had a couple things to say, and one good idea. So tell me please!
Arngrim [28k?\]: Sure!
Bette [24k\]: ok sure];W[nn];B[no]C[Bette [24k\]: oh, i meant to ask, when did you challenge me?
Bette [24k\]: here, or later?
Arngrim [28k?\]: Um.. a while ago?
Bette [24k\]: oh, you meant you should have played a game against me?
Bette [24k\]: i pry wouldn't have been around
Arngrim [28k?\]: I meant that I should have challenge your lefthand side earlier
Bette [24k\]: oh i don't know, if you kept what you have now plus grew into the middle, i might have lost
Bette [24k\]: even if i kept what i have now

RS: I believe B *has* to invade somewhere around e5. H4, j3, d10 or d6 seem possible to me.]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[np]C[Arngrim [28k?\]: ok];B[nq]C[Arngrim [24k?\]: Oops
Bette [24k\]: undo?
Arngrim [24k?\]: nah
Arngrim [24k?\]: I need to loose my first 100 games first :-)]
;W[lp];B[oo]C[Bette [24k\]: ok, notice this shape
Arngrim [28k?\]: yep
Bette [24k\]: i cant separate those four pieces right now, because if i did, you'd just capture my 2 pieces
Bette [24k\]: but if you try to attack that piece, i can just save it
Bette [24k\]: this came up again later on your side, and you just moved into atari

RS: B should have play move 23 somewhere else: f5, h4, d6, d10.]
;W[nl];B[nm]C[Arngrim [28k?\]: yep. stupid
Bette [24k\]: this didn't really change things
Arngrim [28k?\]: ok
Bette [24k\]: but if i'd tried to capture on the wrong side, you could have hurt me

RS: W played correctly with the right idea.]
(;W[mm];B[om];W[mj]C[RS: Game very close to being over.];B[on]
;W[mn];B[op];W[mp]C[RS: Unnecessary. W could have played elsewhere. Not that you really needed to, Bette.]
;B[nr]C[RS: This is dangerous to leave this way, W. B could do great damage. You leave it open for]
;W[pl];B[ql]C[Arngrim [28k?\]: I was trying to defend the corner, but i gave a a really strong wall
Bette [24k\]: there, i wasn't quite sure what would have happened if you had cut those pieces, i was experiementing
Bette [24k\]: but i'm not saying what is a good move, if someone reviews this, that would be a question

RS: If I were B, I'd've immediately jumped to j3. B *must* cause some damage to your ever-increasing territory. I think this is the last chance for B to do anything at all.

Bette, which pieces do you mean? If you mean cutting o8 and q8, you needn't worry. That would only be 1 point, Wq8, you lost.]
;W[pk];B[ol];W[qk];B[rk]
(;W[qm]C[Arngrim [28k?\]: ok

RS: W would have done better to extend to r10.];B[rl];W[rm]
;B[qj];W[ok]C[Bette [24k\]: i lost here
Bette [24k\]: well somewhere around here];B[nk]C[RS: I hate double-ataris like this!]
;W[ml];B[oj];W[mk];B[qn]C[Arngrim [28k?\]: S6 was unnecessary
Arngrim [28k?\]: beginner mistake
Bette [24k\]: you mean r6?
Arngrim [28k?\]: Nope, S6
Arngrim [28k?\]: Withoyoy R6 you could have saved the group
Bette [24k\]: another question for a reviewer, because that is beyond my skill
Arngrim [28k?\]: But really, lets do this later, I think Wilthang 9D's lesson isa worth listening to for both of us.

RS: Wr6 was the wrong way to cut. Wr10 would've been better.]
;W[nh];B[rn];W[ph];B[qe]C[RS: Here W can still invade the top.]

*been invading as in the variation

;B[gm];W[im]C[RS: W should play towards her weakest side where B is most likely to get eye space. For instance, f6.]
