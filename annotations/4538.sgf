AB[dp][pd]C[Dear reviewer!

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game!

The game was played aon IGS this evening, and both players, the game has been a challenge and we played very thougthful, and I wonder if you will get aware of.

This is my 4. game for which I requested a review, and I look foreward to get it back, because everytime I gained best knowledge!

Some thoughts are added!

*: I am not very strong; but I'll try my best to highlight things that can be done differently.  All my comments will start with *:.  I am IgoShinKen on IGS about 4K*.  I hope my comments help you :).]

C[I was satisfied with the Fuseki, considdering the handicap.

*: Agreed; considering the handicap it is not bad but I think approch at G3 was okay but you should have gone for F3 I think. Look at the example. Other than that I think you played the openning very well :).]

(;W[dh]MA[pb][ch][mo]C[*: Lets assess the playing ground ...

White has two weak groups one bottom, one right.  Making a third one might not be a good idea.

Black has 1 weak group on top right.  So your next move should be where it helps you and hurts black.

Any of those three points I think are most critical.]
(;B[cg]C[*: Not good defence ... So you made a mistake black made a mistake even.]
;W[ch];B[bh];W[bi];B[bg];W[ci];B[dj]C[*: Greedy ...];W[fh];B[ff]

(;W[ej]SQ[go][gq][ip][dr]MA[fh][dh][ch][ci][bi]C[*: Nope better to run; or you might start a family battle between the two groups.  And at end might end up loosing one.  Right now F16 is more important.]
;B[bj];W[ah];B[ek];W[fj];B[hf];W[ce]C[*: I think after ignoring F14 his is imporant move if you wnat to keep the group safe.  So it's okay ...]
;B[jf]
(;W[fc]C[*: Mistake .... See next comment why.];B[fl]C[*: Ohh double attack ... trouble brewing .. help you groups NOW!!!

Really I can't see a single move that will help both groups :(

Chose one and then come back to other; which ever you choose other will suffer ... E17 should have been down around F9 instead ...]
;W[dg]C[*: I don't like this move; I think you should attack if you are going to on a bigger front.  LIke attack the Q16 group and then attack D14 group this way you get a double attack going.]
;B[cf];W[ef]C[*: I don't like this move yes it attacks black but you ruin you entire top.  But in site of tht the current group is weak you don't have much chooice.]
;B[ee];W[eg];B[de];W[fe];B[fd];W[ge];B[gd];W[he];B[hd]C[*: Black mistake never push from behind it was a earily xmas present.  Black needs to play J16.

So you got lucky there .. black ended in gote here so you ended up getting alot more then what you should have.]

*: Right area yes .. but you have 4 weak groups now black has 2.  So need to balance things out this is not enough.]

;B[gi]
(;W[gh]C[*: I don't think this move is important right now; even though you are trying to rob black of its' eye space black can still run.

So first surround the group so it can't run then attack it.]
;B[di];W[hg];B[gg];W[fg];B[hg];W[gj]TR[fj][gk]C[*: Rash move ... L12 better.  THis gives you a empty triangle .. so not good.]

Erwin: ok
Robinhood1 has resigned the game.

*: Looking at this game .. not a good game to review.  Black made too many mistakes. 

Noramlly its better to review a game that is more close; or you lost so you can see your mistakes.  

Few comments about your style of play ...

- You have very good sense of finding weaknesses.
- But need to way the weakness/strength of all groups when attacking.  If black played properly this could have caused you problem more then once.
- Don't be in a rush to kill; first surround before you attack.]

(;B[qm]C[*: Black should come in deep to start a fight.]))
(;B[fm]C[*: Right defense.  Sometimes empty triangles are a good move; in this case it keeps white weak so def a good move.

*: I will not play all the paths this can lead to; but need less to say this gives black better chance at fight then D7 will.]

Similar to what you did; but this time black forced you to do it instead of you doing it on your own  for one.  Two black's two stones at D10 don't look too good right about now ...]
