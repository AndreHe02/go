C[I played this game against myself. I hope it doesn't matter and makes sense... :)

The end result is extremely even (only 0.5 points of difference) and even thought there were no really big L&D fights, I liked it.
I would specially appreciate comments on fuseki, as I have just started learning some typical opening moves...

Btw, my rating on KGS might be a bit too pessimistic, as I lost a couple of kyus due to some really shameful games... Something like 19 kyu might be a better estimate, I think.

I would appreciate some estimation about my
strength according to this game.];B[qd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[ec]
;W[de]LB[df:A]C[As I understand it, this is a less common move than playing at A. The diagonal move played here was common before the era of komi.]
;B[hd];W[nq];B[qn];W[kp];B[co];W[fp]LB[cm:A]C[Since you're playing against yourself, it's hard to judge things like intent. You're also much less likely to be aggressive the way a real opponent would be. For instance, white might pincer that last black move at A -- what would black do then?]
;B[dl];W[dh]C[Is this a rather slow move? Perhaps better at the right side? Perhaps an attack
to the upper right corner?
On the other hand, I thought that this would make some influence in the left side and make the mojo bigger...

---

Well, it does expand white's side while at the same time putting pressure on the black group. On the other hand, black has a nice double-wing formation on the right and top, and it won't get easier to invade there as time goes on.]
;B[oc]LB[pj:A][kc:B]C[Having thought about that, I secured the corner then... :)
Perhaps playing around Q10 would have been better?

---

Well, the corner is now pretty safe for black. Yes, white can mess up the influence with a play at A, but then again black can play at B and make a pretty secure top moyo.]
;W[pj]C[Hey, lookit that!];B[om]LB[pg:A]C[Meh. A is better, to preserve as much of that top block as possible.]
;W[pg]C[See, how white gets it and black is squished into the corner. The direction of that top enclosurre is toward the bottom, so that's where the influence is best used.]
;B[bq]LB[kc:A][ip:B]C[It's pretty early for a second line play, although of course this does gain some territory for black. I'd play at A or B first.]
;W[cr];B[ci];W[ch];B[di]
(;W[eh]C[Too slow, perhaps?

---

Well, it's safe. But aggression is important, especially at this stage of the game. Try one of the variations -- the middle is still pretty open, and the sooner you get into your opponent's business, the easier it will be to disturb her plans. You might end up losing your cutting stones, but it's often worth a shot.]
;B[md]C[I thought this would secure a good big mojo at the top...

---

Yes, but now it's urgent for white to get in there.   This snapshot of the board shows how tough it is to evaluate games we play against ourselves -- it's almost like mirror go. Black has a big moyo at the top, and white has one at the bottom. Each has a medium sized one on the left and right. So things are about even, and not surprisingly so. How likely is it that we would ever really crush ourselves?]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[mm]C[Here I thought also about O9, but after long consideration, played N7.
---
Well, what is the goal? To keep black contained to the corner? It's a little late for that, as black goes on to show. If the goal is to stretch out white's bottom moyo, this is too far of a jump. It seems to be a move that lacks definition.]
;B[nk];W[ni];B[lk];W[li];B[km];W[ll]C[Is this kind of attack ok in a situation like this?

---

Again, the question is about purpose. What is white trying to do? Keep black contained? Again, not much hope of that. Suppose white does cut off black's stones in the middle. Is she really sure black can't connect on the left?]
;B[kl];W[kk];B[ml];W[lm]
(;B[im]C[Is this the best way to go? I thought that I'd better save those two stones by extending.

---

See the variation.];W[lj];B[mk];W[jk];B[hk];W[ql]C[White is still pretty open here on the right.. This is the first stone she's played on the 3rd line, which means black is likely to try to invade and screw up the base.]

(;B[rm];W[rl];B[pl];W[pk];B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[jd]C[This was a rather wild invasion attempt, which succeeded quite well.
Would it have worked against a stronger player than myself?

---

Perhaps. Again, white would have been smart to do this much earlier.]
;B[je]C[What is the best answer for black? This didn't work very well in the long run...]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[ke]
(;B[kf]C[Black would be wise to crosscut here, or maybe play at C. See the variations.]
;W[le];B[ld];W[kd];B[lf];W[me]
(;B[nf]C[Too early to jump, and chasing white is silly here. At this point, white is going to link up. Black should keep himself safe and defend the corner, rather than chasing after the white group. See the variation.]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[ne]
(;B[of]C[This was probably a mistake, even thought it resulted in a rather interesting fight...

---

At the least, keep black connected (variation).];W[ng];B[nh]
;W[og];B[lh];W[oe];B[pf];W[pe];B[qf];W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[qg]
;W[rg];B[qh];W[oh];B[mh]C[Perhaps S12 instead?

---

Again, it's silly to chase white.];W[pi];B[rd]C[I thought about this one quite long and decided that the R14-group was lost and better secure the corner.
Would there have been any better way?

---

No, but again, this decision should have been made earlier.]

(;W[rh]C[Definitely not white's best move. See the variation.]
;B[lb];W[kc];B[ii]LB[ei:A]C[At this stage the situation looked a bit bad for black, so I tried to make as much territory at the center as possible.
---
Except that this doesn't make much territory for black. White has a number of places to push in here. What if white plays at A? Playing at A himself is probably black's best territory making move.]

(;W[mi]C[I think this was the best for white. If white would have played elsewhere, black could play at N11 and separate
the white group in the middle, most probably killing it.
For white this is, of course, sente as black must defend.

---

Yeah, okay. But a bamboo joint is more efficient.];B[kh]
(;W[ol]C[With this I tried to isolate the black N9 group, but it didn't succeed.
---
That's why the forcing move at B first is important.];B[pm]
;W[nl];B[nm];W[ok];B[ln]C[Didn't see that when I played P8 :)]
;W[iq]C[Didn't see any other big moves, so I secured the territory at the bottom.
Would
there have been better moves?

---

If black invades here, white will be able to either kill the invading stones, or use the pressure to seal up territory. White is so strong that I don't think an invasion is something to much fear. On the other hand, white has a lot of influence on the top that she can use to crush black's territory up there. Black needs only play a couple of moves to take away that aji, so white should take advantage of it first (and besides, black has to respond at first, so white can always play here later).]
;B[kj]LB[jf:A]C[This looked like a really strong black
move, but resulted to be a rather big mistake...

---

That's because black is too stretched out, dating back to that chase of the white group that failed. Black need to connect at A first before trying this. Remember: Business before pressure.]
;W[ki];B[jj];W[ji];B[ij];W[jh];B[jg];W[ih];B[ig];W[ie]C[I really liked this one. Black can't connect at K14. See the variation.]

(;B[hg];W[jf];B[kg];W[hh];B[he];W[gh];B[fj];W[fn];B[ho]LB[en:A]
C[Perhaps better somewhere near F7?

---

Why? What is black's goal? If it's to make territory, A is the move. If it's to get in the way of white's territory, this is just fine.]

;W[hp];B[jo];W[jp];B[lo];W[lp]C[Is reinforcing black's territory while giving white "free" territory-reinforcing
moves good in this case?
Could there be something better?

---

Well, it's a little late for big invasions, but if I were black, I might be inclined to try anyway, since black appears to be behind at this point. But you're right -- it looks like pushing in is the best way to deal with white's big bottom territory. But once again, it should have been done sooner.]

really like how even the score resulted to be. Only 0.5 points of difference
(with 5.5 seki).

---

5.5 komi. A seki is a stalemate situation, where neither black nor white stones can be killed.

I think the even score is largely a result of the fact that you played yourself, and naturally the opponents were pretty even in terms of skill. =)

Still, you've got a good solid style. The best way to make it better is to take on a wide range of opponents. Keep playing and have fun!  
Cheers..
