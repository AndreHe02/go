C[Hi,

I'm your GTL reviewer, and I'll do my best to point out a few mistakes.  After a first look at this game, it's clear that b did not make any single huge mistake that lost the game.  Instead, there were two or three mistakes in direction of play, and a few more moves that weren't quite optimal from the perspective of making points.  So w was able to win by a small margin due to these little mistakes.

As you get stronger in go, there are fewer huge mistakes, and more of these little sub-optimal moves, so if you lose a game like this you can consider it a sign of progress :)

Be sure to check out the variations in addition to my comments.

;B[db];W[od];B[ld]C[I have no idea what black is supposed to play in a position like this. But going in between the two white stones looked like a good idea.

--
Yes, the H16 and P16 stones are now both weak, and playing between them was absolutely the right idea.]
;W[kc]
(;B[oc]C[Now when I have looked at the game I guess M17 or something else to keep white from connecting is the way to go.

--
Yes, I would guess you played P17 out of joseki-habit.  A move may be familiar but not good.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[lc]
(;B[pf]C[1. You should cut.

2. Even if you don't cut, Q15 or R14 is better.

Q14 is a kind of greedy move that seems to take more territory than R14 but it is actually worse in practise.]
;W[qh]C[An interesting move.]
(;B[qn]C[Should attack R12 strongly.];W[qe]C[What do I do here?
Mabye I should not have played tenuki.

--
Tenuki was fine, but now you must do some reading.  This is the reason why Q14 is seldom played.]

(;B[pd]C[You were much too afraid about the Q16 cut, from move 20 to here.]
;W[ql];B[nd]C[Since you already spent a move at P16, this move is now very small and shows a lack of plan.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[me];B[nb];W[mc];B[cc];W[cd];B[kq]C[Perhaps it is a little bit conservative here.  F3 on this side might be stronger, or you can play on the left side.]

(;B[ho]C[To let w connect so easily -- it is very soft play.]
;W[fr]C[My 3-3 invasion ruined my territory. On the other hand white dont get much territory, so mabye its not that bad?

--
Actually your invasion was fine, it was the moves after it, G4 and H5, that ruined your territory.]
;B[ip]C[I don't understand the purpose of this move.  Spending another move here at this point is extremely painful, and this particular move seems to do almost nothing for b's position.]
;W[iq];B[jp];W[ci]C[W got C11 because of your J4.  B has all four corners, but very little territory, and many weak points.  In this position I would choose w.]

(;B[oh]C[Maybe not the biggest move.  This makes no territory for b, and only modestly reduces w's potential.]

(;B[mq]C[N3 or N6 are moves to save some territory around M4.  However, there is very little territory to find there.  Perhaps a better plan for b is to reduce aggressively here.]
;W[mr];B[lq];W[mn];B[lm]C[Getting cut here was no good. Mabye a move at L7 would have been better?

--
This is a difficult question.  M7 was maybe not so good, but M7 was not the problem.  Allowing w O6 which is very big was a problem, and N2 and M2 don't make any points.  Playing O6 earlier would have been a good way to avoid all this difficulty.]

(;B[kn];W[km];B[kl];W[jm]
(;B[jl];W[ll];B[il];W[kk];B[ih];W[kh]C[At this point the yose begins, with w ahead by a few points.  The game was determined in the center, and you had a number of chances to take the advantage there, but in general you played a little timidly in the center, and seemed too content with your corner territory in the early game.  There were some mistakes in the yose but nothing too interesting, so the review ends here.

Let me know if you have any questions, and I hope this helps :)  You can find me sometimes on KGS or IGS as inimino.]
