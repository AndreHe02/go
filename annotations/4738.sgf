AB[pd][dp]C[I'm Black
I thoght I was better than 9k so 2 stones looked too much
but at the end one big mistake proved me wrong

 Dear reviewer,
I want to know what in general are the weak points in my play and how to improve rhem
thank you in advance
 arie];W[pp];B[qf]C[since two stones looked too much I thought i will give 3rd corner
and stabilize another];W[dd]
(;B[gq]TR[jc][jd]SQ[pd][qf]C[with your 2 stones in the top right it aims at an extension along the side here so rather than what you played I would suggest extending the top first because even if W advances on your corner at the bottom first?]
;W[dj]C[

to me d10 W looked too deep?];B[mq];W[pj]C[again W too deep?]
;B[pm]C[pincer?
looked right];W[np];B[mo];W[mp];B[lp];W[lo];B[lq];W[nq];B[ko]
;W[ln]C[There is no worry here about W cutting so it would be better at this state to try and pull the Q7 stone out, which would in turn allow you to attack W's Q10 stone]

(;B[kn];W[lm];B[ld];W[gc];B[dg];W[cm];B[gg]C[c7 was too dangerous so I went up]
;W[km];B[in];W[jm];B[im];W[ol];B[qo]C[here i wasnt sure
to go down with  R5 and try to live
or try to connect with r9
I was afraid I couldnt connect
and then W will have a nice wall against upper right];W[qp]
;B[ro];W[rp];B[rk];W[rj]
(;B[qi];W[qk];B[rl];W[qj];B[ri]TR[qi]C[I decided that  to lose or almost lose the group isnt too bad if i can make a nice wall

These 2 stones are only doing about 5 points worth of work... and at this stage your group is pretty much dead, and living inside hurts far too much as White will probably just ignore and play elsewhere.]
;W[sj];B[ci];W[cj];B[ij]C[here  I began my plan to catch c7 gruop
in the end failing to do that cost me the game

Attempting to catch the group at C7 is hoping for too much, at any point W can go to B5 and live without any worries]
;W[jn];B[jo];W[il];B[hl];W[hk];B[ik];W[jl];B[gl];W[gj]C[
g10 suprised me
now i had to close two long lines  to catch
but I still thoght it is possible];B[gi];W[fj];B[hj];W[gk];B[fl]
C[this  I feel wasnt optimal
any sugestions?];W[fi];B[gh];W[di];B[ch];W[dn]C[again a good W move i ddidnt see coming]

;B[ep];W[dk];B[bk];W[el]C[this is W mistake?
B10 is better right?

Although B10 will live, the path is slightly more confusing and its not very fun for white to play :)... too submissive on his behalf as B gets to strengthen BOTH sides AND he gets to end in sente.]
;B[ek];W[dl];B[fm];W[fk];B[bj];W[gp];B[fp];W[go];B[hp];W[ho]
;B[io];W[bl];B[bn]C[now I thoght I won the game];W[eg]C[I thoght about E12
but at the end played D12
because I didnt see W  F13
this looks like the losing move to me

E12 would have been correct here :)]
(;B[dh];W[fg]C[arie77 [9k?\]: nice];B[ff]C[now i knew I lost the left side
but I Thought if I could take the middle maybe I can save the game
and wanted payment (influence) for losing the big W group];W[ef]

(;B[ee]C[Too much here... this is too weak for anything to occur at this stage. strengthen the left first then you can try this.]
;W[fe];B[gf];W[df];B[fh];W[eh];B[ed]C[I wasnt sure if I can still take the group
I gambled on my small d13 group to try to catch the W group
and I wanted the upper corner];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg]C[I thought about B15 but then I would lose the small gtoup for sure]
;B[bh];W[cg];B[al];W[am];B[de];W[bm]C[W afraid of  Ko?];B[ce]
C[in the end I lost the small d13 group and of course couldnt take the W group]

Right idea but leaves too much open.  Either of the triangles would be better.]

was there a way to save them?];B[so];W[sk]

Then you should have closed BEFORE you played S12 :)];W[rg]

[ds][es][fs][gs][hs][is]C[I knew lost a few points at the end but that didnt matter since the game was over when I lost
the right small  group

something that is typical in my games is that I get  good influence on the center but in the end I end up with a very shrinked middle group
also I'm a very bad counter so I just "feel" who's ahead without counting
I figure- if I'm playing my best it doesnt matter mush who's ahead

so major  weak points
 and how to improve?

thanks in advance

(;B[ne]C[and this is the answer :)];W[oc];B[pc]C[white can't push any further and now you could look towards making a move to attack him... something like K17 or M18  strengthen yourself and weaken him.]
))
(;B[ni]C[NOW S12 would be nice for you]))
(;B[nl]C[your group is LONG dead especially since W has T10 so just use it as threats]
))
(;B[ic]C[This is slightly better in my opinion.];W[ob]C[let W live there, you have closed a hole on your middle, and have taken a chunk of the side rather than just keeping your corner, plus you can still play in the corner :)]
;B[qb];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb];B[fb];W[gb];B[oi]C[Easy game for Black from this point... you can pretty much answer anything. your ahead by an easy 20 points without too many weaknesses :)]
))
(;B[ce]C[with this your Left is easily alive and w now has to worry :)]
;W[tt];B[ee];W[fe];B[gf];W[de]C[with this W can easily save the group HOWEVER...]
;B[df]C[this is complete Sente... if White ignores his group dies so he will not ignore it]
;W[ed];B[ni]TR[jd][ie]C[now you have pretty much closed off the middle section for yourself but White will still try and come in at the open side.  Any further than the triangles though and he is at risk of losing anything there.]

[en:2][eo:1]SQ[ej][al]C[With this W will start a battle but you have a huge lead on him.. you either just extend your liberties, which you don't need at this point, or play elsewhere... If you count it carefully White only has 6 liberties on the entirety of his group.  The square liberties are free liberties for Black as, played in the right order white either can't or has to respond.]

(;B[nl];W[nj];B[ll]TR[mn]SQ[lj]C[now with this W has to worry about 2 things.
First is if you are allowed to make a move at the Triangled square cutting his 2 stones off and threating almost instant life in there.
Second is if you get to play at the Square... White will be under severe attack.]
