C[Hello Dear Reviewer,
I am white in this game.
The main issue I wanted to learn is how to prevent black from taking over the big territory at the bottom. I appreciate your adive!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc]C[Experiment with different openings.  Q13 is possible if your worried about sizable moyos developing for black.  Playing between star points happens all the time in handicap games so perhaps study them for some methods of invasion.]
;B[lc]
(;W[qc]C[What is black's likely response?  Who does it benefit more?  Picking your joseki appropriately and understanding what each move is doing is important.]
;B[qd]C[I agree with this response as the right direction for black.  White is forced to take corner territory while black builds a strong wall facing a black stone.  Who could ask for more?  
See variation for the R17 stone.];W[pc];B[od];W[rc]
(;B[oc]C[I agree.  This is too early for white to press this without specific advantage.  O16 seems alright to after this but it did before P17 also.  Style perhaps.   See variation.

Is P17 good? Seems to me better to wait with it to keep option for P18 later?]
;W[ob]
(;B[rd]C[Too low for the moment.  Black adds little to the strength of his side moyo and allows white out at O16.  Bad trade.  If white insisted on pushing out at s15 right away black gets to push him along the 2nd line, the line of defeat.  See variation.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[ld]C[You might be hoping for too much here.  See variation.

How about this move? Is this the correct way to prevent being sealed in the corner?]

(;B[mb]C[This move forces O18 wich actually makes things better for white all round.  N16 for black is no longer as good.

F17 seems a bit outlandish considering that N16 seemed to work out nicely for black before N18 was played.

Is this the correct continuation? Or F17 is better?];W[nb];B[md]
;W[mc];B[me]
(;W[lb]C[Why not go for all you can.  See variation.];B[kc]
;W[kd];B[kb];W[ma];B[jd]C[Perhaps leave these guys for dead for now and wait till the play heads back this direction. Trying to build up weak stones in the enemies area this early usually lets the opponent build stronger moyos]
;W[ke]C[This is creating weak shape that black exploits to make his moyo stronger.]
;B[jf]C[This I think is obviously untenable for black he can't honestly hope to capture you with that move.  However it does give white the impression of profit to be had form the capture of L17 etc.  Be wary of small and early captures.  You often end up letting the opponent build large moyos.]
;W[je];B[ie];W[jc];B[jb];W[id];B[kf];W[ib];B[le];W[jd];B[hd]
;W[ic];B[hc];W[hb];B[hf]C[White is heavy and caught 4 stones.  Black has built an outward facing wall that makes the Q10 stones shine.  There is no where for white to invade above Q10.  Compare that with whites confirmed territory on the upper right side.  K4 for black looks like the next logical big play for him.]
;W[ge];B[he];W[ef]C[The result is that Black built a very big moyo. Seems I went the wrong path in recent moves...]
;B[gb];W[ja];B[cc]
(;W[dc]C[The purpose of putting to stones beside each other like that is often to begin making a wall.  A wall should ideally face a friendly stone at some distance away or even just empty space.  Should your wall face an opponents wall it is next to useless.

Here black takes corner profits and you get nothing.  C16 might have been better if only to make your wall face an empty space.
See variation.];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[ch];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[fc]C[Big board focus requires saving moves like this till the end game or for ko fights as they are not worth many points at all.  

F17 is not sente now at all.  Its worth maybe 5 points.  How much worth would a white stone at O3 have right now?]
;B[jp];W[oi]C[You are now in an up hill battle.  Moves like this usually require friendly stones or more open spaces to work properly.  As it stands it has to build across more then half the board to reach a friendly stone.  As an invasion it stands a godo chance of being trapped and killed by black.  

This moyo stems from earlier misplays by white.  First in the upper righ hand corner with a poorly choosen joseki.  Then with the attempt to save the weak stones at M16.  Finally letting black play K4.  

Whole board play comes from seeing how things will react with each other for later.  :)  You don't want this situation to be in the hands of your opponent]

;W[en];B[fn];C[White is essentially lucky to have not been killed around R7 and not been more aggressively pursued around O13.  Further the territory on the bottum side was formed by black's attack on the O13 and R7 groups.  Both groups were under severe pressure from the fact that black's right side moyo was so huge.  
So even though black's moyo was first formed to the upper right, it allowed black to build the territory on the bottum side very easily while attacking whites groups.  Its an action reaction kind of arrangement that should be avoided as is obvioused by whites near lose of the R7 stones.

If you have questions email me at salvor7@yahoo.com.  I usually play on kgs as salvor7 so if you want further discussion let me know and we can setup a time to meet there.
