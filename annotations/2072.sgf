;B[cn];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq];W[eq];B[cp];W[gq]LB[go:B]C[Considering the pincer stone, it is usual and slightly better to play at "B"]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[qf]C[It seems possible to let the situation as it is in the upper left corner and take the initiative here.]
;B[qh];W[of]C[It is not so clear that this choice is good for White : He is investing a lot on influence ; may be difficult to get points with such a strategy.]

LB[om:a]C[30 : Usually played at "a"];B[qm];W[on]
(;B[kd]LB[po:B]C[on 33, my idea was to counter the influence of the white wall.

A play around Q5 or R5 seemed too passive and the thrust at P13 too early.
JH : Right
 L16 seemed to combine nicely with the upper border, was it too ambitious?
JH : I like this move. I think it is better than the ordinary play at "B"]
;W[op]LB[nq:B]C[White should have play at "B" to keep the side.]
;B[oq];W[pp];B[mq]C[Black is clearly better];W[np];B[lp]C[at 39. I desperately wanted to keep the door to the center open, but this might have been an overplay
JH : No it is OK];W[nq];B[nr];W[qp];B[qq];W[rq]LB[lo:a]C[White should play at "a" to block the center]
;B[lr];W[rr]LB[qr:a]C[46 : too slow. At least, white can play at "a"]
;B[jq]LB[ln:B]C[here I felt like beeing punished and was looking for a quick life47 
JH :  Black move is too small. First bad move. Just play tobi in the center at "B"]
;W[pg];B[ro];W[qr];B[hq]LB[ln:B]C[51 This is not so big. I prefer the jump in the center at "B"]
;W[fr];B[hp];W[hr];B[iq];W[cl]LB[bn:A][dn:B][cm:C][dm:a]C[I never really know how to handle this check, A and B always seem too passive
JH : May be "C" is good to take sente but A is possible. I think I would play at "d" or A which here is the best move.]
;B[bm]C[57 : Not good];W[bl];B[ff]LB[fe:A][al:a][ak:b][am:c]
[bj:d][id:e]C[The idea was not to let w play on A
JH : 59 at A is more normal.
Looking back at the game, Black cood consider playing at "b", "c", "d", "e" and pack his territory with "f" even if these moves are generally not good.]
;W[bo];B[co];W[bn];B[cm];W[am];B[bp]LB[ap:B][an:C]C[Shoul play the move at "C" yo get the play at "B" in sente. It makes a BIG difference : alive or dead.]
;W[an];B[em]C[maypbe securing life in the corner should have been my first priority]
;W[dl];B[fn];W[go];B[fk];W[di];B[cc]LB[id:B][fi:a]C[73: looks good but I think Black can win the game easily if he plays at "B" or "b"]
;W[fi];B[hm];W[ho];B[jm];W[jp];B[kp];W[in];B[ir]LB[im:B]C[81 Bad : just connect at "B". Black is already alive !]
;W[is];B[js];W[hs];B[kr];W[im];B[hk];W[hi];B[il];W[el];B[fl]
;W[hd]C[92 : Good. A chance for White to come back in the game]

C[I think  101 is better at "B3];W[dg];B[bf];W[eh];B[ce];W[df]
;B[cd];W[de];B[gc]LB[rd:B]C[The corner at "B" is big, but 109 protects against a possible cut, so it is possible as it is almost sente.]
;W[ib];B[qd];W[re];B[or]LB[rd:B][rn:C]C[You should answer at "B" as the connexion at 113 is gote as you get a weakness at "C" after white connect as you point out afterwards.]
;W[rp];B[rn]LB[rg:A][rk:B]C[This looks certainly clumsy, But letting w play ther in combination with A and B seemed dangerous]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[lc];B[mc]C[119 : Good];W[ld];B[lb];W[kb];B[mb]
;W[kc];B[rd];W[sh]C[A bit early as this move is not clearly sente.]
;B[si];W[sf];B[rj]C[Black answers as it is not clear he will be alive but it may be not necessary.]
;W[ne];B[kj];W[md];B[oc];W[kh];B[hg];W[ig];B[jh]LB[hf:B]C[This move doestn't look good. May be better to play simply at "B". Later you lost one stone here.]
;W[jg];B[mj];W[li];B[ki];W[lh];B[lj]LB[ml:B]C[Better at "B"]

(;B[og];W[ng];B[pg];W[nh];B[pf]LB[lc:B][qc:A]C[P13 might have lead to a territory vs influence game, but with A and B still open, I was not sure whether this could pay off]
