C[Hi,
thanks for review.

>Hey, Kamtre here. 
>OK, let's see: You need to know how to break what I call the Ponnuki Problem. That is when your opponent spreads using the ponnuki: the thingy in the move 2 var. A ponnuki is a versatile shape. It provides spread in any direction, and it has a partially developed eye. If you can beat it , your opponen't can't do what he did to you in this game.
>I will mark my wisdom (LOL) with ">"
>I'm sorry if all the variations get you bogged down, but take your time, and you will learn very much from them.]

;B[id]
(;W[gq]LB[jp:A]C[>A is much better. Your jump doesn't do much. Though it does make your corner more solid, at this point in the game moyo is worth more. Look at B's top, and see that he is developing his territory nicely, and has only some minor issues to work through before he has lots of territory. In short, A is much too small.]
;B[dj];W[dl]LB[cl:A]C[>"When approaching an enemy's stone, use the third line" that's a proverb. A is more stable.]

(;W[rn]C[>This is a good move, but in this situation (aka, getting butchered by ponnuki) a cut is needed. (I'm pretty sure the move is called a Sabaki) See the var.]
;B[pl]C[>Now he almost has a ponnuki];W[qk];B[rm]LB[nq:A]C[>I would definately play A, see var.]

(;W[mo];B[nn]C[>Now you let him consturct ponnuki. You are now officailly in trouble.

>Yes, just forgetting that one stone would be much better. 1, it gives you a ko liberty, which can be a real pain if someone tries to kill your group, and 2, the turn you used can be, as you said, used for a better cause. A-E are all good expansion moves, remember, you need one more eye. (it takes practice to see, but the group you have has a dead eye shape so far)]

>Just a hint for when you send in more though. It may take some time, but thouroughly reveiwing your own game will help both you and me, because I had some trouble seeing exactly what you had problems with.. for example, I didn't even know whether you knew where you screwed up on the ponnuki.
