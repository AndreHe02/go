AB[pd][dp]C[Alex: Hi, I'm Alex Weldon... about 1d on KGS/IGS/DGS and 3d AGA/CGA. I hope you'll find this review useful.

The theme for this game is splitting attacks. How to execute them, and how to avoid them. There were so many turning points in this game it's hard to keep track of all the back and forth, but most of them involve you and your opponent ignoring the basic principle of keeping your adversary's groups separated and connecting your own.

That, and a little bit of work on the fuseki, and choice of josekis.

Don't take any of my fighting variations too literally... it's all too complicated for me to read, so I just wanted to show a few of my attempts to give you the basic idea. Needless to say, the outcome of a fight in a real game is rarely certain anyway.]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[qo];B[np]
(;W[qq]C[Alex: This is more of a joseki for special circumstances, when Black already has a stone around Q10 and you just want to settle quickly. Aside from making a living group, it doesn't do much for you, so it's not appropriate for ordinary circumstances and especially not for handicap games as White.

You could make an extension up the right side, around Q9, but for a handicap game, I would either tenuki or attack Black immediately around M3. Tenuki would be my move, but see variation for how M3 could work.]
;B[qr];W[pp];B[oq];W[rq];B[jq]C[The lower right corner looks a little slow for W.

Alex: Agreed.];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]C[Alex: Since you were slow afoot in the lower right, I think you need to play the more fleet-footed move at K16.]
;B[qc];W[jd]C[Alex: This is the biggest mistake so far. You can't mix and match these two josekis. If you slide to Q18, you need to make a tight extension to L17 or M16. If you want to make this looser extension, you can't slide first.

The reason is that sliding induces Black to take away the corner invasion at R17, so O17 becomes heavy - you can no longer sacrifice it to live in the corner. The invasion at M16 is therefore a big problem, since you'll have to take care of both sides.

If you have already played K16, you can LATER slide to Q18 and then immediately jump to O15... but don't slide first. Black should invade immediately.]
;B[dj];W[cn]LB[cn:A]C[I have to get into B's moyo - is A the best way?

Alex: I don't know if you really have to get into Black's moyo right away. Do you see a perfect move for him? None of C4, D3, C3, K5, K10 etc. seem perfect for Black, so there's probably no rush.

Keep in mind that this is a handicap game, so if Black seems a little ahead, don't panic. He's supposed to still be a little ahead at this point.

O15 is an urgent point for White, since Black failed to invade. C13 is also quite large.]
;B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[cl]C[Looks like W is too concentrated.

Alex: If you don't like this result, you could have played D6 at E6 or even E5 to stay light, but this isn't so bad. D10 is a potential target for attack, and you've still got the aji at C3.]
;B[cg]LB[cg:A];W[bj]LB[cg:A]C[Black A  helps.

Alex: This is indeed a large move for you, depriving Black of a base and making one for yourself.]
;B[eg]
(;W[ce]C[Alex: This is too small since it a) doesn't take away all Black's eye potential, and b) Black wouldn't have two clear eyes even if he slid to B16. 

F16 or maybe G17 is better... as you say later, it's very big if Black gets to play there. See variation.]
;B[qi]C[Alex: Slow move for Black. You should be grateful and ignore it.]
;W[ql]C[Alex: Slow move for White. You give sente right back.

Having chosen the joseki in the lower right, you should at least appreciate its meaning, which is that you're already pretty much alive - an extension around here and turning in the corner at S2 are miai for life... thus, adding a move here later deceives the point.]
;B[bo];W[ci]C[Alex: I'm not sure this is good. It seems to strengthen Black.]
;B[di];W[ch];B[ff]LB[dh:A]TR[cg]C[I'm sure B should have connected at A so this is my first break.

Alex: A is probably better, you're right... but don't underestimate this move. Black is (or should be) aiming at B next, while cutting off the marked stone is small for you. The problem with this move is more to do with the shape of the group as a whole than with the immediate danger of White A.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[dg]C[Alex: If Black played at F17 now, I'd have said F14 was an interesting move, but since he tenukis, I guess he didn't understand it himself.]
;B[df];W[cf];B[cj]C[Alex: Awful aji keshi. B9 is much more interesting, although it doesn't work right now.]
;W[bk];B[qb]C[Alex: Say thank you to Black for this move, since it induces you to protect against the invasion. O15 also reduces the threat of Black F17 a little too.]
;W[ne];B[on]TR[df][ff][eg][eh][di][cj][dj]C[I need to attack the marked group, what's the best way?

Alex: Well, peep to start.]
(;W[fd]C[This looked like a really big move for B so I was very happy to get here first

Alex: This is fine, but I would peep at F11 first.];B[pm]C[B starts a leaning attack to enlarge B's moyo.]
;W[qm]LB[rk:A]C[Alex: A is probably better.];B[jo]LB[fn:A]C[I'm glad this wasn't at A! ...

Alex: Agreed.]
(;W[fn]C[...so I'll take that point.

Alex: Disagree. This is not nearly as big after K5 has already been played. If Black played here now, K5 would look even worse than it was in the first place.

Peep at F11 and then maybe attack on a large scale with G7. See variation.]
;B[go];W[fk]C[I'm still trying to attack the only weak group B has - but it still has thickness.

Alex: Peep first. Black F11 is too good now.];B[gi];W[fj];B[fi]
;W[he];B[hj];W[hm];B[gn];W[gm]
(;B[ld]LB[ld:A]C[A wasn't entirely unexpected and started a fight.

Alex: This is where Black lets you back into the game by allowing you to get a splitting attack. If he just settled his group first, he'd probably have an easy win.]

(;W[kf]C[Alex: Seems too thin... you don't want your stones to the right getting cut off.]
;B[md];W[nd];B[lf];W[ng]C[Alex: The fact that you just had to ignore a contact move shows the kind of trouble you've gotten yourself into.]
;B[lh];W[kg];B[lg];W[pg];B[qg]
(;W[ni]LB[ji:A]C[Alex: Although these stones are in danger, trying to keep Black separated may be your best chance of winning. All I can say is that it gets insanely complicated... see all the thousands of variations I've tried...]
;B[kh];W[jh]C[B's going to connect - darn!];B[ji];W[ke];B[mf]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[lm]C[Alex: Too deep... just asking for a splitting attack against you.

Then again, you've got to try something...];B[lk];W[mj];B[lj]
;W[lo]LB[lm:A]C[May be this is too greedy.  There doesn't seem to be a way to connect A to anything.

Alex: Definitely greedy, but like I said, you have to try something.]

(;B[jm]C[Alex: Big mistake for Black. See variation.];W[no]
C[Alex: Well spotted.];B[oo];W[op];B[mo];W[nn];B[mn];W[nm];B[mp]

(;W[in]C[Alex: I think Q10 is essential]
(;B[mm]C[Alex: Wrong direction. Black can try a splitting attack again because you omitted Q10.]
