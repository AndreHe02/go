C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  I have no idea where I'm going wrong, but it seems that no matter what I do, I fall badly behind early in the game.  In this game, I thought I was in danger of surrendering too much territory in the center, and did what I thought was a very good job of reducing my opponent in the center.  But as it turned out, I was still trailing by far more than I thought.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger

emk: hi fedya, 
this is my first review so it took a little longer than i thought =).
im currently 5k on kgs. so im not so very much stronger than u but i hope my comments help u a little.

i think here is the place to make some general comments about the game:

* white was the hole game concentrated on keeping the left side. maybe too much. it turned out that the left side was not very big in the end.
* white did not play optimal in to bottom right corner and so black was able to build a nice moyo there. (black made some overplays there)
* to protect the top right corner was too slow. there where moves arround that were more important. 
* of course u made some small moves too... but this is normal. think a bit more about : is my move sente, have i to answer my opponents move, what are big moves.

thx 

emk.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[cd];B[jq];W[cn]C[Ted: I wasn't certain what to play here.  I didn't know whether it would be better to approach from the top, or better to invade at a place like F3.

Stronger players have suggested that a move like C6 serves the dual purpose not only of approaching in the corner, but of serving as an extension from C16, which is why I played here.

emk: this move is good. black will welcome an early invasion and get good profit out of it (thickness, territory) while white gets only few points. 
black on the buttom is not yet big enaugh so that you have to hurry. as k3 is low u can aim later at the caping play at k5.]
;B[gp];W[dj]LB[cl:A][cq:B]C[Ted: Stronger players keep inststing that this is better than D9, despite the fact that Black can play a splitting atack at C8.

emk: d10 is a fine point but this may need some explaination:
* d10 leaves a weakness at c8 (A). So u have to be prepared for an invasion from black at this point. it is not a big problem as long as u can invade the corner at san-san (B).
* so u can call d10 a flexible move. it is not yet sure how it will turn out. 
* if u want to secure fix territory on the left botom u should choose an other move.]
;B[ec]
(;W[dc]LB[jc:A][df:B]TR[dj][cn]C[Ted: I thought about playing a pincer attack, but I decided that this sequence would be better because of the two stones at C6 and D10.  Stronger players have suggested I play more "dual-purpose" moves, and this move puts pressure on E17 at the same time it helps a framework on the left side.

I also thought about E15, but worried that Black would try to split my stones by playing something between E15 and D10.

emk: this is the first move that i dont like.

* it doesnt put much pressure on the e17 stone. attaching to a stone makes both sides stronger. without a stone arround k16 (A) this move is not very good.

* i think u worry too much about a splitting attack. but ok if u want to help your left side u could also play d14 (b) or so without d17.

ps) splitting attack: a splitting attack splits white stones with the purpose to attack the resulting weak group(s). so i think to talk about a splitting attack the result must be at least 1 weak group. otherwise i would call it invasion. here im not so sure if a play on the left side is a splitting attack.]
;B[hc]
(;W[df]C[Ted: Would E16 have been better here?

emk: d14 looks a bit boring. yes i would play e16];B[ed];W[qn]
C[Ted: A guess.  I'm not certain what to play, and this looked as good as anything else.]
;B[qj];W[qq]C[Ted: I thought about running out by playing P6, but I always seem to get a bad position that way, so I decided to play the 3-3 invasion, and hope that my opponent has as little luck with thickness as I do.

emk: jumping into the corner is ok.];B[qp];W[pq]
(;B[oq]TR[qn]C[emk: with the marked stone the hane at p3 is an overply. see variation]

(;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[rn]C[Ted: Is this move any better or worse than playing R5?  I don't think I've seen this particular move before, and to me it looks as though R5 leaves a cutting point that could be exploited later.  (In fact, I did try to use it, but my attempted tesuji didn't work.)

emk: i think in this case s6 is not any good.];W[or];B[nq];W[nr]
C[Ted: I wonder whether this move was necessary right now.  I think I could have played a tenuki.

emk: yes u can play tenuki. but if black does not answer it n3 is a nice follow up. so its almost sente.]
;B[mr]LB[mq:A]C[emk: this move is gote. u dont need to anwer it. the corner is alive . u can try it out yourself.

black n2 is an overplay. more usual is to play n3 (A). here black leaves many cutting points / weaknesses.

i would cut immediately. (see variation)]
(;W[pr]C[emk: not needed. the corner is alive without this move.]
;B[qm]C[Ted: Thankfully, Black doesn't take advantage of my extra move in the bottom right.

emk: so s6 cant be very good here or? =)]
(;W[qg]LB[eb:C][mc:A][ff:D][cq:B]C[Ted: I've got sente, and to be honest I really don't know what to do with it.  I've marked a few points with possible ideas I've thought of for what to do here.]
;B[ph];W[pg];B[lc]
(;W[qc]LB[oh:A]C[Ted: I really didn't want to play at, say, O17, and have Black invade on the 3-3 point, which would leave me with little if anything.

Would Q17 have been better?

emk: this move looks somewhat weird. q17 would be more natural way to protect the corner.

BUT: i would say that white has no time for this. black has a nice moyo from the bottom right into the center. so u have to be carefully that this is not getting too much territory.

also protecting the corner is not so very big. the invasion at 3-3 should be gote for black,...

i think u should play p12 (A) -> see variation];B[oc];W[od]
LB[oh:A]C[emk: too small. still p12 (A) better.];B[de];W[ce]
;B[ef];W[dg];B[di];W[cj]C[Ted: I thought about C11, but rejected it because I didn't want Black to play the cross-cut which usually seems to turn out badly for me.

emk: i think that c11 is much better. this way black may has the possibility to split whites position later. and a sort of connection from d10 to the top is good. als the c6 stone keeps to be flexible.]
;B[cl]C[Ted: Black plays a splitting attack, and seems to get a good position out of it.]

(;W[qb];B[nd];W[ne];B[md]C[emk: so i think its a very difficult game for white now. maybe hopeless.]
;W[jc]C[Ted: I was beginning to feel desperate.  Black seems to have done something good with his thickness, and I have to do something to prevent Black from getting the entire center.

I've thought about N15, but that looks too passive to me.

emk: this invasion looks not good. i dont think white should live here.]

[pj][rj][sj][lm][ln][eo][fo][lo][hp][ip][lp][lq][jr][js]C[Ted: I decided to sacrifice the K8 stone, and if need be, the L10 stone, in order to push further toward the side and take away more of Black's territory.  By this point, having practically connected all the way across the board, I thought I was doing quite well and wasn't behind by that much -- maybe 10-15 points by the whole end of the sequence.  I was stunned at the end of the game to find out just how far behind I was.

(And yes, I tried counting.  What I've got on the left, added to the dead stones and komi, looks to me about as big as what Black has on the top, or what Black will end up with on the bottom after all the reductions are said and done. What I've got on the right isn't nearly as big as the remaining Black group.  The point, I thought, was that White's territory is secure while Black's isnt.)

emk: ok lets try a count (im not good at it :> )

white: left: 36, lower right 8, top right 20, komi -> 70,5
black: top:  ~50, bottom: hard to count but a lot more than 20 points.  within the marked 2 areas there are more than 50 points. 
black has a lead by more than 30 points. the game is hopeless for white.

comments end here.]

And to make matters much worse, I had also done a pretty good job of taking quite a bit of territory away from Black in the center -- and I *STILL* lost by 50!]
