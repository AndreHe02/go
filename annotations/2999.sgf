C[tro: Hi. 
I would like to say, that in general you should consentrate more on watching what groups are strong and what are weak. This means both your own groups and the opponenst groups. 
In the beginning you force black to run towards your light group on the right side, resulting in black getting a strong group and some points in area that was your moyo to begin with. Also you allowed black to cut you too easily at several points in the game. 
I feel that working on connections and cuts as well as on evaluating the strenght of groups would improve your game at this point. 
One more point is that you should try to see what happens to the group's strenght when you run in some direction. This would help you to chose the direction so that it helps your groups and increases the pressure on your opponent.

Hope my comments help, 

tro

Dear reviewer,
thank in advance for reviewing the game.
I put some questions in the hope you will find the right answers for me.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[jp];W[pj];B[jd];W[qf];B[dj]C[tro: You might have taken D10 instead of R14. Now black has a quite nice formation in the lower left corner, and your upper left hoshi can not develop efficiently in either direction.
In this situation Tengen might be nice for white, to counter some of blacks influence. Another interesting area might be around N4 or O3, to build a moyo on the lower right and prepare an attack to the lower left.

How should I handle this situation? Black plays very influence orientated, I try to make some territory without let him take control the whole board.]
;W[cf];B[nd];W[nq];B[pm]
(;W[nm]C[tro: Sound reasonable, but you should see the pressure black can put on your Q10 and R14 if he runs in that direction. You could also play as in variation.

This time I decided to cap the black stone at Q7 in order to 
counter the influence. Right idea?];B[ol];W[nl]C[tro: Now you are pushing black against your unsettled group.]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[nk]
(;W[rd]C[tro: This would be better at P14 or similar. P14 also helps you in invading the corner later, if not defended. You could also think about going somewhere around N11, threatening to bag blacks stones at P9 and gaining more strenght for your own group.]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[qi]
(;W[of]C[tro: You should not allow black to cut you, see variation.]
;B[pg];W[oe];B[od];W[qd];B[pf];W[pe];B[qg];W[rf];B[rg];W[pb]
;B[pc];W[qb];B[qc];W[rc];B[ob];W[kl]C[tro: M17 does not work very well, because your threat to connect with P19 does not work. (because of S18 being open) In general you have given a part of your largest moyo (the right side) to black as area, and gained a small corner (the upper right) and a little influence towards the center. also your upper left and lower right corners are quite vulnerable, they hold only little guaranteed area at the moment. In my view black is ahead now.


With this position I was satisfied. I took three corners and had influence towards the center with two groups.
Later I planned to invade at m17.
Am I right?];B[oo]C[tro: This is overplay. Black could have taken R4 or S4 to harrash your corner or C3, C4 or D3 to secure his area with a double wing type formation on the lower left. Also J7 to enlarge the moyo would be possible.]
;W[mo];B[np];W[mp];B[oq];W[op];B[no];W[pq];B[or]
(;W[on];B[mq];W[po];B[nr];W[nn];B[nq];W[pn]C[tro: You ended up in gote, with very little attack potential against O3 stones and the area inte corner is open from both sides.]
;B[nj];W[gp];B[fq];W[ip];B[iq]
(;W[gn]C[tro: This leads to gining a ponnuki to black, why not try with J5, H3 or even with K3 instead.]
;B[hp];W[ho];B[io];W[gc]C[tro: This is a big point, but your stones around G5 are not happy.]
;B[fo];W[hq];B[ip];W[in]C[tro: Again you allow your stones to be cut. you lose all attack potential, black get a little extra area and strenght.]
;B[go];W[cn]
(;B[cl]C[tro: Black could have defended his corner at this point. See variation.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[er];B[fr];W[eq];B[ep]
C[tro: If black takes K6 here, you get E4, which leads to you cutting black. Also K6 not very interesting because of H5 stone still in atari.

I think black missed here a chance to play k6, it seems bigger to me.]
;W[jn];B[dq]C[tro: Black starts a sequence that wastes his ko-threats...]
;W[dr];B[br];W[ar];B[bs];W[cs];B[hm]C[tro: Have to wonder, if this was a misclick. "Never peep what you can cut."]
;W[hn];B[gm];W[fn];B[fm];W[eo];B[fp];W[nh]C[tro: Might consider E7 instead, to keep blacks G7 stones disconnected and steal some points at the same time.]
;B[ni];W[lc];B[ld]C[tro: Usually black should defend with M15, or play the sequence in variation for move 105.]

;B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[ec];B[fb]C[tro: Here black could take H17 instead.]
;W[gb];B[fe];W[ed];B[eg];W[lf]C[I was optimistic that I can connect the g13 stoone to one of ma groups. Can I hope so or should I try something different?]

;B[kg];W[jg];B[lg];W[lh];B[jh];W[ji];B[ih];W[hj];B[gi]
(;W[gj]C[tro: Here you should rather connect at K10. That would give you more strenght, and maybe even L14 might end up working for you.]
;B[jj]C[tro: You really need to pay more attention cuts.  If you are in several small weak groups, you will end up losing something, most importantly the game.]
;W[ki];B[fi];W[lj];B[mg];W[oh];B[oi];W[pr]C[tro: Your estimates are pretty close. 

If I count now the game is prety even:

Black
lower side 15
center 20
right side 20
prisoners 8
together 63

White
lower right 15
lower left 5
upper left 25
uupper right 7
center 5
komi 6,5
together 63,5

I tried to make the biggest yose moves. But unfortunatly I oversaw a counterattack at move 201 later in the game. And there was another blunder at move 210
This was very costly and I lost with 0,5 points.
Any hint to improve my game is welcome.];B[lo];W[ln];B[lp]
