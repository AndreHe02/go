C[ First review. Game won by resign, but in points about 30 points behind.
2 mistakes in the bottom right and left(see variant played against gnugo) were very heavy.]
;B[dd];W[qp];B[pd];W[dq]C[somewhat "single digit kyu" notion :

W D3 should be D4 or C4.
An approach at C5/D5 is good for Black (provided it is properly exploited)]
;B[fp]MA[cn][co][do]C[4 corners taken, i attack


Why ?
Go is not Chess !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You'd better remember this if you want to make a decent player some day.

Go *is not* a life and death game. 
It is a territory game.

I could spend lines of comments and example on this concept. I'd rather ask you to take my word about this. Don't think "attacking", think "make territorry". Sometimes, it helps to attack some group.
But it takes time to attack wisely.

Now, back to the board.

The part of the board is okay, just F4 is wrong direction.

marks are more severe on White (see previous comment)];W[do]
;B[op]C[w defends i attack the other one on the same side (extension l4 possible)


re-read what I said about attacking.

Now you have just crated two weak stones

If W polays in the centre, you will have a hard time defending both (see possible variation).]

(;W[pq]C[not very good. Black will get solid];B[qn]MA[po]C[reattack on the other side (extension q11 possible)

yes, and you create a third weak stone if white cuts you at Q5.]
;W[mq]C[I don't like.
P3 is more solid]
(;B[pp]C[w pinches, i contact (better to cut o2 if o3 then p3 ?)

see variation

Q4 is not bad, since you make the cut at Q5 very difficult]
;W[oq]C[but W makes solid territory];B[np]C[ "threat" o3? and make thickness to the center

o3 is "aji" (potential) as long as W lets it open ...
Besides, what is left of the threat after W 02 ? (explore it by yourself to find out ... nothing interesting I'm afraid)]
;W[po]C[bad];B[qo]C[i cut, threat 2 ataris

No you don't "cut"

It's White that cut you !

But W will have a hard time defending this !];W[pn]
(;B[rp]C[enter the corner

Wrong side ! (see variation)];W[qq]
(;B[rq]C[very small.

You should look for the two Q6 stones while defending your O4 stones]
;W[qm]
(;B[qr]C[can connect at s5, so look for 2 eyes and o3

Why ? 
This is alive with S6 (see var)];W[rn];B[ro]C[connect as expected]
;W[rl];B[nq]C[ cut as wished... a dream!];W[or];B[nr]C[no escape for w !?

probably not];W[hp]C[good

remember what I said about W pincering ?];B[jp]C[w pinch, i pinch too and hope to use my stones on the right

okay, but you may not hope to save F4 stone, letting W with big territory]
;W[hq];B[ho]MA[jc][jd]C[try to defend pinched stone and not forget k4, too much? what else?

Not too bad, but you can tenuki (play elsewhere).

K17 is probably worth bigger];W[jq];B[mp]MA[kq][lp]C[m4 better?

or L3];W[kp];B[ip]MA[jo]C[defend k4 keeping pressure downwards, narrow?

or K5, not sure ...];W[iq]
(;B[lq]C[... to glide under h3 k3

hmm, you let W cut your groups again];W[mr]C[this is a lost move]
;B[lr]C[ gliding downwards?];W[jo];B[io]C[... trying to save those]
;W[kq];B[lp]MA[jn]C[... just not to be cut, necessary?

No, just explore it. N2 stones are in atari, so can be taken with 1 move.
if W "cuts" here (it is not a cut), you can always connect by taking the stones.

K6 is better to get life for your H5 group];W[jn];B[en]MA[gn]
C[... to save f4. better to expand or threat? (l6? to cut in l5)

G6 more efficient];W[go];B[hn]C[forced to save the 4 stones]
;W[gn];B[hm];W[jm];B[gm]C[... trying to use f4 e6, better to expand? where?]
;W[fo];B[eo]C[.. cutting not to be cut

ok];W[gp];B[ep]C[... connecting f4, better to play elsewhere?

the problem is : if W cuts you again at F7, there will be a bad fight, and B is not in the best position for it.]
;W[dn]
(;B[fm]C[e8 better?

see var.
I'd have connected safely like you did];W[dm];B[dl]C[too ambitious? better e8?

no, simply forgetting that W will  separate with E8];W[el]C[hmmm ?]
;B[dp];W[cp]
(;B[cq]C[... try to invade the corner, better to cut e7 first?

yes, probably (see vars)];W[cr]LB[bq:B][eq:A]C[A : i played it to try a ko! B : afterplay with gnugo, looks much better for the lower left

What ko ?

(;B[eq]C[.... believe that a ko may be?];W[dr];B[er]C[... no ko!]
;W[bq];B[jr]C[... and no corner, try to invade the bottom

Better seek life for your group !
Urgent moves before big moves (and big moves before very small moves like K2)

;W[kl];B[mm];W[lm];B[ml]MA[hk][jc]C[... upwards for air, connected for liberties

Why, your group is alive ! N2 and P2 are dead ...

Better get life for G7 group, or play big at K17];W[fk];B[dk]
C[.. mistake, i believe, better to let d8 and get some air for the noeye group e2 k4 : g9?

yes, or H9];W[di];B[ej]C[.... not to be cut from the center, any move better?

yes, save you group with H9 ...];W[fj];B[ei]C[... same idea, but makes things worse for my e2 k4 noeye group, is there emergency for this noeye group?

;B[gi]C[... trying to block and invade the center keeping connected. j11 better? or wider?

no, this is ok, because you have to find life for this];W[ij]
;B[hi]C[.... ladder stopped but very narrow play?!];W[df];B[ff]
MA[gg]C[prefer keep w on the side and use e10 h10 group than to defend the corner

too loose. W will separate again];W[fd]C[yuck.

B can play E15];B[ee]C[no defense of the corner, but connection and cut attack, any move better?

fine];W[id];B[kd]C[to make f16 j16 stones life difficult and gain influence on the right and center ( too many goals?)


no !
When playing a stone, it should have as many goals as possible (usually at least 2, possibly 3).

But urgent moves first. F12 is urgent];W[md];B[je]MA[kf]C[towards center pressing on j16 , any wider game better ?(letting l16 under pressure)

C[okay :

if you think 02 is lost, you are 35 points behind ...
If you play Q1 (before W plays T6, that is)... you are 40 points ahead.

It is funny no one of you noticed this ...


Now :
On thing you have to work on first is :
Don't spread around stones figuring you are attacking something. Just stay connected and solid (and next, try to figure out the difference between solid and thick). Try to go for some territorry rather than working out complicated strategies, because if you don't master them, they may turn against you.

Then your game will improve.])
