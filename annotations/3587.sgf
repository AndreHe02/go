C[dear reviewer
I played white in this game. it was much closer than the final score suggests, i got lucky at the very end.
Thanks very much in advance for doing this review :- )

[teabing\]: hello. this is my first review for the gtl. I hope it will help you. If something isn't clear or If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to e-mail me.]
;B[pc];W[cd];B[pq];W[dp];B[cn];W[fc]C[should i have responded in the bottom left? what do you suggest?

[teabing\]: I usualy respond to such moves but i don't think this is obligatory. Sorry i can't be of more help here.]
;B[cq]
(;W[dq]C[i thought about splitting B's stones...

[teabing\]: i think that would be bad. see variation];B[cp]
;W[hq]C[but this felt nicer];B[do];W[eo];B[dr]C[[teabing\]: I think you were afraid of the cut at e3 after e2. you shouldn't be.]

(;W[eq]C[unfortunitely i turned it into really bad shape

[teabing\]: exacly, this was a bad shape. see variation.]
(;B[en];W[fo];B[jq]C[this didnt turn out too well for me. could you show me a better variation, or should i have responded to C6?

[teabing\]: if you wan't to stabilize your group e2 is better]

(;B[lp]C[[teabing\]: black is shy here];W[po]

(;W[qn]C[[teabing\]: because of the stones at k3 and m4 i have a feeling that this is too weak]

[teabing\]: that's true];B[nd];W[qi]C[[teabing\]: good but q11 feels better]
;B[jd];W[dh]C[maybe C14?];B[ge]C[i responded to this because i was afraid of him going to D14, but maybe i shouldnt have been too worried about that

;B[da];W[ea];B[fa];W[ga];B[cj];W[dj]C[i didnt play C11 because i felt it would strengthen blacks territory, but i dont think D10 was much better

[teabing\]: every move that touches a solitary stone strenghtens it]
