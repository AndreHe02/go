* After Q10 White will play P16. move at P16 is better. Seals off the corner]
;W[ef];B[fb]C[* this is not a good move. Must fist play at A(E13) white will not ignore this and D13 is painfull for black.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[de];B[dh]LB[dc:C][cd:B][ce:A]C[black decides to sacrifice c15 to get sente. is this ok?

* Black does not get sente so, no this is not okay. Defend at C14, letting white capture AB gives away to many points with no return. When connecting at C(D17) white has to defend the cut as well.]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[df];B[bh];W[be]C[* Too small. Either P16 or O3.]
;B[gp]C[too close?

* Yes. White is too strong here, play K4 or N3.];W[cm];B[bm]
;W[dl];B[ck];W[eo];B[ae];W[bd]C[* Should always be at A16. Is at least one point better and capturing A15 is sente when further down in the game.]

;W[pr];B[qo];W[ro];B[rl]LB[mj:A]TR[nh][ph][oj][qj]C[* This is too slow as well, the white stones cannot connect. 
Attack from A white will be forced to run and black can get some territory at the top.]

;W[hg];B[jd];W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[lg]C[* First J17, sente and will destroy the eye-shape.
Now missed oppertunity for black, the 2 weak groups are connected and black is now the one with a eak group.]
;B[ic];W[jb];B[jh];W[li];B[kj]C[* Better at H12 directly. The change that black makes a lot of points in the centre are low.]
;W[lj];B[kk];W[eh];B[hh]C[* You must play at E11, white 120 is too painfull.]
;W[di];B[ci]C[* If you do not intend to play the ko play C12 directly.]
;W[ch];B[bg];W[gh];B[hi];W[gk];B[hl];W[hk];B[ik];W[ij]LB[il:A]
C[how should black respond?
* Simple defend at J8 (A). White has no points in the centre and black has here app. 8 points.
Thisis much better then what happend in the game.
Later Black can also cut the stone at J10. If white connects black D18 or J18 to live.]
;B[hj];W[il];B[jk];W[hm];B[jl];W[im];B[jm]C[* Too small, O18 is the largest move. Then the game is probalby even.]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[of];B[pe];W[oe];B[od];W[nd];B[pj];W[pi];B[pk]
C[at this stage black felt the game was sewn up.  what is your opinion?

* Did you count ??
Black:
left:      10 points
Right:  32 points
Centre: 10 points
Total: 52 points. 
White:
Left:        16 points
Right:     17 points.
Top-left: 12 points
Top:        18 points 
Total: 63 points

So white is ahead by app. 10 points.

* Black was really behind the whole game. The difference is only 3 points because of the sequence at M12.

I think you should focus more on making territory yourself and less on destroying the moyo's/territory your opponent treatens to make.
