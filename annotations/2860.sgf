C[Commentator:

Thanks in advance for your review!!! It's much appreciated.

I was White in this game (IGS 1d*), but because Black was my son I'm as interested in your comments on his play as I am in mine!



QianJiang: Welcome!];B[pp];W[pd];B[dq];W[cd];B[ed];W[ec]C[W6 I chose this attachment because I anticipated ending the Joseki in Sente with which to make a big play on the lower side.]
;B[fc];W[dc];B[gd];W[cf];B[nc]C[B11 I considered this to be an overplay. Am I right? Or is it reasonable?




Yes, somewhat overplay. I cannot say it's NOT reasonable but it is overplay.]
;W[hc]MA[jd][jc][kc][kd]C[W12 This was my way to punish what I perceived was Black's overplay with B11. Is it good? If not, what would have been better, and (most important) why?


It is good. X is other choice, I do not know which one is better. The reason for X is: black went too wide, so go into the center.]
;B[jc];W[fb]C[W14 I considered this to be better than running out at J16 because it connects me and thus leaves me with no weak group to look after.

Was this correct thinking? Or would either running out or a tenuki to R14 have been better, and if either, why?


Yes correct. Running out or R14 is ok, too. Why: 
You are doing something reasonable.];B[gc]C[Bad shape.];W[gb]
;B[hb]MA[hd]C[B17 I expected G16 here. Wouldn't that have been better for Black?


X better, yes.];W[ib];B[hd];W[ic];B[id];W[jb]MA[jd]C[Cut is possible.]
;B[kc];W[qf]C[B23 At this point I felt that I was ahead by a bit. Am I correct?



Should be a little bit ahead.];B[pb];W[qc];B[qb]C[B27 And this is clearly too slow! At K3 instead, and I thought that Black had a very good game. Right?



Yes, too slow.];W[do]MA[pj][qi]C[W28. I thought that this was much better than a splitting play on the lower side. Am I right? Or?


Upper right maybe more important. respond to R18 and aim for K16 cut.]
;B[cm];W[ck]MA[eq][dm]C[W30 Not Joseki, but I felt that W28 is Ok in its high position, and I wanted to take advantage of my UL corner position. Was this strategy OK, or would something else have been better, and if so, what? And why?


should be ok, D7 E3 maybe other choices.
This depends on how much area you expected to get on left side by play C9.]
;B[em];W[fo];B[dk]C[B33 Although it's Sente, I felt that this was in the wrong direction, and something like F3 was better. Am I right? Or?


B33 should be ok, I do not know which one is better.];W[dj]
;B[ek];W[cq]C[W36 After this I felt that I had a winning game (am I correct in this?), so the fact that in the end I only won by 1/2 point bothers me greatly! Either my judgment of this position is incorrect or I messed up badly sometime later in the game.



leading but not winning. Your judgement at the moment is a bit too optimistic, and have some mistakes in endgames.
I feel white leads for less than 1/2 move(komi) now. And black may attack back at R12 and get everything back.]
;B[ep]MA[cr]C[vulgar move
C2];W[eo];B[cr];W[cp];B[gq];W[br];B[iq];W[qn]C[W44 This seemed to me to be the only logical move in this position. Is this correct? If not, what is??

Of course playing C8 would be huge territorially, but I felt that it was much too slow because it put too much of my force on the left side. Then again, it seems like it just might be Sente, and if that's true of course it was the best move. On the other hand I rationalized that Black had nothing really threatening on the left side as things stand, so I might just be able to be first to play again there later. So with that in mind I chose R6,

In my mind this is a crucial point for my understanding, so please, if I'm wrong in my thinking, provide sufficient detail in your explanation so that I will hopefully not repeat my error again.


This is not the only logical move. I think 2 places maybe more urgent. C8 is big, and Q10.
Black cannot kill your group on left side, but C10 cut means big territory and make this group safe.
Q10 is for upperright group and K16 cut.];B[cj]MA[br][cq][cp]
[do][eo][fo]C[B45 Because the Black stones here are in no real danger (especially given his thickness on line 16), and because he's going to end in Gote, I thought that this was another Black error. Am I right? If not, why not?


I do not think so. This move safe the black group, get lots territory, and the lowerleft white looks weak now.
It's worth more than a Gote.
I do not feel line 16 is very strong.];W[ci];B[bj];W[di];B[bi]
;W[bh];B[bl]MA[bk]C[B9];W[nq]MA[qh]C[W52 Now, for certain, I thought that I had a winning game. Am I right? If not, why not?


White is a bit ahead but not sure it's winning. Why:
You didn't kill a big black group
Cannot find 2 or more weak black groups
Cannot find big territory difference
Black can attack back at R12/D2.
It's only move 52.];B[lq]C[B53 This surprised me. Here again, I thought that Black erred, and that P5 was the only correct play. Am I right? If not, why not?


I think both ok, I do not know which one is better.

why M3:
Black is responding at most urgent area
J3-M3 is good structure
M3-Q4 is good structure];W[oo];B[ro]MA[op]C[P4 then cut, probably better.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[rn];B[or];W[oq];B[op];W[np];B[pq];W[nr];B[rq]
;W[pr]MA[nn]C[Bad move, gote.
I'll go O6/O5];B[qr];W[os];B[po];W[pn];B[pj];W[qi]MA[on][ph]
C[W72. I chose this conservative response because of B27, but my instinct tells me that there probably is something better although I don't see it! If there is, please point it out and show the likely continuation. What happens during the next few moves obviously is more or less decisive in determining this game's final outcome, so explaining this will probably provide the most important insight I'll get from your commentary.



Yes, white have weak points and cannot attack Q10 well.
I'll go Q12, aim for K16 cut.];B[qj];W[so];B[rp];W[nj];B[pi]
;W[qh];B[ni];W[mi];B[nh];W[mh];B[mj];W[nk];B[mg]C[B85 I thought that this was an overplay, and that O13 instead was necessary. Am I right? If not why not?


Yes, O13 will be more reasonable.];W[ng]C[W86 I was very happy to be able to play here, and once again I felt that I had a winning game. Given the closeness of the final result that seems not to have been  a correct judgment, so please comment on it.


Yes white is winning.];B[lg];W[lj];B[mk];W[li];B[og];W[nf];B[lk]
;W[kk];B[of];W[ne];B[oe];W[le]C[W98 At this point I expected to cruise to an easy win.


Yes, white leading. P12 first will be better.];B[nl];W[ml];B[ll]
;W[ol];B[mm];W[nm];B[ml]C[B105 I expected P9 and a Ko fight, and was surprised by Black's choice.  Which was better for Black and why?


Ko is better for black, no need explaination.

White should P12 cut see how black responds.];W[ok]C[P12 better.]
;B[od];W[oh]MA[nh][ni]C[W108 After this move I saw no way for Black to even have a chance. Please comment on this judgment.


Yes w is leading.

White should atari here earlyer.];B[ph];W[oi]MA[li][ok]C[M11/P9 etc looks no efficient now.]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[pg];W[ri];B[rj];W[sh];B[pc];W[rd];B[nn];W[pm]
C[This move looks strange, I think P7/O5 etc.];B[om];W[ql]C[Bad move, 
O5];B[no];W[lp];B[lr];W[mo];B[mq]C[No need, bad shape.];W[mp]
;B[on];W[jp];B[ip];W[jo];B[ln]MA[kb][dr]C[B 133 I thought that this was another mistake, and that a Black play at E13 was far better. Am I correct? Or is there another move that's better than either?


Black is aiming for your group and we can look it as a sente move, it destroys white shape at the place, so it should not be that bad. 

We should LOOK AT THE CUTTING POINT @ K16 
and M17];W[jq];B[jr];W[io];B[gp];W[go];B[ho]C[B139 I felt that this helps White far more than Black, and that once again E13 was the place to play.


You're right, this is bad move.];W[hn];B[hp];W[im];B[ke];W[lf]
MA[lc]C[M17];B[kf];W[kg];B[jg];W[kh];B[kb]C[143-149 Black fixed weakpoints(K16,M17). White get almost nothing.
Now much closer.];W[ha]MA[dr]C[Not necessary.];B[sj];W[si];B[rc]
;W[qd];B[fg]C[B155 Finally in what I thught was the key area, although as before I felt that E13 was superior.]
;W[dg];B[jh];W[fh];B[gg]MA[gh]C[G12 better];W[bn];B[bm]C[bad shape.]
;W[bo]C[Slow, D2 or E2.];B[ah];W[bg];B[dr];W[fj];B[gh];W[fi]
;B[ii];W[ee];B[fe];W[ef];B[ld];W[md];B[mc];W[ka]C[W176 I didn't take the time to think this through, because it's Gote! And I suppose that this is the reason that the game ended up as close as it did, but I felt that I was so far ahead that I got incautious!]
;B[la];W[ja];B[rb]C[B179 et seq From this point on it's all endgame moves, but there may be some errors there as well, so please point them out where they occur. I make no further comments of my own after this.]
