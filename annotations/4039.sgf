C[Hello, I'm cybio92, ranked 22k on KGS.
Thank you for reviewing this game :
I'd like to know where are my worst mistakes,
but also in the overall strategy i feel i always have trouble controlling the center.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[qj]C[Ben:  I would call this move wrong only in principle.  The relationship with the r-4 stone is not optimum.  But you are not really behind because of this move either.]

(;W[dj]C[Ben: White should approach r-4 now to prevent black from making an optimum shape. See Var.]

(;B[fq]C[Ben:  This is fine but making a shimari would give black a powerful position.]
;W[cn]LB[er:a]C[Ben: This is a poor way to handle this approach.  A possible white move could have played at "a" locally.  I still think white's biggest move is the approach at p-4.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[oq]C[Ben: A bit low.];B[mq]LB[po:a]C[I am trying to do a pincer
Ben: This is fine.  Simply "a" was acceptable as well.];W[qq]
;B[op]LB[rq:a][pp:b]C[My idea is to block access to the center

Ben: An interesting strategy.  The normal move is black "a" white "b."]

(;W[rp]C[Ben: I might have tried this: See Var.];B[pq];W[pr]
;B[pp];W[rr];B[or];W[os];B[nr];W[ns]C[Ben: This is a poor move from white.]
;B[ms];W[ps]LB[ro:a]C[Ben: White should have just extended out at "a."   Saving these stones is not important right now.]

(;B[qn]C[Ben: s-5 would have been acceptable.  See Var.];W[nc]

(;B[qf]TR[qj]LB[pf:a]C[Ben: At "a" represents a good shape with the marked stone.  A pincer would also have been strong.  See Var.]
;W[ld]TR[nc]C[Ben: White should be more agressive. q-18 is good for making life here. Potentially the marked group could even become weak later on if more moves aren't played there to strenghen them.]
;B[fc];W[hc]
(;B[fd]LB[fe:a]C[I felt it was better heading to the center than trying to establish a living base
Ben: This move is not so good. You could play all the way to a with an even better effect.  My preference would have been to invade on the 3-3.]

(;W[jd]C[Ben: Not so important.  White is strong enough here.  Black isn't thinking about pincering here until he can get his group safe.  White should have simple strengthened his d-16 stone with perhaps d-14 and awaited developments.]

(;B[dc]C[strangely enough i changed my mind and went for the edge !
Ben: This is as good as anything.  A kind of double approach or 3-3 invasion might also have worked. See Vars.]
;W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[ed];W[de];B[ff]C[again to the center... Maybe it is not very consistent ?
Ben: Your plays are a little lacking in punch.  You did manage to outline some eyeshape so that is something.]
;W[dg];B[hd];W[id];B[he];W[jf];B[hb];W[ib];B[gc];W[ic];B[ga]
MA[gd][ec]C[Ben: Unimportant now. Black should be getting eyes at the marked points regardless.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[qa];B[oc]MA[fn][kk]C[Ben: This is aji-keshi.  Taking away potential.  At this stage black may consider white's play to small and play elsewhere (tenuki).  f-6  and l-9 look like candidate moves.]
;W[ob];B[od];W[nd]
(;B[qe]C[Having tried it afterwards, i think p14 was really better. I was afraid of the cut at r16 but now think it was a mistake
Ben: Let's see];W[fo];B[go]C[here i'm tring to get to the center
Ben: This was a big point for white to get.  I would probably try something else as you are now getting into kind of a trade off.  Black will build points on the right while white equally builds points to the left.]
;W[gn];B[ho];W[jj]LB[hn:a]C[Ben: A little too loose.  He could have just extended naturally at "a."]
;B[nj]C[Ben: Acceptable.];W[nf];B[of];W[og]LB[ng:a]C[Ben: I probably would cut at "a" if I played locally.]
;B[pg]C[Ben: Too submissive.];W[oh];B[ph];W[oi];B[oj];W[pi]
;B[qi];W[pj];B[pk];W[ok];B[nk];W[ni];B[mm];W[fh]TR[mm]C[with f12 i don't have access to the center from the top group. Was there a better way ?
Ben: Well you made a somewhat large move with n-7 (marked). So he chose to make a similar move.  You could consider moves like these to be miai (He plays where you play and vice versa).  If you think f-12 is bigger then play there first before you opponent does.  Here I think you can still get a deep enough invasion with something sober like j-6 or j-7.]
;B[ig];W[if];B[hf];W[hg]C[Ben: Nothing wrong with h-11 or h-12 for white.]
;B[gg];W[hh];B[gh];W[gi];B[hi];W[ih];B[fi];W[gj];B[eh];W[ij]
;B[di];W[ci];B[fj];W[hj]C[I was trying for the extension since 10 moves, and by pure luck got trough !
Ben: White still managed to make some amount of points in the middle though.]
;B[fk];W[dk];B[hm]MA[ra][ca][cr]C[now i'm trying to connect h5 and f9 groups
Ben: Both of these groups are alive.  Connecting them is of no consequence. s-19 is getting to be a large move for you.  Also c-2 and c-19 (marked).]

;W[cm];B[dl];W[cl];B[do];W[co];B[el];W[eq];B[fp];W[ep];B[er]
;W[jl]C[Ben: l-7 might have gotten you one or two more points.]

(;B[jm];W[km];B[kn];W[im];B[in]LB[jn:a]C[Ben: Or just "a."]
;W[jn];B[jo]
(;W[jm]C[Ben: Now instead white could have gone m-6.];B[ln]
C[here it seems i could have grabbed a few more points, but i don't see how !]

Ben: Yes notably c-19 was sente.];W[da];B[ea];W[eb]C[a mistake, plain and simple : retreating at e18 was necessary
Ben: You're fine. See Var.]

Ben: The center has a large importance on the game.  However you should not just arbitrarily try to make the center your focus.  This must be done on an ad-hoc basis.  Go is a balance between the sides, corners, and center.  If you have questions my email: benjaminschooley@hotmail.com.]
