C[utku: Hello. I am an KGS 13k player from Istanbul. I will use "utku:" foreword for my comments in this review. 

I would like to give some advices for you before review..
Firstly, you was lost this game because of your opponent is much stronger than you. If you play handicap games with stronger opponents, it works for you much more. This is important I think. By the way, for an additional information, stronger player takes white generally.
Another way for improving is studying life and death problems. You can improve 4-5 stones soonest by studying life death. Please try to remember this. 
Also, you are more than welcome for further information or questions about this review.

I like reviewing your game very much. I have tried to analyse of general subjects mostly, instead of local mistakes. I hope it works. So, let's look to your game...]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[dp];W[po];B[oq]LB[ql:B][qm:C][qq:A]C[utku: We should think about our aim firstly. I would prefer A in here. A's aim is taking the corner. Also you can prefer B or C for influence on right side. I have add a variation...]

(;W[ql]LB[qq:A]C[Was this move too bold? I think htat R7 is the usual play but I wanted to try this out instead.

utku: See the variations please.];B[qq];W[qp]C[utku: I like this. Because you had a weak point on S5.]

[rf][rg][rh]C[utku: It seems like you have shared the points on upper right but Black has advantage. Because, Black has reduced your below group's influence with A while he has the corner below.]

(;W[fc];B[rc];W[jd]C[Sould I have played this differently? Maybe k17? or attacked elsewhere?

utku: Upper white stones seems discontinuous a bit. Black can invade this area easily...

Sometimes, I am playing excited especially on the beginning. Because the board is empty and I want to live in everywhere. But later I am thinking about points and power. So, I prefer maybe a bit less but strong groups instead of plenty weak groups. Please see the variation of 20th move.]
