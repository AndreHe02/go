C[Besides a review of the game as a whole, following are the two areas I am interested in specific focus on. I included this same dialogue at the actual spots in the game where the question occurs so that you can read it as you get to the actual moves.

Thank you very much for the review. I t is greatly appreciated.

1 - How I could have best killed the invasion that started at move 144 in the bottom left corner?

Also what would have been the best way to contain the invasion if it was not possible to stop it? (I do realize that move 149 was an especially bad move) This plays out through to move 186.

2 â€“ After move 186 I counted the Moyo for both sides and realized that I was behind. In order to attempt to pull back ahead, I begin playing stones in Whiteâ€™s Territory. Most of these moves were mostly suicidal, but I hoped that I would hit upon something due to a mistake by white.

That mistake by white did finally happen starting at my move at 201 and whiteâ€™s move at 202, finishing with my move at 207. This allowed me to win the game, but again, it was due to his mistake more than my skill, although I did plan those moves out, and got lucky that he focused on the right side of the plays, like I was hoping, and protected the wrong stones.

Rather than this randomness of moves by me starting at 186 in a desperate attempt to somehow gain some territory, or kill his territory, were there any other more concrete moves I could have attempted to play in his open area to tip the game in my favor. IO am still having some trouble creating life in open spaces such as what he had open, and do not know of there was enough room there.

kklim> I make comment in this way, if needed to show sequence of order, I create variation tree, which it is at behind.

I personally hope I address your concern.

Thanks you.

p.s. your black move 205 is really nice.];B[qp];W[qn]C[kklim > personally I do not like white 2 one space low clamp [Ò»¼äµÍ¼Ð\] in the opening phase, especially as first move for white. It no serve the purpose of divide the corner, and waste one move for opponent. Instead i think white 2 corner approach the corner (@ P3) is better, if white do not want to capture and build a base on so many big point exist during game opening. 

But since the game will mainly focus on review for black point of view, I will minimise my comment on the white and focus on the black.

1 - How I could have best killed the invasion by white that started at this move at c3.

Also what would have been the best way to contain the invasion if it was not possible to stop it?  (I do realize that move 149 was an especially bad move by myself)

This entire process plays out through to move 186.

kklim> i make variation to answer your concern. I provide the few move order for you, please see which fit your preference.

For your second question on contain the invasion, personally I think it is no neccesary need to contain it. If oppoent have no enough eye space for live, you just chase them for entire group dead. Off course you must have atleast minimal 2 eye space for live before you can chase them, if not will end in dragon fight.

As you said, black 149 is a mistake move. We all learn from experience. This experience can be gain thru solving corner life and death problems, especially various placement of sansan the results will be different.

Please look at the variation trees create, hope able to address your concern.]

2 â€“ After this past invasion by white from move 144 to here, I counted the Moyo for both sides and realized that I was behind.

In order to attempt to pull back ahead, I begin playing stones in Whiteâ€™s Territory. Most of these moves were mostly suicidal, but I hoped that I would hit upon something by causing white to make a mistake somewhere.

That mistake by white did finally happen starting at my move at 201 and whiteâ€™s move at 202, finishing with my move at 207.

Rather than the randomness of moves I played, starting here at 186, in a desperate attempt to somehow gain some territory, or kill his territory, were there any other more concrete moves I could have played in his open area to attempt to tip the game back in my favor? I am still having some trouble creating life in open spaces, such as what he had open, and do not know if there was enough room there. If it was possible to create life there, could you walk through the methods to achieve that, and what the best plays would have been and what kind of defense I would have seen.

kklim> your play on 205 is really nice. Since moyo [Ä£Ñù\] already build up, it is hard to penetrate from inside. This is why from the fuseki [²¼¾Ö\] phase, or earlly of the middle game start, you should careful and looking for a invasion point to destroy opponent moyo or atleast minimise it to comfortable size. Fuseki - middle game - end game [²¼¾Ö-ÖÐÅÌ-¹Ù×Ó\]all is linked, problem you no solve will bring forward or become wrose.]

[ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[kklim> overall, white make a lot of unreason move. Especially on the start already in the under hand - each waste move is consider oppoent gain (if oppoent know how to play right\].

I personally think, for better handle on the corner placement, you need to read and solve more corner life-and-death problems.

If on the feseki phase, you closure 3-4 point early, you already no need to worry about sansan placement.

Regard the moyo, you should invade early, not until oppoent make framework become territory and try to invade, unless oppoent is weak, if not most of the time will waste your stones. Then you will become even more better player.

Personally hope I help to address your concern. Thank you.]

personally i think when handle placement sansan you have only 2 choice. If you can kill it, do so, but if can not, ensure make it live minimise. Remember, who capture the sansan point is the owner of the corner, how the owner able to live depend on it skill and move sequence, it can either full live, or ko live or wrose - no enough eye space - dead.]

... if I play black 7, white likely to play white 8 to closure the corner aim for influence (becuase white 4 is 5-4point [¸ßÄ¿\]-for me it signal opponent aim for influence.

Then black 9 wariuchi [·ÖÍ¶ ¡¢ÇÐ·Ö\] is good point here. If white play a, black then b set the base here. And it still open up the invasion opportunity in c or placement sansan and get the corner territory under black. If white play b, then black reverse the play by playing N17 extension two space [²ð¶þ\].And aim for next placement sansan [µãÈýÈý\] to reap the corner under black. Because white 4 is 5-4point, even is 4-4 point, sitll can placement sansan. 

And for black, e or f become good extension point for black left corner as well. g also can be consider.]
