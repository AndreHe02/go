RE[W+3.5]

C[A: Itay, I am going to review your game.  I will preface my remarks with "A:" so you know it is me.  I am, I gather, reviewing for black.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dq];W[pc];B[qe];W[pg]C[A: At this point, you went for a less typical move.  The typical move is for the pincered player to jump out and escape.  On the one hand, that gains no territory and the group has to gain life elsewhere; on the other hand, it keep white separate and keeps black from getting bottled in.  It is important to avoid being bottled in.  When you get bottled in, you get life and a little territory on the inside, while the other player gets "influence" that can turn into lots of territory by the end of the game. In the sequence I put in the variation, black gets life and an exit on the right, while white catches a stone and gets influence toward the top.  It is a fair exchange, which is one of the standards to make a sequence a "joseki."]

;B[rf];W[ob];B[pa];W[pf];B[se];W[oa];B[rb]C[Later on my entire black group on the corner dies... is playing (b) so important? it just looks like a strong group and I didnt think it needed to defend...

A: This group is abundantly alive; there is no need to play T13 which would gain you no more than a point or two and, at this stage of the game, would be a wasted move.  Since white plays the defensive move at O16, you came out of it with "sente," or the initiative, which is useful.  (Forgive me if I explain terms or ideas you already know.  The intro said playing only a month and now 24k, so I am assuming very little knowledge.)

The real problem here is you got bottled in.  Later in the game, even with your group alive, you get 10-12 points and your opponent most likely gets several times that on the top and the right. The position you have in the corner is one you should want after invading a corner already a bit hemmed in.  This early in the game, it should be counted as a negative.

As for the group dying later, chalk it up to experience.  It happens to everybody and it is always exasperating, but you learn from it and get better!]

(;W[nd];B[gc];W[mc]C[I went (a) but I considered (b) but I feared that if I went (b) he'd go for (c)

A: There are bigger points on the board for you to be thinking about, even than G17.  His position in the upper right has "thickness" and there is a proverb about avoiding playing near thickness. Certainly shoving in against his thickness is premature when there are big points like D10, C5, O3 or O4.  That said, white's play at N17 is feeble in the extreme and he lets you get away with something here.  Playing at a is fine and nullifies lots of white's influence; no need to go in to b as you certainly can't attack white's strong group.  If you did though, you would both jump out and out again, slightly to white's detriment I think.  See variation.]

(;B[jc];W[cf];B[ce]C[A: The diagonal attachment here is usually done when black has a stone at, say, D10.  White then usually plays at d14 to prevent black from playing there and making a "tiger's mouth."  Once white plays there, his position is deemed "heavy," i.e. too many stones chasing too little power or territory.]
;W[bf]C[A: I don't think this white move is good.  Consider the variation. Having made the diagonal approach, making the tiger's mouth could be good.]

(;B[be];W[cp]
(;B[cq]C[A: By going for the cramped little corner here, you let White build a wall that works perfectly with his stones on the 14th row.  I know I can be too aggressive, but don't always let the other player get away with things.  Consider how much peril you are putting the other player in as well as how much peril he is putting you in.  See variation.]

C[I guess defending on (b) was important since later on it become a ko fight and I lost it, lots of points on that one.
At this time I decided to go for the 3,3 I had a feeling he was about to protect it.

A: The 3-3 invasion here is a pretty good thought.  With regard to b, though, why not play at e6 instead?  It is, I think, sente, or at least the capture of three stones, and no ko either. As it stands, your group in the lower left is safe but locked in. If you play e6, it gets out.  See variation.]

(;B[qq]
(;W[pq]C[A: White picked the wrong direction to go with this corner.  See variation.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qr]C[A:  Usually, in this situation, white would play R7, giving black the play at Q2, making black safe but bottling him up.  Since white, for no reason I can see, wants the corner, black can get out on the other side.  See variation.]

;B[oq];W[oj];B[ps];W[pi];B[pp];W[rm];B[sm];W[rk];B[ln]C[A: You did fine in the corner here, wiping out white's potential territory, capturing some stones and getting your head out.  Well done.  M6 is worth a few dozen points in despoiled white territory.]
;W[sn];B[so];W[sk]C[A: J5 is absolutely mandatory for white here; T9 is a dreadful waste.  Don't feel you have to go through all the variations, but I think if you playat K5, you kill white's group.  You can still play e6 too.  Think about how different the game would be if black had sealed your lower right group in and played e5. He would be threatening to enclose a vast territory.]

;B[mf];W[nf];B[ng];W[oh];B[mh]C[A:  There is a proverb: "Hane the head of two stones."  D14 has been crying out for a while for one of you to occupy it.  Meanwhile, though, white is letting you wipe out his influence and turn it into your own.]

;W[hf];B[gd]C[A: I can't fault your playing all through here.  You have reduced white's territorial chances in the center and have carved out quite a bit for yourself.  I make you ahead by about 50 points here.]

;W[lk];B[ll];W[mk];B[ml];W[nl];B[mm]C[A: Broadly speaking you are right to connect your stones to the lower right.  But this move seems pretty pointless.  White isn't going to strand the stones in the center anymore.  The biggest points now are (1) points that secure any weak spots, like e3 and (2) extensions from D10, which further destroy white's territory.]

;W[bc]C[I went (a) when (b) was the correct solution it seems.

A:  Yes.  If you haven't already, you may usefully purchase the book "Life and Death" by James Davies.  It is available on Amazon.com. It tells you lots of the shapes that usually arrive and how to kill them or make them live.  I would actually identify your misstep as the previous move, where you should have played B18 instead of A17.  A17 is dispositive.]

;W[fs];B[ep];W[eg];B[fh];W[eq];B[gj];W[fj]C[A: No way.  White should ignore the threat and take at F2.  You'd need to spend a move to save your stones in the corner and white could respond to the threat then.]
;B[ep];W[rp]C[I think this is where I should have closed the ko and let him use his threat and kill those 4 stones. but I didnt...

A: You are right.  He gets 11 points on the right.  The ko is much bigger.  Meanwhile, you are 45 points ahead.  At this stage of the game you should be counting (unless it is a speed game) to see what the score is.  If you can, count every few turns. Then make your judgment.  In this case, lose 11 points and secure the win.  Easy choice.  Counting makes the game easier and, if you do it and he doesn't, gives you an edge.]

(;B[al];W[aj];B[tt]C[I passed.];W[sh]C[A: You are defending a single point at S15.  S19 solves the problem, costing you only one point.  Since you are 35 points ahead, it is ok.  I might have done what you did, though.  It is hard to see this one coming at you through the fog.]

(;B[qa];W[rc]C[I'm in atari and this is a KO for the life of the group, but I already lost the previou KO and I have no more threats... in the end the only way I managed to save this group is by making a KO, and it looked so strong...]

(;B[fd];W[ra];B[fq];W[rd];B[ep];W[gq];B[eq];W[dn]C[A: M19 is nothing.  T6 gets you a point, for what it is worth.]
;B[la];W[sn];B[tt];W[sm];C[Game over, I lost by 3.5

As I see it, I had 3 big mistakes in this game, one is not closing the first KO. another is allowing white to make a small living group inside my territory, and failing to make my group live.

A: You played well.  Really, you beat him and he got lucky.  His play in the ko fights was many grades above where it was the rest of the time and it would have been hard to see what was coming.  The way I would describe what went wrong is that you failed to close a few key weaknesses, perhaps because you were not aware of how far ahead you were and that you could afford to spend the points doing it.  All in all, I think you should be pleased with how you played.

I hope this review is a help.  All the best!
