C[To the GTL comentator:
Hi this game was played on IGS and was valid for the 8th amateour
GO tournament.
I am Beto and I played black with a 6.5 komi to white

I lost this game by 3.5 pts + komi

I would like a generic comment on which moves where to slow or
to timid and therefore allowed the opponent to gain this small
advantage.

Generally saying both players did not try agressive or risky
moves but preffered to develop conservatively, BUt obviously
my opponent choosed the best moves cause he won.

Tks

Hi Roberto,

Black plays a cautious game and just loses. I found some fuseki
ideas that might have helped Black .. some middle game moves
and certainly some endgame moves. I guess your game will improve
as you practice playing more agressively in the opening by pincering
.. and calculate the biggest moves at the endgame. Black was
very good at capitalising on the endgame mistakes white made.

Hope this all helps,

Robin];B[pc];W[dq];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pe]C[It is probably better to pincer here as it works well with the
two stones in the corner]
(;B[nc];W[ph]TR[pc][nc]MA[cf][fc][cj][do][co]C[It is not usually a good idea to attach to a weak group .. although
you get the corner you help white here .. also black   marked
stones are solid .. you could attack white by q10 .. or play
at other marked places that I think may be better than your choice]

will try to confine black to a small group and will probably
get sente too!];W[hp]C[*JoeChill*: I gave you time again

*JoeChill*: :-)];B[lq];W[kp];B[mo]C[White now looks ahead by quite a lot .. mostly because of black
not jumping out from the pincer];W[pm];B[pn];W[pl];B[on];W[hm]
C[f14 looks good as it limits white's moyo and builds blacks but
white can still play k15 which will seriously reduce black.

I think black needs to reduce white now see variation as a possibilty]

(;B[ff]C[White plays too low e12 better];W[dh]C[Another possibilty to build territory for black here would be
as the variation]
