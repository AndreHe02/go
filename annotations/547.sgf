C[Hello,  I tried to give you some practical advises along the game.
In sintesis, I would say :
- try to evaluate the global balance of territory / influence to chose the best move. You played too many moves with low profit
- try to keep sente. before you play a move, be sure that you keep sente. If you  lose it in the middle game, it must be for a big move.
- don't get closed on the sides and keep opened to the center
- don't bother if your opponent get the right side : you can reduce it also from the outside and manage to get compensations elsewhere.

I hope it can be useful.
Good work !
- don't do overplay within opponent's territory

To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing this game.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but it seems that no matter what I try to do to reduce my opponent's territory, I only end up helping him to finish his framework.  In this particular game, my opponent ended up getting the entire right side of the board with little difficulty, and I can't figure out where (or when) I should have played to stop Black from completing his framework.  I never got the chance to play in that part of the board because I always felt I had to play moves to shore up my position.

Also, when I feel as though I do have a sente position, I feel like I'm just guessing which part of the board I should be playing in.

So, I'm hoping that by sending this game in for review, a stronger player will be able to figure out: a) What I'm doing wrong, b) *why* it's the wrong thing, and c) What I should be doing instead.  I hope I'm not asking for too much!  :-)

Regards,

(;W[cd]C[I think that in this position the pincer at C11, C13 or D12 is better.
otherwise, white gets the corner but black is free to expand on the left side and damages the white's stone at C4]
;B[de];W[fd];B[ch];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[pg];W[kc]C[you can do a 3 space extension from 2 stones : I think K16 (on the 4th line : aiming also the center) is better]
;B[hd]
(;W[hc]C[I think that black move  is an overplay : black is afraid that you take all the upper side. but he can't live there and can only be subject to a severe response from white.

however H17 is purely defensive and not agressive. instead it helps black to get out !...

I prefer G15 or K15.

In any case, don't think only to territory but take advantage of these opportunities to take influence throughout the board]
;B[gf];W[nq]C[Fedya: I felt that I was sente here, and figured I should do something to reduce Black in the lower right.  However, Black ended up completing a very large framework on the right side.  I can't figure out where I went wrong.  Should I have attacked from the other side?

I think this move is OK with respect to C4. the right side is still open.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pm];W[kq]C[still, K4 is better, or J3];B[gd]
;W[gc];B[fe]
(;W[ed]C[I would have taken sente : see variation];B[dn];W[cn]
C[I don't agree with this move : D6 is building a framework with the upper group toward the center.

I think this last move only helps black. I would have played E4 to save the corner and prepare for an expansion in the center]
;B[dp];W[dq];B[ep];W[eq]C[this is not consistent with C6 : you should now play C7]
;B[cm];W[bn];B[dl];W[fp];B[hq];W[gq];B[ho];W[fn]TR[dl][cm][dn]
[ho][dp][ep][hq]C[Fedya: Was this a bad move?  I thought it would be a good strategy to split the two black groups.

it's OK];B[hm];W[qq]C[Fedya: Was this a bad move?  I thought I did well because I ended up with the entire bottom corner, but as I mentioned, Black ends up with the entire right side above about the 4th line.

you should first maintain the pression playing F8, reducing by the way black moyo on the left]
;B[qp];W[pq]C[this is a mistake : see variation.

you should play P3]
(;B[op];W[or];B[jr];W[kr];B[jq];W[jp];B[ip];W[jo];B[jn];W[id]
C[this is a very bad move : it doesn't attack black, give few profit to white and don't take into account the global situation.
F8 is still much much better, or O7, or event O13.

white is back in the race, and must reduce black's center influence]
;B[fm]C[very severe : now the game is lost];W[bm]C[B8 is better ... but you should think to the right side !]
;B[bl];W[he]C[useless];B[ge];W[ie]C[you have lost sente ! ... for nothing]
;B[gn];W[go]C[Fedya: Should I have simply played at F5 instead?  As the game went, Black ended up sente and was able to use it to good advantage.

do not answer !];B[en];W[fo];B[lo]C[Fedya: I didn't see this move coming.  Now Black is able to constrict me to a small amount of territory on the bottom.]

(;W[lp]C[this is to submissive, see variation.   otherwise you can play elsewhere : O6 or O13]
;B[ko];W[kp];B[no]
(;W[ee]C[Fedya: I thought I'd try to separate the Black groups, but this doesn't do much.  Is this where I should have played at S10 to do something about the Black framework?

it's to late to invade on the right side : you have no base in the center from which to launch an invasion, and I don't see a way to live on the side.

anyway E15 is useless, as you should see on your own : better J12 or O13.  note that you can try somethink to break black's wall on the lower side : see variation]
;B[ef];W[be]C[B16 is better as it is sente.];B[bf];W[bd]C[you have lost sente]
;B[pj]C[Fedya: I can't figure out where I've gone wrong to allow Black such a good framework.]
;W[qc]C[Fedya: I figured that this had worked in the lower corner, so I'd try it in the upper corner instead.  However, it only serves the purpose of making Black's framework better.

no, it's OK ; it's the only way to reduce black now];B[qd];W[pc]
C[should be at P18];B[od];W[ob];B[rq];W[pr];B[mp];W[mq];B[mo]
;W[rd]C[Fedya: I felt that since Black got this point in the bottom, I had to get it in the top.

still better S17.];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ro]LB[nf:a]C[Fedya: Here I had absolutely no idea where to play.  This was a wild guess, and failed miserably.  I can't come up with anything good.  The best I can see is O14, but that doesn't look like much.  If I try an invasion on the right side, Black gets a huge framework facing the center; if I try anything on the outside, Black ends up with the entire right side.  Is there any good place for White to play?

try to evitate "wild guesses". you can still play simple sente moves such as : A14, T15, A8 that reduce black and then play in the center : J12 and O13]

C[Fedya: Is there anything better to do?  Black has the entire right side, and I feel the only chance I have to win is if I can limit the amount of territory Black can get in the center.  Would L12 have been any better?

L10 is better];B[lj];W[jk];B[kl];W[kk];B[ll];W[lk];B[mk];W[jl]

be agressive : you have nothing to lose now .see variation]

(;W[kh]C[Fedya: I was so demoralized that I didn't even notice I had six stones in atari.  Not that I was going to win, however.  Black was leading by about 30 points (which is less than I thought at the time I was playing -- I thought I was losing by close to 100).

you are losing by some 40 points. if you consider white's stones you sacrificed with no result within black's territory, these are about 30 points ...

Add to this that you should not have permitted black to close you in on the lower right and lower left, and you know why you have lost the game]
