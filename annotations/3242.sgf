R3dDragon [10k\]: hi];B[qd]C[tomrose [9k\]: hi
tomrose [9k\]: enjoy the game!
R3dDragon [10k\]: thx];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj];B[fc]C[shadow: Can't really criticize the move, it looks like a professional game so far.  However the biggest move could probably be argued to be D10.  Why?  The biggest moves in the opening are the corners, followed by corner enclosures/approaches, then side extensions, then 4-4 points and 3-3 points.  Looks for the biggest area to develop, keeping in mind that 4th line stones are for developing an area, and 3rd line stones are for immediate territory, but small development.  White's R10 hit the biggest spot, seperating a 4th line stone (Q4\] from a 4-1/2 line stone enclosure [top right\].  The next bigggest is area was D16 - D4, 11 lines of seperation and 4th line to 4th line.  If White chose D10, then black gets Q10, and black seems bigger.  The top side is 4th line [D16\] to a 3rd line stone [P17\] and only 10 lines long.  It's the smallest area on the board, and has little room for development and approaching a 4-4 stone, which has low priority in the opening.  The bottom is 4th line to 4th line but between black and white, so it's not as big as C10.]
;W[ic]C[not completely sure about continuations here, I tried an approach from the other side which ended up working moderately well

shadow: Dive into the corner, his wall will be ineffective.  It's facing a 3rd line stone and has no room for development.  J17 is a mistake.]

(;B[cf]C[shadow: an approach on this side offering to exchange sides with White, because black has a precense on the left side.  This is not a useful move, it has no purpose except to induce a fight.]
;W[ee]C[shadow: the corner is ther for the taking, white should have played D14 to make black's shape look silly, and capture F17 on a  bigger scale.]

(;B[ci];W[nq];B[qm];W[qg];B[oq]C[this seems wrong, q2 maybe to enclose the corner better?

shadow: it is wrong.  When you touch stones, you make them stronger.  You do not attack strong stones.  you don't make weak stones stronger either.  The only time you touch stones is when you realize they are already strong but flawed, and you don't care that you make them stronger.  The other time is when you are having an emergency.  You are too weak to fight, so you have to compromise and touch a stone, after all by touching you too will get stronger.   The proper move is to just drop down to Q2, or move out.]

(;W[np];B[cn]C[shadow: Analyze the left side -- 6 lines seperate a 4th line stone from a 3rd line stone of opposite colors.
analyze the bottom -- 9 line seperate a 4th line stone form a 4th stone wall.  The bottom is clearly bigger!  Matters get worse when you realize that C6 is too far from C11 and is nothing but a target for later.]
;W[fq];B[cc]C[shadow: this was big :)];W[cd]C[should white play d17 instead? still loses corner but this should make f17 area weaker

shadow: yes white descended on the wrong side.  however it might be an interesting plan if he intends to attack the left side.]
;B[dc];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd];B[ab];W[lc];B[en]C[this seems to build my moyo on the left side while starting to put pressure on white, also starts to solidify the overextended c6, is this viable? i still feel like i'm overextended

shadow: very good developing move, it makes black look much better on the left side, while making whites wall at the top look silly.  It's also staring daggers at the bottom side.]
;W[jp]
(;B[eg]C[shadow: C14 and C11 constitute a strong position, this attacks white but from the wrong direction it runs white into his friends.  you want to seperate him and take territory. G16 is the best move for that.]

(;W[qo]C[wasn't sure how to continue from here
shadow: think about it this way, if white had entered at R3, how would you deal with it?  White is owed something here, your shape is weak, so compromise, and figure out the best way to do that.  See variation to see how I decide to follow up.]

;B[lp]C[shadow: black is attacking strong stones.  For a while now in the game, black has been playing like he's behind, and strengthing white rather then keeping him weak.  White has no weak groups anymore. black is losing again.]

C[shadow white returns the favor and helps black make a large developing area in the middle.  J14 is a good move it builds while attacking!]
;W[kn];B[ko];W[db];B[cb];W[fb];B[da];W[gc]C[from here i try extending to o8, my framework is very large but very open, what is best way of closing it off?

shadow: you can't.  to make a moyo into territory, you have to be able to make territory someplace else too.  Moyos are about options, if they dive in you kill them on a big scale, or if they live, then they lost something someplace else.  White has no weak groups anymore, it's too late, there is nothing else for black to take, white can just play small and coast to a win.  The top right corner is vulnerable now too, now that white is strong again.  Only a white mistake will save you now.

shadow: no more comments.];B[ol]
