;B[ef]C[I like that, better here than C17.];W[cj];B[cc];W[cb]
;B[cd];W[eb];B[fd]C[I think I would play D12 first. It removes the remote possibility of attacking W, but it holds him down quite effectively.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[hc];B[hd];W[ic];B[je]C[This is not good. It's a defensive move which is not necessary, makes very little territory, and does nothing to attack. Better would be C7, D12, or tenuki such as Q10.]
;W[cn];B[co]C[Not good. It heps W to make the side secure. Better G3, or if you really want to stir it up C9.]
;W[dn];B[fq];W[qn];B[lq]C[The idea is right, but in this case I think N3 would have been better.]
;W[nq];B[kp];W[ip];B[pn]C[Always difficult to know what to do in this sort of situation, but I would have preferred O4.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[po];W[qm]C[Q: s6 is the honest move here.
Can i punish worse than i did?

Niall: You could have played R2 before O6, but your punishment seems quite effective to me.]

;B[ln];W[lk];B[nk]C[I would have played out somewhere like Q10 first. This is the key point, but it may be a bit early to play it.]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[oj];B[lj]C[I don't like that: in my view either Q10 or K8 would be better.]
;W[kk];B[ol];W[ml];B[nj]C[An overplay - you have too many weaknesses on the R side to get away with this. Q10, or if you REALLY want trouble, Q8.]
;W[pl];B[qk];W[oi];B[qi];W[sn];B[sl];W[so];B[nl]C[Again an overplay - Q11.]
;W[qh];B[pi];W[ph];B[oh];W[ni];B[mj];W[nh];B[og];W[rl];B[rk]
;W[sm];B[qg]C[A good - indeed a necessary - choice, but it's a shame to have to give up any attack on the P7 group.]

C[Good.];W[lf];B[kg];W[kf];B[jf]C[Should be K14. What happened shows why.]
;W[jg];B[jh];W[ig];B[ih];W[hg];B[hh];W[gg];B[gh];W[fg];B[eh]
C[Overplay. Play H8 now and you should still be able to win. W will have to save the O13 group, and you can pull out L8 to cause trouble on the lower side.]
;W[eg];B[dg];W[dh];B[df];W[fh];B[ei];W[fi];B[ej];W[fj]C[Q: I feel like i'm being ripped \off here.

Niall: with some reason. You manage to exit from it fairly elegantly, but at the cost of giving your opponent the lead in territory.]
