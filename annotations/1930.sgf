C[K: Hi, I'd like to thank the reviewer and the GTL maintainers for making it possible for me to improve my Go so easily.

I played Black

R: Hi, I'm hope to be helpful
For any question you can find me on KGS as Wiles

I've signed my comments with an R: and your original comments by a K:]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo]
(;W[jp]C[R: Usually W defends the corner here (see variation), letting black play C-D6 and seal the corner in is bad]
;B[nq]C[K: I thought about this move.. maybe better to play the shimari.

R: well, you have actually played a shimari (corner encolsure)
maybe you mean the Keima shimari (P3) This is the kogeima(large knight) shimari

But now you should have played D6, taking advantage of W's mistake. Since he has added K4, if he defend the corner now the F3 stones would be floating without a base.]
;W[np]C[R: usually contact moves like this in such an early stage of the game are not a good idea]
;B[mp];W[op];B[oq];W[mo];B[lp];W[om];B[cn]C[R: Good move, but now M5 was also a good point, separating two weak groups, and almost certainly you could have ended in sente and then come back to play C6]
;W[cp]C[R: slack for W, this soes not save the corner as there's no eye shape, he should have tryed to go out (with a move like D6 for exemple), or  tenuki]
;B[ck];W[jn];B[qm]C[R: small, the upper side is the biggest area now.]
;W[ci];B[lo];W[mn];B[cf]C[R: I think that continuing to push at M6 was good enough.
White will then have two groups to take care. 
Now you are creating a weak group of your own and the game can became difficult.]
;W[dj];B[el]C[R: After this move there the corner is really sealed in and you can think of killing it (see var)]

(;W[df];B[ce];W[de];B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[dd];B[bc]C[K: Here white sealed me in pretty well ... if i am not mistaken, this is bad for black?

R: yes this is not a great result for black, but it is not too bad, white will surely play an extension along the upper side with his next move, so you can take sente on a big point like D3, M6 or along the right side]
;W[cg]
(;B[db]C[R: tenuki was the best thing, the corner cannot be killed]
;W[eb];B[ca];W[hd]C[R: This is slow
W could have played at least as far as L4since the big wall he has created]
;B[jc]C[R: Good move, Black is largely ahead at this point]
;W[ld];B[mc];W[lc];B[je]C[R: it was better to play K15 without exchanging N16-M16 first, that was just aji-keshi]

I've added some variations, and it seems that you can kill it, even if there are many variation so i cannot be sure]

C[K: Game ends with a ko fight and black wins by about 16 points with a .5 komi...

I felt that white played a better game, especially in yose.

Please give me any extra tips you might have, thank you very much

R: you played a better game than W, but you still made some mistakes, the last one very huge.
It was just a careless move, but it could have cost the game, you had been just lucky that your opponent missed the chance.
 
In the beninnig you were very much ahead, in fact your major mistakes were all in the middle stage.
More than one time you missed the chance to attack a weak group. Try to see at the whole board (yes, i know it is difficult, but you have to do it in order to improve) looking  for the weakness of your opponent and try to attack there, and you'll improve fast.

Best regards, Davide])
