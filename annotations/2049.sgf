C[I always feel I'm behind, or have missed out on some big opportunities
after the opening. This game is, I think, a good example of this.
I ended up resigning with what seemed to me to be an enormous
arrears.

If possible, I would like some pointers on how I can more effectively
limit and/or invade blacks moyo.

Any and all comments are welcome!];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[cq];B[pj]
C[This is played often against me and I have got little idea what
to do with it. I am not a fan of it myself, I still have to get
used to this whole 'influence vs. territory' idea.

Usually I try to apporach one corner from the open side and then
invade somwhere around the other corner.];W[de]C[RM: Normal progress]
;B[ep]C[RM: It is more common to play around k16 as it is such a big
point
for either black or white. The 4, 5 approach to the 3, 3 stone
is also unusual.];W[do];B[eo];W[dn];B[fm]
(;W[kq]C[RM: O17  or K16 may be better before playing here.]

(;W[hc]C[My opponent offered a variation after the game which seemed very
nice afterwards.
I didn't spend a lot of time on this move, a very grave mistake
in any situation of course.


RM: Before playing at H17 consider if you opponent would like
to play in this area. I think black will not be interested in
G17 or similar because it's too small and Gote. Instead black
would
prefer K15 or simlar to make his stones work together. So if
white plays H17 black is forced to play the move he wanted to!
This could be termed a "thankyou" move. An invasion at R14 would
be typical here, but would end up with the group being chased
into the center. Black's bottom left group is floating, and white
can take profit whilst attacking it. 

E6 leaves black with a cut to worry about and helps white to
secure some terratory on the left hand side.

I think the K15 suggestion is an really interesting idea.];B[ie]

(;W[kb]C[RM: O16 is better.];B[nd];W[lc];B[le]C[I didn't want black to be able to secure his corner and thusly
claim the top and half the right side. Unfortunately black gained
more from this than I did it seems.

RM: Yes, L18 was a costly error.]
(;W[on]C[RM: Instead of this reducing move, the invasion at R10 is more
popular.];B[ol];W[mo];B[lp];W[ko];B[kp];W[jp];B[lo];W[jn];B[kn]

(;W[kd]C[RM: Too small. White should attempt to live in the corner or
at the side with R4 or R5.];B[ke];W[jd];B[je];W[id];B[qp]C[I'd say I have little to hope for now. I have two corners , the
top side and a small group at the bottom.
Black doesn't seem to have any weak groups I can attack, but
he does have an enormous amount of territory.

Where did I go wrong and what should I have done?

Any and all comments are greatly appreciated and in advance I
would like to express my gratitude for you taking your time to
review this game.])
