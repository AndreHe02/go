;B[pd]C[HI thanx for reviewing my game..i'm 20k on kgs..pls make as much comments as possible..thank u!

xxc: reviewer];W[pp]C[xxc : comment for the next move ... as long as the game stay in a usual opening (first moves in the 4 corners)
Black takes a corner R16.
It is said that a cross opening (R16 + D4 for black and D16 + Q4 for white) starts a game with more fight.
White with is first move can chose to prevent this if he wants to have a "simplest" game. Here playing at D4. But as white is ususaly stronger, he let this choice to black :)]
;B[dq]C[xxc : black want to figth.];W[dd]
(;B[fp]LB[cm:1][co:A][do:B]C[xxc : usual extension is A or B.
A enclose the corner right now, while B is a little bigger ... but leaves a weakness at 1. Both A and B threaten a move arround K4 to start to make a big territory.
Here it's strange shape because it leaves corner and side open.]
;W[co]LB[dm:B][cq:A]C[xxc : it's too near, black can attack strongly here.
2 ideas.
From the inside with A. Close the corner and threaten a pincer.
From the outside with B. To build a wall while letting white live small. The wall will be used latter to attack.

But i feel this could have been really simple ... see var from move 4]

(;B[jp]TR[fp][dq]C[xxc : why this move ?
The marked group is strong and do not need support right now ... so this move is too small. If you want it ... you can have it with a better "style" (see var)]
;W[mq]TR[co]C[xxc : same for white, he must not let his stone without help.]

(;B[ci]LB[cf:B][cl:A]C[Was this invasion ok?i didn't want white to have the left side

xxc : Yes and no :)
Invading here is correct, 3 space jump to extend each side A or B. But you can see that these 2 point are also perfect extension for white ! A for C5 and B for C14.
So, with this move, you offer white a spot he wants ... there should be a way to improve this move no ?

Let's see what is possible.
Near the corner ... and then near the lower stone ... see var.]
;W[cl]C[xxc : too easy for white.];B[cf];W[ce]C[xxc : i don't think it's a good idea, white may want to attack this group latter and this will make it stronger.]
;B[ef]LB[dg:A]C[i wasn't sure if this extension was a good one

xxc : D14 is the one you are thinking of. Here you let A for white and it could be dangerous.]
;W[fd];B[bk]TR[cl][co]C[xxc : ok but here again, i don't feel this black group need more support now, the white group (marked) is weaker and an attack from white here may be dangerous for the lower group.]
;W[qm]TR[cl][co]C[xxc : white still underestimate the weaknesses of his group !
And the corner can still be invade (ok, difficult and the result might be a ko ... but keep it in mind)]
;B[qh]LB[lc:A]C[xxc : when extending like that, try to chose the side with the bigger space, here A.
Do not forget here that the corener and side are not yours !]
;W[jd];B[hc]C[Should i went on the fourth line instead of the third?Or was this invasion not a good one to start with?

xxc : there is a proverb interesting for this stone i think ... "make a fist before striking".
I do not think you can invade here right now ... you are too weak arround. And if you think you can have a good result ... perhaps a good idea to patch your own shape at the bottom :)]
;W[he]C[xxc : here is the answer. White is telling something here ... "OK, you think you can live here ... come on show me !"
Better to let this stone and forget it ... it may be usefull later.]

(;B[fc]C[xxc : i'm not sure it is a good idea to try right now.]
;W[ec];B[gd]C[I dun think this was a good move, cuz it didn't bring me ne proft...pls comment

xxc : you have no choice now ... extend to have room to make eyes.]
;W[ge];B[jc];W[kc];B[kd];W[ic]
(;B[jb];W[id];B[lc];W[ib];B[kb]C[xxc : the result is quite good for black, but i think it is not the better way to have this result. Black can just extend from the corner ... and this will leave the weakness in white shape at H16/17.]
;W[dk]LB[cn:A]C[xxc : not sure this is a good way to get out. Weakness is at A i think.]
;B[ej];W[gg]C[xxc : wrong direction ... white push from his strong group ...]
;B[gj];W[lo]TR[dk][cl][co]C[xxc : white can't let his group ... it's really time to attack it strongly !!!]
;B[oi]LB[qk:A]C[xxc : better at A];W[qc]C[Was this a good invasion by white?cuz i used this invasion to build influence to turn the left into territory..hm..pls comment

xxc : it's big !!! But i'm not sure this will be 100% alive.]
;B[pc]C[xxc : better from the other side no ?];W[qd];B[qe];W[re]

(;B[qf];W[rf];B[oe]LB[rg:A]C[xxc : white do not have time to cut here.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[kg]LB[qk:3][cn:2][cp:1][kq:4]C[xxc : there is not so much points in the center.

[am:1][bn:2]C[I was trying to porotect the left side pls comment if it served its purpose or not..thanx

xxc : if you want to protect only, you have to check where can white attack and then find what you can play.

C gives 2 eyes 1 and 2
B prevents a cut at 3
and A prevents a sad reduction ...

But before make life it's always a good thing to extend.];W[fg]

[js]C[xxc : Ok.
One overall advice ... you can't have the whole board !!!
In a game, as long as you have nearly the same potential to make points than your opponent ... extend and strenghten your own groups is better than launching a fight.
And try to keep things simple when you can.

Thank u.])

A lot of moves possible and hard to read ! But i think black can have a better result than white here.]

(;B[lc]C[xxc : for exemple, white have to answer here or he lost all the side.]

))
(;B[ch]LB[fc:E][ce:C][cf:D][ck:B][cl:A]C[xxc : too far from the corner right ?
White answer at A or B ... and then you can't extend with a good shape ... C is not so good and D is too small, a pincer arround F will not put so much presure on the corner.]
;W[ck];B[eh]C[xxc : only simple move no ? Is that really interesting ?]
)
(;B[cg]C[xxc : it becomes more dangerous for the corner, but white can still extend form the lower stone.]

(;W[cl];B[cj]C[xxc : simple way ... or])
(;W[cf];B[dg];W[dj]C[xxc : this is annoying for black no ? But white can't do that ... he is not strong enought.]
))
(;B[cf]C[xxc : white have to answer i think.];W[fd]C[xxc : and now ?]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[ci]C[xxc : this exchange is interesting. Nearly the same that is played in the lower corner during the game.
But with a big big difference ... white have a stone in the corner, black comes and both players settle their group. It's a local standard "joseki". A move arround H17 is needed for white now or latter.
In the game black D3 (first to take the corner), white, black F4. Black have 2 stones in the corner and white none and black F4 is the same idea than F16 ... extendind along the side to answer the approach and prevent a pincer.]
;W[cl]C[xxc : standard patern ... equal result but it gives a strong group to white on the upper edge.]
)
(;B[cj]LB[cf:D][cg:B][cl:C][cm:A]C[xxc : this is an other central point to invade still A and B for a good extension ... and still C or D for white.]
)
(;B[ck]LB[cm:A][dm:1][bq:B]C[xxc : this one starts to become interesting ... A is too small for white, sliding in the corner might be dangerous ... white have to get out ... with 1 perhaps.

Of course, white can extend from the corner and your stone will become under presure with a small extension to A available !!! ... but ...]
;W[ci];B[ek]LB[cl:A][cm:B]C[xxc : and now ???

I do not think white will try this.

You should have the idea now ... black can play closer from the white stone A or B the questions will remains the same for white ... how to play to settle his group if he do not want to let C5.]

(;B[cl];W[en];B[el];W[gn]
(;B[jp]LB[hp:A]C[xxc : ok, it's not so good because of a white move at  A ... but it is the idea to have K4. You got it ... with two more stones on the side now :)]
)
(;B[ip];W[hm]C[xxc : white have to fly];B[cf];W[fd];B[di]C[xxc : simple.
Of course, both players can seek other moves to make it difficult.]
)))
(;B[co];W[nc]LB[qf:A]TR[co][dq]C[xxc: What is the difference ?
Nothing for white ... O17 and C5 is the same idea no ?
I do not think white will come arround G3 facing the marked stones as he done in the game. And A changes nothing]
;B[jp]C[xxc : same as the game.

Here, black have to answer arround R14];W[mq]C[xxc : no interest to play here ... better at the top right corner]
;B[ic]C[xxc : better to extend form the 4-4 point allong the side]
;W[kc];B[fc]TR[co]C[xxc : I follow the ideas only ... the result locally is quite the same, but with the first move (marked stone) it gives a better result.
Don't you think so ?
The main difference is between white top righ groupe and black bottom left one. White group is under a smoother presure while black is more solid ... just an exchange that seems equal to me.

Try to stay as simple as you can.]))
