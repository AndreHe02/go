Hi Romulus,

I hope you will find my comments useful. If you have further questions concerning this game, please feel free to email me.

Joerg.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[qn];B[qo]LB[nq:a][np:b][qj:c]C[White approached this corner pretty early. But you have played on the starpoint which enables you to easily make shape with even two or three white moves in the corner. So I would prever to play in the last open corner. Maybe a matter of taste. Let's see how the game continues.

But if you reply to the approach, this move is not good. By attaching a lone intruder you strengthen him. It is not obvious, but the more severe moves are the ones played some spaces away. (See the Variaton of White 6 for another reason why this move is bad).

Stay calm and play a move around 'a' or 'b'. Even a pincer aound 'c' is better in this situation because it develops your starpoint in the upper right.]

(;W[on]C[The usual move is VAR.];B[qj]LB[np:a]C[Your plan to attack is not generally bad. Maybe you should secure your position at the bottom with a move around 'a' first.

Of course this would enable White  to make an extension up the right side, but it would be a fair trade and you could occupy the last empty corner.   That is what Go is about. Balance. It is an important concept. If your opponent gets territory or influence and you get something equal or more valuable it is a fair trade.]
;W[pk];B[pg];W[pj];B[qi];W[pi];B[ph];W[po]
(;B[qp]C[This is a heavy move. Means, it makes your shape not flexible.   Don't be to concerned about a cut.

See VAR.];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq];W[ro];B[rp];W[rn];B[lq];W[ec]
;B[kc]LB[cd:a]C[Making an approach move is generally more valuable.

The order in the opening is something like this:

- Moves in the corner
- Make corner enclosures or prevent them
- Play in front of corner enclosures


So I would suggest a move around 'a'.];W[de];B[cj]C[Until here everything looks good for me.

Both players have two corners and I was planning to attack white corner as soon as white is revealing  its intentions in reply to my marked move.

------

Ok, to establish a presence at the left seems like a good idea to me.]
;W[cl]LB[cq:a]C[It's obvious his trying to prevent me to atack his  corner

------

This move also attacks your stone. By the way, this move does not really defend the corner territory, because the corner is open to an invasion at 'a'.]
;B[gp]LB[cg:a]C[too slow

------

Not only that. You should take care of your C10-stone. Playing at C10 is a good idea, if you want to establish a presence there, because it is easy to make a base for that stone. That is, if White attacks from below, you extend upwards. If he attacks from above, you extend down the side.

It seems to me that the G4-move should prevent White from building a moyo. But it is necessary to play important moves before big moves.   In this case you really should extend to 'a'. This would be a threat to the corner, too. This double-purpose makes it really a good move. White would probably defend and you could still play G4.]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[ch]C[Now you are in trouble. You have to run away and White can attack you from above and below while taking territory.]

(;B[ej]C[trying to escape to center where I can link my group  to the bottom one

See variation.

------

Escaping is the only way to play now.];W[el];B[fn];W[fh];B[hc]
C[Jumping to G10 seems to be more urgent to me.];W[en]C[G8 would be more severe.]
;B[eo];W[dn];B[ep];W[dq]CR[ej][cj]LB[mc:a][lo:b]C[a short overview from my point of view.

Up to this point except two weak marked stones  situation is even maybe slightly better for me. I  have two corners and white has two. I control the  bottom and upper sides and white is controlling left  side. If I manage to attack his UL corner escaping  the marked stones, I guess I can win this game.

------

I do not agree with you. I dare say that you are in trouble.   Your territory at the bottom and in the bottom right corner is pretty big. So is White's territory in the lower left. The White corner in the lower left is relativ save.

The upper right corner is not yours. It is open to an 3-3 point invasion which will definitely suceed. You have to play at least an other move to secure this corner and still another one to make it hard for Black to invade around 'a'.

The White corner in the top left is not secure, too. But it would be more difficult to invade.   It is easy for White to threaten an invasion at the bottom while enlarging his own influence. (Imagine a move around 'b'). On the other hand it would be big for you to play around 'b' yourself. This is another 'defect' you have to defend.

The focus of the game is the Black group at the left. If White manages to catch it, it will be a big loss. But even if Black manages to escape, White can get an advantage by building strong positions on the right and left.]
;B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[dr]C[Now the White corner is completely save.]

(;B[gk]C[Looks good. Now black stones are almost escaped.  I don't like the direction but it looked to me that I've  many chances to link my stones to the bottom  group and not to the upper one.

------

It is a good idea to run towards the center. A simple one-point jump would be better though, because it can not so easily be cut like the knight's-move. (See VAR at the next move)]

(;W[fm];B[gm];W[jp]C[Indeed too far.];B[ko];W[lp];B[kp];W[mq]
;B[mp]C[clicko: I wanted to capture his stone. MAXCAT didn't  wanted to undo so I continued leaving the game as  is.]
;W[mo];C[**romy**: tb please];C[ UNDO: romy undid the last move (N5)  N4.]
;B[mr];W[mp];B[kq]C[Looks good for you.];W[nd];B[nc]C[Maybe again the direction was wrong...

------

Like before: if you attach a lone intruder, you will strengten him.

A diagonal move at P17 should work better. It secures the corner more or less and threatens a link-up the the black group on the left.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[pe]
(;B[oe]C[very aggressive, right?

------

Right, try the two-step hane. (VAR)];W[qd];B[pc];W[qc]SQ[oe]
C[I left him to invade my corner. what a big mistake. I  didn't realized then that by playing hane with the  marked stone I'll let him invade.

------

But these are only some scattered white stones. The real mistake was maybe your next move. And remeber that the idea that the corner belongs to you was a mistake in the first place.]

(;B[qb]C[Too passive. Show more fighting spirit! You are at a clear advantage in this part of the board. (see VAR)]
;W[rb];B[pb];W[rf];B[qe]C[again attack to the max

------

You saw the cut, this is good.];W[re];B[pf];W[rh]LB[qh:A]MA[nd]
[od]CR[qj][qi]C[uggly! I cought his marked stones but now my two  circels are under attack. I should mention I didn't  realized I should connect at A. BIG MISTAKE.

------

true]
(;B[md]C[stupid as hell!];W[qh]C[now it's too late.

I wonder how I could have make some profits here...

------

Now the right side is big for White.

I think your mistake was to play too passively in the corner. As I mentioned, you should have cut earlier.]

(;B[rc];W[rd];B[ra];W[sc]C[forcing him to make two eyes?!? stupid again!

------

And for another reason wrong. These moves were comparatively small and should be made in the endgame. White could have ignored S19 and played a big point elsewhere, because he doesn't need two eyes there. He can always catch the two black stones to link up.]
;B[rg]C[what am I trying?!?

------];B[qf];W[si]
(;B[fl]LB[fj:a][lm:b]C[Does not prevent the cut at 'a' as far as I can see.

White doesn't have to answer this move. (see VAR on White's next move)

Play a bigger move. For example VAR or 'b' (expands your territory while limiting White's)]

(;W[em]C[VAR would be bad for you.];B[gn];W[sp];B[sq];W[rq]

(;B[qq]C[Ooops... I wonder why I was afraid to capture like in  variation?

------

Yep, in terms of the endgame a big mistake.];W[sr];B[rr];W[sq]

;B[cc]LB[gf:A][ge:B]C[I think it have been better to push around A or B  first.

No, I think your invasion is ok. It was maybe the last chance, before White plays here.]

------

indeed. Dont't play too passiv. Don't try to save every single stone in atari. Show more fighting spirit.]
;B[ab]LB[li:a][kl:b][bj:c]C[Very small.

Keep White's center small with 'a'. Develop your own center with 'b'. Or descent to 'c' and threaten to reduce the upper or lower white group.]

;W[jm];B[in];W[hm];B[hn]CR[ej][cj]C[I had a look at the following moves and could not make out any big mistakes. So there will no comments follow.

I think you lost because of the following points:

Don't let your groups be robbed of a base like the "OOO"-stones for the reasons I already gave. Your opponent simply let you slip away in this game.   Don't think that the 4-4 point secures corner territory. It doesn't! This stone supports influence and a fast development of your opening.

Keep in mind the order of moves in the opening.

Show more fighting spirit. You only lost the top right and top-center because you played to passively. You lost by 20-25 points. This is less than you lost in these fights.

Remember that Go is about balance.


If you keep these points in mind your strength will surely increase.
