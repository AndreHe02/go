RE[B+11.5]

AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[I'm
submitting this game for review because I got a big lead, but the final
score ended up being pretty close.

There are three reasons that the game ended up being close.

White invaded in the lower right (starting at move 125) and nearly killed one of my groups in addition to living.

The
white group on the left side of the board had enough time to make 2
eyes by attacking my stones when I thought I would be able to kill the
group fairly easily (I started my attack at move 180, but throughout
the game I was wondering if I was waiting too long to deal with this
group..)

White invaded in the upper right (starting at move 215)  and lived.

These
are the main questions I wanted answered.  During the early part of the
game, I have a feeling I got out to the big lead more because white
wasn't comfortable at the 4 stone handicap than because I was playing
really well, so some general comments about the early game would be
appreciated as well.  Thanks.];W[mq];B[qm];W[jq];B[gq];W[dg]
;B[df];W[ef];B[ce];W[dj];B[dm]C[Up to this point I've been picking my moves to expand my territory at the same time I restrict white's.]
;W[fd];B[nd]C[I wasn't too worried about the upper left corner, so I played a Shimari in the corner I hadn't played in yet.]
;W[jd];B[nq];W[no];B[iq]C[Still trying to squeeze white while I'm expanding.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[ho];B[go];W[hn];B[jp];W[io];B[kp];W[kq];B[lq]
C[This
was probably a mistake.  My original idea was just to run to the
outside, and I think I should have stuck to that instead of trying to
attack the K3 group.

I
agree.];W[lp];B[lr];W[ko];B[mr];W[mp]LB[jr:B][kr:A]C[I could play at A
or B and connect along the bottom, but I thought other moves were more
valuable.  This possibility sat unused for a long time, and I kept
wondering if and when I should have used it.

B works, A doesn't, but even B is gote so should be avoided until later.]
;B[pj];W[nj];B[pg];W[ng];B[lc];W[le]C[At
this point I noticed that while I had a lot more influence around the
edges of the board, I didn't have many openings to the center.

You are fine here; let White have the center and claim the edges more strongly. But your move is not bad.]
;B[nl];W[ml]C[That attempt to branch out didn't seem to work to me, so I tried elsewhere.]
;B[ek];W[dk];B[fl];W[fm];B[gm]C[I
was happy with this, I thought I would be able to chew up enough space
in the center that I was in a really good position here.];W[fn]
;B[gn];W[fo];B[fp];W[do]C[I
thought I was going to be able to kill the marked stones, but they
escaped.  Some advice on how I played right here would be appreciated.

See the variation in  a couple of moves. you started well and then gave up on a good idea.]
;B[eo];W[en]
(;B[ep];W[dn];B[bo];W[cm];B[cn];W[dl]C[This
is what tripped me up.  I can't save my stone that is in atari, and
without it, I can't kill the invaders.  Back at move 54 I played B5
instead of C5 becaue I thought that playing C5 was playing too close to
white's stones.  If I had a stone on C5 instead of B5 in this position,
I the white stones would be in atari too though.];B[co];W[em]
C[I'm still not upset with this position though,  White had to play a lot of stones in a small area.

Agreed.];B[el];W[dm];B[hl]C[I
was happy with the base I have here to work from to keep white from
claiming the entire center as territory.

I agree, you did a nice
job of securing a large corner while while ended up with an ugly mass
of stones. But I wouild have moved at the marked spot rather than here.
The solid connection would be better here; you don't have an attack on
the lower middle, so the extra influence toward it does you no good,
and you give white a place to build strength.];W[gk];B[gl];W[hk]
;B[al]TR[cg][eb][ec][jc][mf][nm][qc][qp]C[In
the game I played before this one, my opponent made big gains with a
move like this into an area that  I thought I would be able to claim as
territory.  This seemed like as good a time as any for me to try the
move.

This is an end game move; there are many bigger moves available. For example, all the marked spots are worth more, I believe.]
;W[il];B[bj]C[I
really expected white to play on the left side instead of the middle. 
It seemed to me that giving up some access to the center was worth what
I got on the side from my last two moves.

Yeah, I think that white is trying to hard for a center here.]
;W[ci];B[fj];W[fi];B[gj]C[I
was content here to worm my way into as much of the center as I could
manage without taking any chances.];W[ej];B[fk];W[hj];B[gi]
;W[fh];B[hh];W[hi];B[gh];W[ih];B[hf];W[ig];B[gf];W[hd];B[fe]
C[Here
I decided that it was more valuable to issolate the group on the left
side that to keep pushing into the center.];W[ee];B[ed];W[ge]
LB[de:A]C[I
was kind of worried about the upper left corner here if white plays at
A.  I thought that the move white played was a mistake because after I
connect, he can't play at A without putting 3 stones into atari.

yes.
I think you both are making too much of the center and not the
vulnerable points nearer the edges. But as long as white wants to make
you stronger toward the outside, go along with it.];B[ff];W[eg]
;B[he];W[gd];B[je];W[hg];B[gg];W[if];B[ie];W[kf];B[ke];W[kd]
;B[jf];W[kg];B[jg];W[jh];B[id]C[Since
white wasn't pressuring the corner, I just tried to expand as far as I
could before getting cut off.];W[ic];B[ld];W[jc];B[me]C[Here I'm more concerned with sealing off the upper right corner than capturing a stone or two.

good.];W[mf];B[nf];W[mh];B[og];W[oh];B[ph];W[oi];B[pi];W[ok]
MA[qc]C[beautiful large upper corner almost secured. Now secure it with X]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[om];W[nm]MA[cc][cg][fc][on][qc][qp]LB[lf:A]C[Here,
I've sealed off a good bit of territory from the white stones in the
center.  I get invaded later, but with no help from any of the stones
currently on the board.  I was wondering if A would be appropriate at
this point, but I don't play there until very late in the game.

You
have some areas to protect that are worth doing.  See the marked spots;
they are all more important than A or the place you played.]
;B[oo]LB[pn:B][po:A]C[In
hindsight, A or B is probably better, I'm not in such dire need of
territory that I need to press the position of my wall overly much.

agreed; and I think you are more vulnerable to the outside than you realize.]
;W[on];B[pm];W[po];B[op];W[pn];B[ro]C[I'm
trying to make up for playing too close the the white stones earlier
with this move, but I couldn't make that move work correctly.]
;W[np];B[or];W[qp];B[qo];W[pq];B[oq];W[qr];B[qn]LB[rp:A]C[try A instead]
;W[nn];B[kr]LB[pr:B][rp:A]C[I
decided to finnaly use this tactic to add some security to my groups in
the fighting to come.  I also considered playing at A or B here.]
;W[jr]LB[jo:A]C[This
was something I didn't expect. I expected white to play at A, but this
is clearly better for white than playing at A.

That is why your playing were white played would have been better.]
;B[ir];W[js];B[is];W[jo];B[pr]TR[rp]MA[ns]C[This
is a mistake; playing at O1 saves your group, so it's better to play at
S4 and rob white of the room to make eyes.];W[qq];B[ks]TR[qs]
MA[ns]C[Having been cut off, I try for two eyes for my isolated group.

I like O1 better here; I'm not sure if R1 leads to you killing white or not.]

(;W[rs];B[ms]C[I had to resort to ko to buy time, but I make two eyes now.]
;W[ps];B[nr];W[sr];B[rq]SQ[rp][rr][sq]C[I
really thought that this move was going to kill the white group when I
made it.  I was thinking that he would fill in his eye space to capture
the stone, or allow my to connect out and simply not have space for two
eyes because of the presence of my stones.

I don't see a way to
kill white now.];W[rp];B[sp];W[sq]C[I'm just couldn't find a way to
kill this white group in the corner.  Here I realized that whatever
chances that there might have been to kill this group no longer matter
because it's alive now.];B[so]C[This is a wasted, end game move]

B, C, or D  than to play where I did.];W[ai];B[aj];W[ah];B[ag]
;W[de];B[cf];W[bm];B[am];W[bk]C[Looking
at this as I prepare to send the game off for review, I think that A
was the move here.  White can't play at B because the two stones will
be in atari.]

(;W[ki];B[bd]LB[cd:A]C[I
think that I needed to have played this move quite a while back.  This
corner could have been in real trouble if white had played at A.

Not so. See the variation.];W[qc]LB[ra:D][rb:C][rc:B][rd:A]
[sb:E]C[I
really don't think that white should be able to live here if black
plays correctly, however, if I had played correctly here, I wouldn't be
sending this game in for review.  Now that the game is over, I'm trying
to think less cautiously.  From a strategy standpoint, I want to drive
white against the wall on M.  Tactically A-E seem to accomplish this
better than what I played in the real game.

I suspect W should be able to live here. But C I think is the way to try to kill it.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[oc];B[od]SQ[sb]TR[nb]C[I think I've let white get too solid a position in the corner by now.
