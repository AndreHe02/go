;W[cn]LB[dj:C][cl:D][fp:A][fq:B]C[I've since learned that I should play the opposite side from the white stone to prevent a clamping play and  to build up some territory on the side.

patrickb: That's not the only way to play.  Black has a number of good options here, ranging from A ro D. However, black *is* probably best playing in this area now.]
;B[qj];W[fq]LB[eo:A]TR[dp]C[At this point I decided to concentrate on the rest of the board and leave that stone for dead.

patrickb: Probably not the best idea. Doing so lets w build up a very strong posision from which he can use to operate on the rest of the board. Playing at A is probably the most straightforward thing to do. It gets b out into the center, and divides w in half. A general principle of the game is to keep your opponent seperated if possible]

(;B[jc];W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[patrickb: this move serves primarily to make w stronger at the bottom. I'm not sure it's the best way for b to play now.]
;W[np];B[mh]LB[pn:A]C[patrickb: This move doesn't really do enough. It seems... vague. It doesn't really put much pressure on w, and the top is still pretty vulnerable. Black really needs to play at A instead]
;W[on];B[pn];W[cf];B[gd];W[dj];B[ih]TR[ih][mh]C[patrickb: Moves like this may look large, but they're really not as large as they seem. W can invade the area at the top right. One of the problems with plays like those I've marked is that they don't put any pressure on w. Playing this way lets white dictate the pace of the game, something that is rarely a good idea.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[om];B[qo];W[qc]C[I know invasions at the 3,3 point at dangerous, but I never know when to play a move to protect from this. I always think there are much better moves elsewhere.

patrickb: generally, especially at this point, there *are* better moves elsewhere. This move isn't dangerous, however. Simply accept the fact that white will probably live in the corner, and try to seal him in so that you get a large area of your own.]

(;B[pb]LB[pc:A]C[patrickb: this is much too aggresive. Something like 'A' is better. See the variation I've added.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[qb];B[oa];W[qd];B[qf]LB[pe:A]C[patrickb: The first truly *bad* move. This lets white crawl out and through b's territory when he plays atari at 'A'. Better for b to play at 'A' himself and build a large area on the left. You really have to stive to keep your opponent contained it at least one direction when possible.]

patrickb: I'm not so sure. B is already behind if he can't invade the large w area at the bottom, so he has to try something...]
;W[df]TR[ch]C[patrickb: if you're going to play the marked stone, you need to connect it to something now.]
;B[ef];W[dh];B[fj];W[gk];B[fk];W[fl];B[cq]C[I was looking to see if there was anyway to make life in this corner by owning the 3,3 and 4,4 spots

patrickb: at this point, no. w is too strong in this area.]

[dp][ep][fp][jp][lp][aq][cq][hq][iq][jq][kq][mq][cr][mr]C[I though the space at the top was safe...

patrickb: yes, a problem. The game is really already over. b has no appreciable territory, and all of the marked b stones are dead. The real source of the problem in this game was two-fold:
1. You let white dictate the pace of the game, by playing relatively vague moves that both didn't accomplish as much as it might have seemed, and didn't put any pressure on white
2. You didn't connect your stones together. Mainly, you just need more experience in the tactics of the game and making two eyes, and how much space it takes to do so. This is something that is best gained through playing more, perhaps on smaller board, like 13x13. I'd suggest getting on one of the many go servers (KGS, IGS, NNGS, etc.) and trying your luck there either on full-sized boards or smaller boards. It's not uncommon to find people that would be willing to help on these servers. If you're on KGS, you can ask me (patrickb) for help if I'm on, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.]

;W[ki];B[jh]C[I leant quite during the time I was playing this game which quite often left me feeling like I had arrived part way through a game which had been poorly played in the opening game.

My main problem seems to be playing lots of small groups all over the board which leave lots of openings for attack.

patrickb: Like I said earlier, this isn't exactly the problem. You really have to strive to keep your own groups connected and your opponent's seperated. Connecting groups together is very important. If you strike into your opponent's area, you need to have a plan to get enogh space to make two eyes or to connect to another group that's already alive.

Building eye space is also something I am poor at as I never manage to go about it in a manner which is not easily countered. How can I improve that?

patrickb: Solving life and death problems is probably a good idea. "Graded Go Problems for Beginners, volume 2" is a good book for this, as is the website "www.goproblems.com"

Good luck and let me know if you ahve any questions I can answer.
