AB[pd][dp][dd]C[To the reviewer:
My name is Barry.  I am an older beginner.  I am 9k on NNGS and 17k on IGS, although I don't play there often.  This game was played on WING where I am a 13k.
I am especially interested in your comments about the fuseki and joseki's that would have been better.
I have put in a few variations and added some comments on where I would like some direction.
Thanks for your help.];W[pp];B[nq];W[qn];B[lp]LB[jp:A][oq:B]
[np:C]C[--- This extension is too narrow.  Joseki calls for  'A'.  White can punish black by playing the white 'B' black 'C' sequence.  After that you can easily see the over-concentration of black stones.  A go proverb says ' two stones call for a 3 point extension.'  In this case you have a two-stone group (O3, O4) and yet you are extending one point (M4) only.']
;W[hp]TR[pr]MA[hq]LB[jp:B][fp:A]C[I played at q2, but I think that h3 may have been better. see var

--- There is no need to make contact right away.  The two black stones on the right are safe because 'B' and Q2 are miai.  For example, if white plays Q2, black can play 'B' to form a base.    Play 'A' to deny white the chance to approach the corner.  The white stone on H4 is on the 4th line, so it isn't easy to attack it.  Wait until you have done your homework (black has built some thickness in the surrounding) prior to the attack.

I have also put in some comments in your variation.]
(;B[pr];W[qq];B[fp];W[hq]C[--- This is a bad move for white.  He makes his group heavy.]
;B[jq];W[eq]C[I think that instead of blocking e4, I should ahve played d3.  see var.

--- Blocking at e4 is fine.  The plan is to gain thickness while white gets territory.  Blocking at d3 will create cutting points.]

(;B[ep];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo]TR[cn]MA[bn]C[My next move was at the triangle, but I think I should have moved at b6 and tried to capture the corner.  (see Var)

--- Yes, b6 is much better.  I also put in some comments in your variation.]

(;B[cn];W[bn];B[cr]LB[cm:A][dm:B][dl:C]C[--- 'A' is urgent.  If white gets to play this point, he hanes at the head of the two black stones, which gives black bad shape.  It's then followed by black 'B' and white 'C', making black extremely over-concentrated.]
;W[br];B[dr];W[bs]LB[cm:A]C[--- White misses the urgent point of 'A'.]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[gn]LB[cl:A][dl:B][dk:C]C[--- It's fine to put pressure on white's two stones.  Just keep in mind that black is supposed to extend at 'A'.  After the attack, black need to to come back and play 'A'.  Otherwise, the white 'A', black 'B' white 'C' sequence is painful for black.]
;W[jp];B[kp];W[jo];B[in];W[jn];B[im]LB[jm:A][hm:B]C[--- Hane at 'A'.  If white cuts, atari at 'B'.]
;W[ln];B[bl]LB[cl:A]C[--- This is thin, leaving bad aji.  'A' is thicker.  Please see my variation of how white can exploit this aji.]

(;W[dj];B[ck];W[cf]C[--- This extension is too thin for white.  Black has lots of power in the lower left.]
;B[ch]C[Would there have been a better way of dealing with his loose invasion?

Yes, see my comments later.];W[gj]
(;B[cj]C[--- Don't worry about connection.  Black has more power.  Please see my variation of how to attack.]
;W[qf]TR[nc]C[My next move was at the triangle.  Would a pincer  at r12 been better?

The game move is better.  Please see my variation about the pincer.]

(;B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[hd];B[qi]LB[qh:A]C[--- Good.  Punish white because he is supposed to play a move here.  'A' is slighter better because it puts more pressure on the two white stones.]
;W[ef];B[fe];W[cd]C[I ended up letting white have the corner, although I don't think I made good use of the influence.

---  Please see my comments later.];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cg]
;B[dg];W[dc];B[ec];W[cc]
(;B[fg]LB[jd:A][ed:B]C[--- This is slack.  Attack at 'A'.  Please see variation of how to deal with the cut at 'B'.]
;W[kc];B[ql]LB[pg:A]TR[hd][kc]C[--- Attack at 'A'.  Even if white lives, black will form a thick wall which can then be used to attack the two marked stones.]

;W[pf];B[nf];W[og];B[ok];W[ke];B[om]TR[dj][gj]SQ[ln][jn][jo]
[jp][hp][hq]CR[qn][pp][qq]C[In retrospect I should have tried to cut off his middle group, but at the time I wasn't sure I could kill and wanted to solidify my stones on the rigth hand side.  Any thoughts?

--- This is fine.  With this development white now has three weak groups.]
;W[hg];B[hh]TR[ln][jn][jo][jp][hp][hq]SQ[qn][pp][qq]LB[qr:A]
[rr:B][rp:C][ij:D]C[--- The upper white group is reasonably strrong.  I would expect white to ignore your move and jump out at 'D'.  The two lower white groups have been separated.  Play the 'A' to 'C' sequence as shown in an earlier variation to steal white's base.  With two floating groups, white might lose one of them.]
;W[gh];B[gg];W[hi];B[ih];W[ii];B[ig];W[hf];B[fh];W[gi];B[ji]
LB[kh:A]C[--- 'A' is better.];W[jj];B[lg]LB[ki:A][kg:B]C[--- Normally black extends at 'A' but a peep by white at 'B' destroys black's shape.  Still, jumping to 'B' is better than the game move.]
;W[ki];B[if];W[ie];B[gf];W[he];B[kg]TR[lg]C[--- Earlier you play the triangle stone.  But if we switch the sequence and play the game move first, you wouldn't play the triangle stone now.  This shows the inefficiency of the earlier move (triangle stone).]

;W[ib];B[ga]LB[fa:A]C[--- 'A' is slighter better, creating the option of capturing the two white stones later.]

;W[lc];B[le];W[jf];B[jg];W[je];B[kh]TR[jh]C[--- This is a pass.  Capturing the marked stone doesn't have any effect to the white's center group.]
;W[jm];B[li];W[ji]LB[lj:A][kj:B]C[--- White should block at 'A'.  If black captures, white simply connects at 'B'.]
;B[ej]LB[fk:A]C[--- 'A' is better.  It provides better protection of the lower territoriy.]

White has some thickness here because of the H4 and J4 stones (the group can run out to the center very easily), so attacking white isn't the correct strategy.

Play 'A' to stablizie the bottom black group.  Normally white would respond at 'B' as part of the joseki, and black gains sente.  Sometimes white may tenuki, and then 'C' becomes a good point for black.  So either black gains sente or he has a good move at 'C' later.  Please see my variation explaining why 'C' is a good point.]
