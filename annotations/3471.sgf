AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[This is a disaster of a game. I was matched against a 4 kyu in a Little Golem monthly cup tournament. Why do I submit to the abuse?

----------
Hi, Edward. I'm Bob (SirBowen on KGS/IGS), ~12k. I'll preface my comments with "SB:"

I would ask the same question you do...

Even after adjusting for a 9-stone handicap your opponent is still 8 stones stronger than you. Of course it's going to be a disaster! You'll be blown out of the water and never even know why.

Considering the difference in levels, most of the questions you call out are probably too specific to really answer usefully.

But there are still general things to say about the game, and I'll pass them along in hopes that you'll find them helpful.

I would strongly suggest, though, that you stick with even games (after handicap adjustment). You'll find them more enjoyable and more educational.]
;W[qf];B[pg]MA[qh][qd][of]C[SB: OK. Here's the first general thing...

When someone invades your moyo (and in a 9-stone game, the whole board starts out as your moyo), don't go near the weak stones.

Rather, attack them from a distance. Consider one of the X points instead.

You may feel like this is being too easy on White, but you have to remember two things:

1) If you get too close, you actually help weak stones by giving them something to "grab on" to. It's a little like jiu-jitsu, where a physically weaker combatant can get some leverage on a larger one. (Conversely, contact can be great when you're defending).

2) The main goal of attacking is only rarely to kill the group - there are just too many ways for it to live. Rather, you use attacks to keep them busy while you get some other advantage. Notice how the X's help you build your surrounding positions stronger.]
;W[pf];B[of]MA[og]C[SB: ...and here's the second general thing.

Be very careful with leaving cutting points. I would almost go so far as to say NOT to leave cutting points, UNLESS you can specifically read out that you can survive a cut there. That might be a little too strict of a statement, but just be aware that cutting points will come back to bite you again and again. X would have been better.

On a somewhat related note: in the email where you submitted the game, you say that you've been trying to get more aggressive against stronger players. In general, though, being aggressive just gives them more openings to use their better strategic skills against you.

This is, indeed, an aggressive move, but when playing Black in a handicap game you'll mostly want to play solidly to turn your handicap lead into territory in the simplest manner. It's White who needs to be aggressive and introduce complexity into the game.

Anyway, you've made two moves so far and I've presented two principles. We'll mainly see these two things over and over.]
;W[oe]CR[ne]C[I choose A, but B or possibly at the circle would have been better.

-------
SB: Your letter marks didn't show up in my viewer, sorry. So I don't know where "B" was.

But circle would be right out, as it creates even more cutting points.]

(;B[pe]MA[og]C[I think this was a mistake.

----------
SB: Yes, this goes back to the principle about cutting points.

You had a chance on this move to cover the cutting point you left previously. X would be the simplest way.

See the variation for how this might have worked out.];W[og]
C[Because now I am cut into three groups, one in atari.

----------
SB: Yes, now he's doing his jiu-jitsu on you. In the following moves you struggle as best you can, but it all really started from your first two moves, when you got too close to him and left cutting points.]
;B[od];W[nf]C[And now he has separated my corner from my side and has influence toward the center.]
;B[qe]C[Defensive.  What would have been more aggressive?  Did I have a better move?

-----
SB: Defense is called for here, since you're cut apart. But this side doesn't need it as much as the weaker stone on the other side.]
;W[rf];B[ne];W[of];B[qg];W[ql];B[qn]C[I never know whether it is better to respond high or low. I prefer low only because it is better for making territory.  How do I decide?

----------
SB: This move is good. Not touching the invader, low and secure.

I wouldn't worry about the more arcane aspects of the "influence vs. territory" balance just now.]
;W[ol]SQ[qg][pg][pj]C[Of course he runs.

-----
SB: Yes, but don't miss the fact that he's simultaneously counter-attacking your marked group, which is now trapped between his two positions.]
;B[ml]MA[nj]C[SB: So, your marked group should also run for safety, say at X. This saves your group and puts pressure on his group to run some more.]
;W[nk]C[SB: Now, he's maneuvering around your block, in the direction of your weak, increasingly trapped group.]
;B[mj]SQ[ll][lj]MA[mk]C[SB: And, back to the cutting points topic (ignoring your trapped group for a moment)...

You (correctly) didn't approach White this time, but White's gradually approached you - so the same principle apply. Make solid moves that can't be cut apart. This move is actually pre-peeped, so that White could push between your stones (X). If you try to block you create two cutting points (square). Dangerous.]
;W[nj];B[ni]SQ[ll][lj][mi]C[SB: And a new cutting point...]
;W[oi]C[I want to keep him from connecting at P12, but it is inevitable. I play at  P12, which is a mistake.  Would P10 have been better?]

(;B[oh]SQ[nh][mi][ll][lj]C[SB: ...and even more cutting points.

This one has the further flaw of presenting a double-atari point (which he uses next), but that's just a side effect of the general problem of having too many weaknesses.

Once again, don't try so hard to "go for the kill", especially against stronger players. Just be happy to chase them around while building up your surrounding positions.]
;W[nh]C[bad move on my part.];B[ph];W[mi];B[qc]MA[mk]C[Totally defensive.  I figure I am going to lose and lose badly, but I will at least hold this one corner.

-----
SB: Again, don't think of "defensive" as necessarily bad. You can only attack from a position of strength. But as defensive moves, your cutting points need attention worse (X).]
;W[fc];B[gd];W[fd];B[fe];W[gc];B[ec];W[ge];B[hd];W[ee];B[ff]
;W[ed];B[hf];W[dc]C[Now my corner is in big trouble.];B[cc]
;W[eb];B[de];W[df]
(;B[cg]MA[cf]C[SB: This move is overextended because White has already half-cut the knight's-move link. X would have given you the room you need for your corner group (especially since White would then need to protect cutting points now.]
;W[cf];B[cd];W[cb]TR[df][cf]SQ[ef]C[Dead.  Could this group have been saved?  Or was it doomed 20 moves ago?  :)

-----
SB: Oddly enough, it's not completely dead yet. The reason is that White has a nasty cutting point (square).

He either needs to spend a move to defend  it, or let you cut it and then make sure his triangle group survives.

Still, it's a tough fight for you and it makes sense to just give up on the corner and take an outside position in exchange.]
;B[ac];W[bb];B[ef];W[dg];B[be];W[bf];B[ch]C[SB: Now that you've lost the corner, the next few moves are a reasonable way to save the outside stone. But remember it was only one stone; there are a lot of more valuable things to do on the board. 

As a general suggestion, after a close-in fight is settled (win or lose), take a second to pull back and see how the board looks. Otherwise it's too easy to get your attention focused in that area and miss larger things.]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[fh];B[gi];W[ej]
(;B[ei]C[SB: This leaves cutting points again. See variations...]
;W[di];B[fi]TR[ei]C[This sequence (B's last 10 moves or so) is a mystery to me.  What was I thinking?

-----
SB: Actually, it was only the triangle move that backfired. Now you have to deal with White's jiu-jitsu as best you can.]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[bi];W[cl];B[bk];W[cm];B[co]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[SB: Good response.];W[no];B[nm];W[po];B[qo];W[pq]
;B[qq];W[op];B[qp];W[om];B[on]C[SB: Hopefully the cutting-point alarm is starting to go off at this point.

Actually, this was a good try, and might have worked except for the weaknesses that were left in this area way back from move 18 or so. This emphasises that the benefits of strong connections may not be immediately obvious.]
;W[nn];B[pn];W[mm];B[nl];W[ll];B[mk];W[lj];B[oo];W[hq];B[fq]
;W[ho];B[hp]C[This was a "what the heck - I am going to lose anyway" move.]
;W[gp];B[ip];W[gq];B[fr];W[hn]MA[jn]C[I probably should have played down at J3.  Maybe cut at G5.  Instead I played G8.

-----
SB: Actually, you would probably do best to try to run out with X. You're pretty deep in, but there're some White weaknesses on both sides of you that you can take advantage of. (See new variation on the next move.)

You might have made it out or, if not, created enough room inside your group for eyes.]

(;B[gl];W[fm];B[il];W[jn];B[lc];W[fg];B[gf];W[ic];B[jc]C[At this point, I am feeling good about my hold on the bottom left corner, a little of the bottom right (one eye already!), and the top right.  I feel that I have the beginnings of a moyo developing down the center. W will soon take care of these illusions.

-----
SB: Actually, from this point on I'm not sure there's much to say. You were simply hoodwinked by playing someone who's 17 stones stronger than you.

At this poin you have to count the full difference between your rank and his, since the handicap lead has been erased (actually I'd say since about move 65.) There's simply not much you could have done.]

;W[ap];B[cp];W[br]C[I shoulda played b2.];B[cr];W[fs]C[The second line always gets me. E3 might have been better, but I played E1.

-----
SB: Actually your group is now officially dead - there's no way to save it against White's correct play.

But, again, it's because you were attacked by someone who could see it this far in advance. someone more your level probably couldn't have read out the necessary sequences.]

;W[lb];C[At this point I resign because I count, and there is no point in continuing.  I am going to lose by 150 stones or so even if W plays blindfolded.  I'm at a point where I feel like I cannot see the right moves.  Nothing seems to work right.  Am I making any consistent errors in this game that you can see?  Thanks, Edward Hammerbeck]
