Pajaro: Hi. This is my first review for the GTL. I'll try to do my best to explain what happened here. My comments begin with pajaro, my nick in IGS.]
;W[cd];B[gg]C[How do I attack the centre? It always ends to be the case that my territory is along the edges and I end up with nothing in the center.

Pajaro: You **must not** attack the center. This is very important. The points are in the corners, then the edges and then the centre. In a small board, this is more true. So it is natural that you end with no territoy in the center. This is like this for your opponent, too.
Your move here is ok.];W[ec]
(;B[fe]C[Is F6 better?

Pajaro: I think this move is ok.  Look at the var how F6 looks like.]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[be]
(;B[bf]C[Is D4 better?

Pajaro: No, this is ok. You protect the corner and stop white. Look at D4.]
;W[df]C[I wasn't quite sure how to answer this. I wanted to avoid getting cut-off from my stones on the right side so I played D3. But this resulted in my stones on C3 and B4 getting slaughtered. Perhaps the problem elsewhere :-).]
;B[dg];W[ef]
(;B[eg]C[Should I have played F3 instead?

Pajaro: I think this is ok. F3 could lead to trouble.];W[ff]

(;B[fg]C[G4 better?

Pajaro. Yes. Now you have no other way to stop white. He has been able to cut you, so G4 was ver important.]
;W[gf];B[hf]C[Pajaro: At this point, your C6 group was already safe, but, what about the G8 group? This H4 just drives white towards your weak group. Instead, you must always push from the weak to the strong side.]
;W[he]
(;B[ge]C[Should I have connected at H3 instead?

Pajaro: I think no. Maybe H6 would be better. The H4 stone is small. You don't need it to live, but your upper group is still in danger.]
;W[hg]C[Is there any way now to salvage the stones in top right? I ended up losing all the stones I put there. Also is there anything I can do to push into white's territory - I seem to be on the defensive all the time.]
;B[hh];W[if];B[ih]C[Pajaro: You are protecting very little, and forgetting the important group.]
;W[hd];B[gd]C[Pajaro: Again, these two stones aren't important.]
;W[hc];B[hb];W[ib];B[ha];W[ee];B[ce]C[I was trying to save my stones by cutting white off. It didn't quite work.]

C[Pajaro: Well, you lost because:
- You weren't connected.
- You took care of small stones, forgetting the important ones.
- One of your groups was killed while you could still have saved it.]
