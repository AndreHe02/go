C[Hello. :-) I think that i should have won this game. I allowed what looked like an unreasonable invasion to live and it cost me the game. Any help on how I could have killed the invasion or at least lessened the pain it caused would be greatly appreciated. Also, any general comments are always great. Thank you for your time and help ~Erithid

Brodie: Hello, I've added some general comments, and quite a few variations on that invasion.  I hope they help.]

;B[dj];W[ch];B[bm];W[bl];B[am];W[al]C[Brodie: There hasn't been a move in a long while which actually accomplishes anything.  Black has played a lot of small forcing plays, which would be rather difficult to ignore.

Black A7 however is a very small move!  Black should invade the top.

One thing for you to work on is trying to ignore your opponents.  Who says they know where the best place to play is?  It's very important to try to avoid small moves and be the first to play in important areas of the board. 

White E17 would be a very good play.  Almost any play along the top side would be great here!]
;B[bo];W[ck]C[Brodie:  More overplay to avoid. Black can't really do anything to you there.]
;B[jh];W[gh]C[Brodie:  pretty good, it's the right idea.  I think it's a little too close to the black wall though.  E13 perhaps?]
;B[ji];W[kh]C[Brodie: this is another fairly small move.... I think E17 now would be more effective, E13 looks interesting as well]
;B[jg];W[if];B[fh];W[fg]
(;B[eh]C[Brodie:  This works out extremely well for white.   Black shouldn't be so passive here.  Black has a wall, and white has a stone.  That means that fighting is a good thing for black.  He should probably cut at G12 (agressive) instead of extending (passive).  

If you have something, use it.  ^_^];W[eg];B[dh];W[dg];B[hg]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[gf];B[ig]C[Brodie: Again,  black lets white off easy.  Why not invade now? or extend to L14 and start eating up territory?? J13 is too small]
;W[jf];B[kg];W[lf];B[mg];W[lg];B[mh];W[mf];B[ni];W[ng]C[Brodie:  not a necessary move.  (E17!?)]
;B[kf];W[ke];B[ec]TR[je][ff][cg]C[I think that I should have been able to kill this invasion. Up until now i was rather ahead I think. I wish that I could have played here earlier. I did not know how to stop this and eventually started making dumb mistakes.

Brodie:  First of all, I think it would have been a lot simpler to simply play at E17 first - you've had plenty of opportunities to.  However, for the most part you're right, I think this invasion can be killed.  There are a few cutting points,  C13 and F14, which make me a little nervous....]
;W[dc]C[I didnt want b to get corner, though now that i think abt it, may have been ebtter if i just gave it up.

Brodie: This looks okay.  Usually  it's not the best idea to touch stones, so C17 comes to mind.  Here I think D17,as you played, is either best, or at least equally playable.]
;B[eb]
(;W[db]C[Brodie:  One possibility is to play at G18 and try to take the right side away from black.  (see variation )]
;B[hb]C[Brodie: I think the best play here is J18.  First, it pushes black towards the center, and you have a rather large wall there.  There isn't as much room to make eyes that way.  An extra point or two along the top side could help a lot.

Secondly, if black was to live, you'd still be protecting most of the top right! 

(see variations)]

;W[ia];B[ha];W[ka]C[dumb i know it was, i was hoping he would connect, but really it was just dumb

Brodie: yeah, other than this move, you'd have at least sealed black in! L18 would do about the same thing but with no risk ;)]

Brodie:  I think the biggest thing you have to work on still, is thinking big.  Try to ignore your opponent frequently, and beat them to the bigger moves.  I'm still constantly trying to make less small moves, and make more of my moves really count.  It's certainly one of the most important things to get through your head. 

as for trying to kill of an invasion.  An important thing to try to do is play inside of the group and start destroying eyespace early!  Just throw stones somewhere inside of the enemy group.  Estimating what shape the group will end up, and where it will make eyes would help.  Also, if you have a wall that you can push the group into, all the better!  Using the G14 group might have helped you a lot.

Good luck!])
