siegoman : Thank you for the review, my comments marked with S:

S: I won, but by accident.  There are a few battles that I got lucky on, a couple attacks that were planned.  In general I'm looking for help in forming a strategy, getting long term goals for play.

seeking advice with:
- how to see a strategy or flow of stones
- when to let stones go
- how to tell if a move is really sente
- how to know when to stop and look over the entire board.

Tomas: 6kyu KGS reviewing with T:

T: I think the first question is most important, cause you tend to help you're opponent by making a plan only for your own stones. 

T: The concept of sente is diificult cause it's very relative. Really sente doesn't exist I think. I think the best thing to learn about sente, is that you should not only look at the size of a move, but also at the size of the follow-up.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[gp];W[dm]
;B[jq];W[po];B[qo];W[qp]C[S: this confused me, I took a chance and cut.

T: that seems correct, and b ends much better in this sequence]
;B[pp];W[rp];B[oo]C[S: again, guessing, now at least I am looking to protect lower edge
T: Looks very good];W[qq];B[pn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[ro];W[hq]
LB[hp:A]C[S: wasn't sure to contact, ignore or separate from corner, as far as I could read separate from corner.

T: you first need to punish w's tenuki. Remember the basic corner shapes like "4-stone L is dead as it stands". That means that if you make it a L, you kill

T: I think that A is better here then your move cause along with the right side, b gets a lot of influence to the centre. w's gain is only a few points]

(;B[fr];W[hn]C[T: this is a strange play by w cause with b h4 b gets a lot of territory]
;B[jo];W[jd]C[S: got mixed up here, decided on protecting corner and right side.  not confident in my reply.

T: it's ok];B[qe];W[oc]C[S: P17 seems like a thank you move that gives me back sente.

T: it is gote but very big, so not so bad];B[pc];W[mc];B[cf]
C[T: Q11 bigger now it hink because it works as an extension for both corners]
;W[fd];B[ck]C[S: thought of sacrificing C14 to pressure corner, maybe a bit too creative / risky

T: This is ok, but when you're playing so lighly you should not hesitate to sacrifice]
;W[ci];B[ek];W[dk]LB[dj:A]TR[ci]C[T: Here I think A leads to a better result cause it makes the marked stone weak]

(;B[dl];W[dj]LB[cl:A][el:B]TR[ck]C[T: Here you need to choose were you want w to cut. You're play A is ok, but then you need to make life on the side. If you want to sacrifice the marked stone and keep w small, you should play B. I think the last option is better (see var) but in the game you didn't seem to make any choice.

T: this seems to be one a crucial point yet unfortunatly b comes out pretty weak.]

(;B[cl];W[el]
(;B[fl]C[S: I forgot my plan to attack corner and cut on the wrong side.

T: Yes, big mistake. Turns the game around cause now w gets very strong on the side]
;W[em];B[ej];W[ei];B[fm]TR[ej][ek][fl]C[T: At this point there is not much to gain with the marked group so tenuki might be better. You don't have to see that as a sacrifice. That disicion might come later. For now, the stones are just not much use and your move doesn;t gain much]
;W[fn];B[gn]CR[ck][cl][dl]LB[ef:B][gj:A]TR[ej][ek][fl][fm]C[S: plan: sacrifice G6 to play E6, D6, C6 in sente, but then I realized after playing that F9 would cut the attacking groups after G6 is taken.  Seems like some prep moves are needed for the G6 sac to work, but my center is so weak right now.  by playing G6 now it weakened me.

S: prep moves I see:
B C 10
B F 10

T: More general: Your triangled stones are weak and your circled stones are as good as dead. Attacking with such weak groups is usually not good. Better play something like A or B to get some strength. 
I think w is taking the lead now

C10 doesn't seem good cause you lose the aji of d12 peep.
F10 is not se good shape. (A better)];W[gm];B[gl];W[go]
(;B[if]LB[hl:A]C[S: ladder breaker for E10

T: no good. You should not worry about direct capturing but more about strength. A Move at A will give you this (see vars)]
;W[fi];B[gj];W[hl];B[gk];W[fj]LB[ij:A]C[S: was this a good time to treat E10 lightly?  they seem to have some aji to cut with C8 group

T: As shown in mv 53, the aji is pretty much gone since H8. You should definitly sacrifice, cause otherwise you're group gets very heavy. Consider A.]
;B[fk];W[hi];B[hk];W[ik];B[il];W[hm];B[ij];W[jk];B[hj];W[jh]
C[S: I felt really bad at this point.  My plan backfired and I don't see hope of escaping.  This heavy group of black stones, I got tunnel vision trying to keep it alive.  seemed I could escape to top, but not much space for eyes.  when do you know to let a group go?

T: When you're in doubt, as i would be at this point. It's not a bad thing to let go, cause you're opponent probably doesn;t want to waste another move there. This means that you can retry later in the game when the surroundings have changed.
I think w has a easy kill here ( see var)];B[ii];W[ih];B[gi]

(;W[hh];B[gh];W[gg];B[fh];W[eh];B[fg];W[ff];B[eg];W[dg];B[ef]
;W[gf];B[df];W[cg]C[T: As you can see w gets a very big top now, and is leading big even if b manages to survive.]
;B[di];W[dh];B[cj]C[S: my greed said try to get all them stones, may have cost me the group.
T: This move is excellent, but for some reason you don't capture the next move??]
;W[bf];B[be];W[bh];B[cd]C[S: living in the corner seemed more likely than on the edge, but I did not follow up.]
;W[di]C[S: during the game I thought the large black cluster is now ok and I escaped tunnel vision to look at the board.  probably should have D17 first to try and live in corner.

T: Definitly, you were very lucky...];B[hp];W[cm];B[qi]C[S: finally I take a large point, D17 however seems more urgent.
T: Yes];W[kl];B[jm];W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[ae];B[ad];W[af]
;B[hg]LB[jf:A]C[S: I can get one eye in the corner, my only hope seems to be killing the J12 group

T: ?? even though you some how survive, the b monster is  very dead, H13 is a thank you, dead in gote kind of move. w can just take it with A]
;W[ee];B[ce];W[kf]C[S: I was fortunate that W K11 did not come now.

T: I think w should have played m12 if he wans to be sure becuase it also expands his territory]
;B[ji];W[kh]C[S: L12 was another help for me.];B[ki];W[li];B[lj]
C[S: lucky me, M10 is high enough to wrap around K9

T: I don't think it is (see var...];W[kj]
(;B[lk];W[jl];B[im]
(;W[lm];B[nl]C[S: directing the M7 into my thickness];W[jn]

;B[ln];W[mn];B[lo];W[mo];B[lp];W[ll];B[kk]C[S: The large bulky mess of eyeless stones has escaped.  up until this point I was ready to resign.  Now I see some territory on the bottom, and potential on the right.]
;W[mk];B[mj];W[nj];B[mi];W[ml];B[nm];W[mm];B[nk];W[lh];B[jj]
C[S: here I got paranoid, wasted a move

T: Not too paranoid. It would get very dangarous i think with only one lib ahead]
;W[nh];B[ni];W[oi];B[mh];W[mg];B[oj];W[og];B[pi];W[qg]C[S: that wasted move cut deep]
;B[lf]C[S: I was upset and burned another move.  removing the possibility of B:O14 in the future]

C[S: mistake, B O14 would have helped threten O13];W[md];B[nf]
;W[ke];B[of];W[ng];B[hf]C[S: wasted move, lacked a plan.];W[oe]
;B[ge]C[S: lacking a strategy I looked to directly kill E15 group]
;W[fe];B[bm]C[S: found something to shoot for, surround D7 a bit, sacrifice a stone at B3 to build up D4 and cut at E6.  maybe unreasonable.]
;W[bn];B[al];W[bj];B[bk];W[aj];B[bq];W[cr];B[dp];W[bp];B[en]
C[S: I got lucky and all the prep work paid off.

;B[fs];W[ld];B[pe];W[me];B[ca]C[S: again, I lacked any plan, and this moved removed a potential attacking point from the inside.  how do you form plans in situations like this?

T: ThThe game is in endgame now, and this move is very big. I don't think you can invade.]
;W[db];B[hc]C[S: this attempt to live failed, perhaps it is rude to try.

T: I don;t think it is rude but it is pretty useless.];W[gd]
;B[fb];W[ec]
(;B[eb]C[S: mistake, BE19, BE18 would have kept sente, and started one solid end.  then F17 threatens to collapse an eye.]
;W[ba];B[jb];W[da];B[id]C[S: mistake, B H 16 connects in ko and prevents G15 eye.]
;W[he]C[S: here I couldn't decide between saving the stones or playing B H16 to threaten to save them to get more eye space.  I think I chose wrong.]
;B[ie];W[hd]C[S: at this point the F16 group is alive, it does not appear possible to form two eyes.  lost my chance to live on top.]
;B[jc];W[ic];B[ib];W[kb];B[fc]C[S: threatening to remove E16 eye bought me a move, but I squandered it, thought I had it made after this move.]

T: no life there. better start taking the big endgame points]

;W[gb];B[gc];W[ga];B[mb];W[nb]C[S: white could have ignored.]
;B[mp];W[os];B[nr]C[S: I was thinking about how to kill corner, got lost and made a couple pass moves.  After the bad result up top I was upset and made some bad moves.]

C[ black + 17.5

T: The most important part of the game is around move 40. There you made some mistakes that let to the chase of you're dragon. It is hard to make strategic dicisions when you're being chased. The territories where kind of formed automaticly.

In general I think you should not worry too much about a plan. Having a plan is usually not a good thing in Go. 

When considering sacrifice, you should also consider what you're opponent will gain if you try to get out. The entire upper region was given for free by you're opponent by you're escape. 

You're opponent made the same mistake attacking you. Also he could have killed (many times), he should not play all the weak b7 stones, to do so. This way you got you're big territory for free also.
If w would have let you live, b would have a very hard game.

You're local plays seem pretty strong, (apart from lower right), but instead of having a plan, you should look at how sequences build walls and thereby give and take territory.]
