C[My (Black, zwoelefant) strength: 12k* on IGS (new ranking system)

During the game I had the feeling that White was missing a lot of big points. So I was very astonished, that I lost the game. Is my feeling right, that White missed big points? When this is true: Did I also miss a lot of big points? Where have I lost all the points White didn't pick up?
I have also made some statements what I was thinking of while playing and what I am thinking now. Can you please also comment my comments?

NM: Hello, i will review your game, my name is Neil Mclean.
it was an interesting game and a good one to review. Both players made many mistakes but this is to be expected at 12kyu level, i make many mistakes too but 5kyu mistakes ^^.

You ask a lot of questions which is very good, i will try to answer them all as best I can.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo]C[you could also try e3, e4, but r5 is good too]
;W[nc]C[zwoelefant: I think it would be better for white to play around J3?

NM: perhps you are right, o17 is big move too, i cannot say which is better]

(;B[kc]C[zwoelefant: I decided to attack on this side, so maybe to get hold of the whole right side.

NM:yes r14 would mean black has only one side and white is faster developed, not sure if m17 better than l17, i dont know this pincer very well]

(;W[pb]C[NM:i feel this is not joseki and is wrong, white should jump out to o15 or r17 now]
;B[qc];W[ne];B[pf]
(;W[ld]C[zwoelefant: I expected White to play around H17. Would have been H17 better for White?

NM:right, this move seems wrong,];B[hc];W[ce]
(;B[cj]C[NM: i think e3 or e4 is bigger move, also top is urgent for both so mybe o13

my feeling is to play at top since both black and white are unsettled, this is which power and influence can be won and is more urgent]
;W[lc]
(;B[iq]C[zwoelefant: now I get the big point at J3. Is maybe Q10 or R10 better?

NM: this is big move but ...
black has two weak groups and white r12 is big.
ok black can get c7 or c13 miai, but if white starts a splitting attack on the 2 groups then black will suffer.]

(;W[qj]
(;B[pi];W[qm];B[pj];W[qk];B[rl]C[zwoelefant: Now I think this is not the best move. Maybe it's better to play around F3 or C7? And if I want to play in this area, is maybe Q8 better?

(;B[mp]C[NM: mybe r11 is needed];W[qi];B[qh];W[rh];B[rg]C[zwoelefant: Maybe this one is better at R13? But I didn't want White to invade the corner. Would this be possible for White, if I played at R13?]
;W[ph];B[qg];W[oh]C[zwoelefant: okay, now I have realized, that my two black stones are in trouble

NM: yeah so this is terrible result for black
i would even consider tenuki now e3 and leave 2 stones as aji]

(;B[qn];W[rn];B[qp];W[rk]C[NM: tenuki here if your not going to follow up and deny 2 eyes,
but white should get 2 eye no problem , so e3 now or h15?

an idea is to attack white at top now, so r18 then e3];B[rp]
;W[sm];B[so]C[zwoelefant: I had the feeling, that white has to capture at T8, if he does not want to bring his whole group in troubles. Is  T4 now too early (maybe because, white could play maybe at O5) ?]

(;B[cg];W[od]C[zwoelefant: I think this is extremly small for White? Or was there any possibility to escape with the three stones around O13, or to bring them to another use?]
;B[eo]C[zwoelefant: Thought of closing White in and building towards a large moyo in the center

NM: nice idea, it seems a bit early yet beacuse of white jump at m7 or white k4 reduce, i would perhaps reinforce black at top st e17 or similiar]
;W[kq]MA[iq][mp]LB[jp:B][mr:C][mq:D]C[zwoelefant: I thought that there should be no way for white to live, but I think I played the wrong points?

there are many replies , some depend on ladders

B and A would be good choices]

(;B[is]C[zwoelefant: Now I think this was the big mistake. I didn't want White to get eyes at the bottom. But now I think if I wpuldn't have played at J1 White would have get at most one eye at the bottom? Is  it better to play J6 or maybe H6?

NM: j2 seems ok, k2 is bad shape, j6 is good, white should only get one eye at bottom if j6]

NM: i would reinforce this area a lot earlier in the game
black is not too bad since f12 helps black 
black could try d18, it is a move worth remembering against a 3-4 shimari

lets count now ...
w 68 b 62

and white is under attack at the top so white is ahead]

NM: i count w 15 ahead so bar a miracle black has lost the game.

this stems down to the play in the opening, where you tried to save q10 and mybe your attack on white l4 could have been better, trying to make moyo at e5 , l2 was very big also.

there are lots of big endgame moves for both now, for black, a4, a16, c18, s11,o5
for white, o1, b5, b14, j18, e18];W[es]C[o1 is sente for white,]

;W[bo]
(;B[eb]C[zwoelefant: Now I think, that maybe it would also have been possible to play D18? (see the variation)

i ahve shown lots of variations, d18 is the best move i think
a16 is sente though, you might also consider m2, b7 is still sente perhaps]

;W[bb];B[oo];W[gs];B[hs]C[zwoelefant: I considered this move for a while, because of the Ko at H2. Is H2 better?

since black is behind a ko might be his only chance, black needs all the points he can get, as to whether black has more ko threats well, it seems white has more, so mybe not wise to start ko]
;W[hr];B[fs];W[ki];B[lj];W[gs];B[gq];W[ir];B[fs];W[oi]C[zwoelefant: This is quite a big Ko thread, but I thought, that it is not so big as the whole corner. And I was sure to be able to get the corner. Is this right? I also think, that I would have had no big enough ko-threat after B-P10, W-G1.

this exchang is in blacks favour by about 15 points so this is why white almost lost the game]

as regards comments about comments , well ^^ mybe spotting urgent local moves over big moves is more valuable and securing groups quickly would help improve your game, 

there are many variations some good, some not so good, please you decide for yourself, they are just some moves that i experiemnted with. Sorry i cant be of more help
