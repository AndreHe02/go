AB[pp][pd][dp]C[Player's comments: I am playing black. There are some really bad mistakes, because it is a lower level play, I am just a beginner on the game, but I would like to ask you to mark huge and small mistakes, and also give some strategical remarks. I know no more than the basic terms in Go, I did not ever read any book or article. One last thing, the game did not really finish because of server problems, but I resigned, because I thought I was worse, I would like some comments about the result of the game, also. That is the first time I send a game to be reviewed, sorry if I did anything wrongly. I appreciate the atention.

Reviewer's comment:
The main problem black has in this game is a tendency to let white take the entire board while black is winning small local battles.  I think that if you keep in mind a larger portion of the board, you can easily gain three stone's strength.]
;W[ee]C[This is an odd play.  It is easy for black to take the corner away from white here.]
;B[pn]TR[cc][dc][cd][dd][ec][ce][jp][pj]C[This is a very slow move.  In the early stages of the opening, you should be more ambitious, taking corners and sides rather than small jumps like this.

I have marked a few moves that I would consider here as black. The big areas of the board are the unclaimed sides where it is easy to build a framework, and white's loosely-defended corner.]
;W[fq];B[fp];W[cn];B[gq];W[cp];B[fr]C[This stone is unimportant; wasting four moves to capture it allows white to take the entire left side.  Remember, go is about getting more territory than your opponent, not capturing more stones.]
;W[dj];B[eq];W[jc];B[dq]C[This is bad shape.  See http://senseis.xmp.net/?EmptyTriangle]
;W[co];B[cq];W[jp];B[bp]TR[cc][dc][ec][dd][ce][cd][qi][lq]C[This is an endgame-type move.  There are still VERY large sections of the board open (I have marked some better ideas).]
;W[ao];B[bq];W[bo];B[do];W[dn];B[eo];W[em];B[gp]C[Another empty triangle.]

;W[nq];B[ks];W[ql]C[This move is very big and should be responded to.]
;B[jr]C[Those stones could not escape, so taking them was a wasted move.]
;W[qn];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[or];W[qq];B[nr];W[qf]C[You should ALWAYS respond when your opponent approaches a corner.]

(;B[no]C[This is unnecessary.  The white stones cannot escape anyway. See the variation.]

;B[od];W[nb];B[re];W[qb]TR[og]C[Note that if white had played at the marked point instead, you would have been sealed out of the center, and white would have a lot of territory there.]

;W[kf];B[hf];W[je];B[gg]C[This shows you have some fighting skill locally.   That is good.]
;W[he];B[gi]TR[fh]C[Black should atari from the other side at the marked point.  If white plays out of atari, black has no way to save his stone.]
;W[fh];B[fi];W[gf];B[fg];W[hg]C[This is a terrible blunder.  In a closer game it would be game-ending.]
;B[eh];W[ii]C[White fills a dame here.];B[hf];W[ge];B[hg]TR[cc]
[cd]C[Be careful of the value of your moves.  This move is worth 1/2 a point.  A move in the top left corner at one of the marked points could be easily worth 20 points.]
;W[dh];B[ei];W[di];B[eg]C[Pushing like this makes the invasion of the top left more difficult because it forces white to strengthen her wall.]

;B[da]C[Black's group can be easily killed.];W[ac];B[ea];W[fb]
;B[fa]C[If black white continues to push along the first line like this, it will take black right into his wall.  Black has no good plays here; the game is effectively over.]

;W[hc];B[bb];W[ga];B[kc]C[This play is pointless; black cannot make eyes or capture.  Among stronger players this kind of move would be considered rude (but don't worry about it now).]

;B[cm];W[bm];B[cl]C[To reiterate, my suggestions for this player are:

1. Pay attention to large open areas of the board and not to capturing unimportant stones.

2. Don't make empty triangles.

3. Invade early, not after all the territory is settled.])
