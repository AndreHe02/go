AB[pd][dp]C[This is a game I play at qf of china.That software allow users connect to qf's server,china.com server,Japanese server & Korean server.It's a nice place to play Go.Myuser ID is mychew,but the name I register at GTL is xinhai.This is because of different user ID I use in differrent places.My rank at qf is 18k,because I just start to play that day.

I hope you can comment my game.Actually,at the end of game,I lost,but the opponent(one of my friends),zhonngyungb was disconnected ,so he lost(forfeit on time).But I can tell from the game that if he was nnot disconnected,the one who lost is me.

Anyway,please be kind to comment my game,thank you!

<Hello, xinhai.  I hope you'll find my review useful.  I'll be adding my comments in angle brackets, as here.

I put a summary comment at the very end of the game.

--edgy>];W[pp];B[qn]C[I think I should try at D16,is it correct?

<Usually, you'd like to play first in an unoccupied corner, but this isn't a _bad_ move.>]
;W[dd]
(;B[ph]LB[pf:a][qk:b][nq:c]C[This is a bad move I think,I can only try this if my right side is thick,right?

<The real problem is that you're making yourself thin; white could easily invade at 'a' or 'b'.    Also, since White made a move in an unoccupied corner instead of answering your approach in the lower right, you could attack there (by another approach at 'c', for example) instead of the move you played.>]
;W[nq]C[I give the opportunity to white to strengthen his corner.]
;B[rp]C[Is it too early for me to invade here?

<This looks OK.>];W[qq];B[oo]LB[qk:a][pl:b]C[<Interesting move.  'a'  or 'b' are the normal joseki, but here they seem a little flat.  Your move might help to make a moyo on the right, if White submits.>]
;W[qj]C[White invade my territory here and try to split my teritory into 2.

<Right, BUT you can also attack the invading stone to make territory.>]

(;B[ql]C[< It seems to me that you can do better.  See variation.>]
;W[rl];B[rk]C[Is this a wrong move?

<It's a good move.>];W[qk];B[pk]LB[rm:a]C[<THIS is a bad move, I think.  Instead, playing at 'a' to capture the White stone will leave White with an eyeless group drifting in the middle of your right side.>]
;W[qm];B[pl];W[rn];B[pm];W[rm]
(;B[qi]LB[rj:a]C[<This looks bad.  Maybe 'a' is better?  See variation.>]
;W[rj];B[pj]C[Is it worthy for me to play until stone20?Although I may build up my influence,but I can't maintain it until the end of game.You can see this by the stones following up.

<Well, I think Black could have played better before, but you can also use the thickness you have built here.>]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[ri];B[qg]LB[rh:a][dj:b][jd:c]C[<The more I look at the game, the more I think this is the worst move Black played.  It doesn't help Black on the right, and it gives White sente to take a big point elsewhere.

If Black is going to play on the right side at all, he should play at 'a' and block White in.

It might be even better to play elsewhere--'b' or 'c', for example.>]
;W[jd]C[I lost another nice place.

<No matter what you do in a game, your opponent will always get some big points!>]
;B[mc]LB[dj:a]C[<A play around 'a' or an approach in the top right looks better to me.  That way, White can't make a double-wing formation from the top left, and Black gets influence from both sides.>]
;W[qc]C[White keep on invading my corner.

<3-3 point invasions like this are standard--they're the first josekis to learn.  A stone on the 4-4 point is always liable to be invaded at the 3-3; so you don't play 4-4 for teritory, you play it for influence. >]

(;B[pb]LB[pc:a][qd:b][rh:c]MA[qi]C[I think this is the best sollution I can figure out.Can you point out better moves for me?

<It's usual to block at 'a' or 'b'.  Here, I think 'a' is better (see variation), though Black would be happier if the marked stone were at 'c',>]
;W[cn];B[fq]LB[ck:a]C[<It might be better to pincer around 'a'; then White doesn't get the double-wing framework he gets in the game.>]
;W[dj]C[White made a good move at the left side.

<White is starting to develop a moyo on the left, but he's still thin.  Also, if Black can take a move to play in the upper right, that would secure the corner for him.>]
;B[jp]LB[qd:a]C[I think this is the only good move I've made.

<It might be too slow.  An invasion on the right might be better.  But it is the last big point.

This is pretty much the end of the opening, so let's take stock:

White has about 25 points on the lower right and the right side, plus he has a moyo building on the left which is still thin, and hard to value.

Black doesn't really have any territory yet, but he can secure about 15-20 points in the top right with 'a'.  (This would be larger if R13 were at S12!)  Black has also sketched out an area in the lower left that should net him about 15 points.

Also, Black has tremendous thickness on the right side.

So, what should Black do?  Well, the general rule is to use thickness for fighting, so Black should invade White's moyo and fight!  (Or black coud build his own moyo and try to get White to fight, but I don't think that works here.)
>];W[en];B[gn]LB[cf:a]C[<This doesn't do much.  An approach on the upper left, say at 'a', seems bigger an more urgent.>]
;W[jj]LB[fj:a][jf:b]C[He grabs the chance to play at K10,after this move,I was under great attacks.This move led to my failure.

<I don't think this is such a great move for White.  The right and top are still very thin, and an invasion there would be helped by your thickness on the right.  Also, if you eventually cap White at 'a' and 'b', that stone at K10 will feel lonely.>]
;B[fl]C[Maybe it's good to try here,but I didn't think of his responses.

<This is not a bad idea, threatening to invade the right and starting to surround the K10 stone, but it does let White make himself thicker with his next move.>]
;W[dl];B[bo];W[gm];B[hl]LB[fn:a]C[Wrong move,right?

<Very bad move.  Black should cut White in two at 'a' and make him fight.>]
;W[fm];B[hm];W[hn]C[<I think this is an overplay.  White should just solidify the left side.>]
;B[go];W[in];B[io]LB[jm:a]C[<This looks bad. 'a' seems to cut off the White stones.

Even if it doesn't, in a running fight like this, it is often good to play your stones on the side where you're weaker, so you strengthen your weak group while attacking his. >]
;W[jm];B[nh]MA[fl][hl][hm]LB[jk:a][gi:b]C[I give up there first and try O12.

<I don't think Black can afford to do this.  If the marked stones die, White will have made a lot of territory and a of influence, and it will be hard then to invade the right or the top sides.

But if Black can cut off the White center group, he's in good shape.  Black should consider 'a' or 'b'.>]
;W[kl]C[White keeps on invading and enlarge his territory.

<Black is in bad trouble now, since this move makes it easier for White to either live or run out.>]
;B[lj]MA[fl][hl][hm]LB[gi:a][ek:b][fi:c]C[I try to stop him by playing here.

<This is not right.  It's the marked stones Black has to worry about.  I don't think Black can win if they die.  Black can try 'a', or maybe 'b' followed by 'c' if White connects.  Things are not easy for Black, but he might pull it off.

Always ask yourself 'how can I try to win', and make your plans according to that.>]
;W[fc]LB[hj:a][jh:b]C[<Very calm move!  I'd be inclined to play 'a' or 'b' to help the center group, though.>]
;B[jb]C[<This is not urgent.   The center is where the game will be decided.>]
;W[kj]C[I am too late now.

<White has been strengtening his weak group while you've been ignoring yours.>]
;B[lh]C[<Again, this isn't the important area.>];W[ic];B[kc]
;W[jg]C[No chances already.Seems white is going to win this game.

<It's difficult for Black, yes.>];B[kf];W[kg];B[lf];W[jf];B[je]
;W[ie];B[ke];W[re];B[qe];W[rd];B[rb]C[Is this a good move?

<Yes.  White should die.>];W[sg]
(;B[rf]C[I think Ican only try here,what do you think?

<No, this is bad.  There's a standard way of stopping this kind of link up, and you should learn it.  See variation.>]
;W[sf];B[rg];W[sh]C[<Now White is safe, and Black has taken a big loss.  I think Black's only chance is to live with the center group AND find tme to invade the left side or upper left corner.>]
;B[rh];W[pc];B[oc];W[od]
(;B[ne]C[Is this a good way to stop white?

<It doesn't work out too well, does it?  The variation seems better.>]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[qb];B[nb];W[pa];B[na]LB[oe:a]C[Is this good?

< It's very small.  How can Black win the game?  Only by living in the center or destroying White's territory on the left.  _That's_ where Black should play.

Even locally, 'a' is much bigger than the actual move.>];W[jr]
LB[ce:a][ch:b]C[<I think White should just calmly strengthen the left side, starting with 'a' or 'b'.>]
;B[iq];W[bn];B[co];W[ce]C[<That's better.  I don't think Black has any play for a win now.>]
;B[fj];W[hj]C[I shouln't have intrude there,it is too small for me to make up 2 eyes here.

<Well, that's right, but I can't blame you for trying, although even if Black lives, he's losing on territory.  But there's nothing else to do but resign.>]

OK, that's all my comments.  I'll put a summary at the end of the game.>]

<The main thing you need to work on is tactics.    Allowing White to live on the right at 14, leaving the right side open at 26,  failing to cut off the White stones with 49, and  letting White link up on the right around 71-75 were just basic tactical failures.  Try working a lot of basic tesuji problems, and pretty soon the right moves will just 'look right' in situations like that.

Also remember, if you've traded territory to get thickness, you shoul duse the thickness to fight!

Lastly, remember to have fun!  Everyone below dan level makes a lot of mistakes--don't beat yourself up about them, just try to make differnet mistakes next time!

Good luck and have fun!
