C[(magic)
Hi Steve.
I've marked your comments/questions with (Steve), and I will mark my own with (magic).
I will point out things on the road and there will be a summary at the end.
BTW, it is very good of you to have added your own comments, I think that it will help you get a better review.
Hopefully, you will find the review useful. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any more questions.

magic - pahle@iway.fr];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo];W[jd]LB[dj:a]
[jp:b]C[(magic)
Normally, white would play either 'a'(D10) here, completing his san-ren-sei (The three left side hoshi points), or 'b'(K4), extending towards the black shimari. (It's where black would like to play....)]
;B[pj]LB[jp:a][oc:b]C[(magic)
This is the wrong direction to extend to for black.
If he wants to extend he should play at 'a' (K10) (or some sort of approach in the lower left). Otherwise, completing his shimari with 'b' (P17) is the 'normal' move.
Extending would be bigger than completing the shimari, I'd say.]
;W[od]C[(magic)
I'm not sure whether white should want to do this or not. Locally, it makes sense, but globally, playing a ni-ren-sei (the two left side hoshi points) normally means that he wants to build a large moyo. Starting a joseki in this corner may be a bit too early.]
;B[pf];W[pb]LB[dj:a][jp:b]C[(magic)
Small move compared with the others, such as 'a' (d10) or 'b' (K10). Again, not consistent with the rest of his opening. In general, moves on the second line (or lower) should be avoided if not really necessary.]
;B[cf]C[(magic)
Black is right in taking sente. I am not convinced that this is the best approach, though. Extending on the bottom edge would give black the much desired 'double wing' formation.
Black is much lower (=more solid) than white, but white still maps out a larger moyo.
Since it often depends on playing style, it is difficult to criticise moves like these. But I think most stronger player would have played either an extension or an approach on the lower edge.]
;W[ef]C[(magic)
This is very ambitious by white.];B[ci]C[(Steve)When I reviewed the game, I thought this wasn't a great move and should have been played at D11 or D12.  This move allowed me to get surrounded on the inside of the board I think.

(magic)
Not necessarily, but by playing low moves black does let white keep him low. BTW, black leaves the corner and even the top side wide open with this play.]
;W[ck];B[cd]LB[ei:a][ej:b]C[(Steve)Perhaps this move is unnecessary at this time, but I didn't think it was all that bad.  There are probably bigger moves on the board.

(magic)
Now black does let himself be closed in. Better keep this move (or the san-san (3-3 point) invasion) for later. This move will almost certainly cost black sente.  A normal response to a move like W14 is to jump into the centre with 'a' (E11) or 'b' (E10)]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[jp]LB[ei:a]C[(magic)
The last big point on the goban.  'Play urgent moves before big moves'.  I am not convinced whether white should have played at 'a' (E11), or thereabouts, instead.

Status after the opening:  Blacks right side is roughly equal to whites top (but more secure).
Blacks little group on the left is less than 10 points. Whites lower left corner and sides should be (much) more than 30 points.  Black needs to make up at least 20 points in the center.
Problem is, white is more into the center than black.
But black has sente.];B[fq]C[(magic)
The idea to break up blacks double-wing formation is good, but this may not be the time (nor the way) to do it. The black group on the left still needs attention in order to avoid being closed in, and black is creating a weak group here.]

(;W[fo]LB[eq:a][fp:b]C[(magic)
White does like these responses?  In this situation, though, a move like this really serves only one purpose - attacking black.  However, the attack is not very strong, all it does is to make it more awkward to get out into the centre. The move does not build any influence nor any territory. White at 'a'(E3) or maybe even 'b' (F4) work better in this situation, I think. (See var)]

(;B[iq]C[(Steve)I know the rule is to cut a cap, but I liked this because I was afraid that white would be able to cut me and gain a powerful advantave by having control of
the entire bottom left corner.  My play, I felt solidified  the bottom, but I can see how it didn't do a good job, because I really had to fight for it, and I should have lost it.
(magic)
This way will get you closed in and, if living, living very small. I cannot see cutting the cap working very well here. You can fight your way out with contact plays, but you could also slide into the corner. See var]
;W[jq];B[dq];W[cq];B[dr];W[do]LB[ho:a]C[(magic)
This move is not urgent. If W wants to close B in, play around 'a'(H6).]
;B[cm]C[(magic)
This is ambitious. I know Black needs to catch up, but this shouldn't normally work.]
;W[ek]LB[dl:a][dm:b]C[(magic)
'a' (D8) or 'b' (D7) are better. White gives in too easily here. If he lets black get away, he will have lost almost 20 points!]
;B[em];W[ei]C[(Steve)I expected that, but I didn't feel that I was in a bad position.
(magic)
Against a stronger player, the fact of having a weak group like B27/29 would mean that White could chase you all over the goban while taking profit. In any case, black will not make any territory with this group. Then again, this group, if it lives, does split two white groups, but they should be alive individually anyway.]
;B[gm];W[ho];B[lq];W[hq];B[hr];W[ir];B[gq];W[ip];B[hs]
(;W[gr]C[(Steve)Could white have destroted Black?  If white didn't play this, could he have killed the black group?

I couldn't find a way to kill black, but maybe someone else could.

(magic)  (I commented on one of your variations)
In general, black should be able to live here, but not with many points. It looks like he has to give up some stones as well. (See var 4.)]
;B[fr];W[fm];B[fl];W[fn];B[el];W[gl];B[gk];W[hl]
(;B[fk]LB[dj:a]C[(Steve)Maybe I should have played at a.

(magic)
See variation];W[dj]C[(Steve)I really wanted that point.  White was good to take it from me.
Perhaps I should have played it sooner?];B[hm]
(;W[il]C[(magic)  White can safely hane here. See var.];B[in]
LB[im:a]C[(magic)  Why not 'a' (J7)?
It would be interesting to save those stones, since the white group is weak.]
;W[im];B[jn];W[ll];B[lo]C[(magic)
Nice territory building move.];W[ko];B[kn];W[hn]
(;B[ln]C[(Steve)Could 61 be played at M7 and be as good?

I think it would have been a lot better.

(magic)  You probably would have been forced to play at M6 sooner or later anyway. (Imagine white playing at N6 or putting the three stones in atari). M7 would have touched his stone, he would extend to strengthen it and you are not necesarily that much better off.  I'd say that N6 is better. It closes off your corner a bit more. Ofcourse, he can force by exchanging M7 for M6, but that doesn't give him anything, and just reinforces you...
In general, though, it is good that you ask yourself these questions about connections. Most often, a move like M7 would be better. (In some cases, even N7 would work!)]
;W[nl]
(;B[pl]LB[nn:a]C[(magic)
Playing at 'a' would not be a bad move either. You can cut apart his string of stones later... (See var)]
;W[nn]
(;B[md]LB[mm:a]C[(magic)
This was a bit ambitious again. I think that the last W move really does need a response. Black must be sure to finish with sente so that he can get back and defend.
The white shape at the bottom literally screams for a move like 'a' (N7). See var.]
;W[nd]LB[lc:a][rc:b]C[(magic)
White is now pushing black into an area of the board which he was hopingto make his territory. He would be better off playing around 'a' instead. He can then push black back towards the right side whilst expanding his own center territory. (Which needs to be closed around G11)
He shouldn't worry about the two stones W8/10. In fact, with the low position of W10, I wouldn't be surprised if a later play at 'b' S17 couldn't live on the spot...]
;B[mf];W[mc];B[ld];W[lc];B[kd]C[(magic) It is normally not wise to bump into your opponents stones like this.]
;W[kc];B[je];W[id];B[ie];W[hd]C[(magic)  White is being very submissive here. He is losing all his influence towards the center. Ten moves ago, white had the best prospects of making something in the center. Now, it's all gone.]
;B[he];W[ge];B[hf]LB[hi:a][hh:b][gf:c]CR[if]TR[gk][fk][fl][el]
[em][cm]C[(Steve)At this point, how does the board look in general?
I think 79 was poor, and maybe should have been further down along 'a' H11 or 'b' 12.  What do you think?
(magic)
Why not 'c'? His cut is unlikely to work, you can cut and mess up his upper/left side. B79 makes the dreaded empty triangle around the red dot. In this position, there's no reason to play it.

As for the board position:
The white top and black right still more or less even eachother out.
But after that, white has no real territory left: a couple of points around the two captured stones and on the lower and left edge, maybe 15 (tops) in total.
Black has ten+ on the left, 5 in the lower left and 10 in the lower right.
White would need to make around 20 points in the center to even things out.
Note that there's a big corner still in the top right, and less so in the lower left and even less so in the top left.
Black probably has the easiest way to make more territory in the center (playing around N10 or so). I think that the easiest way for white to gain many points is by chasing the eyeless black group (triangles)
This way white would stop black from making any points in the center, and he may use strength he builds to maybe reduce/invade on the right side. I don't think it would be realistic to kill the black group.  Conversely, black just has to keep playing solidly. "Rich men don't pick fights"]
;W[hi]C[(magic)
:-) Excellent];B[fi]
(;W[gc]C[(Steve)I think that was a mistake.  A poor move, because black has a chance to escape.

(magic)  Agree. Black could not really expect a cut to work up there.
I cannot see the reasoning behind this tenuki.];B[fh];W[eh]
;B[gg];W[fg];B[gh];W[gf];B[hg]C[(magic)
These white moves were pointless. All they do is reinforce white. Better leave them for later, maybe when the surrounding situation changes. (Or even as Ko-threats)]
;W[db]LB[bc:a]C[(Steve)I think this was also a mistake.  I don't think it is necessary, maybe could have been played someplace else?
(magic)  Agree.
If white wants to play there, why not at least play at 'a'?  These two tenukis easily loose white the game.]

(;B[hk]TR[nq]LB[bh:a]C[(Steve)I think this move was too small.  I should have played at O3

(magic)  I agree. This move is too small. O3 or, better still, O4 are bigger. Then again, with the white strength on the left, the black group there may need an extra stone. I think e.g. W 'a'(B12) would be awkward.]
;W[ph];B[qh]C[(Steve)I wasn't sure on what to do here, but I decided that the best thing would be to protect against a cut along the side because I had good thickness in the middle... what is better?

(magic)
Playing like this protects your edge whilst losing some of your center. The potential territory you loose in the center is maybe 20 points. If he lives inside on the edge, you easily loose much more than that.  Attacking him with a view to killing would be fun, but in the current situation, black doesn't need to do that, and trying to kill is very costly if you fail.]
;W[of]
(;B[qg]LB[pg:a]C[(magic) This is very defensively. Be careful, the black center group is now detached and without eyes.  Black should have been able to play 'a'(Q13), see var.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[pg];B[qf];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm]
(;B[jj]LB[ni:a]C[(Steve)I thought this was a vital point for me to secure the black stones
in the middle.

(magic)  Now that they are disconnected from living groups, that is not a bad idea. However, it looks as if the black group can make eyes, or even connect up with the black right edge around the weakly connected white wall. It would be difficult for white to cut apart black after black 'a' (O11), for instance.

Therefore, this move is not is not really urgent. White playing at R7 would be costly. The move black played does not need to be answered.]

(;W[ql];B[qk];W[qm];B[ik];W[jl];B[rl];W[rm];B[rk]C[(magic)

There's a famous endgame-tesuji called the monkeyjump which applies here. Based on W110, since that stone is 'lower' than B101, white can jump along the edge. In this case, since B101&5 are only loosely connected to the rest of the group, it is a move well worth considering. See Var.]

(;W[nq]
(;B[mm]C[(Steve)I thought this was my only escape.

(magic) It's an awkward position, this. I cannot see a way to conect up 'cleanly'.
But you have at least two options: sacrifice a stone and connect on top (See var) or, alternatively, start a fight and capture the cutting stones. Considering the fact that your group has quite a large number of liberties, if you can keep his cutting stone (W112) from connecting up with his own stones, you can capture them. I've tried to find an example in the Var.]
;W[lm]LB[no:a]C[(Steve)I didn't see that coming, and I thought N6 was the only thing
I could do.

(magic) If you want to save the N7 stone, yes. But that stone has little value. How about starting a fight with 'a' (O5)?]
;B[mn];W[ml];B[kl]TR[hm][gm]C[(Steve)I wasn't thinking.  I don't think this was very good.]
;W[kk];B[km];W[jk];B[lk]C[(magic)
This stone can be caught in a geta (net). See var.]
(;W[ol];B[kj];W[gn]
(;B[mj];W[no]C[(Steve)I looked at playing here a bunch of times, but I couldn't make
it work for me.  Everytime, I thought I would lose the group.
Could I have cut and saved the black group at O5?

(magic)
I think so. Look at var two moves back.];B[mr]
(;W[mq]LB[nr:a]TR[mr][lq][mm][mn][lo][ln][kl][km][kn][jn][in]
C[(Steve)If he played at A, the black group would have been dead I think.

(magic)  I agree. 30+ points down the drain.
'a' (O2) is also sente against the weak black group in the corner.]

;W[sm];B[ro];W[po];B[cr]LB[bo:a]C[(Steve)I liked this just for the points.  Now that I was living, I thought
that I could relax a bit.  Where should have I played?

(magic)
The upper right is by far the biggest.
Having said that, the lower left has lots of bad aji for white. But I think an approach from B27 would have been better. (E.g. 'a' (B5))]
;W[bp];B[bc];W[bb];B[dg];W[eg];B[bj];W[dm]CR[al][bl][cl][cm]
[cn][bo][ao][bn][bm][am][an]C[(Steve)I don't understand why he tried this cut.

(magic) It's pretty big. If the white cut works, he gains all the marked territory. As it is, with the black 'tongue' sticking down to the edge, there's no territory there.
Ofcourse, the cut cannot work, but that's another matter. He'd be better off playing e.g. C6]

(magic)  (See var if white plays there first. (21 points))
Now it is 25 points. (In both cases + 1 prisoner)

Yes, the center has turned out to be quite big, but this move is not the one that makes it so.

(;W[ee];B[bq];W[cp];B[ap];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[nb]C[(Steve)At 233, White resigned the game to black.

Overall, what was the performance of white and black?

(magic)  See next node];AB[ac][fj][an][aq][mg][na][sl]AW[ab]
[nm][mb][ma][en][ej]C[(magic)
Some stones added to approximate boundaries.
Black: 86 + 18 prisoners: 104
White: 42 + t prisoners + 5.5 komi: 54.5
Black wins with 49.5

I think that white had the better opening, but that he made many (both tactical and strategic) errors, which black used well.

Black managed to gain the initiative and keep it, partly due to good play, partly due to some unwarranted tenukis by white. White was a little bit too gentle with black w.r.t blacks invasions in the lower and left side of the board.

Whites biggest mistake was probably the response to blacks attack in the upper right (moves 66 and on), as this lost him all the influece which he had on the center. Afterwards, he should have tried to attack the eyeless black group on the left. Also, the black group in the lower center right should have died. Furthermore, the lower left black corner could have been taken apart. In Go, the timid and shy do not inherit the world :-) Many of Whites moves were good and they were almost always solid. With a bit more experience, he should dare to play more aggressive moves. He could have won this game.

As for Black, he played a good game of 'catching up' without making too many mistakes and using whites mistakes to the full. The mistakes he made were more  strategic ones, both in the opening and afterwards. If black could improve the global view, he would become a much better player. Also in the endgame, try to get a clearer concept of which moves are big and which are not. A good endgame can easily make a difference of 10-20 points.

It was a nice game, always with a large fight going on, so it was interesting. Neither player lost a group, which is a good sign.

Keep on playing and good luck to both of you!])

White is overconcentrated and still open at the bottom (he needs to reinforce at or around 'a'(L3) sooner or later). Based on the double wing formation white had, I think black sould be quite pleased with this.]

Large corner for white. W18 can still easily be managed. Black low. Looks OK.]
