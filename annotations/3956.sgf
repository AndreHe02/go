C[I'm playing white here. I feel being ahead in the beginning but my game crashes after I fail twice to capture an enemy group. (Second time a stupid mistake). Even after this I feel slightly ahead but I'm forced to a situation where I need to run with two groups at the same time and I fail miserably.

Especially I'd like some tips how to capture running enemy groups safely (and when not even try) and how to play so I won't get into a situation I described before. Thanks.

OK.  I'll try to critique the fighting and direction of play, and maybe point out a couple other things along the way.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fp];W[eq]C[Is this response ok?

Yes, F3 is also commonly seen.];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[po];B[qm]
;W[np]C[Is this ok?];B[qp];W[qo];B[nq];W[mq];B[op];W[oo];B[mp]
;W[no];B[lp];W[pp]C[This captures only one stone in gote, and removes some aji around O2.  Maybe better to not play this.]
;B[oq];W[qq];B[rp];W[rq];B[ro];W[rn];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr]C[W ended in sente because of b bad moves, but my criticism of Q4 still applies.]
;W[qk];B[oc]C[Should I play around O9 now to make sure B doesnt escape?

No, that would be slow.  Instead, you should play between the black shimari and your existing group around R7 area.  That is the biggest open area on the board for both players.]
;W[qg]C[So you did the right thing. :-)];B[cl];W[bm];B[cf];W[ch]

C[Now I feel like killing C8 should be easy, maybe I'm doing something wrong?

Yes, you are trying to kill C8, and that is wrong.  Killing is never easy, but planning to kill is often an easy way to lose.

Instead of thinking about how to kill, think about how to win.  These two things are not the same.]
;B[cm];W[cn];B[bl];W[bn];B[bi];W[bh];B[ek];W[dk];B[dj];W[ej]
;B[fk];W[di]C[This is not so good.  D8 simply would be better.]
;B[dl];W[cj];B[em];W[ho];B[fl];W[hq]C[Is this too brave?

No, this is a great move.];B[fn];W[kq];B[rs]C[The corner is roughly 16 points, in gote.  Did you just play T5 by reflex, or consider other moves carefully?  Did you read M3 here instead?]
;W[so];B[kp];W[jq];B[lq];W[kr]C[I thought this is sente, but later i saw B gets 2 eyes even if I play N2, maybe I should run already...

It is sente, you probably misread the life and death after N2.  Look at it again.]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[lr]C[Now black answered your N2 possibility.  W does have sente here.  Your next move, however, was completely unnecessary.]
;W[gr]C[Should run out first.];B[ir];W[iq];B[fr];W[hm]C[Am I running correctly?

Yes, H7 is standard shape.  However, as you can see, after G2 and F2 exchange, your corner is significantly weakened.]
;B[in];W[hn];B[jm];W[hk];B[gj];W[ij]C[There are better shapes here.  Consider H10 or K8 instead of this move for good shape.]
;B[jk];W[er];B[es];W[ds];B[fs];W[eo];B[fo];W[dr]C[D2 is just points, kind of small.]
;B[bj];W[il]C[I saw a way for black to cut so I protected it]
;B[lm];W[nl];B[pk];W[qj];B[pl];W[nj]C[Now I feel like I cant fail killing black stones, but unfortunately I make a stupid mistake later :(]
;B[pj];W[pi];B[nm];W[om];B[nk];W[mk]C[Perhaps P8 here would be a little simpler.]
;B[ok];W[mm];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh];W[oj];B[nh];W[li];B[ll];W[lk]
C[You really should connect at some point.  N8 would make a lot more sense here.  Black has around three weak groups here.  You don't need to kill all of them!  But M9 allows a severe cut.]
;B[kk];W[kj]C[Here it comes, N8 and i probably would have won? But i dont feel too badly behind even now.

N8 is huge, this was worth a lot of points.  Biggest mistake in the game so far perhaps.]
;B[ml]C[zedi [9k\]: blah
zedi [9k\]: i never play safe anough

It's not a question of safety, but efficiency.  You just played inefficient shapes.  L10 makes a very unsafe (bad) shape.]
;W[mi];B[ol]C[Should i connect by J12?];W[fd];B[gc];W[ql]C[You did not take advantage of the biggest opportunity on the board at this time.  The black group at G10 is almost entirely dead, but you must attack it.]
;B[pm];W[pf];B[of];W[rm];B[gh]C[Since you were not aware of the situation with the black weak group, you lost the best chance to win in this game.]
;W[jd]C[There is a huge fight going on around K10, and this move is far enough away that it is almost like passing.  I guess you were not seeing the status of your and your opponent's groups clearly.]
;B[jj]C[This doesnt look good, I think I should have connected before, but I couldnt read this far enough.

I think I'm doing some mistakes in the following moves, but I cant point them out.

Now you have two weak groups because you allowed G12 and then tenuki again and allowed a cut.  So it is a verty difficult position for you now, but it's the moves that came before this, not after it, that are the problem.]
;W[ii];B[ji];W[ih];B[jh];W[ig];B[gf];W[lg]C[Not the best idea.  Play H15 instead, which is the natural shape.  Maybe you will sacrifice 8 stones, but it is not clear how the black dragon would live in this case.]
;B[mf];W[kf];B[jg];W[if];B[jf];W[ie];B[ke];W[kd];B[le];W[ld]
;B[gd]C[Finally black has connected, and you lost the stones around N10 anyway, so it is safe to say that you lost all your chances in this game at this point.]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[eh];W[ff];B[gg];W[fh];B[fi];W[ei];B[fj]
;W[gs];B[is];W[ge]C[Maybe I should have taken one of blacks eyes first and hope he doesnt realize he can be cut...

No.  Relying on your opponent to miss something that you see yourself, is only a way to become a worse player, not better!]
;B[he];W[fe];B[hd];W[hf];B[ck];W[dj];B[ci];W[dh];B[ak];W[ai]
;B[dm];W[ib];B[hb];W[ls]C[This is really big, but maybe I should have played in the upper side once before?

This is small.  It only makes one eye for your group.  By the way, be sure to read the yose differences if you had a stone at H2 instead of G1.]
;B[ms];W[ks];B[ic];W[jb]C[this feels right

I don't think so.  I would try perhaps O16 here.  If you can't find a way to use the aji of the N11 stones then it might be a time to resign.]
;B[lb]C[But now I dont know how to make an eye... Though at this point I feel like I have lost already.

I would try N18 here.];W[kb]C[This is very bad, creates zero eyes while helping black to play N18.]
;B[mb];W[nd];B[od]C[At this point, w group is almost perfectly dead, so I will end the review here.

Your greatest weakness in this game seems to be fighting skills, making good shape, and an awareness of the weakness of various groups on the board, both your own and your opponents.  I suggest studying some pro games that have some fighting in them to help you get some good ideas.]

C[Too bad black doesnt make any mistakes, though part of it might be luck, I doubt not many players of this rank could read this sequence when I played O16.]
;W[mg];B[pg];W[qf];B[qi]C[Ok, hopeless. Guess no need to review any further :)]
