C[<BW> We will look at the opening and early part of the middle of this game between a black player who likes influence, and a white player who clearly prefers territory.

review for black



-------

<MD> Hello. I'm MoonDraGOn (13-14k KGS). i played black. My opponent has 13k KGS. This game i won, but still i need your advice badly.
<MD> Thanks in advance.

<BW> Hi, I am sestir [3k\] on kgs and I will do my best. =)  (2005)]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd]C[<BW> After the four corners have been occupied, we notice that black stakes two stones on getting a moyo while white is about to turn his corners into territory.]
;B[ed]CR[ec]LB[gc:A][qf:B]C[<BW> This move on the 4th line is consistent with black's moyo-ambitions and occupies a key point for white, so it must be a good move. White has to be careful already.

<BW> White's goal could be to prevent black from gaining influence, or even worse - thickness, here. I have added variations A, B.]

(;W[ec]C[<BW> This move is playable but I am no fan of it.]
;B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[cf];B[jd]TR[qf][qi][qj]C[<BW> This gave black thickness and the beginning of a moyo. The simplest continuation may be for white to play any of the marked points to establish a group on the right side.

<BW> Black for his part has not had to make any hard decisions yet. The postion is mostly even but I prefer black.]
;W[np];B[pn]C[<MD> Right direction?

<BW> Yes. As black has moyo-potential in the upper right half, playing on the right side is bigger than anything else.]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[oq];B[qr];W[jq]C[<BW> I dare almost say, up to this point, black plays like a pro. =)]
;B[qj];W[jj]LB[co:B][do:A]C[<MD> i think, it is a bad move for W. e.g. A&B are much better.

<BW> I must confess that I do not know how to play as white in this position. All of his stones are low and black is building a huge moyo. I am not so sure that tengen is a bad move. Imagine a black stone on tengen. All of white's stones except for O4, are on the third line while black has at least 5 stones on the fourth line. Thus if this would turn into a moyo-game, and if black gets a key-point such as K10, the game would be very hard for white. K10 is simply an urgent reduction of black's moyo-potential.
Or at least, I think so. =)

<BW> The difference between the third and the fourth line may not seem so important at a first glance, but it is.]
;B[do]C[(variation)]
(;W[co]C[<BW> This is almost certainly too gentle on black. White should attack this stone, not attach to it, thereby making it strong.]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fq]
(;B[dj]C[<MD> what about my fuseki?

<BW> Very good. =)
(vatiation here)];W[dl]C[<MD> Help me. I dont know how to respond to this attack.

<BW> Me neither, but I suggest C8.]
(;B[el]TR[cn][dn][do]C[<MD> i think my move is very bad. As a result . i lose my three stones.]
;W[ek];B[dk];W[em]C[(variation here)]
(;B[fl];W[dm]C[(variations)]
(;B[bl]C[<BW> This is the famous knight's move tesuji. Black is connected and white can not cut. If you discover that you frequently play a tesuji but fail to find the correct continuation, you may have to change your habits with regard to reading. Do not just guess but try to read out all relevant variations to be sure that it really works. =)]
;W[cl]C[(see variation)]

;B[hp]C[Looks dangerous.];W[go];B[hm];W[hn];B[im];W[in];B[ik]
;W[jm];B[jk];W[jl]C[<BW> This move does not exist. ><];B[kk]
C[<BW> This shape is on the cover of "The Art of Go, vol 1: Connecting Stones" (Yutopian).

<BW> For white, it is one of the worst shapes that can appear on a go board. Neither K8, nor K10 makes any sense.]
;W[ch]C[Considering the size of black's moyo, this is too slow. White must invade. Maybe O17.]
;B[eg];W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[fh];W[dh];B[pc];W[pl];B[ql]C[<MD> right respond to this invasion?

<BW> Yes. Staying connected is the most important consideration. Q8, as an invasion does not work.]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[qk];B[rl];W[pk];B[rk];W[qf]C[I count 74 points for white and 58 for black. But since black has so much more influence over this one large unsettled part of the board, he is still well ahead and does not need to kill..]
;B[pj]C[Good move.];W[nk];B[og];W[pg]C[(variation)]
(;B[oh];W[of];B[pe];W[pf];B[me];W[nd];B[ne];W[oe]C[<BW> cutting could be worth the bad shape]
;B[nc];W[od];B[mc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb];B[oa];W[md];B[lc];W[oi]
;B[mh];W[oj]C[<BW> As soon as white gave up his P15 dragon, the game is really over, from a theoretical standpoint, so I will end the commentary here.

<BW> In summary, you like influence. That is good, but sometimes it is better to get a base.

You play on the third line to:

- get a base for your group
- approach a stone on the fourth line
- immediately grab territory

You play on the fourth line to:

- build a moyo
- attack an opponent's group
- escape
- gain influence

<BW> Counting territory would also help your play, if you do not do that already. Knowing that white was less than 20 points ahead when he invaded at R14 would have enabled you to play more calmly there.]

(;B[bm]C[<MD> could this move save my stones?

(;W[bn];B[fm];W[ck];B[en];W[am];B[fj]C[<BW> Something like this maybe.

<BW> Extending to C10 in the first place was clearly better but it is hard to say which outcome is better between this and connecting underneath.

<BW> From a shape perspective, black will have to use 7 stones to capture E9, and has sacrificed two stones. That is not efficient. On the other hand, just look at the moyo.]

(;B[cj]C[<BW> You can try this move.
The difference between this and D10 is that C10 gives black a base while D10 gets influence. If I were black there I would have tried to live asap (as soon as possible).]
))
(;W[dm]C[<BW> A pincer like this is suggested by the fact that white is low but has allies at K10 and K3.
The more allies you have around, the more you can attack.])
(;W[dl]C[<BW> A wide pincer was suggested by one of my friends, based on intuition. Several variations of this pincer depends on ladders that runs right into K10. For one example, "the Magic Sword of Muramasa", starting at bE3, wD4.]

(;W[gc]C[<BW> There are many continuations. Here is one example.]
;B[fe];W[cg];B[hd]C[<BW> Black tries to press down on white's stone and get a wall. White will try to get ahead and become strong as early as possible. wH17 would be too slow so next white will jump to J17.]
