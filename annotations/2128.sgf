C[Hi. This is a game I played on the famous Korean server, Dash 'n Dot. Both my opponent and I are 6k* and I took black. From beginning until I resigned there was a very big battle going on all over the board and I'm sure I made a lot of mistakes. I'm trying very hard to reach 5 kyu, I've been studying lots of life and death problems, and several other resources but i have been losing most of my games. I would be very happy if a stronger player could review my game Thanks!

Jay: This game is very interesting to examine.  There are some critical moves that deserve to be studied, for you to get stronger.  This is a typical Korean style game that brings a lot of excitment and sparks.  Thanks for presenting the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[jp]C[This is the way i like to open with black, although i don't think it is fuseki.

Jay: True.  Typically, either you play the Chinese openning at Q9 or R9, or play attachment at F3.  Playing K4 now is ok if you are aiming at playing attachment at F3 later, although from this point of view, playing J4 makes more sense.]
;W[nq];B[lq]LB[po:A]C[My first mistake? Maybe A would have been better.

Jay: This may not be a mistake.  After W jumps (O5), B playing Q5 is a good play.  This is because W's O3 approach is a bad play. The normal play is to approach from Q5.  In fact, B M3 makes later attachment (F3) a good extension.  But you opponent recognized this right away and soon started a fight.]

(;B[mo]C[Jay: This is where you may have some problems.  First exchanging N4 with O4 may not be a good idea at such early stage of the game.  It has eliminated other options.  Then, playing pressing (N5) against the W's wall only strengthen its presence, and you have already lost a hand here. W's J3 was an agressive play trying to start a fight.  You should not back down from it.]

TR[pd][mk]C[I played here because I thought it worked well with the marked stones

Jay: The board is still too big.];W[df];B[pj]C[Same idea again, while also forcing white to respond so I can try to get sente again

Jay: This move is too close to the attacked group.  Typically, with such close encounter, you are ready to sacrify the stone to gain stragetic advantages.  You should not expect to capture the whole W group unless your opponent makes stupid mistakes.]

(;B[oc]C[Jay: This hane is too aggressive and is the losing move. It has resulted in gote in the battle in the upper right.  What you need right now is a sente in this area, so you can kill the large W dragon on the right or profit from attacking it.  This dragon is not alive if B plays here first after settling all the related groups.   See the variations.]
