------------------------------------------------
Hi, I'm trying out a new review form I've learned from a friend (omgwtf on KGS). Maybe it works best live on KGS, but you tell me. :-) At various steps I'll mark several points on the board with capital letters each standing for a move choice. Then, in the comments, I'll talk about what I think of each of them (from a weak kyu stand-point: the last time I went to a club (in France) I played even and won (but barely) against a person rated 8 kyu) and possibly try to rate them in relation to each other.

The point of this is that you get multiple choice problems to work with and the key word here is "problems." Many people of the lower ranks (myself included) pay closer attention and think more when working with actual go problems in contrast to "normal" commented games because they know there is a solution and they want to do well, so they "think before they click." And the more they think about it the more they will remember and learn. It's also "interactive," in a way. :-) Personally I think it works great for opening and early middle game, but later on I'll switch back to normal review style.

Look at the first move for an example.

Note #1: that I might neglect to mark other choices that are "just as good" as some other choice, but these are mostly just a matter of style, so limit yourself to the marked intersections.

Note #2: you need to fetch something to cover up the comments with, if you can't do it in your SGF viewer or with your OS' UI.

Note #3: by convention I'm assuming black is male and white female for personal pronouns.]
;B[pp]LB[po:a][dp:b][cq:c][qq:d]C[------------------------------------------------

This is just an example, to familiarize you with my concept.

B & C are best (of the four choices you have), probably equally good (a matter of style) (at least for anyone below professional level :-) )
A is bad 'cause it neglects the open corners *and* it's unnecessary contact
D is especially bad (has all the flaws of C, plus it totally neglects the center and mobility)]
;W[cq];B[qd];W[cc];B[oc]LB[dj:a][qj:b][qn:c][nq:d]C[
------------------------------------------------

B is best, I think, because if black gets to play here it will be a perfect extension from both his corner enclosure & his star-point corner stone.

D is worse because it neglects this vital point and allows black to play against the side, just making it harder to play around B later.

C is worse than D because theoretically it is an "invasion" and too early at that (try to play corner approaches on the "outside" in the opening) -- it allows black a perfect pincer attack.

A is a weird choice. If white wanted to play like this she'd be better off playing on the star-points in the beginning. A probably has the same value as D or something around there.]
;W[nq]LB[pj:a][pn:b][lq:c]C[
------------------------------------------------


A & B are better than C because they correlate to all three of black's previous stones.

C is low together with other low white stones. If you're thinking of pressing white into the corner here and building a wall facing your enclose it won't work, because white will have sente (and will invade, naturally). Building a wall facing C is the proper joseki when you don't have an extension, I think, but that's even worse here...]
;B[lq];W[no];B[pn];W[nm]LB[ol:a][pl:b][lo:c][iq:d]C[
------------------------------------------------

Here I like B best. A is more aggressive & ambitious, but it will probably be regretful later when white invades the right side (which she'll probably do), so I think it's worse than B.

D makes a base for your weak stone, which is always big, of course, but since white is also weak here, it's probably not urgent? In fact, I don't know which is better of B and D. Personally I think B.

C is the worst choice, I think. It doesn't do anything particularly useful (like make a base or take territory etc) and you could say it's "chasing from way way behind."]
;B[iq]LB[pl:B][lo:A]C[Should I have played at A instead? I wasn't sure which way I should go.

Is playing B a good idea? I was thinking white plays B it wouldn't be very pleasant.
------------------------------------------------

See previous "problem" :-)

You're right about white @ B wouldn't be very pleasant as you'd have to make life in the corner then (otherwise white would take the corner and giving white both B and the corner would be too much).]
;W[fq]LB[pl:a][io:b][pr:c]C[-----------------------------------------------

I still like A the best. Your two stones in the corner "yearns" to make a moyo with your corner enclosure on the top.

Next comes C which takes away white's chances of eye(s) at the edge/corner in one swoop.

B is not urgent nor big. With C you threaten to link up to your group on the side anyway.]
;B[io]LB[jd:a][cj:b][pl:c][pr:d]C[
-----------------------------------------------

A & B are both neglectful. A is completely off-base & in the wrong direction. High play against a low, strong black group? B is too low & neglects the area of contention here.

C & D are correct ideas. D aims to settle the group, which is a very good idea but it is likely white will lose sente (or only get one eye) and black gets to play at C. Playing at C (which pretty much forces black to play in the corner) is better, I think, because it aims to separate black and because afterwards white will have so much more mobility that life or escape will not be much of a problem (if proper attention is paid).

I'm going to neglect making "problems" for the white side for a while seenig as something like D, settling, or running with the dragon would be the solutions at almost any move...]
;W[cj];B[pk];W[de]LB[id:a][ch:b][ej:c][nk:d][eq:e][pr:f]C[
------------------------------------------------

B & E: I put in these just to trick you. It's the worst possible choices. A invades a low & small moyo, and D will probably only strengthen white's side & corner.

C betrays black as a "jealous" person. Black has good fourth-line power, a much greater potential for development AND a weak group of white's to attack, so he has nothing to worry about if white secures a little territory on the left side. He could build a moyo twice as large as white's instead.

A & D are best. A builds a moyo containing half the board and it prevents white from playing around here. Likewise, D is a powerful move that will make white really "sit up straight" and think over what petty things she's been fretting over on her low side. D both attacks and builds a big moyo.

F is good for reasons I've already talked about, but probably a little singly focused right about now.]
;B[ej]C[ Is this ok? I didn't want him to have too much moyo on the left side with a lot of stones so I tried to attack it.
------------------------------------------------

If you have $1000 and make $50/hour and your enemy has $100 and make $10/hour, would you still be jealous of him and cause trouble to try and make him lose his job? ;-)]
;W[dl];B[eg];W[ei];B[fi];W[ic]LB[lc:a][kd:b][nk:c]C[-----------------------------------------------

B stresses your moyo and center influence, which will come in handy attacking white's base-less group. A is territorial and low, petty. C starts to attack right away & also builds moyo, though on a slightly smaller scale.]
;B[lc];W[le]LB[kd:a][ie:b][me:c][nk:d]C[
-----------------------------------------------

C is unambitious and vulgar "brute force."

B is a half-between move, like black can't make up his mind whether he wants to help his three "reduction stones" or cut white. In reality it's like not being able to decide whether to stay in the boat or step off it and so one can recollect scenes in old slapstick movies where the actor stands with one leg on the pier and one leg in the boat, slowly being stretched wider and wider until he splashes into the ocean.

D is still a "good" move, and always has been, but it's of less value now than before.

A is best, in my opinion. The more disconnected you can make your opponent, the weaker he will be! Separating and surrounding are the two most serious strategies you have against your opponent in go.]
;B[ie]LB[eg:A][jd:a][fj:b][pr:c]C[I had no idea where I should play this move so I played it at J15 to sort of help A


-----------------------------------------------

A makes black splash into the ocean. It's best. ;-) It also connects some stones into black's moyo and now white might have an easier time rescuing his three stones if they need to run.

I do not understand the reason for playing B right now.

C, aiming to make a base, is still good, but painful.];W[fj]

B is a completely random nonsense move I do not understand.

A is better by scores. It's consistent and solid.];W[kf];B[eh]
;W[pi]LB[jd:a][cg:b][pg:c][nh:d][nk:e]C[
-----------------------------------------------

A & C & D & E are all good I think. (See variations.) A is probably the most ambitious (in a good sense) and also maybe the best?

B is hard to understand. There is *no* territory for white on the edge below this black group so it can't be counted as a reducing move. It's definitely not a running move either, so perhaps black is looking for eyes? But still, black has so much mobility toward the center, it's almost a shame he wastes moves living...

But OK, end of problems. ;-) Some general notes...]
(;B[cg];W[im];B[nk];W[cf];B[ci]C[

-----------------------------------------------

Black is too concerned about eyes for this group. He should realize that it is actually pretty strong (ponnuki shape and good mobility).]

-----------------------------------------------

Unnecessary. Endgame.

Marked are some better moves which all are probably better than most of white's moves.]
;B[bl]C[-----------------------------------------------
Black must stop with this "pillage and destroy" style of playing. It's like barbarian go. Very often you can gain a lot more by building moyos or taking territory than by reducing moyos or destroying territory.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[oe];B[qf]
(;W[mn]TR[pl][pm]SQ[qr]C[
-----------------------------------------------

What the deuce... White needs to unlearn these kinds of weird moves. If this is a move to make eyes then anything else would be better. Also, black could play at square now to take away white's prospects of an eye on the edge.

Since black jumped two spaces, it stands to reason black has a weakness over here at triangles.]

This is typical of 20 kyu endgame. Take a moment and think about this move. In his mind, black probably thinks he's "surrounding something" in the center here, and played it to "protect" what he's surrounding, but in fact there are *no* points anywhere to be found. (Technically speaking, with some effort, black might get 3 points there, but it is *nothing*.)

Either that or he's protecting some kind of phantom cut (in which case he should start doing tesuji problems ;-)]

-----------------------------------------------

The reason you seem to have little territory (even IF both of your groups had survived) is because you were too busy invading and reducing instead of building your own moyo. Reducing and invading is for when you are actually *behind*. You were ahead by a fair amount in this game UNTIL you started to reduce. ;-)

The reason you lost so much in the finishing stages of the middle game & the endgame (killed groups, say), is because of poor reading, I think, plain and simple, and I can't really help you with that by writing comments like this, so you'll have to gain more experience from games or do go problems on your own, sorry. :-)
