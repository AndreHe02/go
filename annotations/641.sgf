;W[qn]LB[nq:A]C[D: Would white have been better playing at A?

I think W was trying to avoid you getting strong all along the right hand side.  I don't think it matters too much at this point.]
;B[qp]C[I like this move when playing from a high handicap because it is very solid.  It is, however, slightly lax, and not usually the best move if you were playing without a handicap.

In high handicap games, at least in the high to medium kyu levels where we both are, you want to avoid the terrible blunder more than the slightly lax move.]
;W[on];B[np];W[fq];B[dq];W[cn]LB[fo:A]C[D: Perhaps white should have played at A?

A is probably technically a better move, if two even players were competing, and W was trying to lose by as little as possible.  But in a high handicap game, W needs to purposely make some overbold moves, counting on B's inability to capitalize on them.]
