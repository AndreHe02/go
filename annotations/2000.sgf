C[Dear reviewer this is game I (black) played at dragongoserver. My rank there is 19K, but i only played few games so i'm not sure about my exact rank. I would especially want to know comments on fuseki and possible sente moves i missed, because I know i'm very weak at this.
And maybe few comments about endgame - i'm always very unsure whether it is better to defend some weak position, or to attack, and it is very hard for me to decide which endgame move has higher walue.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp]
(;B[cg]C[Is this good move? Isn't it better to attack the white cornerstones?
MK: It is not a mistake, but I would play E4 or E3 before.]
;W[fq]
(;B[jd]C[I'm not sure about this move - i'm used to plaing high handicap games so maybe i'm overestimating the star points
MK: Too safe again. If you would like to play here, it is better to play on the 3rd line (K17).]
;W[qf]
(;B[qe]C[MK: I think this is not the best choice of the joseki. Sth around Q11 is better.]

MK: Sure, see variant.];B[pj];W[dj];B[md]C[MK: Too defensive, you can play around Star point K4.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[ri];B[rj];W[pi];B[rf]C[I think that this was mistake (i was trying too hard to put presure on white group and ended in gote) How should i play here? (now that i'm reviewing i'm thinking of P11, but i'm not sure)
MK: You are pressing W group, which makes W stronger. He will be alive or he will escape, there are no points. Still K4 is big point for both sides.]

MK: B play was very soft and gentle. He won by the W mistake in the left top corner. Without this it would be very close.
Any Questions???
