*Final result: White +58.5

*Submitting this game for review because my opponent appeared to be tangibly stronger than me and to know some things that i didn't know.

You played a good game overall, but made a few huge mistakes that ended up costing you the game.]
;B[pd];W[do]C[* i was unfamiliar with this opening - need to find Joseki for 5-4 opening

Don't worry too much about learning joseki at this point.  It's more important to work on things like reading ability and counting.  In any case, you seemed to do a good job dealing with his opening.]
;B[pp];W[ed];B[qk]LB[pj:A][qj:B][pq:C]TR[pp]C[Typically this would be at "A" or "B".  Or if you wanted to play the low chinese opening, the marked stone should be moved to "C".  That doesn't mean that it's a bad move, just unusual.]
;W[qq]C[Your opponent invaded very early here.  It's usually a bad idea to invade this early in the game, as it can end up giving the opponent a lot of thickness that is worth more than the small territory gained by invading.]
;B[qp];W[qn]LB[pq:A]TR[qn]C[Very strange move, I'm curious as to what your opponent was going for.  In a situation like this, you should play at "A" and thank your opponent.  By playing at "A" you secure the corner and white's marked stone is looking pretty lonely.]

(;B[ro]LB[pq:A]TR[qn]C[This move doesn't accomplish much, there's no territory for you to protect and the marked white stone can still easily escape to the center.  As a general rule, you should avoid playing moves on the second line until the endgame (with some exceptions, most notably during fighting).

A better move here would be at "A".  Once you play there white's marked stone is dead, he can't connect it to his R6 stone no matter what he does, and you should be able to profit by attacking his R6 stone.

(;B[pg]C[This move is a little loose.  I can understand that you're trying to defend the right side with this move, but white can still invade/reduce around Q11 without much trouble and this does nothing to help the top right corner.

Now might be a good time to close off the top right corner with a move like R16.  That would threaten to close off the right side with a move at Q12 next.]

(;B[hd]C[* I wanted to take advantage of the thickness on the right hand side.  This move perhaps turned out to be too ambitious for my skill level allowing an invasion at L17, which perhaps lost the game?

This move may be a bit ambitious, but it's certainly not bad.  White is more or less forced to invade, which is fine (you can't expect to take a large territory with just 1-2 moves).  The key is to try to profit by attacking white's invading stones.

See the variation.];W[kc];B[je]C[I would prefer to play this one point to the right, at L15, which would keep white blocked in along the top.  He can break through but he really needs to try to live first, and you should be able to seal him in completely while he tries to live or connect to his upper left corner.]

LB[ji:A]C[This is probably the game losing move.  It isn't sente, and white uses the opportunity to invade.  I would recommend playing at A, which would give you a very large moyo that white would probably only be able to reduce, and not invade.]
;W[ji]C[*

This is very painful for you.]
(;B[jg]LB[kh:A]C[*intercepting the ladder breaker

Not necessary.  A move at "A" would be much better, as it would take a large amount of territory.  Even if he does cut off the marked stone, you could more than likely run out with it and live on the left side which is sitll wide open.  Or you could just abandon it, as it wouldn't be a big loss.

And as a side note, in your variation you can catch the cutting stone in a loose ladder anyway :) (see the variation at mvoe 83)]
;W[mh];B[li]LB[mf:A]C[* i think this move was too ambitious.  I had a huge "imaginary moyo" in my mind consisting of the upper right quadrant (!) and was attempting to rescue that.  :-(

This move isn't necessarily too ambitious, but I think your inexperience at fighting is what allowed him to live.  Before taking such an aggresive course of action as this, try to read out a few sequences.  If you don't think you have a VERY good chance of killing the invaders, then don't play so aggressively.  Remember, you can make a huge profit if you do manage to kill his group, but if you fail to kill him then you will take a huge loss.

Take a look at the board right now.  You're probably not very good at counting yet (but don't feel bad, I'm not even very good).  The simplest counting technique is to try to match white territories against black territories to get a rough idea of who's ahead in terms of territory.  You have the bottom left corner, white has the top right.  Your corner's probably a little bigger than his.  White has the bottom right corner and some bottom territory, you have some territory on the lower right side that is about the same size as his bottom.  The upper left corner is still wide open, and so is the left side.  If you can grab a chunk of territory now, you can just concentrate on attacking white's invaders and making sure you play in the upper left corner before he does, and you should have a fairly easy win.

A move at A would make about 25 points, still would be attacking the invaders, and it would connect your top middle group so that you wouldn't have to worry about it getting cut off during fighting.

It should be possible to kill the invading stones in this case, but if you're not confident that you can do it then consider a more conservative course of action such as playing at A.]

(;B[kd]LB[mf:A]TR[kc]C[Bad move.  Even if white does connect to the marked stone, it's not going to help him at all because you can prevent him from connecting along the top to his upper left group.  The move that jumps out here is A.  If you play there, I don't see how white can make even 1 eye, let alone two.  Remember, you are VERY thick in the area.  He is completely sealed in, so all you need to do is prevent him from making 2 eyes.

I threw together a quick variation, not sure how realistic it is but it should give you an idea of how good a move like A is (it's an eye-stealing tesuji)]

*overall i think that i

- still attempt moves that are overly ambitious (greedy)

- require more discipline in counting

- need to develop my ability to visualise future scenarios beyond the next 2 stones.


I agree with your assessment.  Working on reading ability is always important, you should check out www.goproblems.com if you haven't already.

Some of your moves were a little ambitious but maybe not as much as you think.  The problem is that you're still relatively inexperienced, so you aren't able to effectively follow up your ambitious moves.  Remember, there is a difference between ambitious and unreasonable, and most of the moves that you thought were ambitious were just that, and not necessarily unreasonable.  If you like playing ambitious moves then by all means continue making them.  The important thing is to have fun and maybe learn something in the process :)

Working on counting would make a big difference.  In the next few games try the method i described, where you simply try to match up white and black territories to try to see who has more territory.  It's not meant to be precise, but instead to give you a rough idea of the balance of territory.  When you know who has more territory, you know how you need to play.  If your opponent is ahead then you should play aggressively, and make ambitious moves.  But if you are ahead in territory, then all that you need to do is to keep your lead so you can play more conservatively.

You played well overall, but a few mistakes ended up hurting you a lot.  Keep with it and good luck!]
