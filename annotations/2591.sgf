C[I am black, but I am not quite sure of my strength though
I made quite some mistakes in the game but they were not that bad]
;B[pq];W[dp];B[qd];W[ec]C[patrickb: Completing the shimari at P16 ot P17 is more standard; that way, if white comes in to the right side with either a wedge or approach, you get a good result. See the variations.]

(;B[en];W[gp]
(;B[bp]C[patrickb: This slide is generally bad here. It encourages white to reinforce the corner, which destroys your ability to invade at 3-3 later. Here in particular where white has made a somewhat thin two-space jump, helping him reinforce the corner isn't good.]
;W[ek]C[patrickb: Strange move at E9 for white, since it doesn't put as much pressure on b... My first reaction is to take C3 now to cut out white's base to some extent on the bottom. Playing on the right side to set the E9 stones running too might be feasible.]
;B[cg]C[patrickb: This seems a bit lukewarm... how does b respond to white C11, which gives white a base *and* a reinforcing move? It seems to make black too busy, with wanting to get in C3 and a base at the top left]
;W[eh]C[patrickb: Strange move by w. Doesn't strongly threaten black at the left. Perhaps w wants to build thickness to make an approach at P17 or threreabouts?]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc];B[cj]C[Quite a strange opening for black ?

patrickb: For both, yes. This is a good point, since it aims at the weakness on white's right-side group and to connect to C6. that said, I don't like playing the C16/D16 stones first. It just solidifies white's upper left corner.. Perhaps black is best just playing here immediately. Black again has two places he wants to play, F15 and C3, if white plays B8 to prevent the connection across...]

C[Should be B8? It will create the cut at D8 and I get sente?

Absolutely B8 to connect.];W[bl]
(;B[bj];W[dl];B[fe]C[Is it too small? I don't want to be shut in

patrickb: I understand not wanting to be shut it. A good impulse. :)]
;W[ed];B[ee];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[df]C[patrickb: Is this necessary? Are the D16 stones important stones now? They don't cut anything, and they only give you half an eye (one eye in gote), so I think this is a good place for black to have tenukied. Jumping out at G7 is my first instinct here, since white is still marginally thin at the bottom and in the middle...]
;W[bn]C[patrickb: okay, now the trouble... Here you seem to make the direct responses to white's moves. Perhaps a better idea is to look to trade the corner for some outside thickness? That way you don't get chased around and you get some concrete profit in return...]

(;B[co];W[bo];B[cp];W[dq];B[cq]C[patrickb: C2 is better shape. Both this and C2 give you one eye, but C2 avoids the empty triangle. Note how by following white around you've helped him reinforce previously thin stones.]
;W[kp];B[gn];W[fm];B[fn];W[gg];B[fd]C[patrickb: Pushing down like this directly feels a little slow and just helps reinforce white at the top]
;W[gc];B[fc];W[fb];B[mq]C[patrickb: Hmm, lots of irons in the fire now...]
;W[kq];B[io];W[qo];B[po]C[patrickb: I'm not sure I like this attachment. It helps reinforce white on the right side, and I'm not sure the thick shape you get out of it is help enough...]
;W[qn]C[patrickb: Ah, but white is playing passively here. Now is a good time for black to play J3 and make the fight on the bottom an even one, with both sides having stones at risk :)]
;B[pn];W[rq]C[patrickb: again a good time for J3!];B[qp];W[rp]
;B[qm];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl];B[ol]C[Unneccsary? Should I just extend at R9?

patrickb: If you're playing in this area, R9 is better, yes.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qq];B[pp];W[qr];B[ho]C[patrickb: I do not like this move. If you want to reinforce this connection, J7 does move. This asks white to fix up the bottom by playing something like H3.]

;W[jo];B[km];W[jm];B[mn]C[Very bad move. I should extend at L8. Black will have a easier time

patrickb: Absolutely];W[kl];B[ll];W[jk]C[patrickb: What should consider a double-hane here, but he's thin and small enough that it's probably not worth it...]

patrickb: 7k is probably about right. Not higher. You missed some really significant tactical moves, as did white (the life and death on left side, the endgame weaknesses at the top right). Shape decisions were a little funny, too. If you have any questions, feel free to send me email or to ask me on KGS (patrickb).]
