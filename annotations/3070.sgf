C[R: Hi, my comments are marked with a R: before them.
I hope you will find this review helpful. You can reach me at KGS (my nick is egymonk) or email.

First I want to state that I started playing Go around Dec 11th, 2004. So my experience so far is limited.]
;B[cc]C[meandyou [18k\]: HI];W[dp]C[dshaitan [17k\]: hi, gl]
;B[qe]C[I havent encountered this type of opening much, so wasnt sure if it should be attacked immediately or not

R: I think there is hardly anything you *must* do at the 4th move. Its ok to play at the fourth corner. 
Also, it is possible to attack if you feel comfortable.];W[qp]
;B[pc];W[kq]C[R: Chineese opening with white  seems a little bit strange to me. I'd prefer attack and weaken shimari  UR.]
;B[jd]LB[jd:A][qj:B]TR[pc][qe]C[R: It is said, letting your opponent to make double extension from shimari (triangles) is generally bad thing. If Black takes A (that is correct, since that is the weak side of shimari) You should take B, to prevent double extension. (see var.)]

(;W[dd];B[dc]LB[ed:A][fd:B]TR[cd]C[R: Notice that, it is black's corner (white is second here). White can not hope to close in or push down black. In fact, black can even tenuki, and W still cannot close him.

Therefore, W shouldn't try to close B. Playing at triangle will provoke "hane on the head of two". You can play A or B instead and make outside influence.]

(;W[cd];B[ed];W[dg]
(;B[fd]C[R: It seems slow.];W[dk]C[R: Its a one-purpose move. Additionally, with d9 white had left a weakness (cutting point) at d11 and about d6.   If W really want to play such territorial move he should strengthen the weaker side. 

However big move at the right side still available.];B[oq]C[R: Attacking from inside is a mistake here.]

(;W[mq]TR[kq]C[R: White's two marked stones seem to be overconcentrated. What about make black overconcentrated instead? See var.]
;B[oo];W[qn];B[po]C[R: this peep only helps white.];W[qo];B[ql]
;W[pm];B[qq]
(;W[pp]C[R: You might try to cut here. (var)];B[pq];W[op];B[pl]

(;W[om]TR[ol]C[W might try hane (see var). B can't cut,  and hane threatens black's weak stones.]
;B[qh];W[fq];B[mc]C[R: Very slow. It would be important to "play at the border of two moyos"]

(;W[jj]C[R: ... now W got the big point.
However I feel its better to move around o9. The biggest extension is around there for both side, and white threatens the right side. If Black deffends, White moyo will be huge.]
;B[jg];W[gg]C[R: Other side would be bigger.];B[ff];W[hf]C[R: W's moyo is much larger. If black wants to fix this borders, let it be. This invade only make W groups weaker.]

;B[ii]TR[hg]C[R: W's moyo now in danger. B's threaten with a cut, and push into the moyo. W *must* pull back. (I would try var.)]

(;W[ji]C[R: It helps black.];B[ih];W[hg]C[R: W now pays the price of his invading snake.]
;B[gi];W[gk];B[df]C[R: Now both the corner and the invading snake cannot be saved.]

(;B[ck]C[I didn't like him getting into the left side as much as he did, was there a better way to prevent this, and still save my finger?

R: The problem began earlier. You made that dragon despite the corner was weak. In this position you've saved the dragon, but i think a move like B12 kills the whole corner. (see var) Thats big. So, the answer is no, W have to pay the price.]
;W[ek];B[cl];W[ch];B[ci];W[ej];B[di];W[bh]C[R: Very nice. If B play this, W would have a hard time.]
;B[co];W[cp];B[do]
(;W[dm]C[R: It seems dangerous to me. W should deffend. (hane for expl)]

;B[or];W[ms];B[rp];W[ro];B[rr];W[no]TR[np]C[R: I think o4 is ok . This let B nice sente endgame.]
;B[ne];W[ld];B[lc];W[mf];B[nf];W[mg];B[ng];W[nj];B[lg];W[me]
LB[lh:A]C[R: Stop here a bit. If you connected your two stones only to save them, this is a bad move. This is worth 4 points in gote, so don't save them. 

If you connected because _you've_seen_ that W can cut at A and kill the whole black group, then this is a nice sente move! :-) 

(Yes, this is a good move anyway, but you should have try the cut :-) see variation)]
;B[oi]
(;W[oj];B[pj];W[ni];B[nh];W[li];B[mi]TR[ki]C[R: triangle is sente for W. B will deffend at M12, and w can kill 3 stones in gote if he want to.]
;W[pk];B[qj];W[ol];B[hj];W[hh];B[ij];W[hk];B[ik];W[il];B[ki]

(;W[bi]TR[bj]C[R: You might try  triangle instead. (see var.)]
;B[bj];W[sp];B[qs];W[rq];B[sr]
(;W[sl]SQ[rk]C[R: This move is aji keshi (ruin your own opportunities). B will deffend at S9, and W has no good continuation. W should play s9 first. See var.]
;B[nn]C[R: Aji keshi for black. O4 would have been sente.];W[np]
;B[qk];W[ok]LB[bc:A][bo:B]TR[sj]C[R: Deffending 1 point in gote is too small now, there are many better moves. For example you can exploit B's bad deffense at the triangle. But A and B also very big.]
;B[rl];W[sk];B[rm];W[sm]

;W[si];B[sh];W[mk]LB[bc:A][bd:E][md:F][jh:D][ri:C][bo:B]C[R: Ok. Let's see the endgame! :) 
(Its a very close game, who is better in endgame will win.)

This move (triangle) is 1 point in gote. 

"A" worths 9 points gote (2 in sente). 
"B" worths 10 points gote (2 in sente for b).
"C" is 1 point in sente.
"D" is 1 point in sente
"E" is 2 points sente
"F" is 1 point sente];B[bp]C[R: B got the big point];W[bq];B[ao]
;W[aq];B[ap];W[cr];B[bd]C[R: B got both points. After this exchange B's got 11 points in gote. (Remember, W's last move was 1 point in gote!) W is loosing now...

(However B should've play d8 sente first.)];W[be];B[ad];W[ae]
;B[bc];W[aj]C[R: This is 2 points in gote again. Sente moves first!]
;B[ak];W[ai];B[md];W[kh];B[lh];W[jh]
(;B[kj]C[Obviously this wasnt a misclick, and normally I don't allow undo's when someone just doesn't see something, but I was feeling nice.

R: :-) It's ok, if it was not a serios tournament game.
I would've let it take back either. I'd rather loose by 2 points and feel i have a great game, than win by resignation coz my opponent made a very stupid mistake in haste. But its matter of taste. :-D]

(;B[ph]C[R: R11 would be ok. +2 points for free.];W[qi];B[pi]
;W[os];B[ps];W[ns];B[sq];W[rp]C[R: This is the end.
W has won by 0.5. Nice and very close game.
After this position both of you made same unreasonable moves. Each of that move easily would have decide the result.

If you see that there is no chanche, we can suppose your opponent will see it either.  And it's *never* "worth a shot" to continue blindly, because every unanswered moves cost you 1 point! There were 2 unanswered white moves after this result, that is more than enough to loose this nice match. "Forunately" your opponent made the same mistake. Lucky! :)

General advices: Watch out your weak shapes and don't attack from them. In the endgame, it is very important to double-check what is gote and what is sente. If you brush your endgame a little, I bet you dont need any unreasonable moves at the end of a game like this again! 

Thx for reading.
