AB[pp][dd][dp][pd]C[Hello!

w is sdt55, 17k* when match was played.
b is me, ozelot1980, 21k* when match was played.

variations are very welcome!!

point out all obvious mistakes on both sides, please!

please comment on the direction of play!
i am still new to that term or what it means at all ;)

Thanx for taking the time! :)

My comments will look like this for the rest of the game:

**this is a comment line1
**this seems to be another line ;)];W[fc]C[**keima approach...in the upper left **corner.
**i decided to "pincer" in the most **peaceful way at K17 also extending **my upper right.
**by now the orientation of my **coordinate system should be clear ;)  **x(A-T without i) y(1-19)]
;B[jc];W[db]C[**as expected w slid into the corner with **the keima to D18.
**my answer to this move was **questionable.
**i think i should have played C13 and **safe my upper left...but...]

(;B[hc]C[**i did play the small extension from my **K17 stone violating the "play away **from strong positions" rule

kklim> this move is too small, just in the beginning phase, should focus on the "big point/move". Do not forgot you got 4 star point in the corner, play big should focus on "influence play".]
;W[cf]C[**of course w took the point when **playing C14

kklim> expected outcome, double keima, black need to move out and let white take the corner territory.]
;B[fd];W[ec];B[ed];W[cd]
(;B[cj]C[**this was meant to reduce the **possibilities of w developing down the **left, but i think i should have played it **on C8 if playing here at all.
**i was considering some other points to **play when reviewing.
