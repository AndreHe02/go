(;W[gc]C[ukill: I guess that W 20 is not good.

adum: slow. better to approach the corner directly]
(;B[lq]C[ukill: Overplay and Wrong steps.

adum: i don't think this is an overplay, but i'm not sure it's a good direction of play. the right side is bigger than the bottom side, so it's better to play a move there.]
;W[qj]C[ukill: Overplay, isn't it?

adum: looks a little cramped, but i don't think you can kill it outright. so it's fine, i think.]
;B[qh]C[right direction];W[qm]
(;B[mp]C[this move is the wrong direction. black should instead attack on the right]
;W[ol]C[white can feel good to get this nice shape now];B[dj]
C[ukill: It's not the best. F3 is much better.

adum: f3 is better after M3 and N4, yes.]
(;W[ec]C[ukill: Terrible shape for W. If you were W, what would you do?

adum: yes, this is a very slow move. white is playing slow, thick moves on a group which is already strong. this is very inefficient]

(;B[de]C[ukill: I think it's good.

adum: it has a weird relationship with D10. later you will need another move to connet them, so it's a bit inefficient.]
;W[gq]C[ukill: It's what i regret, B turned weak. And the power of the B wall had reduced.

adum: yes, this is good for white]
(;B[iq]C[ukill: To stay safely, i choose 31.

this extension is small. you don't need to worry about your group in the bottom-right yet -- they're still strong. so this is a bad move.]

(;W[co]C[ukill: Too timid. This time i think B is going to win the game.

adum: timid, but big. can't say this is so bad.]
(;B[cm]C[too close to white's strength. this leaves white C9.]
;W[go]C[ukill: Too weak. I think the possible choices are C9, C17 and O17.

adum: this is slow, but not so bad.];B[eq]C[ukill: Greedy, nonsense.

adum: yes, this is impossible];W[dq]
(;B[dc]C[ukill: Too big, that time I believe that I won't lose.

adum: white has played a lot of slow moves, so black looks a little ahead, but the game is still on]
;W[ch]C[ukill: Too late.

adum: really? hard for black to kill this.]
(;B[ci]C[ukill: Indeed it's the rough move. Please tell me what should i do.

adum: this move says you want to chase white. i think this is okay, but you can't expect to catch white. the other choice is to try to surround]

(;B[gd];W[he];B[fd];W[hd];B[fc];W[gb];B[fb]C[ukill: Up to 59, B move badly.

adum: yes, black is overconcentrated. this move is pretty small too. the game seems pretty even now]
;W[ke]C[ukill: It's the main reason why W lose.

adum: this move? it seems fine to me. maybe a little slow, but helps to reduce black's corner]

(;B[md]C[a little slow]
(;W[bf]C[ukill: It must attack the No. 41  B groups first.

adum: this move is very unreasonable. it's impossible to attack black's corner here, it is way too strong. and this move is not worth so many points.]

(;B[bg]C[again, wrong direction... black should ignore white's last move]
;W[bh];B[be]C[again bad. black does not need to worry about this corner]
;W[ag]C[bad again for same reasons. anyway, the atari underneath makes no sense. atari on top is better because the black stone cannot escape that way.]

(;B[mr]C[because of black's bad moves on the left, he should play there to fix instead of here]

(;W[nr]C[ukill: Wrong move, just take O3.

adum: locally this is wrong, yes. but still, you should ignore and attack on the left]
;B[bn]C[now black gets to play here first and white has missed a big chance]
;W[bo];B[nq]C[ukill: Much better B11? But i can control me from O3.

adum: B11 is better, yes];W[bj]C[ukill: After there is so confusing, please explain to me...]

(;B[dk];W[cj];B[cl];W[bl];B[ak]C[this doesn't really help];W[al]

(;B[hj]C[ukill: I want to decrease the power of the upper W.

adum: i think you just need to run since you don't have two eyes. this seems reasonable for running, but probably not the best.]
;W[el]C[ukill: 82 is strong

adum: yes, this attacks your shape]
(;B[dl]C[slow]
(;W[en]C[since it's hard to attack the black group, this move is a bit slow]
