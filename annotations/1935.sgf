C[I'm playing White.   I make two invasions in this game which are somewhat bumbled but at least don't die.  I'd like advice on whether it makes sense to invade in those situations or reduce, and if invasion is appropriate, what's the best place to do it?

My endgame play still needs a lot of work, too.

Dave: I'll be reviewing this game. I'll try to put in as much as I can in the way of possible alternatives and also reading out fight. My comments will all start with (if I remember) "Dave:" and I'll be making a few comments on the black positions as well, as appropriate. In case your view shows differently, the first stone is played in the bottom right corner for me.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[qn]TR[pq]LB[jp:a][jq:b][dp:c]C[Dave: This right here should be a warning. For a shimari such as with the marked stones, an extension in the area of A or B would be very good for black. Furthermore, since black has a stone at C, he can play the high extension at A more easily. You should be thinking of ways to counteract this, either by developing a moyo of your own or breaking up his.]
;W[cn]LB[jq:a]C[White 6 at 'a' might be okay here.

Dave: Yes, I would be more inclined to play at A. The played stone induces black to develop his moyo at the bottom.]
;B[eo]C[Dave: This is an unusual move.];W[ck]LB[dj:a][cq:b]
[em:c]C[I didn't know this sequence.  I looked it up and 8 at 'a' or at 'b' would have been joseki, but it looks like my play is also played sometimes.  'c' is also possible, and may have worked well with my stone in the upper left.   I didn't feel it would be wise to tenuki here, but I guess I could have since I have two directions to go---either out along the side or inte the corner.  Thoughts?

Even after this I could have invaded at 'b' but I didn't.

Dave: The played stone seems to be a satisfactory play, if not joseki. It settles your stones at the moment for now in any case. A might have been better for your upper left stone, but the difference isn't too much.]
;B[pj]LB[jp:a]C[Dave: Black extends along the wrong edge, in my opinion. A stone at A is big right now, as black clearly is building a strong moyo at the bottom.]
;W[jc]LB[jq:a][jp:b]C[I don't know about this.   A play at 'a' or 'b' is looking bigger.

Dave: Yes, i think the black moyo is looking too dangerous at the moment. If you wanted to develop your own moyo, I think you could have played on the fourth line, since you have stones in both top corners. A general rule of thumb for moyos is to play on the fourth line between your own stones, and play on the third line otherwise.]
;B[hn]C[Interesting.   I didn't know if black was being greedy or what.   Slack or brilliant?  You be the judge...

Dave: I think black is being too greedy here. There is room for white to live at the bottom, so this stone does not seal off territory for black. It looks like black is looking for center influence, but a stone at tengen would be nicer. I might go as far as to say white can safely ignore this stone for now.]
;W[lq]LB[nq:a][iq:b][jq:1][gq:d]C[I'm not sure this invasion point is wise now.   It's deep and unsupported.   I figured if black 'a' then white 'b' for a base still leaves me some room, but I could be shut in easily.

So I have there questions:

1. Is an invasion here urgent?
2. If it is, is there a better point that W12 at M3?
3. If not, where else is bigger?

Dave: An invasion here is very good for white. White has been able to construct a good moyo at the top, while black has not finished his at the bottom. However, the point of invasion is bad. If black plays around B, white has no choice but to run out with her invading stone. You can assume that in the following battle, black will be able to solidify the lower left corner and the right side. I would play at C, allowing for a two-space extension on either side, and thus easy life for white. Note that black's groups on either side have problems. If black pushes from the right, then white can extend to D and black's corner group is in trouble. If black pushes the other way, white gets to put pressure on black's large shimari, which, since black used the ogeima shimari, is not quite secure yet.]
;B[lo]LB[np:a]C[I wouldn't have played here were I black.   'a' looks like a weak point in black's group.   But I guess a cap is a safe play for the capper even if nothing else is nearby.

Dave: Yes, this move isn't useful except for capping white, since white can live. Black's center influence doesn't seem to be worth all the moves he is expending for it. White doesn't have any weak invasion points black can exploit, and black's secure territory is running out. I wouldn't bother exploiting the weakness at A; what would it accomplish? Both black groups around A are fairly secure. White should just extend and get life.]
;W[iq]C[Dave: The right move for this situation.];B[jp];W[jq]
;B[mr];W[lr];B[ls];W[ks];B[ms];W[kp]LB[kr:a][fq:b]C[Dave: I wouldn't bother pushing here. If you are going to ignore the weakness at A, which is good, by the way; it's small at this point in the game, you should make sure you have life first. An extension at B is just begging to be played here. The played stone belongs in the early endgame, not the fuseki.]
;B[jo];W[gq]LB[kr:a]C[I think White can live now, but I should have fixed the weak point at 'a'.

Dave: I think that if you extended one more space, you could live even if black took A.]
;B[kr];W[is];B[js];W[jr];B[ks];W[er]LB[fq:a][dr:b][kq:c]TR[mr]
[ms][ls][ks][kr][js]C[Dave: I would be less worried about this group if you had extended to A previously and were now playing B, but an attack on the black corner seems good now. Note, though, that C has become a somewhat important point, since black's marked stones are a bit short on liberties. If you are able to take C, you can push along the third line and attack black's corner.]
;B[cq];W[go]C[Dave: A bit pointless; you're giving black the opportunity to strengthen his position without getting eyespace in return.]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[fp];W[gp];B[ip];W[hp]TR[go]C[Dave: Ugly shape. Defending the marked stone seems to be more trouble than it was worth.]
;B[hr]LB[hq:a][ir:b]C[Dave: A dangerous move. The short extension from earlier is starting to hurt white now. Black threatens both A and B, both of which look disastrous for the white group. In addition, white's eyespace is running out fast.]
;W[fo]C[Dave: Not a good idea I think. Trying to run out with this group will cause only more problems for other groups. See variation.]

(;B[fn];W[nq]C[Dave: Not a good play, as the black reply shows.]
;B[mq]LB[kq:a][mp:b]C[Dave: Now, even if white gets A, black can easily reply with B.]
;W[fq];B[ep];W[eq]LB[dr:a]C[Dave: Useless. A would be better for eyespace, and would probably get a black response as well.]
;B[ir];W[cr];B[br];W[bq]C[A weird fight starts here.    This cut is probably an error.   Not only does it not seem to work, but the value of cutting black here may be questionable.

Dave: This is bad for white. If black captures the played stone instead, white's prospects are grimmer.]

(;B[dr];W[dq];B[cs];W[cp]C[Dave: This starts a ko battle, but for black, it is multistage, so white has a good advantage here.]
;B[co];W[cr]
(;B[bp]C[Dave: This isn't much of a ko threat; white can simply fill in. Even if black played a ko threat, white can still win unconditionally (see variation).]

(;W[ds]C[Dave: No. White should simply fill in, and black will die. See variation.]
;B[cq];W[bs]TR[bq]LB[gr:a]C[This is a bizarre position in the lower left.   There's a ko lock and some other complicating stuff.   I don't know how to analyze it.

Dave: Black no longer has a ko to play, so he should simply capture the marked white stone. This would force white A for life, and then the corner position is settled, and then black has sente.]
;B[lp]LB[hq:a]C[Dave: Black can capture the whole lot by playing at A first.]
;W[kq]LB[hq:a]C[Dave: Black at A would still capture them all.]
;B[np];W[hq]LB[ko:a]C[Dave: Now that black has booched it, this leaves a weakness for black at A. White can break out if she wants to.]
;B[dn];W[dm]LB[cm:a]C[Dave: Bad. Should extend to a instead, as black shows.]
;B[cm];W[bn];B[em]C[Dave: Black can claim a bit of profit with A. I guess he sees the center as more valuable.]
;W[dl];B[fk]LB[cg:a]TR[cn][bn]C[Dave: This move seems rather useless. Black is claiming a bit of center territory, but is also basically forcing white to take territory on the left. An invasion around A would be nice for black, especially considering the weakness of the marked white stones.]
;W[el]C[Dave: Tiny move; 1 point sente; belongs in the endgame. Black can ignore this move as there are much more valuable plays around still.]
;B[fl];W[ej];B[fi];W[ei];B[fh];W[eh]C[Dave: As you can see, black just handed the left side to white for negligible profit.]
;B[ef]C[Dave: A bit of an overplay.]
(;W[cf];B[dg];W[eg];B[fg];W[df];B[ee]TR[ef]SQ[cf]C[Dave: Good work punishing the overplay by black. This is a nice, safe alternative to the variation I pointed out earlier. White still takes a fair bit of profit. White should look to reduce the black center territory now.]
;W[ed]LB[je:a]C[Dave: I wouldn't bother with this; reducing black's center territory is bigger than blocking black off. Note that if you allow black to go push in, you may be able to build a wall around A and claim the top right half of the board. Remember to think of the effects of the opponent's strategy and how you can take advantage by subverting it rather than preventing it.]
;B[fd];W[fc]TR[pj][fd]LB[kg:a][md:b][qg:c]C[Fifth-line territory for white (with weaknesses) in exchange for black thickness (with its own weaknesses).  I'm assuming this exchange is good for white, right?

Dave: Yes, but now dealing with the black thickness is important. The last white stone isn't necessary; I would start reducing. As a general rule of thumb, to reduce an open territory, find the two stones marking the corners of the boundary you want to pierce (the marked black stones in this case, draw a line between them, and play slightly outside the middle of that line. In this case, a white stone at A would be good. Remember that you are not trying to claim territory; you are simply trying to start a fight in the center so you can turn all the black potential territory into dame points. The other points of interest would be a possible invasion for black at B, using his center thickness to pull out, and the point where the moyos collide, C. C is especially interesting since both of you are high on the fourth line. Whoever plays C can slide into the other person's territory if they don't respond.]
;B[cc]C[Dave: I'm not sure about the status of the 3-3 invasion here. Even if it lives, though, it does not look as worthwhile als the points I mentioned.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[eb];B[db]
(;W[dc]C[Dave: Not too sure about this move; it looks like it induces a lively shape for black. Might have been better to just strike at the critical point (see variation.]
;B[cb]LB[ba:a][ab:b]C[Dave: I think white can kill black by playing at either A or B. If black plays either, though, he will live.]
;W[qf]LB[qg:a]C[Dave: Not sure if this is worth as much as the corner; seems like a big point though. I wouldn't mind going one space farther to A since it is attacking the black position as well.]
;B[hc];W[je]C[Dave: Good response. White makes a black invasion more difficult.]
;B[jg];W[md]LB[mh:a][nh:b]C[Dave: Not necessary. Reducing black's center territory is paramount now, since black has almost sealed it. A play at A or B would probably discourage black invasions as well as reduce black's center.]
;B[mf]LB[ko:a][oh:b]C[Dave: Black gets to cap, taking center territory. Breaking in looks difficult now. There is a weakness at A, though black can deal with that by sacrificing the three stones. Otherwise, white may have to try something around B.]
;W[pc]TR[qf]C[I was thinking I couldn't afford another corner invasion here.

Dave: Corner invasions are not that costly. Usually in games, now is the time to be sealing them off though, but now the marked stone clearly should be one line farther out.]
;B[he];W[ng]LB[kf:a]TR[mf]C[This move is atypical for me.   I don't  now how to judge whether it's brilliant or moronic.

Dave: This isn't bad. It's poking at black's weaknesses, which is long overdue. If black tries to capture it, you might sacrifice it to break throguh around A. It's a severe attack on the marked stone, at any rate, and as such, should create problems for black.]
;B[nh];W[nf]LB[mg:a]C[Dave: Retreating now is bad. You need to get the black center under control. Pushing on at A would be good.]
;B[mg];W[me]LB[oh:a][oi:b]C[Dave: Your territory does not need strengthing here. Keep attacking with A, though black's borders are about closed. You can try B as well, though that looks much more dangerous.]
;B[ke];W[kd];B[kf];W[oh];B[qh];W[jl]LB[fj:a][io:b][ko:c][oi:d]
[km:e]C[This is one of potentially many game-losing moves.    Watch the next few moves and see if they make any sense at all to you.   I figured the cutting points at 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' would allow me to get away with this.   Hint: I don't die, but I don't know if I get the best result.

Dave: This is a bold, bold move. The cutting point at A looks to be worthless. Both groups there look lively enough. B is about the same as C, since they exploit the same weakness. The played stone is not close enough to help though. If you had played at E instead, you would threaten to pull out through C and made life very miserable for black if ignored. This, combined with the weakness at D, might have been better. In short, I think this move is just a few spaces off. It shows good instinct, though; black's territory does have some weaknesses left.

By the way, don't expect invasions like this to live. Instead, you should look to sacrifice the played stone in such a way that you can exploit other weaknesses, such as while black deals with the played stone, you can come in through D. I know this invasion lives, but it's going to happen less as you improve. :)]

C[Dave: I would play with the assumption that the marked stones are going to die, and instead push with my live group at A followed by B. White can still deal damage to the right black position. Your variation, though, does lead to the nice double atari that allows you to live later, though black should have sacrificed the marked stones instead.]

I'm trying to make my endgame better, but it still takes me too long to judge the actual value of endgame moves and I often miss important things.

Dave: Black takes what looks like the last interesting point. Of course, the top left group can be killed, but otherwise, I wouldn't say that White's endgame is her weakest point.]

[qd][qe][ra][rb][rc][re][sa][sb][sc][sd]C[Dave: Overall, I would say this is not a bad game. I think the most important part is to think more about your fuseki. A better invasion would have meant a lot in this game. Secondly, the game involved a lot of close fighting, and a lot of misreads in the fights. Black and white both miss numerous chances to kill each other. Of course, you are not expected to find them all at this point, but look through each variation I've added and try to recognize the weakness in each shape that could have allowed one side to seize the initiative. Pattern recognition is very important in go; if you practice, you will soon spot shapes that look weak. From there, it's only a small step to actually finding and exploiting the weaknesses.

As for what you thought was bad endgame play, I think it wasn't particularly bad. It was not exceptionally good, but I don't think that the endgame is a weak part of your game right now.

I think that if white had been able to break up black's territory early in the game, she would have won this game. At the beginning, white should have noticed the dangerous black moyo on the bottom and split it early. And in the mid-game, white should have noticed black's huge potential center territory. Of course black later lost it, but this was through a different mistake. At each turn, you should stop before you play the next natural, forcing move and think what would happen if you left the local situation as it is and played somewhere else. You should not focus on defining exact borders in the middle of the game; once you are assured of life for your group or have reduced as much as you want to, stop playing there and look for the next big area on the board. Leave the touching-up to the endgame.]
