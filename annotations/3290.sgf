C[A game played on KGS. I've written some comments and questions to the file, but any comments are very welcome.
Thank you for taking the time to comment on this game.

Tim: 

Hi there! I will do my best to help you with some problems. 
I will also correct white as far as I can correct this, because you'll learn from that too!

If you have any questions left, don't hesitate to ask me!!]

I think it is ok like that];W[cm]
(;B[eq]C[This turned out to be a very bad move
Should i have played G4 or D10 or something similar?

Tim:
Until this move both of you claimed territory... b the right side, and upper side, w the left side and the bottom.
So now you have to make sure you stay ahead in territory, or gain more than w does.

This move makes white very strong and you practically give away the corner.]
;W[dq]
(;B[hq]C[this move gives you no base at all... and it doesn't make you strong eiter.
So indeed combination of E3-H3 isn't good];W[er];B[fq];W[fr]
;B[gr];W[ir]
(;B[ho]C[Since i cant make life i decided to try and run. This a good start? Any comments on the running are very welcome, since im not that great at checking when something can be cut and when not. I tried to keep it quite safe in this situation.

Tim:

Running is ok, but you already have +- one eye.. And be careful that you don't run in a way that white gains too much... This move (H5) isn't so good in my opinion (see variation)
On the other hand... you don't need to run right away.... white can't kill you with just one move.]

This game is very territory based... I think b is a little ahead.. When yo ucan keep it like that... b wins]
