;B[bg];W[bh];B[ah]C[Here I was starting to think about attacking to two white stones a B2 and C2, with an eye on the bunch of 5 whit stones at the bottom centre.

Was this a good move to both do that and stop white from spreading further, or would it have been better playing at A-3 or D-1?

=====
Reviewer: A2 is the best option in this area.];W[ai];B[bi]C[A good move, or would I have been better fortifying the stone at A-2 by playing A3?

=====
Reviewer: A3 is not necessary; B1 is a bad move.];W[ci]
(;B[ag]C[I don't think I had a choice here - it was either loose the stone at B-1, or play A-1 and loose both that, B-1 and possibly A-2.

=====
Reviewer: This move was not necessary, yet.];W[ai];B[dh]C[I think this might have been a mistake.  J-5 would, perhaps, have been better.

=====
Reviewer: Yes, this is a wasted move.];W[eh];B[bi];W[di];B[ai]
;W[ei];B[gg]C[Silly move.];W[hg];B[gh];W[hh];B[gi];W[hi];B[id]
C[Definitely a mistake!  Again, J-5 would have been better.]
;W[ie]C[And that was it.  If I had played J-5 with that last stone, with white's response as J-6 I would have played at J-4 (a win of 1 moku), or with a response at J-4 I would have played at J-5 and white playing at J-6  (a win of 2 moku)]
