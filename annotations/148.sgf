;B[dd]C[Hello, and thank you for condescending to review this game.
I have one question written at move 33. The remainder of the game
is low kyu flailing about without effectiveness.
This type of 'helping the opponent build power' plagues my recent playing. This was a speedy game but I have difficulty in thinking
slowly. Please excuse, and Thank you.

>> Playing slowly is a good way to be able to play fast games ... You really should try to play some longer time control games]
;W[pd];B[dq];W[pp];B[jd]C[Why not at C9 or D9 (chinese fuseki) ?]
;W[do];B[cp]C[This move doesn't appear in any of the joseki  books i've been able to open ...

gives the feeling you're sealing yourself in the corner
better to try a pincer , or F4];W[co];B[fp];W[ck];B[cg];W[lc]
;B[dc]C[way too passive

i'd make an approach move against the lower right corner];W[hd]
;B[nc];W[md]C[black helped white separate the two stones (K16 and O17)  this cant be good for B]
;B[od];W[oe];B[pc];W[nd];B[oc];W[qd];B[qc];W[rd];B[rc]C[black once again sealed himself in the corner]
;W[df];B[cf];W[de];B[ce];W[fe];B[pf]C[This move only reinforces white

points i'd consider now are (in decreasing order)

-) play in the middle of the right side
-) K14 to keep the center from becoming white
-) approach move against Q4 (from the right side)];W[pe];B[pi]
C[The last two B moves we're all about my brain telling me that I must
erase whites
power immediately. Supposing that you had a headache and played the B
fuseki
as such to 29. What could black do at 31 and the next few moves to swing
the balance of power?

>> When I have a very bad headache, i never play go :))
>> Comment for move 31 is still valid .. I'd have played a move such as Q10 to try to counterbalance the white wall]
;W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[ni]C[black still has defects at his base ...

as will W38 show next];W[qh];B[pn];W[rj];B[qq]C[good (in my view)

the Q11 group will be in trouble anyway now .. so you have to seek compensations elsewhere]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo]C[B should **cut** here, without asking any question
Let's see how W chooses to answer and start thinking at that time
Things can't go on well for W if B plays 45 at Q5];B[pr];W[or]
;B[ro]C[why such a submissive play ?];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[qr]
;W[nq]C[white has gained the wall in the lower right against the one he had in the upper

but B has lots of weak stones on the board ..];B[ph];W[ng];B[iq]
C[wasn't to late to try to take K16 out and annihilate white's plan to take the center

white would be left with nearly no points on the board];W[kq]
;B[gc]C[if white answers this, black has gained a very few points on the upper side,   while white gets much stronger]
;W[hc]C[done];B[dm];W[cm];B[cn]C[dubious move i think];W[dn]
;B[cl]C[??
what's the point of this ?];W[bn];B[bm];W[dl];B[cn];W[em]C[black collapses]
;B[gd]C[playing yose here only gives white a good opportunity to get stronger

taking K16 may still be possible];W[ge];B[hb];W[ib];B[gb];W[jc]
;B[he]C[too late  white is now strong here];W[gg];B[id];W[ic]
;B[jg]C[I believe that this stone should have been at k12 instead. I was going
to use the
aji of the three stones to erase power and pull the q11 group to safety
but
my plan backfired.

>> This looks like a stone that will really have to take K16 and sisters out ... If you wish to use these three stones as a 'threat', you have to play at k12, l12 or m12 (maybe even on the 11th line)]
;W[hf];B[li]C[B79 and 81 are not connected
thus the idea of playing B79 lower];W[kh];B[nl]C[doesn't connect with Q6 either
so this is a wasted move, as black's only hopes rely in the connection with the lower left

why not m8 ?];W[oj];B[oi];W[mk];B[nj]C[once again
forces white to connect, thus loses possibilities for black]
;W[nk];B[ki];W[jh];B[mg]C[what's the point of this stone ?

black can't make an eye with it

if you wish to play yose from this group before it is alive, you are taking lots of risks :

-) playing yose makes you lose liberties
-) you're also losing some opportunities that may occur later

as a yose move, M12 would be better, since it wouln't end up captured ...]

;B[kj];W[kk];B[jm];W[km];B[jl]C[black made his road to the lower left , but gave white :

the territory around O8 with the prisonners
the H13 territory with some prisonners

and made no point out of it

The cause for this was the weakness of the Q11 group, itself created by B31 at Q14 which was too near from white's power]
