C[I left the comments of my opponent, his questions and my comments too. Thanks, Mirco.

r: Hi Mirco, this is rcarn, and I'll be doing your review.]

(;B[cq]C[r:  This is the first move I would change.  Generally, if you're looking to give up a stone on the 3rd line like this, you add an extra one first.  It generally doesn't cost you much more, but it leaves a lot of aji in the position for you to use later.]

(;W[dg]C[mircofanti [7k\]: it was a pincer and an invasion
mircofanti [7k\]: not bad

r:  This feels a bit early.  White is starting an unfavorable fight here since a) it's black's turn, and b) D13 has no room to live locally.  This is the type of move you would make if you were losing and needed a lot of points to come back.]
;B[cl];W[dl]
(;B[dk]LB[ck:A]C[r:  Not a major difference, but helps with shape a little.  Try to avoid hitting your own stones on the head.]
;W[el];B[fj]
(;W[gg]LB[fg:A]C[r:  A little too much.  White is begging for a cut here later.  Stick with the solid one space jumps when running away if you want to keep all your stones alive.]
;B[gl]
(;W[fn];B[go];W[fo];B[gn]
(;W[fm]C[r:  This feels a bit like a thank-you move.  Black would love to connect at G7, and this makes it happen.]
;B[gm];W[cm];B[bl];W[bq];B[br];W[ap];B[dr]
(;W[hp]C[r:  White is just making these stones heavy here.  Maybe consider using them as light sacrifice stones.]

(;B[km];W[il]
(;B[hl]C[r:  Empty triangles are usually wrong.  Black doesn't have to stop an eye here yet since H7 will do it in sente later.]

;W[ik];B[gj]C[r:  Here's where H9 would have been more useful than H8.  Instead of needing to defend to avoid losing the whole G6 group, black could press the attack on white's J4 group.]

(;B[pi]C[r:  This feels like an odd spot to play.  Why not just the usual extension to R10 to grab some territory?  With the black wall facing the right edge, you might even be able to get away with R9.]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[qm];B[pn];W[po];B[qn];W[rn];B[pl];W[qk];B[pk]
C[r:  White gained a lot here.  Black is very overconcentrated here, and considering that he could have taken most of the side (see variations at 105), it's a big lost opportunity.]

r:  Though black gave up a lot of points on the right side, he had enough in the corners to make up for it.  White's weak groups definitely contributed to that, since black solidified most of his territory on the left side during attacks.]

(;W[jq];B[hp];W[gq];B[hq];W[ir];B[hr]C[r:  White gives up the cutting stones, but takes compensation on the bottom edge.  Plus, he keeps sente, so it's a good chance to either defend a weak group (like D13) or take a big point if there isn't one (like R10).]
