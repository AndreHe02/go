RE[W+25.5]

C[Hello

I'm joe (wysi), playing this game as a 19k against ozRick (who was more or less the same strength).  I'd like to get a review of some of the main points of this game (I lost by about 20 points or so) and have written comments as appropriate.

In general I feel that my opening was not too bad, but I found myself losing a lot of ground as the game progressed.  Perhaps it would be possible for the reviewer to point out some slack moves or lost opportunities.

---------------------------------------------------------

Hi,

I'm Richard, and I'll be reviewing your game.  Most of the comments focus on black, but I have commented some of whites moves also for reference.  Wherever possible/appropriate I have included possible variations or alternative moves.  Naturally, these aren't gauranteed to be the best possible moves, but either better or alternative moves to the one taken (I hope ;) ).

All my comments start with RJ];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq]
C[joe: My opponent is an aggressive player, so I chose this shimari to ensure at least a little territory.  I wonder if perhaps I should just play hoshi and try to fight more (except that I am weaker at tesuji and life and death than this player).

RJ:  This is a reasonable opening.  One of the (many) purposes of playing a move like R4 is to allow a move like P3 shortly after.  This is a strong corner enclosure, and if you play it, your game strategy should be adjusted accordingly.

Hoshi does not gaurantee either territory or influence, but is a good balance between the 2.  A 3rd line move like R4 indicates that territory is sought on the left]
;W[dj];B[qj];W[nc]
(;B[kd]LB[lc:a][ld:b]C[joe:  Is this pincer too far away (a or b better)?  I think this may have resulted in his being able to live too easily here.

RJ:  I have included some variations for a and b.  Essentially, choosing the moyo on the rigjht as your starting point gives you a good basis from which to lean on the upper side.  Given the stone at R10, it may also be good to have played an attach-extend joseki at O16 (variation included).]
;W[ne];B[pf]C[RJ: Absolutely.];W[ng];B[gc];W[ec]
(;B[ge]LB[jq:a][jp:b]C[joe:  Would preventing the double wing (a or b) from the lower left been more profitable than the move chosen?  As it turns out this move allowed me ultimately to reduce his left side quite a bit, but I wonder whether the trade off was not a good one.

RJ:  Certainly taking gote here allows white to extend along the lower edge.  The black stones at the top are not fully settled, though, so there may be some danger.  The solution, I believe, would have been to follow something similar to the variation at F3

Your concerns re the b group at the top are justified, but do not forget that w has a weak group on the top left also, that you can threaten in order to obtain eyes for your group.

The bottom edge is bigger.];W[jq]C[RJ:  White is correct not to extend any closer to your corner.]
;B[dg]LB[hq:a][fq:b]C[joe:  Seemed unorthodox but worked.

RJ: This has a number of useful effects - it reduces the left side, reduces the potential for w territory in the centre, and also begins to build up threats on the W group on the top right (consider b on K10 or nearby soon).

There are also big points in invasion to be obtained at either a or b (but the fights are bigger and harder).]
;W[bf]C[RJ: Interesting response from W.  Perhaps C14 better.]
;B[lq]C[RJ: Worthwhile point.];W[dm]
(;B[hq]C[RJ:  At this stage of the game, there are a number of things to consider.  There are very few large moves left on the board, and it becomes harder to determine what is best.  Your move at H3 is certainly one I would consider - I have also included some variations of others that might be worthwhile.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[jn]C[RJ: Another strange move from W.  I should have gone at J5]
;B[ln];W[fp];B[is]C[RJ:  This move looks like it connects underneath w stones, but I don't think that it does - see variation on next w move.]

(;W[fr]C[RJ: W makes the sensible move on the other side nonetheless, but still has L2 in reserve for later.]
;B[ks]C[RJ: Well, not anymore ;)  This should prompt white to deal with his stones floating near the middle]
;W[hn]C[RJ: like so.]
(;B[ei]LB[qh:a][ql:b]C[joe:  at this point, in surveying the situation, I felt reasonably happy about how things had gone so far.  I didn't like the big area in the lower left corner, but decided against a 3-3 invasion.

Thinking back, however, the purpose of this move is unclear, though again it provided support for reduction.

RJ: The balance of territory is maybe slightly in b's favour, although the balance of influence is maybe more w's.  Nonetheless, w has an insecure group, whilst b does not. Although b has an invasion risk around a and b.  In short, the stakes are about equal.

A move like E11 in this case does not dramatically reduce w's territory, and does not dramatically increase b's.  Something a bit bigger is required.  I have included some variations that may be of interest.

Incidentally, w is building up centre influence at the bottom, and if b is to move on the 3 w stones at the top right, the time is now.]
;W[pm]C[joe: I was expecting this move, and as it turned out it was probably the move that did me the most damage.  I realise of course that this area was not really my territory as such, but I am a bit disappointed that I did not manage to kill it or at least profit better from attacking it.

RJ: Yes, good attack from w.  Not clear cut what's going to happen next, but as long as the w stone connects out, w will tip the balance of influence, and probably territory too his way.]
;B[oj]LB[nj:a]C[joe:  Aims to prevent connection to o15 stones, ended up failing to do so.  Perhaps a move to a would have been better?

RJ:  O10 has been a big move for a while.  Not such a strong connection though, now that w has a stone inside.  Too late, unfortunately.  P10 still threatens w group, but not so severe.]
;W[ql]
(;B[qn]C[joe:  I thought this would make him run (it did).

RJ:  forcing the enemy to run is not always the best solution.  See variation.]
;W[nl]
(;B[ll]LB[om:a]C[joe: another mistake? Should I have tried to cut the keima at a?  There is now too big a hole for him to escape through.

RJ:  You already made the decision to let w run, so next is to follow it up by taking advantage of w's self-inflicted weakness.  I recommend N10 - this gives w a tough decision over playing for the w group at the top or the w group on the right.

See variation];W[mk];B[mj];W[lk];B[ml];W[nk];B[nj]C[joe:  Another missed opportunity?  My reasoning was again to keep him from connecting to the above stones, while I carried on out into the centre.

RJ: W has also made a mistake.  Your position with regard to the w stones at the top is still intact.  Don't just look at what you've lost, but look at what you've gained, and what potential you have also.]
;W[qk]C[RJ: For w, I prefer extending out to L9.];B[on]MA[kf]
LB[om:a][oc:b][lc:c][kf:d]TR[gc][ge][kd]SQ[dg][ei]C[joe:  Too defensive here perhaps.  Can I cut (a), or better to harrass the stones above (b or c)?

RJ: You will need to make a move like this at some point, but right now it's not very big.  You can hassle the w group the most by starting at b to see how w responds.  If w extends along around c, simply pin him in and force him to live small whilst making territory around there.  If w extends around d, secure the b group with something like c, and take profit on the top edge.

Things to be aware of at this point are the potentially weak connection between the square and triangled stones (especially if w runs into the centre), and the potential for w to try and turn the tables by attacking the b top group with the w top group whilst escaping - the b group will live, but w may become much stronger on the outside.

It isn't possible to cut the w group at a as far as I can see.]
;W[rj];B[qi];W[gi];B[gg]C[joe:  didn't want the two stones there to get cut off, as I knew they were my only hope of accomplishing anything on the left.]
;W[ii];B[kg]C[joe:  again, an attempt to keep the groups separated.

RJ: Yes, good.  I'm amazed that w has not attempted to save his group already.]
;W[ch];B[fj]C[RJ:  The oportunity to attack the w group still exists, against many odds.  If it is captured, b is far in the lead.  Nonetheless, b can also make big threats in the way that you have played here.

I would be inclined to attack the w group first.];W[kb]C[joe:  I could really have used the stone at m17 now...]
;B[md]C[joe:  an attempt at making these stones heavy, though it seems a bit pointless at the moment, the large keima can't be cut (or can it?)

RJ: I cannot find a satisfactory method for cutting this connection, although there are plenty of pitfalls on either side in any ensuing fight.]
;W[nd];B[mc];W[mb];B[kc]C[joe: shape move to try and keep some territory here.]
;W[pb]C[joe:  again left me wishing I had played this or p17.]
;B[qc]C[RJ: joseki move seems reasonable.];W[lb];B[jb];W[mh]
;B[li];W[qb];B[rb]
(;W[qa]C[RJ: odd response from white.  Joseki is in variation.]

(;B[cg]LB[fb:a][eb:b][ri:c][go:d]C[joe: I decided I better do something about the left side now, as the right and top weren't doing all that particularly well.

RJ:  I would maybe secure top with b a, w b first.  Also, c is quite big, and if you're in the mood for some wrecking ball stuff, then d will also serve your purposes (see variation).

I think that those moves in alphabetical order would even out the game a bit.]

(;W[cf];B[bg];W[hk];B[di];W[cj];B[aj]C[RJ: Your intrusion into the side was poorly handled by w.  Frankly, I think that B13 would have sufficed.  See variation on move 70]
;W[fb]C[RJ:  Hmm, w should not ignore the monkey jump.];B[gb]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[ci];B[bk];W[ck];B[bl];W[dh];B[eh];W[cn];B[bm]
;W[bn];B[df];W[de];B[ef];W[kr];B[lr];W[bh];B[ah];W[af];B[ag]
C[joe:  He gets a nice big corner, but I get to reduce the side a fair bit.

RJ: Fair trade];W[kl];B[mn];W[bi];B[ai];W[fl];B[gk]LB[ig:a]
[go:b]C[joe:  I reasoned that the lower left was still quite large (and moving into the centre) so some reduction needed to be undertaken here.

RJ: Certainly, but don't neglect your own defence. a is a good gote move (worth about the same as G9), and b another good incursion.]
;W[hj];B[gl];W[jk]C[joe:  I should perhaps have heeded the fact that I ws weakening the stones around o10.

RJ:  These stones should have been OK, as they can connect either left or right.  The problem later on was that you left it a move or 2 too late to connect them out.]
;B[hl];W[gm];B[hm];W[fk];B[gj];W[ig];B[if];W[jr];B[js];W[ej]
;B[fi];W[jf]C[RJ: You have let w take control of the game for the moment.  This is OK for the time being, but you should fight back more.]

(;B[hf]C[RJ: Possibly try the line of resistance suggested by the variations.]
;W[jg];B[je];W[kf];B[gh]C[RJ: It is at this point that you should have connected the stones around O10, although that is easy to say with hindsight ;)  Best connection point probably P12 or Q12]
;W[pk];B[ok]LB[qh:a]C[joe:  I can't see why I played this move and not one to connect those stones.  Perhaps fearful of the cut at a (I don't think the ladder works).

RJ:  The cut at a seems to work OK for w, and puts b in some danger.  The best variation I can see is given in the next move.]

(;W[ol];B[rm];W[pg]C[joe:  this cuts off the group at o10 and so I should not have wasted my time playing s7.

This is the end of my set of comments, as it is clear from here that the game is more or less settled (apart from some mistakes here or there).]
;B[qg];W[pj];B[pi];W[oi];B[oh];W[ni];B[og];W[rl]C[RJ:  The result of the loss around O10 is slightly bigger than the loss that would have ocurred by the cut.  Good move by w.]
;B[lf]C[RJ:  There is a lot of fight that you could put uo to save the b stones.  Havn't found a satisfactory soultion, though, to getting them out.]

RJ:

Overall, you played quite well.  The basic strategy at the beginning of the game was OK, although w offered you 2 week groups throughout the game that you could have profitted from attacking (there is no need to always kill a group you attack) by making territory as you did so.

There were some fighting oversights that we all make (I wouldn't even pretend that I am aware of even a small proportion of some of the variations), but that's part of the fun of the game.

Hopefully this review has given you some strategic pointers that you should find useful throughout all stages of the game, and has been of some help.

Best of Luck with future games
