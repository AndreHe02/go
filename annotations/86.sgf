;W[mc];B[eq];W[gq]LB[dn:a][hq:b][cj:c]C[I think this move is not good, because it is pincered between the
B stone to its left, and the two B stones to its right. I would play
W (a), black would probably play (b), then white (c). Thats a fairly
even result in the corner, and limits the potential of black's top
left star point star.];B[eo];W[cm];B[iq]TR[gq]C[Now white's marked stone is in trouble]

(;W[fc]C[Playing here makes black's corner stone thick, then the marked stone
will be pincered. Better to split black in two (see var)];B[ec]
LB[ee:a]C[This is too defensive, if black lives in the corner, white will get
a lot of thickness in this corner, which will work nicely with their
stones in the top right and bottom left corner. Black has to try to  negate that thickness, (a) does that, and also splits W in two.]
;W[fd];B[jd]LB[ee:a]C[Black's left top corner looks too weak for this, B (a) will indirectly
make the corner stronger, and split W.];W[ee];B[cg];W[cc];B[cd]

C[There are two weak groups on the top of the board, white's top left group and blacks single marked stone. If black gets to play around (a), black will connect and whites top left group will be very fragile. White should play (a) themselves. Whites current move isnt very useful. The black group at the bottom is very secure, and it will be hard to make territory in the center.]

[dj:b]C[This does limit white, but it leaves white the cut at (a) which could
become quite difficult for black. better to reduce white from the
other side (at (b)).  Black (b) will limit white on the bottom, keep
connected, and help build pressure on the top left group];W[in]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[me]LB[jf:a]C[Black (a) would split white in two, white's top left  group would have to run to the bottom, so black could chase white and in the process destroy whites bottom moyo.]

because of that, B will take the lead];W[mi];B[lh];W[oj];B[pk]

;W[ol];B[pm];W[pl];B[qm]LB[ql:a]C[This move should be at (a), then white should die. It doesnt matter if
white cuts where black moved, because the black bottom right group
has many liberties. Not playing (a) probably cost Black the game,
up to then it looked like B was ahead. However once white lives, the black stones above and to the left of it will be weak.]

their two (marked) weak groups by playing at (a)];W[qb];B[ro]

[nk][ok][pk][pj][qj][qk][rj][ri][rh][sh][sg]C[Black resignes. (I'm not sure why black resigns now.. B can play at (a) and still save their 11 stones above)

An unusual game, it seemed like black and white were each making minor
mistakes, but the game was fairly even, then white cut (at the bottom white marked stone), entering a zone of strong black influence.
Then white cut again (at the top white marked stone), it could be expected that both those cutting stones would die, instead black made an error (by playing (b) instead of (c) which allowed W to put pressure on the marked black stones, thus making two eyes. From then on, white was in the best position   If any common tendencies occurred, it was that both black and white tended to invade or cut too strongly into areas of the others influence where they did not have sufficient support.]
