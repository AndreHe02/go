(;B[pk]C[This move is a little bit questionable. Taking the initiative is very important in the fuseki, but this move doesn´t put any pressure on white. Better is to play at O16, treatening to attack the white stone at Q14. Then, if white reinforces his stone, you can decide what to do in the bottom right.]
;W[mc]C[now white gets the initiative.];B[oe];W[of]
(;B[eq]C[There are two things to say:
1. white can confine you to the corner now (in the upper right). You would live in the corner, but your stones there would be passive, with no meaning for the rest of the board. So i would say it is necessary to continue in upper right corner.
2. Locally you chose the wrong joseki. You should definitly play a pincer against this stone. Imagin the normal joseki followed by your move and any pincer given in the previous variation.]
;W[fq];B[dq];W[dp]C[this is a mistake of corse.]
(;B[fp]C[this makes things complicate. Not, that this move is bad, but there are simpler possibilities that are very good for black, so there is no need to make the situation more complicate.]
;W[fo];B[gp];W[gq];B[eo];W[do];B[en];W[co];B[hq]C[good. the key in this position is the lower side. If black is able to get it, he forms a huge moyo together whith his two righthandside stones. For this purpose black can give white somethink on the left.]

;B[er];W[gr];B[kn];W[jm];B[km]C[looks very good. now an invasion on the right would turn dangerouse for white]
;W[jl];B[el];W[em]C[this move only helps black to build eyes.]

C[good, but very late now. White will get outside influence here, but it is mostly neutralized allready. On the top white stands low and on the right there are little chances to attack black.]

C[at least white risks a weak group but on the other hand, black has more actual territory so white has to make something aggressive now.]
;B[np];W[ql];B[nk];W[qk];B[kk]C[this is an overplay as you are not able to attack white severe enough, but you risk to be cut apart by yourself.]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[lq];B[mq]C[you should pay more attention now to stay connected.]
;W[lp]
(;B[lo]C[again an empty triangle. this is clearly bad shape. it robbs you some liberties. every time you want to make such a move, there must be an alarmbell wringing in your head, saying you: "bad shape, bad shape, bad shape!" Always look for alternative moves. If you are looking hard and there are no alternatives, then and only then play an empty triangle. here there are alternatives.]

you must be very lucky about that win. I think you can at least 2 stones stronger only by installing the empty-triangle-alarm in your head. For the next games try out to look for alternatives every time your hand wants to add a stone to form an triangle-shape. This is the one thing you should learn from this game.]
