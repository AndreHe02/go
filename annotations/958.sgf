RE[B+4.50]

AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Ok.... 3 handi game... remember the  basics of handi game:   1- you are looking for the influence  2- try to join your handi stones
3- don´t let him get easy territory, make  him sweat for every bit of it or trade him  for equal value, elsewhere.
4- have fun : ))];W[dc];B[jp]LB[de:A][ce:B]C[is it better at K3 ?

R: Depends on what you expect to gain  in  the future... K3 is more territory based,  while your K4 is more influence driven.   Since he played D17(komoku) he is  willing to make quick territory, the other  alternative was to just fight that joseki  out with D15(A) or C15(B)]
;W[cn];B[cl];W[en];B[gp]LB[fp:A]C[a bit too far...it is not bad, but  you might  want to think it at F4(A), it gives  you more  of a base, and keeps lots of  pressure in  the W group. You keep a lot of  pressure  too but it leaves W F5 in sente.]
;W[cj];B[el];W[cp];B[do];W[dn];B[gm]C[If the cut was not that important  why  push? Instead of D5 why not  just jump  out with G7 or G8 ... the way  you played I see that:   White now has a wall, this type  of move  is called ajikeshi ( killing the  possibility),  if you had waited in the future  you could  cut...]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[cq];B[er];W[co];B[ce]C[very good... better than E4  witch is worth nothing, just for  the record how about a  attacking move at C12 to  prepare first? if he doesn´t run  then D11 kills the stone. Just a  thought, your move was a very  very good one, but leaves the  attack-pincer-joseki of C13.]
;W[cg]C[Here it comes ; )];B[bc]C[should I play e 15 instead ?

Yes it is the only solution in  this position. You just took a  worthless piece of territory  compared with the influence he  will make, plus with E15 he  would not be able to join his  forces. This was a very bad  move, but the game is not yet  lost.]
;W[de]C[See? he lets you take the  corner, and joins his forces  AND makes a big awsome wall  out if.]
;B[cb]C[Of course just because you  made a bad move isn´t reason  not to think in better ways to  deal with it:  life in the corner...  or cut with D14?  I think you made the right  decision...]
;W[db];B[cd];W[dd];B[hd]C[Now... this move had the right  thinking behind it but a better  player would have creamed  you. It is too close to  opponent´s wall and too far  from your (lonely) stone at Q16.]
;W[nd]C[White makes big mistake. He  should have played at L16 . It  would put a lot of pressure on  your H16 stone AND prepare  for a O16 drive. VERY bad play  by W.]
;B[ld]C[See? Even if you attack his  stone you still have H16 so far  away it still has a weakness  between them. I instead of H16  you had played J16 your  position would be very, very  superior.  Remember not to reach too far,  you may lose a arm ; )]
;W[cf]C[Again wrong move by W, first  C17, threatens to kill.]

;B[nb];W[qe];B[pe];W[pg];B[og];W[ph]C[This actually worked very well  for you... W gets aprox. 17  points, B gets aprox. 15 solid  plus all the points he can get if  he can join H16 with M16 plus  a HUGE influence.   Besides you get SENTE!!!

White played that corner VERY  VERY poorly.];B[qk]C[Nice extension, leaves Q7 as  invasion point though. As you  are so far ahead this was the  time to play a more  conservative game, Q7, R7  were the best I think.]
;W[qj]C[White did not invade??? He is  too far behind to just let you  play like this.]
;B[ok]C[Good, Best was the  more solid extension to Q9];W[qq]
;B[rp]C[is this move better at Q2 or R3  ?(you must mean Q2 and R4??)

YES!!!!!  You are ahead... just simply  play a easy joseki, let him try  to trap you and lose more...  Besides YOU CAN NOT KILL A  3X3 INVASION!!!!!   If I where to choose between  Q2 and R4 I´d take Q2... your  right side stones (O9-R9) are  weaker than your bottom side  ones (K4) so your group will  help them when he "leans"  twards them in the joseki.]

Yes you should have saved  that group, expecially since W  has the exelent tesuji of N3!!]
;W[kn];B[lp];W[kp];B[kq];W[lo];B[ko];W[mo]C[Did i do the right thing by  sacrificing my m7 stones ?

It´s ok to sacrifice 4 points if  you can make more in some  other place... now that you  have the sente, maybe fix the  weakness with H14, or expand  with E10. But did you HAVE to  sacrifice to live? I don´t think  so...]
;B[jn]C[a little weak but ok...];W[jm];B[in];W[mr];B[mq];W[gn]
;B[ho]C[NO!!! You just let him cut you!!   Why not just descend to H6?]
;W[hm];B[gl];W[hl];B[eh]C[is this a mistake ? where  should I play ?

R: Your position is good all  over the board, the only thing  that is still open is the upper  side and those five stones that  are under attack at the 8th-9th  line in the left of the board.    Or you save them (if you can  save them in sente it would let  you play at the top and it would  be perfect)   Or you trade them for a big  piece of territory. Your play at  E12 is trading for territory...  pretend interest in the 5 stones  but enclose the most territory  you can. E12 can not save the  5 stones.To save them I think  the best play is G9.]
;W[eg]C[Bad White play... best is E10  and make you run for your life  in 2 fronts... the 8th line stones  and the stone at E12.]

There are a lot of variations in  these last 3 plays... you would  inprove a lot if you had a good  look over them... if you want we  can talk more about them in  another e-mail. : )]
