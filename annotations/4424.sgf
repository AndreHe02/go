C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game in first place.
I don't know what I did wrong. I thought it would be an easy win cause my opponent is weaker than me but this year I lost some times with him.
I think my fuseki doess't have a clear idea of what I want to do.
Please could you check out my mistakes?

BA: Hey, nice to meet you. I'll try my best to review your game and identifiy the mistakes. I hope you find the review enjoyable and useful. 

First of all, a general rule in all games is to never underestimate your opponent (but don't overestimate him either!).]

BA: I agree, but I believe that it's relative.];W[od];B[mc]

BA: This is quite an uncommon move... I don't believe it leads to any good results for White. See variation.]
;B[re];W[pe];B[rf];W[qc];B[rc]C[kinda weard joseki??? bad for W??

BA: I think so...See earlier variation for a possible approach.]

(;W[qb]LB[pc:A][ob:B]C[
BA: If your aim is to attack the isolated black stone (marked with a triangle), I really prefer a move at A. See variation.

The reason is that with this move, Black gets a forcing move at B, which, if ignored, leads to quite a lot of reduction.]
;B[qi]
(;W[md]LB[kc:A]C[
BA: I dislike this move. I think it should be a pincer around A instead. 

By attaching, White is strengthening this Black stone, while he should be attacking it. Furthermore, since Black made the longer extension at R11, White can use a leaning attack more efficiently here. See variation for a possible continuation.]
;B[ld];W[me];B[fc];W[hc]C[bad choice?

BA: Does White have a choice? :) Letting Black settle comfortably would just be going too easy on him.]
;B[cf];W[fd];B[cc]
(;W[dc]LB[ec:A]C[
BA: The normal move in this position is at A. See variation.]

(;W[cm]C[
BA: Black is strong in this area, so I don't like this choice of move. Perhaps a higher move would've been better. See variation.]

[rs][ds]C[anyway thx for reviewing my game.

BA: I think the main reason why White lost (even though only marginally) is because White went too soft on Black for most of the game. I have tried to give what I think would have been a tougher approach, in the form of variations.

I'm also human, however, and might have given completely wrong moves and ideas. If you find any such mistakes, or would like to ask any questions, please contact me. Thanks.]
