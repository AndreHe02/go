AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi,

i hereby request a review of this game for both players.
It has been played at 15-Dec-2005 on KGS between ye[22k\] as B and jug[myself,18k\] as W.
Edited SGF with cgoban-2.6.12.

* Info about the game:
19x19 with handicap 4 stones, Komi 0.5, without time limit (took ca. 3 hours).
Actually this was my 2nd handicap-game, so sometimes i was a little helpless.

* Info about my reviewing:
I've included my and our review-comments, but moved some to the move before (hope that's not confusing).
Included my thoughts along with questions starting with label 'jug' (instead of 'jug[18k\]' from the normal game-review).

When i marked moves, marker 'A' is always the main-road of playing for the current player, other markers are about alternative thinkings for B or W.
Maybe you can add reviewer comments starting with a prefix you prefer.

What i would expect:
- there are many different ways how to play handicap-games. Please comment the main-mistakes (when violating principles that should be considered in handi-games) for both players.
- i included some of my "understandings" how to play handicap-games. if these are flawed, please correct them
- correct and/or show better ways to cut/connect
- when to play locally or tenuki
- maybe you find some words about order of some moves
- correct moves that gave up -> propose sente-moves

Well, enough introduction, let's start ...

Thanks in advance for your effort of reviewing this game, Kind regards, jug.]
;W[qf]C[ye [22k\]: hallo
ye [22k\]: enjoy
jug [18k\]: hi
jug [18k\]: nice game
Ben:  I wanted to start by first saying that playing a handicap game is pretty much the same as playing an even one.  Your rank is higher than your opponents so you can be confident he will probably make enough mistakes such that you can exploit and overcome the handicap.  That said, there are a few special cases where people employ certain joseki, usually considered inferior in normal terms, in order to bamboozle their opponents into defeat.  Simply put it would be better for someone of your level to play as you would during a normal game and try just keep the biggest point on the board.  If you do this I think you will find yourself pleasantly surprised as you should win at least half your handicap games this way (try to rememeber the handicap is meant to give either player and equal chance to win).]
;B[qe]C[Ben: Now see here already a mistake.];W[pf]C[jug [18k\]: it's really hard to play handicap games sometimes]
;B[nc];W[qi]C[Ben: The extension should be one move further (r-10)]
;B[qm];W[pn];B[qn];W[qo]LB[po:A]C[ye [22k\]: yeah, really tough handi

;B[nk]LB[ml:B][ql:A][cn:E][mo:C][fq:D]CR[ol][pl]C[jug: played 'A', where better 'B' ... ?
Ben: And also now A is necessary for the previous moves to make any sense and you end in gote, otherwise the marked stones are just "heavy."]
;W[ql];B[cj]C[jug [18k\]: omg, that was hard];W[bd];B[cc];W[bc]
;B[bb]LB[fc:D][cd:A][cf:B][cg:C]C[jug [18k\]: don't know the joseki for this
ye [22k\]: don´t either
ye [22k\]: mostly play intuitive
jug [18k\]: but anyway, it's not good to play joseki in handi-games, because the situations become to good for B
jug [18k\]: so W must confuse B
jug [18k\]: ... without getting confused for himself ;)
ye [22k\]: :)];W[cd];B[db];W[ec];B[dc];W[ed]C[jug: big no no (make groups weak), better line of play propably starting with move #33]
;B[de]C[ye [22k\]: maybe i could bring top right corner alive but i didn`t dare
jug [18k\]: sometimes the contact play R15 is not so good in handi-games
jug [18k\]: it makes me stronger
jug [18k\]: and leaves a weakness in corner
ye [22k\]: i see
jug [18k\]: but B did a bang-up job in left-corner, or W a very bad one (now 2 weak groups)]
;W[hc]LB[jc:A][kc:B]C[jug [18k\]: maybe better at 'B', safe

jug: how to approach W here ?
Ben: A or B have their pros and cons, it's a matter of taste in my opinion.  Tenuki is also an option as k4 is quite large.]
;B[jc]C[ye [22k\]: hard to keep overview]
(;W[lc]C[Ben:  White should make their first group stronger, see variation.]

ye [22k\]: no way out
ye [22k\]: either this or that

(;B[nd]C[Ben: This move seems fine.];W[qd];B[pe]C[Ben: Again a fine move.]
;W[rd]LB[pc:A][re:B]C[Ben:B all the way, white is just dead.]

(;B[mh]C[jug [18k\]: you know that can be cut ?
ye [22k\]: i thought to connect either to K-group or elsewhere
ye [22k\]: maybe i felt too safe

jug: what is best here ? first make life (if possible, how?) then escape ?

Ben: Hmm well white is not alive yet.  I believe it is a ko.  Black could use the ko and make threats to escape or kill the white corner. eg:]

(;W[ng]
(;B[mg];W[mf];B[og];W[nh];B[oh];W[ni]LB[od:3][qd:4][mf:5][of:B]
[pf:2][ng:1][rg:A]C[jug [18k\]: better at 'B'
ye [22k\]: yes
jug [18k\]: 5 groups now
jug [18k\]: keep opponent cut
jug [18k\]: that's very important in handi-games
Ben: Not sure if I woud play B, white has some outside influence. n18 and t16 are miai although I think its the same ko situation if white tries to play n18 first. So black probably needs to settle his group and get n18 before white so that should preclude black playing at B.]

(;B[rg];W[se];B[mi];W[oi];B[lb];W[mb];B[kb];W[nb]C[Ben: Possibly N17 better?  Less ko threats anyway.]
;B[ig];W[kh];B[mj];W[of];B[kj]
(;W[fp]C[Ben: This high move wont do enough for you.  Play low kakari.]
;B[cn];W[dq];B[cq]
(;W[cr]C[jug [18k\]: i always make that mistake ;)

jug: better here (maybe variation) ?]
(;B[dr];W[eq];B[br];W[er];B[cs]
(;W[eo]C[Ben: White really ought to play around k-4, although even then black can reduce.  For example:]
;B[do]C[Ben: About a one point move..];W[en];B[dm]C[jug [18k\]: boah, it's soo difficult (that's my 2nd handi-game)
ye [22k\]: take ur time
ye [22k\]: (and ur strong)
jug [18k\]: you play very good too
ye [22k\]: :)
ye [22k\]: (try my best)];W[hf]C[jug [18k\]: now tried to give upper-group a base]

(;B[if]C[Ben: The other way looks more damaging to me.  Lets see.]
;W[je];B[jf];W[id];B[jd];W[he];B[ic];W[ff];B[ce];W[cg];B[be]
LB[bf:A][eg:C][bi:B][ii:D][fl:H][ll:E][em:G][km:F]C[jug: played at 'A', what's better here ?
- C: connect
- D: cut
- E/F: attack/reduce/enlarge-moyo
- G/H: more thickness (maybe not good because wide open) ?
Ben: Well A looks pretty much useless so I would say all of the above on what it is better.  C seems a little timid.  D might be  too aggressive, I mean you would just be making your other group weaker.  I propose g-12 which should give you life and threatens the move at D.  A move at F or k-6 looks necessary at some point.]
;W[bf]C[jug [18k\]: that was not good
Ben: You are correct.  He doesn't even need to prevent a-15 due to the snapback.]
;B[ad]C[Ben:  Here black should just play d-13.];W[dk];B[ck]
;W[dl];B[cl]LB[hb:H][ib:G][hh:I][ii:F][dj:A][fl:C][ll:D][em:B]
[km:E]C[jug: played at 'A' (gote), what's better (sente-play) here ?
Ben:  I dont see any awesome sente plays although certainly I and F are sente and G would take away blacks one eye for that group.  Honestly A seems as good as anything, in a way it threatens to play at B if black doesn't push through there.  Although that could be moot since you still need to make a move like E.]
;W[dj]LB[lm:D][jp:A][jq:C][nq:B]TR[kh][kf][lf][mf][me][ld][lc]
[mb][nb]C[jug [18k\]: and that neiter
jug [18k\]: neither*
jug [18k\]: you take sente
ye [22k\]: yes, always same mistake
ye [22k\]: ok

jug: would interest me if variations are likely to work that way, or if general idea behind that or similar moves is ok ?
Ben: Okay I added some comments in your lines of play.  Ill give a brief overview of the these moves:
B is Aji-Keshi, it just doesn't do enough for you and gives him a free monkey jump.
C is about the same as A.
D is perhaps to tame.  I would only recommend D if I knew I would get the marked stones. But in fact that is semiai which white wins comfortably.]

(;B[jp]LB[lp:A]C[jug [18k\]: bang
jug [18k\]: it is still possible
jug [18k\]: but not on 4th line
jug [18k\]: you can't make a base there

jug: played at 'A', better to cap or other move ?
Ben: Well you need to play A at some point to make shape, so doing it now just puts the onus on black, which is what you want to do.]
;W[lp]C[jug [18k\]: for example here
ye [22k\]: have to learn more about strategic
jug [18k\]: this drives you to the left
ye [22k\]: yes
jug [18k\]: on the left you can't make territory, but i gain some on the right while attacking]

(;B[lm];W[kn]LB[hg:D][jh:E][jl:B][fm:C][hn:G][in:F][jn:H][mo:A]
C[jug [18k\]: what do you wanted to do ?
ye [22k\]: so played there where you would
jug [18k\]: it's good to think of a plan, then search for moves to accomplish that
ye [22k\]: ah
jug [18k\]: for example: "escape with center-group" or "connect upper-groups" or "reduce center" ...
ye [22k\]: ok
ye [22k\]: yes

jug: best for B here ? 'B'... or other move ?
Ben: Well best was not playing m7.  There are a lot of things black could try to complicate the issue.  The question is if he needs too.  If black feels he can win with it then B may be best (looks too close to call to me).  Otherwise he may have to try something like at H or A or F and start trying to muddy the waters.]

(;B[mo]C[ye [22k\]: no, it looks nice

jug [18k\]: this was too ambitious

[jl:A][fm:B]C[Ben: B hardly seems different than the mainline.  A and C could become important but I think they are not right now. I would be a little worried about black trying to cut through at m5, if anything he doesn't lose anything and he could get a semedori out of it.]

ko-threats of B at '1' ..., more ?
which ones can be used, who will win this ko-fight ?

Ben:  This was probably an okay time to fill for white.  It's impossible for me to tell the score but I think white is ahead so just fill is fine.  That would be the only thing that would dictate whether or not to keep the ko going for me.  The other thing is people usually reserve their larger ko threats for later in the hope that you will keep it going and white can't really afford to lose this ko (they refer to this is a picnic ko for black).]
;B[ej];W[gh];B[hm];W[hn]C[Ben:  Unless I miss my guess, black could play j12 here which is a little better (he wont lose 2 stones) and would definetley force white to capture the group around o17.]

jug: final comments ?

Ben: Both players played a really tough game.  I predict you will improve a lot if you keep playing and analyizing.  There were some mistakes early on like black's handling of the top right or white's debacle on the bottom.  You both also made some really high level moves especially later in the game. 

For black I would say just work on making strong groups and practicing some of the fundamentals, life and death, good shape and bad shape, bamboo joints and empty triangles and the like. 

For white, I would say try not to be so exhaustive in your analysis when you submit games here again.  It makes it a little difficult to give variaitions.  Let your annotator surprise you with what he comes up with.  Maybe just save some of your more lengthy lines on your own computer unless you think they are really important and you want the annotator to definetly look at some conclusion in them.  Shorter lines are of course much prefered.
That said I don't think either of you have any deficincies that can't be corrected by simply playing more and watching stronger players play (especially pros).
