;B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[en];B[ip]C[this is the first move where I cringe a little.  It's
too close to f3-f4 and and is likely to lead to
a very ineffecient shape.

At this point I would probably play O3 instead,
or if you're in an agressive mood, perhaps D14,
aiming to eventually exploit the weakness of his
high move at e6.];W[kq];B[jq];W[oq]
(;B[mp];W[mq]C[ScarletFox [13k?\]: hehe, mine should have been one lower :-P

Despite my comment here, I think that taking the top was probably the best idea at the time.]
;B[kp];W[lq];B[lp];W[pq];B[np]C[If you accept the general direction of play, I think 
P4 is better, strengthening the single stone.];W[nq];B[qp];W[qq]
;B[rq];W[rr]
(;B[lr]C[Hey look I can take a few points by jumping in here!!!!...not.  Don't know why I did this really, its just a bad move.  L2 puts my in my place immediatly but my opponent did not do that.

Yea, this is a BS move.  You can't play s3 without
following up.];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[kr]
(;W[mr];B[gc]C[Another bad move.  I should have closed the cut available at R5.

Given the play, yes, but the real mistake as M2];W[jc];B[dg]
;W[dj];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[ec]C[It's usually a bad idea to attack from weak
groups on both sides.  White gets a stronger
group between two of your weaker groups.];W[dc];B[db];W[ed]
C[should have played c18 first];B[fc];W[ce];B[be]
(;W[bf]C[this is white's immediate mistake.];B[cf];W[de];B[bg]
;W[cb];B[eb];W[ad];B[af]C[too me this looks like joskei...although in favor of white because of his stone at E10.

I don't think any Joseki leaves the favored party with
one eye.]
(;W[ba]C[If he played at C19 I would have left it alone.  I don't know why he played here.  A misclick maybe?

White's corner has one eye any way he plays it.
At least this way he only needs one more move
to make it real.

However, both sides "knowing" this, white shouldn't
play anything in this corner.  It's just wasting a Ko
threat.   White has to escape and it looks pretty
dicey.];B[ab]C[Force only one eye (why not)];W[ac]C[I start to go crazy here with variations.  For the most part I know I played horribly, though I'm still uncertain if I can stop whites second eye without dying myself.  In some case I win, some I lose.  This is the part where I would like advice really.

I think C17 is also a mistake for white.  The
difference between no eyes and one eye is
not significant.  If white eventually escapes,
he'll probably have lots of eyes and not need
the other eye here.

As black in this situation, I wouldn't attack
directly as you do.  Instead work around
the outside and make white bleed on every
move, trying to retain the eye potential without
making tenuki locally.

The problem with a direct attack like this is that
if it fails, you're left with a scattered and unstable
position.

Things are different if you can see a direct line
of attack that succeeds.  My candidate for a direct
attack is F14.  

On the other hand, what does white do in response
to K10?  He might make a move that he hopes will
save his group, but let you carve out a huge moyo.
Or J16, which maybe just leads your top group out
of trouble, but maybe also threatens to make an
enclosure possible.]
(;B[ge]C[Trying to net the opponent.  If I play one more down, he cuts me off at G16 and connects out to K17.  so I belived this to be the best play.]
;W[ae];B[bf];W[ef]C[Here are another dozen variations on where to play.  My move 61 at G12 is incorrect after playing several varations out.  If white plays E13 he has more liberties then my B14 group and I could not find a way to stop it.  The correct move is E13 for me.  But white always escapes in the end.  The correct sequece for this would be useful.

My move would be E13, forcing white to play F14.
Keep white running toward your wall on the
other side of the board, but keep your stones
double and therefore hard to threaten.]
(;B[fh]C[---fails to E13, I'm fairly certain.];W[gf];B[fe];W[ff]
C[more variants here.  I mainly did this for the bamboo joint I get while maintaining sente.  E13 still works at this point for white.]

(;B[if];W[hg];B[ih]C[More attempts at a net

Net full of holes.  A net of single stones
is only viable when the other side is desperately
short of libterties.  Single stones are too easily
attacked.];W[hh];B[hf]C[To me this makes my stones here less weak, and it forces white to bunch up again.]
;W[gg];B[gj]C[at this point I start fearing for the saftey of my group on the left.]
;W[hi];B[hj];W[ii];B[jh]C[He's escaped, I see that here, but my stones need  support.]
;W[ji]C[at this point black has clearly lost the attempt
to form a net, and had bettter stop chasing
and pay attention to all his vulnerable groups.

There is some compensation on the top, because
whites lone stone is not a good foundation for
anything.   Likewise, there's some opportunity
to shore up the left side by attacking at D8.];B[lh]C[... so this continuation is a bad idea - adding more
weak stones where they will not create any
meaning ful threats or territory.];W[ki];B[jj];W[kj];B[kk]C[I have a nice moyo up top, and I don't want my wall on the bottom to go to waste either.  so I let him have his eye.]
;W[jk];B[lk];W[ij];B[ik];W[hk]C[This starts an odd sequence.  I'm not sure if I played it correctly or not.]
;B[il];W[jl];B[jm];W[im];B[hl];W[km];B[jn];W[gk];B[fj];W[hm]
;B[gl];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek];B[cj]C[My stones are fairly connected on the bottom but my group at B14 is still in limbo.  I'm pretty sure this is the time (if not sooner) to save them.]

If I had japanese langauge on my computer I'm sure I could read that....]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[dh]C[I didn't really understand this move of his.  I really expeted him to play E8 and make me fight for my group of 5 at F8.]
;B[ci];W[ch];B[bh];W[eg]C[This move was purely Gote for white.  left me the free kill of his E9 group (which I later botch anyway)]
;B[df];W[ee];B[dl];W[gm];B[em]C[There was no need to kill his stones at this point so I felt that this was a better option.]
;W[cm];B[dn];W[dm]C[ScarletFox [13k?\]: probably too agressive...]
;B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[fm];B[cl]C[Lack of attention I suppose.  Really its my only explanation.  If this was actually a better move...then I'd be surprised.]

ScarletFox [13k?\]: was not payin g attenting
ScarletFox [13k?\]: well that royally sucsk.];B[bo]C[at this point, this is small change.  The
big areas everywhere else on the board beckon.
M17 comes to mind.  And Q10.];W[eo];B[cq]C[Overplay I'm sure.  But After I just lost 5 stones I was bound and determined to gain them back.]

;B[lb];W[pc]C[Another complicated sequence.  I don't know the best moves here.  I wanted the right side, because I knew that he'd have very little space to live anywerhe else.

;B[ho]C[I took nearly 30 seconds to go here.  I could not for the life of me figure out where to go at this point.  Most of my stones are connected, but I could not find any sente moves anywhere.  Conneting my stones out just gives white a free move, so I tried to gain a few extra points here.]

ScarletFox [13k?\]: blehh...
------
I've played through this ending sequence in dozens of ways.  I've got scores ranging from B + .5 - B + 10.5  Depending on how well white or black plays through the sequence.  My end game certainly is terrible, and this game has a complicated one.  I'll play through it again sometime to refresh my memory, and see if I can make White win in the end, or if I can outscore 10 with black, playing correctly of course.]
;W[co];B[cm];W[em];B[sk];W[sj];B[sl];W[op];B[oo];W[so];B[sn]
C[Yes.  This is a bad move.  Its a dumb move.  Very very very very stupid.  My correct move is R6.  And it took me looking at R6 for 30 seconds to decide...oh wait...I don't need to play there....how silly of me.]
