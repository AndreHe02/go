AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[siamgo: Remember "Don't play close to the thickness and Play
from the weaker side" If you understand this you'll get stronger
rapidly.];W[jq];B[fq];W[mq];B[oq]C[RainOnLevs [22k?\]: Pretty defensive at this point. . .

siamgo: white 2 stones here is strong enough, don't need to add
any more stone, better play else where.];W[hq];B[dm]LB[jd:K]
[co:J]C[siamgo: this move neither take a corner nor side. I prefer playing
at J to take corner or switch to the top, bigger point at K.]

(;B[md]C[siamgo: this move makes it too easy for white, better approach

White should answer by playing at G16.];W[cc]
(;B[cd]C[RainOnLevs [22k?\]: Hmm. . .D17 instead?  More solid connect with
F17. . .

siamgo: this is ok to block this way. Actually this is bad for
white.];W[dc];B[ec];W[bc];B[bd];W[eb];B[fb];W[ea];B[fa];W[cb]

(;B[fe]C[RainOnLevs [22k?\]: Liked this move.  Could I have pushed it to
F14?

(;B[cf]LB[eh:J]TR[ch]SQ[jc][gc]C[RainOnLevs [22k?\]: You know, this should have been a bad thing
for her. . .

siamgo: Attack from strong position is not good. This move is
very bad for white. It create another weak group for attack.
right now white has 2 weak groups. You should try to attack both
at the same time.  The first fundamental is enclose the escaping route for white.
Black should play at J to enclose the / stone and connect black
stone from top to bottom build up a powerful thickness facing
center.];W[dj]C[RainOnLevs [22k?\]: Did I need to ansswer this?  Would I have
been better off capping with D12?

siamgo: you have to answer. If you don't want to help white making
good shape, you can answer at C9.]

C[RainOnLevs [22k?\]: Really started to lose it at this point.  I wasn't sure whether I should be trying to hold her in from
the center, or protect my guys on the lower left.

siamgo: the problem is black got cut off now. You have to make
live which is not good because white can get a thickness toward
center to support any invasion in black territory. Yet, all black
stones don't work well together.]

it was the best way to prevent a connection and save that group.]

;W[ol]C[siamgo: After this is very difficult for black to win the game
since black lost so many stones on the center.
I'll end my comment for now.
