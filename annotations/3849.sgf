C[alaric: Hello, my name is alaric and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'm around 16k KGS, so take anything I say with a grain of salt, it's not all that long ago that I was 30k.  All my comments will be preceeded by "alaric:".  When I use a japanese term for the first time I'll define it in case you don't know it.  If you already do, all the better.  I'll comment on both black and whites play throughout.]
;B[dp];W[pp]C[alaric: Nitpicking already.  I would suggest not trying to get too fancy while you are trying to learn.  Playing in the near corner could lead to a diagnal points opening (for example BQ16, WD16), which is uncommon, and therefore a skill that is less useful.  Better to simply play in the diagnol corner from blacks opening and keep things simple.]
;B[dc];W[pd];B[gq]C[alaric: Odd opening for black.  The shimari (corner enclosure) at D15 or C15, one of the chinese openings (D11, C11), or an approach adjacent to your 3-4 stone (O17).]
;W[nq]C[alaric: You generally don't want a move like this for a couple of reasons.  The knights move extension from a 4-4 stone is slow.  You also chose to extend down a side where black has already played a move, if you wanted to do this then O17 would be better.  At this point though a more standard move would be an approach on the D17 stone (at C15 or D15), the sanrensei (3 star opening) at Q10, or a extension on top at K16.]
;B[ci];W[mc]C[alaric: Again this is slow, if you want to extend on the top K16 is better.]
;B[gc]C[alaric: The largest open space is on the right side.  On top of that white has two shimari facing that side.  Black should invade at R10 here.]
;W[jc]C[alaric: Q10  is much bigger.];B[qj];W[ql];B[qg];W[qe]
C[alaric: Probably better at R16 or S16.];B[og]C[alaric: Better to extend on the other side as that would apply pressure to the weak R8 stone.]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[jp];B[iq]C[alaric: A crosscut here would likely settle both sides.  Since black has the early advantage it is better for him to avoid complications.]
;W[kr]C[alaric: A bit early to be playing on the second row.  The second row is called the "row of defeat".  The side that is playing there more often is usually losing.]
;B[jr]SQ[iq][jq]C[alaric: Empty triangle is a well known bad shape.  J4 is better, no reason to play on the second row yet.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[ho]C[alaric: When you leaving cutting points you are basically going into debt.  You "owe" moves to cover those points at some time during the game, so make sure when you do this that what you get out of the play is worth the risk of leaving that cut point open.]
;B[kp];W[lp];B[ko];W[io];B[go];W[gn]C[alaric: Too aggressive.  You are already cut, you can't afford another weak point.]

;B[en];W[eo];B[em];W[cq];B[do];W[cp];B[ep]SQ[fn][gn][eo][fo]
C[alaric: The marked stones are already dead, this move doesn't serve a purpose, better at C5 or D3.]
;W[dq]C[alaric: C5 is better here.];B[fp]C[alaric: Pointless move.]
;W[co];B[dm];W[cn];B[eq];W[er]SQ[pc][de][je][df][pj][ln][qp]
C[alaric: This is an endgame move, save it for endgame.  C7 is good locally, but you could also tenuki (play away from the local position) here.  The marked stones are all possible plays.]
;B[fr];W[es]C[alaric: Better just to connect at D2, but this is a small threat, you don't need to answer it immediately. A sente (move that requires a reply from your opponent) move here (such as an invasion of the top left) would be appropriate.]
;B[fs]C[alaric: Pointless move, if white pushese at F1 black can play G1, there are much bigger moves on the board.]
;W[dr]C[alaric: Same as previously, you can afford not to play this move at this moment.]
;B[gr]C[alaric: Extremely pointless, white can't cut there.]
;W[js]C[alaric: Very small, save this for endgame.];B[is];W[ks]
;B[hr]C[alaric: Pointless as well, black keeps covering holes that aren't there.]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[bl];B[bk]C[alaric: Over reach by black, C9 instead.]
;W[ck];B[dl];W[bj];B[cj];W[dk];B[ej];W[jj]CR[ko][kp]C[Maybe attacking his two stones instead maybe have been better?

alaric: Yes, and this is too far an extension as well.  M6 kills the marked stones.]
;B[ln];W[lm];B[mn];W[nl];B[nm];W[om]C[alaric: N7 instead.  It threatens to cut at O6, and helps connect the previous two stones.]
;B[mm];W[ll];B[ml];W[mk]C[alaric: Alot of cut points there.]
;B[nk];W[nj];B[ol];W[lj];B[ok];W[pm];B[pj];W[mg]C[alaric: That's a bit of a stretch, try to stick to one point jumps when fleeing.]
;B[cf]C[alaric: That was a very long time coming, a big point for black.]

;W[oo]C[alaric: Good.];B[no];W[pn];B[nn];W[np];B[lo];W[ng]SQ[pc]
[hd][qp]C[alaric: Unnecessary, better to defend the corners, or expand towards the center.]
;B[oh];W[jg];B[gf];W[hg];B[hj]C[alaric: Better to respond to white's last play.]
;W[gg];B[ff]C[alaric: Black shouldn't fear the crosscut, he's got lots of friendly stones around.]
;W[fg];B[eg];W[eh]C[alaric: Often it is better to  play to the other side first (E14), black will atari (for example at D14), then you play E12 in sente, which gives you time to protect the cutpoint at F12.]
;B[fh];W[fi];B[gh];W[dh];B[ei];W[gi];B[hh];W[hi];B[dj]SQ[ci]
[ei][cj][ej]C[alaric: Black already had a bamboo shoots formation, no reason to connect that way, E9 better.]

(;W[rc]C[I think I should have spent more time to think here. S19 would have been better

alaric: This is the Rectangular 6 in corner with no outside liberties.  This is the only time you can kill a shape with a rectangular 6, and you are right S19 kills here.]

[on][ko][lo][no][kp]C[alaric: R14 makes Q13 a false eye.  P8 is already a false eye.  If black plays Q11 then white Q13, if black plays anything else, white Q11.  Either way white kills the entire marked group for around 60 points.]
;B[ik];W[jk];B[il];W[jl];B[im];W[jn];B[ed];W[gj];B[gk];W[ij]
;B[hk];W[bi];B[bh];W[mp]SQ[ga][ee][if][ah]C[alaric: This move is gote (a move that looses initiative), and only worth 1 point.  Don't play small gote moves while sente moves remain.  G19 and A12 are double sente (a location where both black and white have sente moves), so they should be played first.  E15 is one point in sente.  J14 is one point in reverse sente (by playing you remove a sente move for your opponent).  All of which are better than a 1 point gote play.]

;B[am];W[an];B[qf];W[rk]C[alaric:  Unnecessary.  if Black cuts, capture at T11.]
;B[if];W[jf];B[qq]C[I lost 2 corners from the 3x3 invasion when I had it surrounded already. Is there a way I can prevent the loss?

alaric:  This is probably the most common question asked by beginners.  We should start by understanding the purpose of the 4-4 opening.  A 4-4 opening does not claim the corner, it is a influence play.  It's value is in the power it projects towards the center of the board.  So when you play the 4-4, you can't really think of the corner as "my corner".  If you want corner territory you can take it by opening 3-3, or opening 3-4 and forming a shimari.  That said, you can at a later time claim the corner.  The most common play is play a 3-4 stone.  You need to have some help (such as a stone a knights move away) on the side you don't cover with the 3-4.  You could also simply play the 3-3 stone yourself, if that makes you more comfortable.  Lastly, as in this case, if you have alot of strength to the outside you can play S4 in this case and deny black eye space.  This allows black to "escape" to the center, but since you have the center surrounded that doesn't help.]

[fn][gn][eo][fo][fq][hq][ir][qr][gs][hs][ps]C[alaric: There are still points left on the board.

alaric: You played a good bit better than you opponent in this game, but there are a few things that you seem to do incorrectly.

1) Your opening is a bit slow.  You are trying to lay down a framework for future growth, do n't be too concerned with controlling concrete territory in the opening (specifically the knights move extension from a 4-4).
2) You leave too many cutting points.  Believe me when I say this, as you go up in rank those cutting points will kill you.  All other things being equal, the first person to create a weak group loses, and leaving cutting points is an invitation for a fight.  Make sure every time you leaving a cutting point that you have read out how you will respond if you are cut.
3) Don't dwell on the local play.  This was evident at the bottom of the board during the early game, both you and your opponent wanted to fully settle the position.  This is unnecessary, there were many oppurtunities for either of you to play big points elsewhere with little damage to the local formation.  You should continually be thinking "What would my opponent do if I don't answer his last move".  If the damage they can do is less than the value you will get by moving some place else, then tenuki.]
