C[I am only interested in fuseki and middle game (until move 102). In particular, my choise of joseki, mistakes in joseki, direction of play in fuseki and middle game. Mostly strategy but also some tactics as a way to correctly realize certain strategy.

Hi Andsok75.

Well I don't pretend to really understand the opening very well, but I will try to assist as best I am able.]

both O4 and Q14 are week but I am not sure how to deal with them best

I do not necessarily agree with both of those. I think O4 is Ok, but Q14 is questionable afterwards because R12 is good extension and pincer combination. Also the O4 stone is alone against two stones, and if black plays again here, his advantage will be large.]

This is "fancy" - at least its a variation of Joseki I haven't seen. That doesn't mean it isn't joseki, but I guess all I'm saying is that it is complex, and its beyond my meager abilities to say if its good or not.  But I am not able to find a good follow up - basically black either ends up getting split and the F17 group comes under attack, or black is small up on top and white gets excellent prospects on the left.

Playing to "stop white from getting a big moyo" may not be the best idea. If your opponent is intent on getting a big moyo, its often best to let them get it - making them pay for it of course. Otherwise you will be responding to them instead of implementing your own plan.]

I think killing the corner is quite reasonably large even at this point. Its around 30 pts. A17 or A18 would do the trick.]

***************

Andsok75,

You are a fairly aggresive player. I believe your aggression is due to the fact that you do not want to let your opponent have anything. At the first hints that he is going to make some territory, you jump in to try to stop it.

The result of this, as you have seen in this game, is weak groups that need a lot of care, get split, and often die.

I think you would benefit from doing some rough counting to ascertain how much you need to invade, and how much you need to simply reduce, or expand your own territory.

In your calculations you should take into account weak groups that have one or no eyes. A rule of thumb I have heard is -10 points for a group with one eye, -20 points for a group with no eyes. This is obviously highly innaccurate, but it does force you to at least consider the cost of having weak groups on the board - its a big problem!

You'll find that if your groups are stronger, your attacks become stronger. So in this way defense can be used offensively. Sometimes you should not attack because you cannot attack with strength. Your opponent will get territory, but you will get more (if you do it right).

I hope this is somewhat helpful.

Thanks,

You are greedy.  If white plays this way, blcak plays at D6, builds strength enclosing the corner and can use that to deny territory to white on bottom and on the left. This is a good way to play I think.

The bottom is low and has too much black strength around it. White will not get much there.]
