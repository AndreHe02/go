Rab> This game I thought was going well at first, but it quickly turned against me. Any comments or suggestions you could give would be appreciated.
Thanks.

mb> I'll try to explain some general concepts where I see fit. There are several major mistakes on your side as well as on the opponent's.]
;B[dp]C[tsyuman [25k?\]: thanx u 2];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp]C[mb> Perfectly normal...]
;B[jp]LB[nc:E][qf:D][dj:A][qj:C][nq:B]C[mb> Ok. Everything from A to E is also possible. This is (as most things in fuseki (= opening)) a matter of personal taste. I would prefer A or B/E.

mb> A is the so-called sanren-sei (three starpoints (= hoshi) in a row). It often leads to large "components" (read moyo). Whereas a move like D splits everything up into small pieces. This can be harder to play for a beginner since the relationship between those pieces can get quite complicated. So I would recommend A. But as I said: play what you want to play.

mb> As you will see, I'm a go-proverb-fetishist. In general they contain some truth. But don't take them to seriously. They are advices but not laws. "Cut your opponents stones apart, keep your own stones connected." D16 and D4 are fairly far apart. D10 "connects" them together. Whereas with K4 you have two groups.]
;W[ip]LB[fc:E][cf:D][cj:A][pj:B][cn:C]C[mb> A typical beginner's move. Keep your distance. This move starts an unreasonable fight. There are still large points like A to E for W.]

(;B[jo]LB[jq:A]C[mb> Ok. I would prefer A. The edge is very important. At the edge it is easy to make eyes and it is easy to make territory, since the edge is a natural border.]
;W[jq];B[io];W[ho]
(;B[mq]TR[hq]C[<rab> Perhaps a play at H3 would have been better here?

mb> Hmm... I don't like H3.];W[hq];B[gp]C[mb> Ok. Playable peep.]

(;W[fr]C[mb> W should connect. H5 is an important stone. It currently splits B into two groups. "Cutting stones are important stones!"]

(;B[gq]TR[hq][fr]C[mb> The white stones form a keima (= knight's move, like the move of a knight in chess). "Cut it or avoid it". Either the cut works. Then cut (if this is your strategy). Or the cut does not work. Then leave it as is. Then your opponent has to worry about a possible cut all the time. Remember? More problems for your opponent = better for you.

mb> In this case the cut does not work. So leave the situation alone. Cut at H4 instead. Maybe you want to play on G2 later on. (Depending on the situation.)]
;W[gr]C[mb> Now the cut has vanished and B has only strengthend W.]
;B[ir]C[mb> Just look at the current situation. There is a single B stone. Surrounded by a lot of W stones. This move can't be good. At least not in this stage of the game. Later on this would be an important point concerning eyeshape. But now still the cut at H4 is important.]
;W[jr];B[eq];W[fq];B[fp];W[er];B[dr]C[mb> Now B is happy. Secure corner. Nice wall. Now you really see the value of H4!]

(;W[ds]C[mb> Endgame. Don't play moves like this as move number 24. The value is to small. B will tenuki. No matter what.]

(;B[cs]C[mb> Endgame...];W[es];B[cr];W[is]C[mb> H4!!];B[dj]
C[mb> Good! But still cut at H4 first. (Sorry, for repeating. But H4 is huuuuuuge.)]
;W[lr]
(;B[lq];W[kq];B[kp]TR[jo][jp]C[<rab> should this stone have been at M4?

mb> This shape is not favourable. Maybe M3 should be at M4. The marked stones form the so-called "empty triangle". Avoid this shape where ever possible. However since the ladder works for B, it is playable here.]
;W[lp];B[lo];W[mp];B[np];W[mo]
(;B[jj]C[mb> Learn to read the ladder.];W[no]C[mb> W is happy.]
;B[oq];W[op];B[jd]C[mb> Ok.];W[lc]C[mb> Now H4 and W is in trouble. B controls the whole left half of the board.]
;B[nq];W[pq]TR[np][lq][mq][nq][oq]C[mb> These black stones are mostly likely dead. No chance to get eyeshape.]
;B[jc];W[kb]C[mb> To early. In the endgame this is a huge point. A so-called double sente, because it is sente for both players. But now its value is to small. W should be concerned about the left half of the board.]
;B[ll];W[gd]C[<rab> An invasion began here that I dealt with very poorly.

mb> General rule: If you are strong, fight hard! You have influence in the lower part of the board. And you have four "handicap" stones around. This has to develop into a tough for W.

mb> Concerning the invasion stone: Better invade on the third line (read: g17). Playing on the fourth line means: I don't want to live. If necessary I want to run away. But where should W run in this situation? No allies in sight. B whereever the W stone looks. The only reachable allies are in the top right. So basic plan should be: Invade on the third line and use the aji (= potential, possibility) to link up to the right to build a base.]
;B[fc]C[mb> Good. Keep the W stone away from the edge. In the center it is difficult to get eyes. And here B is strong in the center, so it gets even more difficult.]
;W[dg];B[ef]C[mb> Good. Split W into two.];W[fg]TR[ef][eh]C[mb> In general a one-point jump is very stable. But if one of the marked stones is in place, the opponent may immediately cut through. This is only in special situations desirable. Eg. for sabaki, ie. you use one part of your group as sacrifice in order to get living shape for the other.]
;B[eg]C[mb> Good. More or less mandatory.];W[eh];B[ff];W[gg]
;B[dh];W[ch];B[di];W[df]
(;B[jg]LB[de:A]C[mb> Mistake.];W[ee];B[fe];W[ed]
(;B[de]LB[fd:A]C[mb> Again a mistake.];W[fd]
(;B[cg];W[cf];B[bg];W[ph]C[mb> Mistake. W should capture E14.]

(;B[be]LB[ce:A][bf:B]TR[cf][df][dg]C[mb> Right direction, but: take a liberty of the cutting stones. This would revive e14 and cut W into pieces! A complete desaster for W.]
;W[ge];B[bf];W[gf];B[ff];W[ef];B[fh];W[fi];B[gh];W[ei];B[gi]
C[mb> Nice result. But W is not really in trouble since the single stone at the top is really weak.]
;W[fj];B[gk]C[mb> Weak jump. (see earlier)];W[gj];B[hj];W[hi]
;B[hh];W[ii];B[ih];W[ij];B[ik];W[hk];B[ji];W[gl]LB[fk:A]C[mb> W should connect. The ladder does not work.]

(;B[hj]C[mb> Good.];W[fk];B[hl];W[gk];B[hn];W[gn];B[gm];W[fm]
;B[hm];W[fo]C[mb> This one cannot work since g4 already peeps into the tiger's throat.]
;B[go];W[hp];B[fn];W[en];B[eo]C[mb> Black is connected again. Good.]
;W[bi]C[mb> Those stones are captured. No way to rescue them. But B should keep in mind that the D12 stones may come under fire.]
;B[el];W[em];B[dm];W[dk]LB[ci:A]C[mb> The three black stone are cutting stones! They keep B11/C12 dead and make territory on the third line! Rescue them. (eg. A)]

(;B[dn]LB[fl:A]C[mb> When playing in this way, then capture the stones!]
;W[fl];B[ek]C[mb> As seen in the game, this one does not work. Try to exercise reading situations like this one. It's only three moves and the moves are fairly obvious (ataris).]

(;W[rp]LB[rq:A]C[mb> Mistake. This move should be on A. Then B is dead.]

(;B[ns]LB[rq:A]C[mb> Wonders happen from time to time. A and B is alive.]
;W[ms]C[rab [24k?\]: you did very well on the left there....can't believe you invaded there!

mb> The invasion was pretty normal. Don't confuse a moyo with secure territory. I've seen enough games, where B lived where W had a moyo before and W lived where B's moyo was. That's pretty usual.]
;B[os];W[qs];B[rs];W[qr]C[mb> The group is still dead.];B[sq]
;W[rq];B[oo]C[tsyuman [25k?\]: thank you u did as well in the center]
;W[on]C[rab [24k?\]: actually.....i think you've won it from here though

mb> Giving away everything you had on the left, was the loosing mistake. Allowing W to run downwards was no good.]
;B[oj];W[po];B[ol];W[ql];B[ng];W[qj];B[lf]C[mb> You can't expect to make much territory here. This only helps W to strengthen his positions at the border. W doesn't even have to bother about the bit of territory in the center....]
;W[of];B[mf];W[nf];B[og];W[pg];B[oi];W[oh];B[nh];W[pk];B[le]
C[<rab> by this point i thought I had lost the game unless i could extend the center potential, it didn't go that well though and perhaps securing the center would have been better?

mb> No. The center _has no_ potential. The big central territories grow from the border into the center. "center-only" territories are not big enough for the number of stones you have to invest.

mb> Even allowing W to live on the left was not the problem. The problem was to let W destroy to much territory. Compare the situation now with earlier, when you had the three stones at d12. Huuuuge difference.]
;W[ld];B[md]LB[qc:A]C[mb> Keep such weaknesses in the opponent's wall. Invade at A.]
;W[ne];B[mc];W[nc];B[mb];W[lb];B[nb];W[ob];B[nd]LB[oc:A]C[mb> Not very likely, that B will survive here.]
;W[oc];B[qc]C[mb> To late.]
(;W[na]LB[qd:A]C[mb> Thank-you move. Should be at A];B[pf]C[tsyuman [25k?\]: its to late for u to try to penetrate that arrea

mb> Tough words. It is more or less correct, but after such words he has to prove, that he can kill you. And this is probably not possible anymore. See variation after next move.]
;W[oe]LB[pe:A]C[rab [24k?\]: yep probably, but i've lost if i don't get it right? :-)]

;B[ca];W[ea];B[cb];W[bc];B[bd];W[hd];B[id]C[<rab> how should i have defended this center area?
