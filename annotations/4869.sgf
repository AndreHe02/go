C[Hallo!

Here I have a game that ended with a clear loss, but which is very important for me to understand some principles.

You can just focus on my questions, that would make me already happy :). Of course, when you see some real big mistakes, feel free to mention it.

Thx very much!!! in advance, I appreciate your effort and teaching without charging money.

[Harleqin\]: I am your reviewer. Thank you for submitting this game to the GTL.]

(;W[de]C[[Harleqin\]: C11 and D6 are both a bit slow, though perhaps playable. I think D15 is too slow, because it allows Black a perfect point. A better idea might be to probe at Q2 now, before Black expands his moyo further.]
;B[jj]C[rs: Is that ok as Fuseki for White? In my opinion it should be still even....

[Harleqin\]: The development until now makes this move at K10 a very good point for black. 
The rest of the board is quite evenly divided, but there is a sublte difference: Q9 is high, while C11 is low. Black's formation is rather center moyo oriented, while White's emphasizes more territory.

K10 is consistent with Black's moyo strategy and also aims at reducing or invading the white formation. I think that it puts Black ahead.

K10 is also the last big fuseki point. You can perhaps look at http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tedomari to see what this implies.]
;W[go]C[rs: In these big moyo games I'm always concerned where to play the first "tight move" Here I played at g5. Is that ok or are there better places and why would it be better to play there?

[Harleqin\]: I think this is not too bad, but I wouldn't play like this.

Usually a move like G5 has two purposes: building the own moyo and reducing the opponent's. Here, K10 already serves to reduce the white moyo, so this aim is somewhat smaller.

The black moyo has become the central theme of this game. 

I think that White has to become a little more active, for example, invading somewhere on the right or lower side.]
;B[cr]C[rs: How to react on this move. I saw it never in my previous games. Did I play it right?

[Harleqin\]: The easiest way to refute this trick play is C3 (see variation). I think that Black also makes a mistake in direction here, because the main theme is the center in this game, not the corner territory.]

(;W[dr];B[dq]
(;W[cq]C[[Harleqin\]: Blocking on the outside might be a better idea here (see variation).]
;B[eq];W[br];B[fo];W[do];B[fn]C[[Harleqin\]: This result is good for Black, because F6 harmonizes very well with Black's center moyo. The stone at G5 looks like a lost move now.]

(;W[ei]C[[Harleqin\]: I think that this is too slow. Black has already got two very good points (K10 and F6), while White has lost a move's efficiency (G5), so I think Black is well ahead. White has to find a way to catch up.

The right side is the most open right now, but perhaps one could try to use whatever is left of G5's aji for an invasion on the lower side.]
;B[fl];W[dl]C[rs: Is that move at d8 too slow or ok to secure territory?

[Harleqin\]: Definitely too slow, in my opinion. White is already very strong both in the lower corner and in the upper half of the left side, so this is only endgame, and gote for both. Doing something about the black framework is much more urgent.]

(;B[hc]C[[Harleqin\]: I think that this is not the right idea for Black. It is not necessary to enter here, because he is already ahead.

White now has a chance to get back into the game. My idea would be to build as much thickness from attacking this stone as possible and then invade somewhere in the lower right.]
;W[jc]C[rs: Is that move at k17 ok or are there better moves?

[Harleqin\]: I think it is good, strengthening the own weakness while denying a base to the black stone.]
;B[he]
(;W[gd];B[hd];W[jf];B[hg];W[gf]C[[Harleqin\]: These peeps are not useful. Especially G14 helps Black more than White. See variation to move 32.]
;B[hf]C[rs: Where would you play next? Would you still focus on attacking the weak black group or would you try to invade somewhere (and where)?

[Harleqin\]: I find it difficult to attack this group in a meaningful way now. 
Invading at the bottom seems viable, perhaps at P3, M3 or L4.]

(;W[qh]C[[Harleqin\]: You should be aware that by strengthening Black's outside here, you also help his weakish group at the left. I think that you should aim to split the black groups more, e.g. invading on the fourth line, or you could first probe the lower right by attaching to Q3.]
;B[og];W[qk];B[ql];W[qj];B[rl];W[pj];B[ok];W[rf]C[[Harleqin\]: I think O11 is better, splitting the black position.]
;B[qe]C[[Harleqin\]: This move is not very effective, since R17 is open anyway, and White can run out. I think Black should play around P10 or O11, closing white in and strengthening his center.]

(;W[rk]C[[Harleqin\]: I think that the natural move for White would be to move out at O11.]

(;B[gg]C[[Harleqin\]: This seems too submissive. Black allows L11 to connect, thus weakening his moyo greatly.]
;W[gh];B[fh];W[fi];B[ff];W[eg]C[[Harleqin\]: This is good for White. L11 provides good support for an invasion at the lower edge.]
;B[ge]C[rs: In my opinion now I made the mistake not to strengthen my group around m17 (e.g. with a move at O15), instead I tried to pressure the black group. Do you think the same?

[Harleqin\]: White now needs sente more than anything. The best way would be to try and strengthen K17 in sente against the black group (it is difficult to kill it), then invade the lower side. The next best way seems to be to invade directly, though that gives Black the opportunity to strengthen is own group in sente against K17.]

(;W[gc];B[hb];W[fc];B[lc]
(;W[lb]C[[Harleqin\]: The normal way is to play N16 or M16 here.]

;B[od];W[pg];B[fg];W[gj];B[ee]TR[kp][lq][oq][pr]C[rs: Now here I should be able to kill black easily with a move at d14 e.g. just to make it safe. Do you think the same?

In the following sequence I totally blow my territory and at the end my opponent lived there and I resigned.

Nevertheless: Let's suppose the black group would be "safed" by White and it would be White's turn. Where would you play now as White? I assume that one would try to invade the big black moyo, but how and where? Can you show me a sequence?

[Harleqin\]: So we'd assume that black dies in gote here... please see the next variation...

I cannot tell you how an invasion would develop, this is where your own creativity is called for. You might try one of the triangle-marked points, then look for sabaki.]

[Harleqin\]: My impression is that, in this game, White started off rather slowly, but didn't realize that he was behind at all. I think that you should try and apply some positional judgement to decide which measures are called for. It is strange that the deciding fight developed in White's framework when Black's framework was much bigger.]

(;W[cq];B[dr]C[[Harleqin\]: This way, C2 clearly is a bad move.

The reason can be seen by tewari analysis: If instead of C2 Black had played the normal D2, and White answered with C3, then Black definitely should connect by H4, not crawl to C2.

C2 is just endgame, and way too early.]))
