C[pajaro: Hi. I'll review your game. I'll mark my comments with pajaro and I'll try to make your mistakes clear.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[cp];W[dd];B[eq];W[cj];B[cf]C[pajaro: That's too early for an invasion. There are a lot of big points still, no need for this yet.]
;W[fd]
(;B[ci]C[pajaro: Contact play. No good. Use them for defense. Here you have a better way to settle yourself. See var.]
;W[cn]C[pajaro: 3-space extensions. Too long. Black can invade in the middle and fight, as he's stronger than you on both sides.]
;B[cd]C[pajaro: Again contact play. It might be joseki, but don't play them always. Better B16.]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[de];W[jd]C[pajaro: White should protect E16 and get territory. See var for what black can do.]

(;B[qf];W[nd];B[qc]
(;W[pc]C[pajaro: White should learn some standar patterns. This is too good for black.]
;B[qd]
(;W[qn]C[pajaro: White should press a bit before tenuki.];B[nq]
;W[qj]C[pajaro: Again, a 3-space extension. Too long, black could invade.]

(;B[jq]C[pajaro: This is too low. k4 makes much better balance.]
;W[qp]C[pajaro: Again contact plays...];B[qq];W[pq]C[Here I wasnt sure if I could do that.]
;B[oq];W[pr];B[qr];W[po];B[op]C[pajaro:... and again, black gets the best. You can't really say who's the attacker with this contact moves. That's the reason why they are not good.]
;W[qg]C[Here I had no idea what to play];B[rg]C[pajaro: Nice. Now black is safe in the corner.]
;W[qe]C[pajaro: ??? What will white do when black plays Q15?]
;B[pe];W[re];B[rf];W[qb];B[se];W[qh];B[rh]C[pajaro: This is not good. Black plushes on 2nd line. But black is already safe, so he is actually helping white.]
;W[ri]C[pajaro: Now the white group is a lot safer.];B[pf]C[pajaro: No need. Black can capture S15 whenever, so no need to defend this.]
;W[ch]C[I thought I could cut these 2 groups apart

pajaro: Unreasonable. Look next comment.];B[bi]TR[ci]SQ[ch]
[cj]C[pajaro: 2 stones for each player, but 1 black group, 2 white groups. It is white the one who is cut appart. Also, black in strong on the side. Any fight will favour black.]

pajaro: True. But even with C8, white will have a hard time to live.]

(;W[gg];B[cl];W[bl]C[pajaro: The 2 white stones are captured. Don't increase the loss.]

;W[hh];B[ne];W[md];B[me];W[ng]C[pajaro: No. Play M16 instead. it secures territory, and defends against a hane.
Also, white seems to be going for a big moyo in the center. But this is hard, since it's open at the bottom and the top.]

pajaro. well, perhaps white n8 now?

Pajaro. anyway, here are my last comments: you both play too many contact moves. Get ride of this habit. Also, try to read a bit and consider strong and weak positions. Play and watch stronger players a lot, so you can have a feeling of where to play next. And, of course, enjoy!]
