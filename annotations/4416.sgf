AB[pd][dp]C[CommanderW:Hi, I am reviewer for this game. I'll call myself
CW.]PL[W];W[pp]C[I played white.];B[dd];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj];B[nq]
;W[lq]
(;B[qn]C[CW:I think this move isn't good since White can occupy 3-3. Normally,
Black can make a one-space jump or enter 3-3 point.]
(;W[qq]C[I saw this move in games of Go Seigen, but the following moves
seems to get me a bad result.

CW:This move is very good and your fighting is fairly well. But
please note that if you don't have much confidence in your fighting,
you have an alternative. Just play kosumi (diagonal move).
One more thing, you can't use this technique if there're not
White stones on both side to attack Black.];B[oo];W[po];B[pn]
;W[on];B[no];W[om];B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[ok];B[qj];W[lo]C[CW:Good.]
;B[mn]C[CW: Black should throw these stones away, it is now heavy (hard
to save, hard to throw them away) and serving no purpose (take
territory, attack, etc.), so it's just Black's burden.
Concept: Any stone that is doing nothing is as good as dead.]

(;W[iq]C[CW: This move lets Black off the hook.]
(;B[gq]C[CW: And Black let slip this golden opportunity too!]

(;W[jo]C[23 seems to be o.k., but 25 is probably a slack move, but what
is your proposing?

CW: As you have seen, yes it's slack.];B[ml]
(;W[mj]C[CW: Good, the right side group still has some bad aji (potential),
so an attacking move that helps them is of course good.];B[rp]
;W[rq]
(;B[ro]C[CW: Not a standard move. It loses some forcing move.]
;W[or]
(;B[nr]C[CW: Wrong shape.];W[oq]C[CW: Very good. Now you have a cut at O4 as a bonus to your larger
corner.
Concept: When your opponent misses the vital point, you must
take advantage of it.];B[np]C[Cw: Ow...This is just about 17-18 points gote endgame move.
Concept: Better to die just 2 stones than dead whole!];W[kl]
C[CW: I don't know which surrounding move is best. But every moves
places Black in trouble. One more slip  and the group dies and
the game ends.];B[lk]
(;W[pi]C[CW: Now it's White who let slip the golden opportunity. The lower
Black group is alive, so this move does almost nothing.];B[qi]
C[CW: Well...this can be called a bad move that let slip another
opportunity or a good, stubborn move backed-up by some reading
that the center black group won't die.];W[ph]C[CW: I know it's shape...geez. The White stones' very over-concectrated.]

(;B[rd]C[Now the white center group seems to become weak and I play on
this site, but so I weaken the bottom white group.

CW: The center White group is strong...in fact it's too strong.
Black plays form the wrong direction. He should help the center
first.];W[lm];B[mm]
(;W[li]C[CW: As I've told, the shape here is knight's move.]
;B[kk];W[ji];B[jl]
(;W[ln]C[CW: This move have no pressure on Black.];B[ik];W[jj]
;B[jk];W[hn]C[CW: This move gains nothing since the bottom group is strong.
If you don't know how to attack , you can leave it alone for
a while.
Concept: A good attack must gain something., If you don't know
how to play in an area, leave it until the environment changes
and you may know how to play.]
(;B[cf]C[While I thought we have to fight on the bottom, black ignores
my moves and take one territory-move after the other (g3, s16,
c14).

CW: I think all three moves are bad, but you just can't land
knockout-punch on him. You have no real territory at all so you
must have some strong or even killing attack to be in the game.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[do];B[dq];W[cn];B[bo];W[dn]C[I want to build thickness to attack the black center group.

CW: That's good plan! I can't think such a plan because I'm Territory-crazier.
You may have counted territory and know that you're around 45
points behind. So contesting on it is useless. The only way to
win now is to kill the center group.];B[bp]
(;W[dj]C[CW: This move says "I resign". You should attack more strongly.]

(;B[fk]C[CW: This is like running into opponent's strength]
;W[gj]C[CW: Good.];B[gk]
(;W[fj]C[CW: Wrong shape, but if you have read it all out, you can play
it.];B[dk]C[CW: I don't know what will happen next. It's too complex.]
;W[ck];B[ej];W[ei];B[ek];W[cj];B[fn];W[fo];B[go];W[gn];B[eo]
;W[fm];B[fp];W[hl]C[It´s a pity that I have to play this move and give black h9,
but if black cuts, it seems, he is able to catch some of my stones
and I fear the semeai with my bottom group. Should I fight for
all?

CW: I think this move is unneccessary. Your bottom group has
very good box shape so it should be alive. And your 2 stones
has miai (two equivalent ways) to connect.];B[hk];W[em];B[hi]
C[Now Black can escape.

CW: Are you sure?]
(;W[fi]C[Later I tought, 83 would be better at f12.

CW: Of course, and the Black group is still in danger.];B[ii]
C[CW: Now the game is over. The black group escaped.];W[id]
;B[ig]C[CW: Very good.];W[fd]
(;B[ff]C[I try to establish the balance of territory.

CW: No, you can't. As I told, it's around 40 points.
Anyway, This move seems to be strange shape.];W[dc];B[cc];W[ec]
;B[kg]C[CW: Good. Black can give anything. If the group survives, he
wins.];W[qh];B[rk];W[mk]C[CW: Why make this exchange? You gives Black half an eye here
and gains nothing.];B[ll];W[kc]C[I secure the center group in sente and take this big point. But
all in all: I have to small territory.];B[mh]C[CW: Black's leading, there's no need to fight. And he misreads
it too. No more comments except the summary at the end.];W[lh]

I think I´m 20 points behind.

CW: In this game, White has got a good start by getting a chance
to attack two weak Black groups. But White missed some vital
points and let both groups live while taking some large points
too.
My advice: For White, watching professional games will be good
for you. You'll learn shapes and vital points. Don't try too
much to understand it, just absorb the feeling in the moves.
For Black, I don't know if you're Shinogi-style(take large points
first and try to survive weak groups later) player or not, but
your play's too risky. I don't think Cho Chikun or Sakata Eio
will leave the center group to play S16. For both, counting territory
is extra-important, you can't be good at Go if you don't do it.]

(;W[hl];B[hk];W[ei]C[CW: This is the shape for attack. By just looking at it, I think
it'll die. Anyway, Cho Chikun may not agree with me. :p (Meaning:
I can't read it out.)]))

lives he wins, if Black dies he loses.]))
(;B[fk]C[CW: Counting territory is very important aspect of the game.
If black knows that he's ahead by 40 points. He'll play this
move and winning easily. All the blame is for White slack moves
(K5, Q11, M11).]))

follow it with knight's move. In this case the right side is
weaker so this move is better.];B[kk]

in sente too.];B[sq]C[CW: Black can capture T4 stone in sente. White can't resist or
his whole group dies.]

(;W[lm];B[mm];W[kk]C[CW: If the right White group is strong, then an attacking sequence
is something like this.

has power, of course.), so he must make a move that is too close
to each other to live. And you can make moves at 100% efficiency
to gain advantage.]))
