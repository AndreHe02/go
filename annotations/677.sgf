C[i am black 7k IGS against a 6k.
i had like to know what i did wrong in chasing a group that ultimately
was able to live, & at that time i was a lot behind.
thanks in advance.

At the start, black played some suboptimal moves.  Later white gave him the chance to capture a large group.  Capturign this group was certainly enough to win, so black had better played safely.  Then white saved his group using a number of tactical mistakes of black.]
