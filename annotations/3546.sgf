C[Greetings,
   This is a game I weas doing rather well on, until about the 100th move, where I pretty much tossed it out the window. Despite having it in the bag (at least I'm fairly sure I did) up until that point, my opening stank to high heaven. I am a great deal better than I used to be, but any general advise you could give me on improving my starting moves would be greatly appreciated.


Hi, I'm Cap, I am about an 8kyu at KGS.  You can reach me at silvus@gmail.com.  I would be happy to answer anny questions you might have.  On KGS I play as Silvus.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[cg]
TR[cf]C[This move is kind of asking for a cut.  Why invite a fight when you could clamin territory and settle the corner with c14?]
;B[ce];W[de]C[Was this too aggresive? I though about sliding along the 2nd line, but I thought that gave black to much upper thickness, and it really ended up serving me well

It worked, but you lost the top and the corner, in exchange for a smaller side.  I would have gone c15 and tried to settle what i had.  Black would get center influence in exchange for you recieving real solid points.  In the end points not influence wins.]
;B[dd];W[be];B[cc];W[cf]C[moronic I know, while replaying it, I relized I should've gone to B16. He could'nt do anything to me at this point
 
we all make mistakes:)];B[cb];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb]TR[jc][kc][jd]
[kd]C[While I understand your desire to keep up the attack, I think a move to the center is much more devastating to black.  It decreases what he get in middle. And most important it assures a solid life.]
;B[lc];W[qd]C[Another one I thought was to aggresive to start with. My thinking was, depending on his reaction, I could put a base in the cornerand live small, or run out and possibly live at the same time

When attacking you shouldnt think, "well I should be able to live small."  Small life takes many stones, Put those stones elsewhere and make large life.]
;B[pc];W[qc];B[ob];W[qb]C[base, and I am happy. My throw in stones didn't go to waste, and I can still run with the O17 stone. I'm in the hurt zone right now, but I'm far away from his thickness on the left, which isn't all that thick just yet, and I could've even possibly wrapped around and pincered.]
;B[oc];W[ld];B[nb];W[ic]C[I'm playing a much more aggresive game now, I realize. MY thinking all the time at least is "We can fight or you can make me run, but if I run and make it, you won't get something I could'nt get anyway.


The problem with this strategy is if you dont get away, you lost the game, when your only started fighting over a tiny reduction.  The goal is to win areas and if there is to be a contest try and keep it to the area your fighing in, unless the area it will go to can support you.  Don't start large and unknown outcomes.]
;B[kc];W[ie]C[I'm thinking this is a pretty snazzy setup. I've got a good shape right against his line. If he drives me left, I get thickness that spans half the board, and ife he tries to drive me up (don't see how), I can use the D17 stones to live. and if he just walls himself in, I get some heavy stones that can quickly turn thick


I'm with black on this one.  You have a nice shape, but he is in the position to cut it, and so he does.]
;B[kd];W[me];B[ke];W[mg];B[kg];W[ig];B[pj];W[nq]TR[pm][qm]C[Plan was to moyo the lower edge, or sweep around if he turtled

I would have went here and tried to decrease his lands.];B[mi]
TR[mb][mc][lj]C[to greedy of him? Or is he wouldn't about the L17 stones?

I think that would have been my move.  His move wasn't too greedy, It was too close. The closeness allowed you to slide through.  L17 is pretty safe without his move.]
;W[lh];B[li];W[kh];B[jg]C[this is where I think things could've really gone differently. Is there a way he could've cut off both my J15 stonse and my N15 ones at the same time?

I think he missed his chance to cut u off with m11.];W[jh];B[if]
;W[hf];B[jf];W[hg];B[he]C[A little pear shaped, but it could've been worse]
;W[ge];B[hd];W[gd];B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[gb]C[I thought this was pretty slick, myself. I've never been able to hit aji this well

It decreased his moyo, but you might have tried to make your other stones live.]
;B[fb];W[qn]C[standard joseki. I figured his stones were far enough away to not be much help.]
;B[pn];W[qq]C[this turned into absolute junk, as you can see. Thoughts? maybe S3, R4, or just toss the R6 stone and Q3?]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[rn];W[qp];B[qm]C[agan pear shaped. His walls are turning out far better than mine, but I still thought I had the upper hand]
;W[oq];B[do];W[cm];B[fo];W[em];B[ep];W[bp]C[too defensive? My other thought was F3, and try to wedge him into that slot between my lines

I am a firm believer in something that is settled is alive and if you are going to start a fight, it is best to do it with settled stones.]
;B[eq];W[hp]TR[jp][kp][jq]C[thoughts? There was no chance he'd pincer me, at least I don't think, and at best just run out or down, and I'd just improve my lower moyo

I would have gone with the triangles.  But i try and play a more balanced game.  I am happy to let his group make a life so long as i just made a larger life, and if my making the larger life forces him to make that smaller life, so much the better.]
;B[dr];W[co]C[was worried about B B5. Not enough room to live there

indeed];B[cq];W[cp];B[dp];W[kq]TR[kp]C[I tihnk you got lucky he didnt cut right where you layed your stone.  or above it.]
;B[gr];W[hr];B[gq];W[hq];B[ll];W[ik]C[At this point I was ecstatic. I'd screwed up several times in a row, but had some beautiful moyos on the bottom and left, and B's moyo was about as wide as mine]
;B[gm];W[gl]C[best I could think of, considering I was dealing with a crippled horse. B G8 would've been better I think, as I would've had to split into two chunks at least, especially consider how close his support was.

Yeh this looks like your only real recourse.];B[fl];W[fk];B[fm]
;W[el];B[hl];W[gk];B[hk];W[hj];B[il];W[ij]C[two bad shapes right next t each other, but  I was near euphoric now. At this point, were I black, I probably would've resigned. I think my leads around 25 points, especially after I hit his crippled horse.]
;B[jl];W[ej]C[big problem having to deal with this bad shape. Rather lucky he didn't try there. It would've been a mess]
;B[mh];W[lg];B[ng];W[nf];B[og];W[of]C[should'nt have pushed here. Worthless. O6, N6, M6, maybe even L9. This mistake and the three in a row that followed cost me the game

If you see that you screwed up and are low on time.  All you can do is try and recover.  Don't let one mistake lead to more.  Either cut your losses, or secure your stones.]
;B[pf];W[rf]C[moronic. S15 gets life, and does the same thing

yup that one cost you the corner.];B[re];W[rd];B[rg];W[pe]C[double moronic. helps black and hurts me. Don't ask me what I was thinking

you were rushing.];B[qe];W[oe];B[rb]C[and squish. Now I'm behind 10-15. I couldn't see life, except for a ko with T18. Would that have worked, or am I being optimistic?

dead, best you can hope for is to use it in a ko fight.]
(;W[ra]LB[ra:A][sb:B];B[sb];W[sd]C[not I could pull a fast one on him]
;B[pa]C[but no dice];W[nm]CR[ci][cj]TR[nn][no]C[I like the cut this move makes. its a good spot for black which means it is a good one for you.  but you tade up some stones in reducing him rather than going at one of the triangles.  all in all i think it is balanced either way.  This whole game i have been waiting for black to intrude at the circles,  he could have earlier and it woul dhave been game breaking.  I think it is safe now but could be mistaken.]
;B[no]
(;W[mo]LB[ln:B][mo:A]C[another dumb one. I wasn't focused at this point though, consider I knew I'd probably just lost. M6 better?

no i like n5];B[nn];W[mm]TR[mn]C[But i like n6 here. Let that one stone go in return for a wall and more points.]
;B[mn];W[ln];B[lm];W[lo];B[kn];W[ko];B[jn];W[jo];B[io];W[ip]
C[so my best invasion was halted in its tracks, but I got some 4th line territory out of it at least]
;B[ho];W[gp];B[go]
(;W[kj]LB[bc:B][kj:A]C[better moves? I'm really curious what he would've done with J18. There was enough there that I might've had a shot of saving my corner stones, but I doubt it

Your corner stones are his.  let them go];B[lj];W[kk];B[bq]
;W[dn]C[bad aji I figued was worth more than];B[rp];W[rq];B[so]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[ha];B[ia];W[ga];B[ib]C[no realy play options, but six or seven ko threats in a row at least]
;W[bc]TR[fe][ge][ff][gf][hf]C[This spot is very unsound.]
(;B[bb];W[gs];B[fr];W[aq]C[this a trick I learned from playing many faces, which is as merciless a teacher as you can get. Is it a bad idea to leave floating sente moves out there like this?

never let go of sente, not ever.];B[sq];W[rr];B[ac];W[bd];B[pq]
;W[pr];B[ar];W[ap];B[br];W[lk];B[mk];W[kl];B[km];W[ml]C[was thinking snapback, but he saw that easily. Doubt it would've worked, considering the extra liberty at K9

Dont try and win with a trick.  It is true that you won, but there is no honor in it.  Also if the oppenant sees through the trick, they almost always get free stones.]
;B[om];W[fe];B[eb]C[just as subtle, but I was running out of sente moves, and was already pretty much out of time]
;W[op]C[anything better?

not that jumps ot at me.];B[po];W[ki];B[le];W[md];B[lf];W[mf]

[ro][dq][cr][er][as][bs][cs][ds][es]C[And thats the ball game. My loss by 24. With the corner alive I win by ~4, and probably would've done a lot better, as I would've have been as distracted and flopped so bad on my invasion at his crippled horse. So I guess I only have two points I could still use some serious advice on:
1: What improvements can I make with my opening? Am i too passive/aggresive or do I keep setting myself up to run away?
2: What can I do to tell whether a group is uncoditionally alive? Until that flop, I thought my corner group was.


1.  You played this one too aggressive.  My advice is on your next game, try to win by 1 point.  Count the whole game and just try and win by one. Be sure that you win but dont go for the fireworks display of slaughter.  let the only conflict on the board be about space not about stones. 

2.  The only way to know life is to play and to play and to read it and read it again.  It is a struggle that just gets more complicated later on.  

This was an exciting game.  I hope what I have said and shown you has helped.  Feel free to email me with thoughts/questions, and i'm always open to setting up a game if you want.]
