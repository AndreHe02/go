Hello, and thanks in advance for the review of this game.

Both of us were ranked at 18k at the time of this game, which we played on KGS.

I play much more on the Dragon Go Server than I do on live games. When the clock ticks, my mind tends to go blank and I play reactively.

There are a couple of obvious gaffes in this game, and a failed attempt at using a probe. Other than those lapses, I'd appreciate knowing where I misssed big moves or made bad shape.

Of course, tell me anything else I need to know as well!

Thanks.

You both failed to keep sente in the second half of the game. Sente is very important, since through sente moves you can lead the game where you want to.

You both have made many moves which were worth obviously less than other available moves on the board. It is important to look at the whole board after each move and not simply follow the sequence of recently played moves.

You misjudged the strength of your stones which were lined up on the upper right early in the game and then made a few local mistakes which cost you a lot.

You both left the other player turn a big moyo into territory whithout any serious reduction.]

> 8-)... It's not a very fortunate move to start your attack as it doesn't pose an immediate threat, so white can just make sure you don't have enough room to live.

His gaffe here put me a bit closer. Yet I think my chances to reduce white's very large lower right were either fading or had evaporated. Was there a chance at this point?

(;B[qj]C[> About this move and some others: this is one point gote, that is you don't force white to answer and its worth one point as you would lose one point if white had made that move. So: low value and white can decide where to play next.
Compare that with A13 for instance which is sente, since if white doesn't answer he risks losing six stones, so at this point of the game he will certainly answer. The value of the move is a little more complicated to compute: compare the two variations I included: your move there instead of this one and white's move there as the next move.]
