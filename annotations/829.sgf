C[LoP: Dear reviewer, this is a game played with a good friend of mine on NNGS.  As we will both read your review would you please comment on black's and white's moves. We added our questions at specific moves but feel free to comment other moves as well.
My main interest is my direction (esp. moves 10, 20, 44, 90, 94 and 122).

bommel: My main interest is how to figth against white's big moyo. it's the biggest problem I face in all my games. do I try to reduce to late, or is my reducing strategie bad?

djna - A difficult game to comment on, the game seems to me to be characterised by  1). Some strange tactical outcomes. There are a few occasions when unexpected things happened.
2). Several occassions when things were left unresolved. Groups assumed to be live or dead when I think they are unstable.
3). Some moves where the direction of play seems to be wrong
My general feeling is that the "real" game is over once the invasion of the moyo is resolved. You both have questions about things that happened in the yose, but I don't see that as where the real problems for either player occurred. Yes there were clever moves in the yose and some blunders but these did not seem to be due to lack of understanding. I'd recommend a focus on the earlier stages of the game.

This may be my own way of learning, but I don't think that seeking out complex fighting sequences in a game review is useful. If you can't  read it over the board then it's very hard to apply to the next game. So unless some common tesuji is missed I don't think that this is a good area to work on. For that sort of technique problem books are more effective. So I apologies if I didn't comment on things you find interesting, but I am trying to suggest ways to think about the game in the hope that it will help future games.]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[np]C[djna - This is a little unusual, it tends to make rapid development for B difficult.]
;W[pn]C[djna-Ishida says that this is usually favourable for W]

(;B[jq]C[djna - Ishida says that this is bad because ... see variation]

(;W[fc]TR[np][pp][jq]C[djna - This is an example of a position being left half resolved. Not sure how one can recognise that this is the case. To my eyes there is something odd about the relationship of the two marked B stone and the marked W stone that says "unfinished"]
;B[cj]TR[hc][fd][jd][cf][df]C[bommel: I'm not sure of C10

djna - this is almost certainly bad. K3 was similar. I realise that playing joseki by rote is bad, but sometimes they give us clues. We know that joseki tend to be around the points I marked. They have some reason. If you ignore a move (and by not playing joseki you did) then you probably need to make a very urgent move, or a move with several meanings. C10 is just a mojo sketching move.]
;W[do]TR[ck][dk]C[LoP: is it ok to play here?

djna - must admit I get puzzled myself about this sort of position. It feels right to play in this area, B is building quite quickly and needs keeping under control. When the Cinese fuskei is played by B (marked points) then there's no room to go in low, and so your move is normal Here there is one line more space and perhaps low would work? Anyway I don't see this move as bad.]
;B[eo]C[LoP: I felt unsure about what to play next. I didn't want to play C3 because black would get a nice wall facing to K3, and i didn't know for sure if i'd be able to live there anyway.

djna - this is quite a delicate area for both sides. B wants to confine W and get some profit by chasing him or build thickness by letting him make a small live group. W wants to avoid giving B too much territory (though he had 3 stones here first so he should get some) and does not want to be left with a weak group. B's move seems quite good but  a pincer at C7 migtht also work well.]
;W[ep]TR[en][cq]C[LoP:  with this move i tried to prevent that black would get a big moyo at the side, although i gave the left side for it,  i think that move is more than questionable, and there should be a better way to play here

djna - This almost certainly cannot work. When W plays E4 he must have evaluated the obvious response of D4. Now sometimes one examines this sort of thing and finds that sacrificing a stone works well,  but I find it hard to imagine the outcome W was expecting. I suspect lack of analysis.

The marked joseki moves must be better. It'simportant not to get too upset by the notion of a moyo on the side. The K3 stone is low so B needs a further move at K5 before we feel really threatened.]
;B[dp];W[fo];B[en]SQ[fo][ep]C[djna - Count the points now for B on the left. I think B has already got more there than if he had been allowed the wall facing K3. What's worse the marked W stones are still very unstable.]
;W[ip]C[djna - Much better than moves that get obsessed with the two stones. I have seen people plav moves such as G4 in this position. However at this point B is having a very easy ride; he has not actually done anything but play where W forced him to play and he's happy!]
;B[jp]C[djna - good, try to provoke W to build a weak group, and make sure B doesn't get one]
;W[in]C[djna- stylish. Again W is showing that he's quite prepared to give up odd stones rather than build a weak group. Trouble is that B can get quite a lot of territory now on the bottom as well as on the left.]
;B[co]C[djna - this is the sort of move that is either very good or too slow. I feel that I'd like to play F6 and build on a larger scale, but I do know that solid moves like this one are often correct.]
;W[cf]C[LoP: black's C10 invited me to play this

djna - yes this is another area of unfinished business. Danger here is that B could attack this stone on a large scale but W is behind so he needs to try something. Would D14 be better? I really don't know.]
;B[fp]TR[fq][gq][fr][gr][fs][gs]SQ[ep][eq][er][es]C[djna - surely must be too slow. Takes the points marked with the square, but needs another move to take the triangled points. The W stones were not really doing much anyway. Suppose W plays E15 now?]
;W[gp]C[
djna - I would be stubborn and play in the top left, this is an argument over 10 points at most]
;B[fq];W[fn];B[em];W[jo]C[LoP: push one further instead? (F7)

djna - I feel that the whole sequence is not too urgent. F6 may have been good as B there was pretty big and nearly sente. F7 is bad as it is "pushing from behind" it will remove aji around D9 for no great benefit. K5 isn't quite good enough because it's not really sente. The top left is more urgent.]
;B[fd]C[bommel: the following sequence is definitly not joseki... which one would be best to choose here?

djna - well B is doing the right thing: press on the strong side to attack the weak.]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[ec]SQ[dc]
(;B[df]TR[df]SQ[dc]C[djna - according to ishida "whatever happens B must not let the fear of push and cut make him attach at the marked stone" so B has blundered. In fact the right move is to play at D17, but I must admit I get scared when I'm playing stronger players.]
;W[cd]C[djna - Perhaps an overplay by W, D17 is supposed to be good enough]
;B[dc];W[de]
(;B[ee]C[djna - a bad atari, you had to play E16 eventually, and it's sente, see the variation]
;W[ce];B[db];W[hc];B[ed]C[
djna - this really hurts!];W[dg];B[bc]C[djna - this is a very bad choice of direction of play. The corner is now of no importance, connection to the centre is the thing..]
;W[ef]C[djna - this capture gives W great strength and note the impact of G14]
;B[qq]C[djna- pretty unreasonable. This asks to be cut into two groups. I'm not sure of the thinking here. In pure territory terms seems to me that approaching the top right is bigger. G14 is urgent and Q3 really should have been played long ago.]
;W[pq]C[LoP: Is it the wrong side to block? I wanted to get some thickness to play M4 or something afterwards. I was happy giving the corner for the prospect of destroying blacks potenital territory.

djna - unless W's stones are weak this is the only move. separating B is essential. The follow up is probably J3 not M4 though.]
;B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nq];B[qo]C[bommel: R5 better at S5?

djna - yes, this is a mistake, and what's more what is your plan to deal with J3?, you should expect to live in gote in the corner. So that's why R3 was bad]
;W[qp]C[djna - this move seems very appealing, but I think it's small. How about just Q5?]
;B[rp];W[rq]C[LoP: Is this cut on the wrong side? If it is please explain why.

djna - The problem is what you will do now if B plays S6. Suddenly he has action on the side and you get only a few points in the corner. The same is true if you cut the other way. You also have the Q5 weakness. Hence W at Q5 may be better than pushing and cutting.]
;B[rr];W[ro];B[sq];W[qn]C[LoP: I think there should be a better punishment for R5. Ending in gote here hurt me pretty much because i planned to play M4 after giving the corner.

djna - I agree that B seems to have swindled something here, but thickness is good.]
;B[qj]C[LoP: I think this move is bad?

djna - play away from thickness! B is gradually leaving problems behind. G14 and J3 are lurking as difficulties. This stone should be pressured now. It should be played at R11, then there's some chance of making an extension in either direction.]
;W[qg]C[djna - good, perhaps even R12?];B[mp]C[djna - ? I'm not sure why this move is played? W J3 now is surely annoying? If B has to run out  the R10 stone will be troubled.]
;W[mq];B[lq];W[iq];B[ir];W[hr];B[jr];W[lr];B[lp]C[LoP: trying to leave black's group eyeless and cut

djna - yes exactly! Correct idea. But why stop?!?];W[gf]C[LoP: I felt uncomfortable without G14. I believe blacks group was pretty dead here.

djna - not the right time. The other group is in dire trouble. This one lives at C17 (make effectively an L+1 group with B to play)]
;B[gm]C[djna - seems to leave three groups pining for life and a large moyo building in the top right. Unless this has strong effect on W it's bad.]
;W[fm]C[LoP:  Is this aji-keshi? because i didn't cut in the end.

djna - well B there is good, but, why not try M6? Or kill the top left, or attack the R10 stone? W has begun to care about stones that were being treated lightly. He needs to follow up his attack on the M4 group and look after his stones indirectly.]
;B[fl];W[ho];B[gq];W[hq];B[hn];W[hm];B[gn];W[go];B[gl]C[LoP: hehe was pretty happy with this :)

djna - really?  I'm not sure how good it is B has gained little territory and W has the move to continue attacking.]
;W[ln]C[LoP: trying to contain black, of course O6 was still open, but i planned to take R10 while chasing blacks running group.

djna - good plan, also just helps the eyes in the group];B[rn]
;W[rm]C[LoP: I believe this was my first bigger fault.

djna - yes, simple misread I imagine. T 5 must be better.];B[so]
;W[ql];B[po];W[oo];B[op]C[LoP: woops cut in two and M4 living :(. I believe there was no way to kill M4 anymore

djna - too late now, S7 was the problem];W[ro];B[oq]C[bommel: the weak M4 group is alive now, but these stones won't be able to help in the game.

djna - this is a very good analysis, the isolation of those stones is crucial.]
;W[pc]C[LoP: here i had no better idea :) but i believe it's still a good move?
I didn't want to cut at E8, because it would only lead me into troubles and i thought i'm ahead anyway.

djna - if the top left group is alive is the score so obvious? I think that this is the right move but the game is not quite won]
;B[ej]C[bommel: I was afraid of the cut at E8. would it be better to invade on the upper side instead of E10?

djna - yes you have no time for this. W has two large moyos you need to get reducing.]
;W[lc]C[djna - one line higher would be better - 4th line territory is good.]
;B[le]C[bommel: is there a better point for invasion?

djna - this looks pretty good, very hard to analyse and W's position is strong so it's going to be difficult.]
;W[lg]C[LoP: Lack of better ideas again :) My hope was to build a moyo around O10-R10 while black would try to live there. Better suggestions?

djna - no this is an excellent idea];B[id];W[ic]C[LoP: i was aware about the weakness at G15, but i thought a can resist with J17 instead of playing G15 .


djna - this seems to change course in mid execution. You are building a moyo on the right. You want to encourage B to dive deep into the upper side while you wall him off. G15 is the move.]
;B[ge];W[he]C[bommel: F16 group can escape now. I choose to attack and fail. would the escaping result be better for black.

LoP: can F15 really escape?

djna - Seems like the W wall could be cut now. However W could get a huge territory while B escapes. Realistically, B needs the top left to live *and* to invade the moyo. That should be impossible, but I think B should have a little hack around the  region of M10 hoping to gain enough strength to make more use of the H16 cut.]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[jd];W[hf]C[LoP: containing black, i thought that there would be enough room for my white group.

djna - I would not be able to analyse this position over the board but to my eyes suddenly W is in a little diffculty.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ia];B[kc];W[eb];B[ga]C[LoP: Woops suddenly i was in big troubles.]

(;W[cb];B[ea]C[bommel: would connecting at c17 be better?

djna - yes it looks very tight after that, you gain a lot of liberties that way]
;W[cc];B[hb];W[fa]C[LoP: OK i think i was lucky here];B[fb]
;W[ff];B[da]C[bommel: connecting at D19 doesn't make sense

djna - yes, just a bad move];W[ca];B[ib];W[fa];B[mc];W[ni]C[LoP: Lack of ideas again :) i believe that move is somewhat suboptimal. better suggestion?

djna - The only way to loose now is for B to set the R10 stone in motion. This moves looks after that problem, seems good to me. As we find out later there's more aji than I or W realised in the top right. Hence P13 might be better. B might reduce but W should get 4th line territory all down the side.]
;B[mn];W[mm]TR[lm]
(;B[nn]C[
djna this seems to slow unless you know the follow up works.]
;W[nm];B[km];W[lm];B[im];W[jm];B[il];W[jl];B[kl]C[bommel: this sequence seems bad for black. better variation?

djna - B simply played moves that didn't work. This last one is refuted so easily that B should have seen the answer.]
;W[ik];B[hl];W[kk]C[
djna - B's 2 stones have little meaning now. Judging by the rest of the play B is very capable of avoiding this sort of sequence.]
;B[ll];W[kn];B[jj];W[jk];B[hj];W[ij]C[LoP: Was this move too small?

djna - it has large follow ups, counting yose plays at this stage is hard work, this will do, except ...]
;B[qe]C[bommel: I think the L17 group is strong enough, so I can enter at R15. is there a better point to invade?
LoP: i was surprised by that, somehow i believe that this shouldn't work for black.

djna - this surprised me too! Does seem to have lots of ways of working. Hence W should have played near here at the previous move!]

(;W[pf];B[qf];W[pg];B[rg];W[rh];B[sf]
(;W[rd]C[LoP: playing R11 instead better?];B[qh];W[qi];B[ph]

(;W[pi];B[oh];W[ri];B[pe]C[LoP: I guess i have failed now, at least O11 helps a little now ;)]
;W[ng];B[oe]C[bommel: could white stop my escape?

djna - I've shown the variations I think might work. The variation at 154 is the one I'd recommend. Concedes a biut but still wins I think.]
;W[nf]C[bommel: the three stones in the UR corner don't look alive. could I have killed them?

djna - B needs to get out safely first, W just has time to live, as per the game]
;B[ne];W[nb]C[djna - this seems to look after the group. S18 looked like a danger point]
;B[mb]C[djna - did B need to answer? Getting the reverse sent yose at B11 is bigger?]
;W[bi]C[LoP: I try to play some endgame moves now

djna - I think that the final result comes from W getting these yose plays, though without W losing the Q13 stones the game should be won anyway]
;B[bj];W[ci];B[ob];W[pb];B[oc];W[od];B[nd];W[oa];B[nc];W[rb]
;B[kg];W[kh];B[lf];W[jg]C[LoP: again a lousy fault of mine :(

djna - but this is something that it is possible to learn to avoid. Faults of technique will be solved. I, in my own games, have far more problems with faults of understanding. Even very strong players make equivalent mistakes to this.]
;B[mg];W[lh];B[nh]C[djna - very elegant use of W's mistake but because B is behind he needs to be a little tricky. His lovely move works, but it's gote. Has W spotted the problem? If so then he's going to waste a move (admittedly to get a *lot* of points) but would he ignore R5? Could we even get A11 in too before taking gote?]
;W[mh];B[of];W[oi];B[og]C[bommel: now the endgame starts. the endgame of white was much better, he took away 30 points I think. where were my biggest mistakes?

LoP: I thought it was pretty close now. It was the first time where i actually counted the value of my possible endgame moves.

djna - by my estimate W is already head by quite a bit, W has the first sente run of the yose and hence probably gains about 10 points, B has relatively few sente places to play. As far as I'm concerned the end game goes pretty much normally. I reckon that with komi W is about 10 ahead now. The F1 mistake accounts for the reaminder of the deficit. B had no reasonable expectation of gaining 10 pointsstarting here. So I reckon B already made the big mistakes.]
;W[gb]C[
djna B could claw a little back by playing R5 sometime soon]
;B[ja];W[aj];B[ak];W[ai];B[bk];W[sn]C[LoP: I think this was not right, i was surprised that black answered.

djna - given that O2 is insurance B should not answer.];B[sp]
;W[er];B[fr];W[gr];B[eq]C[bommel: I also thought about F1 instead of E3. is F1 secure?
LoP: wow after F2 i didn't believe black would give me E2 so easily

djna - F1 works for B. This is a few points that B let slip]

;W[lo]C[LoP: I think my main advantage in the endgame was, that black tried to build around H12 where he only got 1 point in the end.
I was pretty surprised when i saw that i lead with about 20 points, because i lost a lot because of some wrong hands.


djna - B had no real hope building anything anywhere, I don't believe that score changed much in the last 50 moves.]
