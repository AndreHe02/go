C[This is a game played on DGS, Dragon Go Server www.dragongoserver.net It's a correnspondens server, you log in and play a move per day.

Played against a slightly stronger player. I lost by resignation. It was a non rated game so I experimented a little.

g4: My name is Peter Hoehe. I am a 2K in germany. So please do not think my advice are always true. But I hope they are helpful to you. It was a very enjoyable game. And there were a lot of good moves. Thanks for letting me review this.

Enjoy

(;B[el]C[g4: The real move is C8 now. If it works, this is a good move. (see var)]
;W[hl]C[g4: I would have preferred white F7, bE7, wC8. bC8 feels to good to me.]
;B[cl]C[g4: good!];W[bm];B[ej]C[g4: Difficult to say. Maybe a move like R4 is better. This helps the 2 bottom stones and make white's H4 group weaker. But black's move make the E3 group solid.]
;W[po];B[qp];W[qo];B[rp];W[pp]C[g4: This move strenghtens black. Someone wants to play it only if he wants to cut. Better to leave the situation as it is. White may want to play P4, and Q3 instead later on?]
;B[pq];W[mp]C[g4: A little loose.]
(;B[qk]C[From here my aim was the three stones below, maybe I was aiming too hard and therefore giving up to much in other parts of the board. I don't know.
g4: One proverb says: First strengthen yourself, then attack. You cannot afford to attack the 3 white stones very heavily, because your K4 stone is too weak itsself. You may want to cut now or escape with the K4 stone.]
;W[nc]C[g4: very ambitious from white. I would prefer N6. This prevents the cut, secures some territory in the center, and weakens thw S9 stone.]
;B[lc]C[Guess I should have played Q14 instead, but I was hoping he would enter at then 3-3 point.
g4: That's just a matter of taste here.];W[qf];B[qh]C[Ok I know this is a really strange move. But I was still aiming on the three stones below and needed to make R9 strong.
g4: This is a good move in this situation.];W[ne]C[g4: This is strange.]
;B[pf]C[g4: This is difficult. What did you plan on Q15?];W[dh]
C[g4: There is definitely no time for that. The black group below cannot be killed with one move. So there is a strong risk that this is a dame move.]
;B[le]C[g4: This is understandable. But it is more urgent to prevent Q15.]

(;W[ng]C[g4: Q16! (see var)];B[gc]C[g4: H17 is safer. But more urgent is Q13.]
;W[pg]C[g4: Good];B[of];W[nf];B[og];W[qc];B[pc]C[g4: I think R15 is easier now. It will give you a strong position, and white gets a small corner territory.]
;W[qd];B[od];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
(;B[oc]C[g4: I would prefer O16. The 3 white stones will have a hard time. (see var)]
;W[qg];B[oh];W[nh];B[oi];W[ni];B[nk];W[kh];B[no]C[Finaly I attack. Bu maybe I should have secured the left group first?
g4: This is a good move. The left group is nearly alive. It can always be connected with O18 or live with G15.]
;W[nm];B[on];W[om];B[mo]C[g4: good.];W[lo];B[ln];W[ko];B[ll]
C[g4: N4 seems more reasonable to me. I don't think that white can live on the right side nor escape.]

(;W[np]C[g4: That doesn't work. White should try N7.];B[op]
;W[oo];B[mn];W[lq]C[The attack went as I wanted it but white got his share to.
g4: This good for black.];B[qm]C[g4: Really necessary?];W[ec]
;B[ge];W[cj];B[gj]C[g4: White O17 group is still weak. You should try to keep it separated from the rest. I would play around J10. Then perhaps F12.]
;W[ih];B[gh];W[je];B[jc];W[jk]C[I felt I was behind at this point and decided to atttack the white wall as this was the only weak group he had. This ended up a really bad choice.
g4: You should have not letting him connect. Now this seems impossible to me. But I think you are leading. Invade at C17 now and you should count. (see var)]

C[And here I resign. White has saved all of the stones form the previus attack and I still got several weak groups.

I'm really not sure were it all went wrong. I can only find one move there I say "I should have done like this instead".
The game just didn't went my way.])

black

white

15 points lower.
Counting the komi white leads by 5 points. But black is strong everywhere. So black should be able to catch up. 
Be aware that S12 is sente, so is H2, N2. O16 and B8 are big. You should get one of them. And M13 followed by K14 is also big.]
