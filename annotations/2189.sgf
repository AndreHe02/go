C[Hi,

Here are some general comments about the game.
I'm sure you realize that playing again a program is quite different from playing real people even if the program is stronger than you are for now. A couple of areas where it is certainly stronger: joseki and local fights as it will not make a miscalculation of liberties 8-). 

Now about the game. You have let White build up the left for too long and even when you would have still had a small chance to but you were pushing White to make the boundary stronger. In many situations you have made defensive moves when a fight could have been more advantageous. Towards the end you misjudged the value of several moves, preferring to take a small certain profit to a larger move. Try to keep sente more -- you can lead the game that way.

I have preceded my comments with G. Please let me know if you have any questions.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[cn];B[dn];W[dm];B[co]C[Brendan: Black E6 probably would have been stronger here.

G: Both are standard joseki.];W[en];B[do];W[cm];B[fn]LB[em:A]
[fp:B][gq:C]C[G: Here you have diverged from the standard joseki moves which are labelled. (Although C is not recommended.)]
;W[fo];B[eo]C[G: Not a very nice shape. The board is still empty, so there are probably bigger moves than this, e.g. the remaining empty corner. On the other hand, you do get access to the center and W is cut so it's not too bad.]
;W[fp];B[em];W[dj];B[pp];W[nq];B[pm]C[G: This is not a standard joseki move; I assume because it is too loose.]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[qj];B[mo]C[Brendan: Looked strong at the time, but looking back it doesn't really seem to be.
G: Again it is loose. Your last four stones are not close enough to each other to remain uncut.]
;W[no];B[nn];W[kq]
(;B[jp]C[G: You're too thin for this. See variation];W[jq];B[lc]
;W[qf]
(;B[pf]C[G: It is easier to make territory in the corner and on the sides, see variation.]
;W[pg];B[og];W[qh];B[ph];W[qg]
(;B[oe]C[G: A little too defensive, leaves the corner open for invasion. See variation.]
;W[de];B[gd]C[G: At this point you have built up half of a huge moyo, the problem is that it is hard to defend this in the middle of the board especially that its wall is quit thin. W's moyos are smaller but more defensible.]
;W[gf]C[G: Here comes trouble...];B[if]C[G: Too defensive. You might try to cut at F14. Another spot to play would be around C12 or 13 as one more W stone here will make it impossible to invade. 

Also, G16 and J15 are not connected and are easily cut]
(;W[pi];B[oh];W[oi]
(;B[oj]C[G: Wrong direction, I think. You are letting W go into you moyo. See variation.]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[mj];B[qi];W[ri]
(;B[pi]C[G: Unnecessary and therefore bad. (You lose sente.) If W takes it still can't cut you because that would be self-atari. See var.]
;W[lh]
(;B[lg]C[G: Too defensive. See variations.];W[op];B[oo];W[np]
;B[pn];W[pq]
(;B[hi]C[G: White's Q3 is sente. W can play R4 and you won't have any territory here. Your move (H11) doesn't make territory. It might be considered to be an invasion, but that area is quite open still, so it's not a worry at the moment.]
;W[kj];B[jk];W[kg];B[mh];W[kf]
(;B[lf]C[G: Too defensive. See var.];W[li];B[mi]C[G: This move doesn't accomplish anything. It might be worth one point at the end.]
;W[ig];B[ke];W[fi]C[G: With this move W made it very difficult to invade the left. There have been several moves earlier in the game which could have been played around C12 or 13, the latter threatening an invasion at C16.

I created one possible variation starting with the next move not because that was a bad move -- just to show one example how it could go.]

[ll][ml][nl][km][lm][mm][nm][kn][ln][mn][ko][lo]C[G: Are you trying to have the circles or the triangles? At this point you probably won't be able to save both but you last two moves were on two sides of W's two K-stones.]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[je];B[id]C[At this point, white has a large moyo at both the left and right sides, as well as around the bottom.  The area around F13 is still unsettled, but I wasn't sure how to attack the territory there.

G: Yes. If you try to invade the left, C12 or 13 is your only chance, but it's nearly impossible. C13 at least threatens C16 so it might work.]
;W[jf];B[hg];W[gb]C[G: That is quite big, unfortunately.];B[ib]
