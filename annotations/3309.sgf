(;W[op]LB[qj:A][qk:B]C[After the game we had a discussion about this move. My opponent (black) feels this is too early. During the game I had the feeling black 9 was kind of an overplay and that black 9 at P4 would be normal. What is your opninion?  See the variations we looked at.

reid: I agree, I think P4 is too early.

In any fight (not just in go), you have a better chance of doing well if you have an advantageous position before the fight even starts.  Here, the one white stone is fighting against three stones - not a good tactical situation.

Furthermore, white already has a weak group in this area (G3 and K3).  If black gets stronger around M4 as a result of fighting with P4, G3/K3 will suffer.

Of the variations you looked at, I like A the best, and perhaps B is even a bit better.]
;B[pn]LB[nn:E][on:A][po:B][lp:D][mp:C]C[What about black P6 ?

P6 (A) leaves a hole at B (Q5), and another with the C, black D, white E possibility.  Black Q6 is very natural.]

;W[go];B[lm]LB[km:A]C[reid: I like to tell students that "if you touch me, you help me".  By playing the contact move here, black helps white to get stronger.  I think A is good enough.

Black has one weak group between two weak white groups: an ideal splitting attack.  Black doesn't need to force the issue.  He can simply let the stones flow and his strategic advantage will assert itself in the long run.]
;W[ll];B[km];W[mk]LB[mk:B][km:A][lm:C]C[reid: If we change the order of the last four moves, we can ask: "if black had played A and white responds naturally at B, does black now want to play at C?]
;B[nl]C[reid: Too soon.  Black can play this anytime, and the O8 stone doesn't really do much for black.  Perhaps later he will wish he'd left this move.]
;W[ml];B[hp];W[hq];B[gm]LB[gp:A]C[reid:  Hmm, if black wants to cap at G7, sh shouldn't play H4 first.  Since he did play H4, and white responded with H3, black should really push through at G4 (A).]
;W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[mq]C[reid: white has helped black to take away the eye base for the P6 group.  White M2 is a fratricidal kind of move - it hurts one side just as much as it helps the other.]
;W[in]LB[fn:A][ip:C][er:B]C[What about this move?  The idea was to capture H4 for a second eye or to break out in the centre.

reid: The other way of saying that is that you're allowing black to either let you out into the center of force you to capture one stone.  Are these really your only choices?

If black can force you to take one stone for life, he can consider that a local victory.  You would rather not be forced into that (it should be your last resort).  How about A (F6) to run out into the center and keep the black groups split?

It's still not great, but white has an uphill battle here because of black's strategic advantage (the splitting attack).

In any case, white still has B and C for creating life here.  But again, these are last resorts - white is too small in this area to get a good result.]
;B[im];W[io];B[jn]LB[lj:C][kk:B][kl:A]C[reid: Here is where we can see why exchanging O8 for N8 too soon causes a problem.  Black's goal here is to maintain connection with his outside stones.  There are a number of ways to do that and while K6 works, it is 'inside' and has little effect on the fight in the center. If O8 and N8 have not been exchanged, black could instead play at A which almost demands white B in response, so black gets his connection in sente, and he still has the O8 peep available (and another at C).

If black plays A now (instead of K6), white is likely to tenuki.]
;W[ip]LB[jl:B][gn:A]C[reid: instead of playing 'inside', white can accomplish the same thing by playing an 'outside' move like A.

But perhaps white can even play the peep at B (K8).  Black may be able to save his H4 stone, but his whole group is still under attack, and white is nearly alive now anyway.]
;B[od]C[reid: Black seems to have the better position now.  The white group at N9 is not stable, and white has only 8 points of territory on the bottom.  Black has a slightly weak group at J7, but it's stronger than the white N9 stones.  And he's got territory on the bottom left and bottom right.]
;W[jl];B[jm];W[mc];B[qc];W[rc];B[pc];W[re];B[qf]LB[ne:A][of:B]
C[reid: Mistake in direction.

Black needs to keep in mind the weak white group - simply extending to A or B starts putting stones in place that will seriously hurt white.]
;W[pe]
(;B[oe];W[pf];B[of];W[pg];B[kc]C[reid: R14 is now a donation, and Q13 helps the center white group while reducing blacks right side potential.]
;W[ld];B[og];W[ph];B[lf]LB[ni:A]C[reid: I like black A better: try to threaten the N9 stones in such a way that M17 ends up helpless.

In go, you need to think in two directions at once.];W[kd];B[ic]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[ni];W[oj];B[oi]LB[nj:A]C[reid: Is black trying to attack the N9 stones or the R16 stones?  Of course, this move should be at A.]
;W[pi];B[pj]LB[nj:A]C[reid: A is still better.];W[nj];B[qj]
C[reid : Not sente.  Black is helping white.];W[mi];B[jg]LB[lg:A]
[lh:B][mh:C]C[reid: Can black do this?  H should maintain his strength and continue attacking the center white stones with A (even B is too far because white can play C in sente).]
;W[mg];B[lg];W[mf];B[me];W[le];B[md];W[lc]
(;B[nf]C[reid: Urk.  Black doesn't have much choice now,  he really needs to play as in the variation.]
;W[mh];B[nc]C[reid: Black lives small, but his outside positions are a shambles.]
;W[ig];B[if];W[jc];B[ie];W[je]LB[id:A][jd:B][ih:C]C[reid: Bad shape.  White asks black to play at A in sente.

Better to just play B.  Then if black A, white can pull back with C, capturing four stones.

(;W[jo]LB[go:A]C[reid: If white feels the need to defend this group, A would be better.  Remember the proverb: play away from strength.  After black has played M5, white doesn't want to butt heads in that area.

Defending on the bottom feels a bit slow, but it does prevent black from getting free moves in the area which might let him develop the left side.]
;B[op]C[reid: Too slow.  See my comments in your third variation]
;W[qj]C[Seems reasonable for white

reid: Yes, but not for black :-)])
(;W[od]LB[qi:A]C[reid: Too slow.  It leaves too good a move for black at A]
;B[qj];W[qh];B[oj]C[Looks better for black to me. How to invade/reduce black moyo?

reid: Yes, black is better.

Rather than asking how white should invade, it's better to recognize that white has already played too slowly (with P16).

After black M5, the focus shifts *immediately* to the right side (assuming white decides not to assist his bottom side group).  White doesn't have time for P16.]
)
(;W[qj]C[reid: this looks fine for white.  I think this is a reasonable game so far.]
;B[op]LB[ql:B][qm:A]C[reid: this shape is overconcentrated for black.  White will be happy to play A.  Black B would be better.]
