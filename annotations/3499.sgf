C[H: hi, i'm playing black here and will mark my comments with "H:"

Thanks to the reviewer in advance!

Hi I hope you enjoy the review, if my comments come on a bit harsh I am sorry.   I'll try my best to answer your questions, don't take my answer as the truth in the stone (I am only 5K).   So I hope it helps my comments will be marked by *.

*: Final Comments:

1) Use thickness to attack not build space.
2) Don't leave your weak groups alone.
3) Don't pass by the chances to build moyo, give up small to gain big.
4) Don't defend 1 point, play bigger moves.
5) Don't play bad shapes, if you have to make bad shape to save few points, try to find a bigger move that will confisate for the lose.
6) Play more sente moves.
7) Don't make white's life soo easy its' not allowed >< White should have hard life ^^ Black starts with sente right? :P]

(;B[df]C[H: i didn't want to go in to the avanlanche here, but build a wall instead. would you recommend that? and would you recommend it, if you knew that i have no idea on how to use a wall effectively, later? :-)

*: I perfer because of your Q16 stone, at the end of this sequence you got a wall but most of it is wasted because white settles easily above.

*: Another reason I don't like D14 is I did a pattern search threw pro games out of 608 games with this openning, pros ALL PLAYED E17. (if i take only the top into account)

*: If I take the whole board into account out of 123 games I found they STILL played E17. So you see that point is the most important at this point with relation to Q16.]
;W[cf];B[dg]C[*: This move is a mistake, YOU MUST play E17, or your wall well be somewhat useless.]
;W[ec];B[cg];W[jd]C[*: White mistake, he should play C7 to reduce your wall's effect.]

(;B[cl]C[*: I don't like this move :(  I recommend D6 at least.  Reasons ..
1) You have strong wall above, when you have power you need to use it (play on grander scale)
2) This is low ... so white can push you down and reduce you to mear 10 point :( not good.
3) Shows no guts...];W[nc];B[pb]

;W[pq];B[op];W[nr]
(;B[oq]C[*: Bad move, because it causes you your liberties, and you can't kill whtie ne ways right now so why waste moves like that?]
;W[or];B[rq]C[H: that move made me loose sente. stupid.

*: Yes this move isn't good, it doesn't do anything to white, so better to play arond Q9 to use your thick wall you just gained.]
;W[rr]
(;B[ql]C[*: Bad, over concentrated, has to be around Q9.]
(;W[mp]C[*: White mistake. His group is save, and he can't really attack one stone.  It's light he should worry about the moyo.]
;B[lp];W[mo];B[hq];W[eq];B[nn]C[*: Bad, using thickness to make space.  Never good you should fix your weakness on the bottom.

How to determine a big move:

How to decide on big move?

1. The urgent move (The move that gives you a base or takes away a base.)
2. The corners.
3. The approch move to corner, esp. 3,4.
4. The side.
   4.1 The side that a perfect corner is facing.
   4.2 The side that 3,4 stone is facing.
   4.3 The side with corner stone on the star point.

I got this from a 9D, so I am taking this as good as it gets >< (can't beat a 9d, i tried and failed :P LOL)

So by those guidelines it's best to play H5 to help your weak group, because there is a weakness please refer to the example.]

[af][bf][ns][sr][es][er][an][bn]LB[gd:A][og:B]C[H: at this point i was quite content with my potential territory. did i underestimate the white territory, if he played around A? Would an attack there have been more valuable than playing B?

*: B was a good move it fixed a shape defect.  But for space lets count ...

Black: 56
White: 38 Without A, White A 52.  

So you wouldn't be doing bad with.  If white plays A next, you get to play more moyo moves to buidl yours' right moyo.]

(;B[pc];W[od];B[oe];W[pe];B[of]LB[ne:A]C[H i played this stone to prevent him cutting again at A. but this gave him time to attack my corner. what should i have done better?]

LB[fj:B][jn:A]C[H: should i have played B instead of A? i would have lost influence to the center, but had secured my left side

*: I like A it's very strong move, it will help in fighting if there is any and it safe garuds your group.]
;B[ej];W[fk];B[ek];W[gh];B[fh];W[gi]C[*: If you look you only have a bit on left side so giving white 1 point wouldn't hurt.

If you count.... black has 39 on right and 5 on the bottom and 15 on the left.  So total of 59 points.

White on the other hand has 66 Alone on the top and 12 on bottom right and 20 or so on bottom left so total of 98 or so ... whit eis way ahead :(.

You can afford to defend one single point if u are worried about white playing E11 please look at the example.

*: Since you are behind your play style should be to get points much as you can in sente. starting with S4.]

Guidelines to play moves like these

1) Never play thickness
2) Always use thickness to attack
3) If you have a wall 2 accross, jump 3 away.

Rule 1: we are safe now it's not too close

Rule 2: Doesn't apply no white stone to attack

Rule 3: Your wall is 4 long, so play 5 away.]))

*: Now this is rough estimate, white has definate possiblity of space on top but it's not space YET! So can't be sure on counting, same with the bottom.

Your future development on the top wouldn't be in sente, and since white ends in sente he can play around C9 to reduce the power of your wall and be happy, that he crapped your style.

*: I found two examples where pro play this veration (at least the D14 white move).  And both times they diviated from the joseki (at least black did).   So this tells me this is one reason to avoid this.  So I would recommend against it, if you don't want to have nasty fight on our hand because if you dont' diviate from joseki you are kinda at a lose.]
