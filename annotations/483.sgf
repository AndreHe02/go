C[Fro Ted's email.
Since getting an established rating on IGS, I've been comprehensively defeated by anybody I've played above 26k, without any idea where I'm going wrong.

If it makes any difference to the reviewer, I keep having to resign because very large groups of my stones get captured (or are about to be captured when I resign).]
;B[pd]C[Fedya 24k: I know that Black was able to kill my group at the bottom, and that I probably could (should) have resigned at the point that the group was dead, but I didn't realise this until a few moves before we would have counted the score.

I'm sending the game in for review because afterwards, I counted the score, and even if the group at the bottom were alive, I *still* would have lost by about five points.  I can probably figure out where I went wrong at the bottom of the board, but I can't figure out where I went wrong elsewhere.

I ended up with a 24k* rating on IGS as a result of a bunch of 27-30k players challenging me and my winning, but since getting my established rating, I haven't come close to beating anybody above 26k.  Indeed, I've had to resign every game after having large groups of my stones killed.]
;W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[dj];B[eq];W[dq]LB[gq:a][hp:b]C[*** Needless to say, there are different josekis for different situations.  Many depend on the preferences of the player.  However, in this situation, there might be something better than d3.  The joseki that results from this would give black a nice double wing formation from the q4 stone with strength on both sides of the board.  Some people might chose a pincer at either 'a' or 'b' to try to reduce some of black's potential territory.  Just some thoughts]
;B[ep];W[do]C[*** you might consider placing this stone at d6 to work more efficiently with the d10 stone.]
;B[jp];W[jc]C[*** given black's huge moyo at this point, you have to play on this side.  you might have chose to approach at o17 instead, but this is beyond criticism other than the fact that some people, playing white, would play more aggressively in this position

Fedya 24k: Is this move premature?  In light of Black's response at D4, I'm wondering whether I should have handled the bottom-left corner differently.]
;B[dp];W[cq];B[eo]C[*** this is a very nice move for black because it expands the moyo on the bottom.]
;W[dn];B[en];W[nc];B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[ch]LB[cg:a]C[*** given your strength on the left side, i would have played this stone at 'a' to put more pressure on black and expand your territory at bit more.


Fedya 24k: I didn't like the result from the bottom left corner, so I decided to try something different when Black attacked in the top left corner.  I figured this would make it more difficult for Black to get two eyes.]
;B[fe];W[qf]C[*** I would want to push black with f17 to both attack black and provide a solid base for the corner group.  As it is, black could begin to attack the top left corner group and gain strength to attack the top right group.  on the other hand, with f17, black's group is still unsafe and wedged in between two solid white groups.   also, since you already have an approach stone at o17, you might consider playing at r6 or o3 before making another more in this corner and before black solidifies the bottom.

Fedya 24k: Here I thought I could get more territory on the top right by surrounding Black's stone at Q16.  Should I have played something like M16 instead?]
;B[oe];W[qd]C[*** the common continuation is to play r17 so that black has to chose which side to let white connect with.  it gives white the corner and a lot of strength.  however, the tradeoff is a large black wall facing the q10 stone. I am sure people could debate r17, but it would give you the corner and a strong top side of the board (with the defect in the top left corner).

Fedya 24k: Is this the wrong way to attack?  Perhaps S16 might be better, although it looks a little low to me.]
;B[qc];W[rd];B[oc]C[** yes, this is a strong replay by black and threatens to attack at m17

Fedya 24k: And now Black looks like he can get more territory in the corner than White,]
;W[ld]TR[jc][ld][nc]C[*** you could have played o16 or drawn back at n17 to protect the top.  with black so close, m17 is not the best shape   Fedya 24k: I thought that this was a good formation for White, but Black's next move took away a good deal of territory.  Should I have played at O18 or P18 first?  I was worried about Black playing at M16 and building up a wall towards the center, too.]
;B[nb];W[mb];B[nd]C[*** if you notice, by plaing o16 instead of n17, black is building up some strength that can be used to attack the white group at r15.]
;W[mc];B[pb];W[qi]C[*** yes, this is extremely important now.  if i was black, i would not have played q18 and attacked with r12.  the black group is pretty safe because it has access to the center and nice shape.    Fedya 24k: Making sure I finish my formation on this side.]
;B[pi];W[qh]C[**** good];B[qj];W[rc];B[rb];W[em]LB[fc:a][ef:b]
C[*** there are other places that you might consider playing.  black will just hane at f7 to continue expanding his moyo.  other choices are labeled on the board.  if you played 'b', you would need a follow up on the top to secure the top left corner.  there are also several options in the bottom right.  at this point, anything you do there will be tough going, but you cannot let black take all of that.]
;B[fm];W[el];B[fl];W[nq]C[**** you could have invaded at the 3-3 point and then tried to reduce, but since you pushed with black at e7, you are going to have a hard time doing anything down here.     Fedya 24k: Is this invasion premature, or did I simply invade in the wrong place?  I was thinking of playing P3, but was worried that Black would respond with something like M3 or N3 which would make it difficult for White to get two eyes.]
;B[oq];W[kq]C[*** i wish i could think of a better move than this, but everything i consider is just going to let black continue to build strength.  my tendency would be to try to get out to the center where there might be some room to breath, but black will attack every step of the way.  this is a good example of how important the opening is because black built a strong moyo that made white's efforts extremely difficult.]
;B[jq];W[jr]C[**** i would have played o4 instead.  if black gets o4, it will be very good for black.]
;B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[lp];B[ir];W[kr]C[*** i would have either played m2 or m5 instead of L2 to try to get your head up into the center, or begin to build eye space.]
;B[lo];W[or];B[pr];W[nr];B[hq];W[kp];B[ko];W[ps]C[*** you need m2 to be sure of life.]
;B[qr];W[qs]C[Fedya 24k: Should I have played at N1 here?  I think that if I had done that, I could get an eye around O1 and an eye around M1 later.]
;B[rs];W[os];B[lr]
(;W[js]C[*** m1 would not have saved you.  see the variation

Fedya 24k: Considering that Black's next move here was N1, I think that's probably what I should have played myself.  This is probably the move that prevents me from getting two eyes.]
;B[ms];W[lq]C[Fedya 24k: I thought I had to do this to connect the two groups, but as it is, it's pointless -- there's no way to save the group.  I didn't realise this at the time, however.]
;B[gc]C[Fedya 24k: And now Black gets to eat into more of my territory.]
;W[rr]C[*** yes, this will do nothing, but black still has to respond.

Fedya 24k: I thought this would enable me to get another eye in the bottom corner, but I was wrong.]
;B[rq];W[ss];B[qq];W[fb]C[*** black is going to reduce your territory no matter what once black plays g17.  so, b15 would be good because it would be sente.

Fedya 24k: Where should I have responded in the top left corner?  Black was able to limit my territory as a result of his next move (B16), but if I had played over there, Black would have been able to respond with something like E18.]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[dd];W[cc];B[bf];W[hb]C[** i would have played a16 and then attacked with h15 or f13.  i don't see a way to capture the g17 stone and that is a little too small to worry about.  you should be thinking about a way to attack the group and build some more territory.

Fedya 24k: I wanted to do something about the stone at G17 that would allow me to get more territory.  Would G18 have been better?]
;B[gb];W[fc];B[hc];W[ib];B[ic];W[jd];B[fd];W[ec];B[ga];W[jb]
;B[ek];W[dk];B[ej];W[ei];B[bh];W[bi];B[cg];W[di]C[** yes

Fedya 24k: Should I have played at D12 instead?];B[dh];W[ci]
;B[eh];W[fj];B[fk];W[fh]C[*** i think g11 would be better than f12 because it reduces (a little) black's lower side]
;B[gj];W[fi];B[fg];W[ph]LB[kh:a]C[*** honestly, the game is over at this point.  when black built that large moyo on the bottom with the large wall on the left and then killed your invading group, there is not much you can do.  L12 would reduce a bit, but certainly not enough to win.     Fedya 24k: I don't seem to have much territory, except in the lower left-hand side, so I need to do something to reduce Black's territory.  Looking at the board, however, I can't find anything good to do in this position.  Should I have played something like L12, trying to connect it to the stones at the top?  I don't think this would help limit Black's influence in the center, either.]
;B[oh];W[og];B[nh];W[rj];B[rk];W[ri];B[ql]C[*** yes, the only way to "really" reduce the territory is to invade, but I don't see a convincing place to do it.  perhaps a stronger player than i would see something.

Fedya 24k: Everything I do only seems to help Black's position.  Now I seem to be even worse off than before.]
;W[gg];B[ff];W[ie]C[Fedya 24k: Here I'm trying to connect the stones at the top to the stones on the left-hand side, and build some influence facing the center.  I also wanted to stop Black's stones at the top left from getting out into the center.]
;B[he];W[hf];B[gf];W[hg];B[ng];W[of];B[kj]C[Fedya 24k: And now Black starts to secure territory in the center.]
;W[kg];B[id];W[je];B[nf];W[pe];B[kk];W[ji]C[*** right

Fedya 24k: I thought a move like this (I was also considering M11) might do something about the territory Black is creating in the center.  But it doesn't seem as though much of anything can help.]

;B[be];W[cb];B[ae];W[ac]TR[bb][da]C[but even if you played at a17 and black did not try to kill, you still would only have eight points.

Fedya 24k: This does secure two eyes for me in the top left, but I only end up with 8 points -- six points of territory and the two black stones.]
;B[sc];W[sd];B[sb];W[ij];B[ik];W[mf]C[** ha, i didn't see that.

Fedya 24k: After I played this move, I suddenly realised that G16 would kill a big group of Black stones at the top of the board....]
;B[sj]C[Fedya 24k: And fortunately, Black didn't notice it.]
;W[gd];B[ed];W[si];B[sk];W[is];B[hs];W[mg];B[md]
(;W[rs]C[*** actually, m1 is the only way to save this.  i mentioned this earlier.  if you play m1, then you can fight the ko.  however, you don't really have any good ko threats.    Fedya 24k: I figured I'd go back and create a second eye here.  At this point, Black pointed out that he thought the entire White group was dead.  I looked at the position for several minutes and then determined that he was right.  I was thinking of playing at M1, but the following variation shows Black can still kill the stones.

I'll add a few stones to show that Black would still win even if the White group at the bottom were alive.]
;B[sq];W[jj];B[jk];W[hd];B[ge];AE[ms][lr][da][bb]C[****  two major things for you to consider.  First, get a book on life and death.  many people say (and they are correct) that the fastest way to get better at go is to learn life and death.  obviously, if you lose large groups, it is hard to win games.  Second, think about how your opponent can build large frameworks in the opening of the game and try to prevent this.  A book on openings might be helpful for this.  you have a good base for playing and i think you will improve quickly. let me know if you have any questions.


Fedya 24k: And even if the group at the bottom were alive, Black still leads by 3.5 after deducting the komi.  Of course, had I saved the group at the bottom, it would have been at the cost of a few points in the bottom left corner.]
)
(;W[ls];B[ks];W[mr]C[*** no, this is a two-step ko.  before playing n2, you have to have a stone at m1 and ignore a ko threat.  so, after L1, then you make a ko threat, take the ko, ignore a ko threat, play n2, black takes ko, you make a ko threat, and if black responds to the ko threat, then m1 makes three eyes.]
;B[ls];W[ns]C[Fedya 24k: And here we have a bent four, where Black can play at M1 and kill the group.]
))
(;AW[ls];B[ms]C[** now, white is dead no matter how you reply.  the best you could hope for is a ko with k1.  anything else will lose.]
;W[js];B[ks]C[*** white doesn't have many convincing ko threats though, but this is the only option.  if white had pulled back at L1 instead of K1, black would connect at n2 to form only a three space eye that cannot live.]
