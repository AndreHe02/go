was it good to go after the stones in the upper left at the begining of the game? could I have played some where else?



As the variations show, i couldn't find a way to kill white. 
Seeing that your stones in the upper right are dead, that you have oe quarter of the goban, you could have resigned now.

You should not try  to protect so much territory at once. If you break the board into small fights, it will be easier for you to close off your territory.
Try to give some space to your stones especially in the beginning of the game. Remember to play in the corners first then the sides and finish the game with the center. ( this only a general advice, it will not be so in some games).
