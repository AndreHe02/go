C[Note from the reviewer:
As usual, I have tried to make my best during this review. Hope it will be useful for the players and may be to some other readers.

However, please don't take my comment for the only truth as it should be full of mistakes for the truth of a dan player, and only worst for the truth of a pro player.

;W[ne];B[rl];W[mh]MA[nj][pj][qj]LB[jp:A][jq:B]C[Till this move, I see no problem. But this one seems too slow. It seems that White wants to escape with the 3 marked stones, but, this leaves too many weak points.

Moreover, I think it is more important to do something on the bottom side at A or B]
;B[rj];W[pi];B[qh];W[ph]LB[pi:A][qh:B]C[The exchange A for B was OK (White A removes some weak points  of white, and make a good shape and Black B is also reinforcing black without much points).

But this move 26 is too early. The exchange (this move with the answer of black) is useless for white. Keep it for later.]
;B[pg];W[mf]LB[jd:A][jp:B]C[Doubful. Play either on the upper side to extend the white moyo (e.g. at A), or on the lower side to avoid black playing this move (e.g. at B)]
;B[fc]C[OK];W[jd]MA[mf]C[OK. But please see how the move 28 (marked X) is not well placed. It should have been played on the lower side.]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[dc];W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[ed];W[cg];B[id];W[ib]
LB[jp:A][jq:B]C[Too early. Don't delay the move at A or B on the lower side. I don't know which one is better. But White cannot let Black play there first, because Black moyo would be too large.]
;B[hb];W[je]C[Not good. White should not, at this stage, use his influence to build territory. White might feel good with building sure territory, but Black is very happy to reinforce himself without problem.]

[mo:B][jp:A]C[Should White be happy with this sequence?

I don't think so. Because Black is now strong. White is  gote and thus cannot play the important move at A.]
;B[jp]C[Good. The black moyo is now impressive.];W[gh]LB[lp:A]
[hp:B]C[What are you doing here? There is no point there. Play the important move on the lower side. White has now no choice but reducing black moyo on the lower side with something like A or B.]
;B[fh];W[fi]C[Again, there is no point];B[jj]LB[jl:A][jm:B]
C[Seems to close to white. White should play under this move at A or B. White can let the black stone "57" escape while building  some force to reduce the black moyo on the lower side.]
;W[eh];B[gk]C[Good.

For the second time, black does not answer, and is building, calmly, a huge moyo.]
;W[en]C[This extends the white moyo, but ...];B[gn]C[.. now the black moyo is extended further. White is far behind.]
;W[cq]C[OK. White has no other choice to reduce black now.  Black can let White live in the corner while building more territory on the lower side.]

Please see how big are the 2 blacks move marked X, that were exchanged for the 2 whites move also marked X.

Those 2 white moves were the loosing ones.];W[bl];B[ml];W[lo]

Maybe just c16 and see how opponent responds.

Denis: I don't know who wrote the comments here above, but indeed c16 is better. f1 is not starting any KO (see my comments later when this move is played).]
