;B[cc];B[gg];W[df]C[I am not sure why the white player passed on his first move, and gave black two moves in a row. This put white behind by a lot in the beginning, especially on a small board game like this. White will have a tough time winning, and will have to take more risks if he/she were to have a chance of winning.]
;B[fe]
(;W[ed]C[I think this move is a little too ambitious. It tries to attack the stone at c7, and also tries to cut black's stones. I think the idea of this move is that white tries to profit in the fight that will be provoked. But, black is clearly in a better position to fight.

In addition, I don't think that white is fundamentally hurting black c7 still have plenty of room to live. Both of black's groups looks pretty solid. White's group looks rather precarious.

However, I believe white does have the correct idea. The white player need to do something or he/she will be short by a lot.

White aims for g7 to make a solid territory. D4 is hanging a bit. But, due to the initial disadvantage, white need to take risks if he/she were to have a chance to win.]

C5 would be a bad idea for black. See variation.]
