C[Hi revieewr! First of all thank you very much for review!
In this game I was black and I lost by 9,5 points.
I have some questions in the opening and middle game.];B[pd]

(;B[jc];W[nq]LB[jp:A]C[Maybe white should have played A, making miai of the kakari played and the right side.]

C[White has more or less managed to keep the diagonal simmetry, but it is not perfect, as you have traded a big corner for influence supporting the solitary corner stone.
Now, if the board keeps in this diagonal almost simmetry you are one corner ahead, so that would be good for you.

The widest and loosest area is the right side, with no 3 line stones is quite open to invasion, so I would play there, A or B would be my choice, probably B.]

(;B[cn]C[I don't like this kakari, I would prefer to live at 3-3 that should be sente and reduce from the outside later, but again, the right side seems the right place for me.]
;W[cp]LB[bo:A]C[The white A keima seems the more aggressive answer, the solid move played is a bit slower but leaves less options for black.]

(;B[fq]LB[ck:A][fm:B]C[Is double kakari ok?

I don't think so.
Left side seems bigger, and the white stones are already settled, so white now can increase one side while putting pressure on the one you try to save.

Normal answer against white's iron pilar is a nikken tobi at A, but maybe here is not appropiate, I would  jump at B with an ogeima. See variations.]
;W[cl]C[I'm not sure about this pincer beeing the severest move.]

(;B[dr]C[Again I would jump to the outside first.];W[hq]LB[cr:A]
C[Again this seems too easy for black, blocking at A maybe is more severe.
Or maybe not ...];B[fo]C[But beeing able to play this seems too good for black.]
;W[dn];B[bq]C[Very dangerous move, I think you were lucky here.
I would have keep on running to the center.]
(;W[bp]C[I would cut, letting black connect seems too much.
See variation.];B[cr]C[I think white played too soft here, as you managed to get the corner and not be closed there.
I'm not sure which are the best moves, but the final result seems too good for black ...

I think that at this point you are well ahead.]
(;W[qf]C[here, is a pincer better?

I think so. Maybe white had to play at A to keep it simpler, and closer to what happens in the game, which is good for white, I think.]

;B[gq];W[go];B[hp];W[gn]LB[fj:A]C[I'm not sure this cut is good, at least not now.
White has lost more on the bottom, unless a move is added, that he has gained in the outside: right now only 4 points, could be more, but there are moves to be made yet and a black stone at A would be a safe reduction turning the cut a failure in my opinion.]
;B[ph];W[qh];B[pf];W[pi];B[qe];W[rf];B[oh];W[oi]LB[fk:2][fh:3]
C[The most white can do out of the moyo is marked with 2 keimas, white needs 2 move to enclose this, we will use this as reference later.]

(;B[cj]C[See variations, but anyway, this invasion looks like a suicide.]
;W[ck]LB[ej:A]C[Too soft, a boshi at A seems appropiate.];B[ej]
;W[gj]C[Now's too late, black is almost out.];B[gk]LB[fi:A]
C[Maybe just kosumi at A is enough, and more simple.];W[fj]

[el][em][dm][cm][en][fl][fm][fn]LB[ee:A][fh:1][fk:2]C[The reduction anyway has not been much severe, I mark the white's potential area destroyed, count yourself, and it were pottential points, white had to spend at least a move to get those points, and white has been reforced and can now invade, althought cutting at A at once can also be considered.

We picture again the 2 jumps white needed to make the most of this area.

Black's invasion seems a failure to me: a reduction of about about 12 points in gote while reinforcing white to do a better reduction on the top.]
;B[fe];W[eg];B[ge];W[qm]LB[hf:A][he:B]C[I think white can push one more time before the invasion at the right side.

How i had to answer white?

What you did seems localy ok, but white manages to gain influence to invade deeply at the top, then, not having played the A-B echange is good for the invasion to succeed.]
;B[qn];W[pm];B[om];W[rn];B[ro];W[rm];B[ol];W[pk];B[ok];W[on]
C[This cut is too good for white, now black stones in the center became weak.]
;B[oo];W[nn];B[pl];W[rk];B[pj];W[rl];B[rp]C[This is big, but if the corner's life is not in danger it's only some yose points, stabilizing the center seems more urgent.]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[lk];B[mj];W[mi];B[li];W[ni];B[ll]C[Dangerous, I think white could cut.]

(;W[lh];B[kk];W[lc]
(;B[ld];W[kc];B[jd]C[what about this?

Maybe trying to kill it is not a good idea, as an outside wall will not be very useful at this stage, letting it get out seems more simple. It depends of course whether it's enough to win the game or not, but here it seems so. 

That's all! my questions are finished!

There's some more comments later.

Please give me some suggestion for become stronger  ^^!!

Don't let so much bad aji behind, at least when you are ahead.
White failed several times at finding the severest attack, but finally saved the game because of bad aji even if it was in position it could not work.

(;B[fq]LB[jp:A]C[Is this better?

I think so, or may be the hoshi A , but something dennying white the chance of build a half-board framework as you are doing seems a more positive approach.
The lower side and right side are the most wide areas, with only 2 stones at hoshi  from to the side to well past the center, but in one case you are gaining ground toward white's position while in the right side is only defensive.
Buildin in the upper side seems even more redundant than at the right side, as it would still be a framework, not territory, so I would play at the lower side.]
