C[review by adum (adum@aya.yale.edu)
i'm not sure which player requested the review, so i'll make comments towards the play of both

general critique: black should work on reading ability and good shape]
;B[dd];W[jj];B[je];W[dj];B[hj];W[kh];B[dh];W[fj];B[gd];W[df]
;B[cf];W[ch];B[cg];W[bh];B[bj];W[cj];B[le]C[better to take the corner at k11
makes better shape
as is, white can still probably sneak in there.];W[ik]
(;B[hh]C[the H4 stone isn't in danger of being surrounded as far as i can tell. better to play H3 or G3. letting white get H3 is big.]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[jc];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[lc];B[ie];W[ib];B[mb]

(;W[lb]C[better to block at M10, as that also threatens atari at K10. look for defensive moves that also attack.]

(;B[la]C[not good. H12 is vital. whoever plays there first comes out ahead here. this move is the kind of move that says i can kill you. but because white will get H12 in sente, that's false, so it's a waste of a move.]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[hd];B[gc];W[he];B[jd];W[hf]C[aggressive and risky play from white. but i suppose there's little turning back from this line of play.]

(;B[jh]C[the trick to what follows, for black, is to make sure his K9 group has good enough shape to give him the time to kill white.

as we'll see, the K9 group gets very bad shape.

this move is extremely questionable.];W[jg];B[ig];W[if];B[jf]
;W[kg];B[kf];W[lg]
(;B[hg]C[not a good move. doesn't surround white, even though it takes a liberty. something like G7 is necessary.]
;W[gf]
(;B[ff]C[again, need a looser net];W[gg]
(;B[fg]C[wrong way to push as these stones become food.];W[gh]
;B[gi];W[fh];B[fi];W[eh];B[ei];W[dg];B[di];W[fe];B[ge];W[eg]

(;B[fd]C[must push at D9 first to protect C8 stones

also, F10 isn't key point, as you'll see.];W[ef]
(;B[ld]C[this move only makes sense if it buys time to kill E8 group. but E8 becomes safe after C9, so this move is a waste]
;W[ce]C[game is effectively over with this move.];B[jb]C[good job by black getting a seki here]
;W[ja];B[ha];W[kb];B[ga];W[ia];B[mc];W[lf]C[wasted move. position already seki.]
;B[mf]C[another wasted move.];W[mg]C[third wasted move in a row in this area]
;B[ki]C[too aggressive. doesn't work. but black is desperate]
;W[ji];B[kj];W[ih];B[hi]C[those three stones have no value. no point in saving them.]
