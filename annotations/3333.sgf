C[[Migeru\] I believe I came out of the opening fairly ahead but squandered my lead in the middle game. I was able to make some gains in the endgame, but they were not enough.

Although I played the fuseki and yose better than my opponent, I am sure there is room for improvement.

I would also appreciate comments on timing, direction of play and tactics.

[IanDavis\] I will try my best ;-) Hope you learn something from the review.]

(;B[oq]C[[Migeru\] I am not very happy about this approach.

[ ID \]
There is nothing wrong about preventing your opponents shimari. If you feel uncomfortable playing this move there are several others you can choose.]

(;B[pq]SQ[np]C[It's normal to hane [ID\]];W[pp]
(;B[qq]SQ[np]C[This sequence is abnormal. Conventionally Black hanes to avoid being hut into the corner. [ID\]]
;W[nq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qn];B[kc]SQ[nr]C[It is quite painful to leave White O2.]

(;W[jp]LB[cf:B][cj:A]SQ[nr]C[[Migeru\] This seems slow to me. Would a play around D10, or an approach to D16, be better?

[ID\]
I agree because I don't like this K4 move from White. Making a double wing with B or A would definitely be better.
White can also play at the marked square ( O2 ) to ask questions of Black. As it is, Black can eat away White's lower side with O2 more or less in sente]
;B[cj];W[pj]LB[qg:B][qi:A]C[[Migeru\] As with K4, I had a feeling that my opponent was playing too close to his own strength., and could have played farther, or approached my corner

[ID\] You are right, in terms of potential it is clear that Black has staked out a much larger moyo. At this point Black is ahead.]

(;B[hc]LB[cc:A][pg:C][jj:B]C[Odd choice. I suggest three others.]
;W[qg];B[nd]SQ[od]C[This exchange has been very good for Black. O16 looks a little inbetween. Maybe the standard P16]
;W[cm]
(;B[dg]SQ[ej][em]C[Perhaps you need to really set your moyo in motion.]
;W[of]
(;B[cq]LB[gp:A]TR[dl][jl][pl][dm][dn][do][dq]C[[Migeru\] is this good timing? I considered an invasion at G4, but thought that would solidify white's corner, so I decided to invade the cornr myself.

[ID\] In my opinion it's a little too soon. Black is offering White the chance to build a framework. It is doubtful whether Black needs to invade right away as he is ahead. Why start a fight? Again I would start with O2 in this position.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co]LB[cm:A][bn:2][bo:1][dr:B]C[[Migeru\] I thought sliding (1) would be bad because white's supporting stone allowed a double hane (2). Hence I played at B.

[ID\] actually I think there is no difference];B[dr];W[er];B[br]
LB[bp:B][cr:A]C[[Migeru\] I thought this gave me better chances of making two eyes than connecting more solidly at C2. I thought a white play at B would not work (see the variations).]

(;W[fq]LB[eo:A]C[[Migeru\] wouldn't it be better to defend at A?

[ID\] yes this blocks both cuts];B[bo];W[bn];B[ap]
(;W[dn]LB[nd:A][eo:B][fq:B]C[[Migeru\] Was this too defensive? Or is it necessary because of the ladder-breaker at A? Is this a further reason for white to play F3 at E5 earlier?

[ID\] sorry I don't see a ladder];B[jj]LB[cc:A]SQ[mf][of]C[[Migeru\] I have to admit I did not know where to play next. I considered protecting my corner instead, but then a play at tengen would give white a nice moyo.

[ID\] I think a play at tengen has more potential than the san-san play now. You are also limiting White's potential. I'm not sure with P14 in place how effective Tengen can be, perhaps Black just has to Cap with a keima at N14?]
;W[od];B[oc];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[ne];W[mg];B[kg]
SQ[lf]C[[ID\] this seems a little loose to me, I would have played at thie marked space]
;W[li];B[lh]C[Doesn't look sharp];W[mh];B[mi]SQ[ki]C[[ID\] as we see later the cut is unreasonable, Black should give atari and encase moyo]
;W[ki]
(;B[ni]LB[mj:A]C[[Migeru\] I believe this was a mistake. I should have extended in the other direction

[ID\] correct];W[nf];B[le];W[lk]TR[mi][ni]C[[Migeru\] Now my two stones are dead withour compensation.

[ID\] white has also grown a moyo];B[cc]SQ[jj][nr]C[[Migeru\] Bad timing?

[ID\] Tengen has become very weak now still O2 is big. I don't think I like C17]
;W[ji];B[ij];W[kf];B[jg];W[jf];B[ig];W[lf];B[ii]C[[ID\] white has made a big reduction, purely because black tried to take too much]
;W[jl]SQ[hl]C[the keima now for black to reduce];B[gm]C[[Migeru\] I believe this reduction was correct, but later I made a mistake and lost it.]
;W[jk];B[kj];W[lj];B[kk];W[kl];B[ll];W[ml];B[lm];W[jn];B[go]
LB[gk:A]C[[Migeru\] I think this is a mistake. I should have jumped back out instead of going deeper.

[ID\] If you need to jump back out the reduction is not correct.]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[hk];B[gj];W[hj];B[hi];W[gk];B[fj]LB[fk:A]C[[Migeru\] I believe F9 would have left mee with too many weaknesses.]
;W[fk]C[White has done well];B[em];W[dk];B[dl];W[cl];B[ck]LB[ek:A]
TR[dl][gl][em][gm][go]C[[Migeru\] I don't believe a play at E9 works, so I have to give up my stones, again without compensation. If I came out of the opening ahead because of white's passivity, I more than lost my edge at this point, and I am behind.

[ID\] yes it seems Black has self destructed a little];W[el]

(;W[lq]LB[lr:A]C[[Migeru\] I can see no reason for white not to hane at A.
