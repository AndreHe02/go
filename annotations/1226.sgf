C[Requester's comment: I am keen on playing
the Sanren Sei but it has been failing me a little lately, please help!?

Hi,
I'm David S.  I will preceed my comments by "DS:"  I hope the comments make
some sense!  The San Ren Sei as I understand it is all about influence early
on and not about territory.  The goal is to use it to create a moyo.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[cd];B[jp];W[cn];B[cl]C[DS:
 As a moyo strategy, I would consider playing D8 or even D10, letting W take
the side and creating a wall facing the middle, but C8 is playable.]
;W[cg];B[pj]C[DS:
 No.  I think C13 requires a response here.  Otherwise W at C10 is just too
good.  B has C11 or D6 as options here.];W[en];B[fp];W[bp];B[cq]
;W[bq];B[br];W[cp]C[DS:
Personally, this is too early.  No need to force here yet, and it just strengthens
B.];B[dq];W[bm]C[DS:  W has missed repeatedly the C10 pincer.  B7 is an endgame move.]
;B[el]C[DS:
Hmm, I know the proverb " A one point jump is never wrong, but I think this
is wrong.  B really has to extend upward, but first B might want to play
B8 first];W[bl]C[DS: W now undercuts B and robs him of a base.]
;B[gn]C[DS:  nonsense.  B should at least extend or hane at C9 or B8.]
;W[fm];B[di]C[DS:  This is bad shape, C 11 would be ok, but B is in a lot of danger here.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[cj];B[dj];W[nq];B[oq]C[DS: Correct direction.]
;W[kq]C[DS: Bad move.  W must play O4, or if skillful O5.];B[jq]
;W[kp];B[np];W[mq]
(;B[jd]C[DS:
 B as a weak group on the left, W a newly created weak group on the bottom.
 It doesn't seem good timing to play here yet.  See last variation...]
;W[nc];B[fc];W[dc];B[ee]C[DS: B is getting dangerous here.  This move will induce W to split between B's two groups.]
;W[eg];B[df]C[DS:
Bad move.  This is a thankyou move.  W welcomes it as it strengthens the
wall that is almost surrounding B's weak D9 group.];W[dg];B[ce]
;W[be];B[dd];W[cc];B[ci];W[cf]C[DS: B should not ingore this!!!]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[bh]
(;W[de]C[DS: No, W missed the tesuji.  See variation.];B[ed]
;W[ef];B[qf]C[DS:  B still ignoring his weak group on the left. and the weak W group at the bottom.]
;W[qd];B[of]C[DS: Ok, but B should have forced at N4 first, then B's moyo on the R becomes really impressive.]
;W[pg]
(;B[qg]C[DS: I would have connected.  Then Fight and attack the second weak w group!]
;W[pf];B[ph];W[og];B[oh];W[oe];B[lc]C[Looking
back, I think this was a very bad move, with much bigger, more urgent things
to do.

DS:  Yes i agree.  Like attack at N4 or strengthen D9 group.]
;W[hd]C[This turned out to be quite devastating, I'm pretty sure I did not respond to this as well as I could.

DS: again I agree.  H17 seems the logical reply.]
(;B[he]C[DS:  bad move.];W[ge];B[gd];W[ie];B[hf];W[id];B[jf]
;W[je];B[kf];W[kd];B[ke];W[ld];B[jc];W[kc];B[ic];W[hc];B[hb]
;W[gc]
(;B[fd]C[DS:  VERY BAD MOVE.  See variation.  All you needed to do was to read out the sequence and play atari at G18.]
;W[gb];B[fb];W[jb];B[if];W[ib];B[ff];W[ko];B[pm]C[DS:
 ok, but B had many chances before to attack W here.  Attacking, not to kill,
but to build power and outward strength is the key here.  N4 followed by
P2  would be powerful.  They build up B's influence on the right as well
as attacking and protecting the corner.   Multi purpose moves are the essence
of GO.  But they can be hard to see.];W[qq]C[ What happened to my Sanren
Sei??];B[pq]C[I think this was probably a mistake too, I should have built
my territory more by blocking the other way, I guess.

DS: Yes, R4
was better here.  But I this move does have the advantage of making an attack
on W's N3 group better.  But just attacking has little value now unless B
can kill the group. Attacking is best when it is used to threaten while creating
territory elsewhere.];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[rm];W[qr]
;B[pr];W[qs];B[sn];W[sp];B[rq]C[DS:  Bad move. This does no good and uses up a potential ko threat for later.]
;W[rr];B[km]C[DS:  I still think N4 was better.  Then push up with K5.]
;W[jo]C[DS:  Now B's K4 group is short of liberties.];B[io]
;W[jr];B[hq];W[in];B[ho];W[jm];B[hm];W[kl];B[lm];W[il];B[hl]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[jk];B[ij];W[mp];B[no];W[mo];B[mn];W[ir];B[hr]
C[DS:  Now that W looks alive, there is just endgame left.]
;W[nr];B[im];W[jl];B[ll];W[lk];B[mk];W[nh]C[DS:  B could have forced at O14 at anytime before this.]
;B[ng];W[nf];B[ni];W[mh];B[mi];W[lh]C[DS:  B lost points by letting W play O12 first.]

C[This was just plain lucky for me, I'm kinda glad I didn't win based on this.

DS:
yes.  You both made several big blunders.  Don't ever play hoping your opponent
will make big mistakes.  Just play the best move possible.]
;B[jn];W[ps];B[do];W[dn];B[co];W[bo];B[fn];W[em];B[rd]C[DS:  I think B could still attack the W B5 group.]

;W[ap];B[an]C[I
didn't notice until this point that this group was vunerable, perhaps I could
have been more successful if I had noticed earlier?

DS:  It's not really that vulnerable now as A6 and C2 are miai. Earlier might have been able to be killed.]
;W[cr];B[dr];W[bs];B[ds];W[cs];B[ak]C[DS: Nonsense.  This does nothing at all. W is alive unconditionally]

;W[sc];B[qe];W[fj];B[gj];W[or];B[po];W[lo];B[sm];W[rp]C[DS:  This loses W one point.  It seems ok to connect at T5]
;B[ag];W[ae];B[ln];W[ej];B[ek];W[pe];B[ga];W[ha];B[fa];W[da]
C[DS:
 This is a gote move.  E19 would be better as if B E18 W D19, B must then
connect at F15.  D19 like this is does not pressure B at all.]
;B[ak];W[bn];B[aj];W[gm];B[gl];W[ec];B[fe]C[DS: Not needed yet,]
;W[qh];B[qi];W[rh];B[rg];W[ql];B[qm];W[ri];B[rj];W[oi];B[pi]
;W[oj]C[DS:  These attempts by W are futile.  They only hope B will make another blunder.]
;B[ok];W[lf];B[tt]C[DS:  B must connect/capture at H14 before passing.]
;W[ea];B[gf];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[DS:
 W's blunder in the middle cost him the game.  B's missed an important squeeze
at the top earlier.  I think you would improve if you studied life and death
and tesuji problems.    Study EASY ones so that they become almost automatic
and you can see the sequences easily.  That way you will reduce these blunders
and become stronger.])
(;B[gb];W[fd];B[if];W[gd];C[DS:  This wins for B.  You missed it and that lost you many points.]
