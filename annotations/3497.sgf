C[Hi, 
i'm xinwen 13K, your reviewer
I've browse through your game, overall you did quite well (= 
so i will point out your major mistake

and also welcome to the world of GO,
kgs.kiseido.com will be a great Server to improve your skill.]
;B[qf]C[To Ben,
Is something wrong with the data or did you really move R14 as your first move?

It is not wrong but kinda too uncomfortable for me (=];W[qp]
;B[fc];W[co];B[cj];W[ce];B[cc]TR[fc]C[I considered C16 here, but I don't know enough about joseki to evaluate whether it's better or not.

C17 here will be very fine =)
and i love the way it matches with F17.];W[ch]C[Actually the idea for C12 was attacking your C10. it's supposed to be a probe.

you should have respond.(see variation)]

[qk][cl]C[My idea was to try and create a moyo with moves like L10, but I didn't follow it up.

to Ben,
L10?
IMAO, I dun think L10 is a good move now (= why?
What did you gain in L10?

Those marks shows the vulnerability for opponent to strike and so moving L10 is a risk, if your opponent is strong, he/she can destroys your moyo at anytime.

So my advice is, concentrate on the side and corner then lastly to center.

Attacking at B, C D would be better =)];W[he]
(;B[fh]C[here here, what is the purpose of this? connecting to F17? but one thing always keep in mind, what is gain?

To Ben,
NO, C16 wasnt too bad either.
moving B18 might leave a cut.
for D17 too slow, should expand.];W[bd];B[de];W[cf]

To Ben,
alright, your idea is there but why did you move N10?

to my point of view
moving those area is urgent
gain points];W[nb];B[nc];W[jh];B[kj];W[ii];B[eo];W[eq];B[nj]

you shouldn't ignore E3 finish up the business first.

I don't think you should play like that..because you cant kill the dragon and also you are lacking of points..

Very obvious, you concentrate too much to protect your territory on the upper part of the board instead of attacking opponent's corner.

In GO, always keep that in mind..

2)Connect your group and disconnect your opponent's group
