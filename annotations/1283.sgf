C[I'm with white.
I've got 7 questions with this game.
Any suggestions besides my questions will be appreciated.

Thanks a lot!];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[oc];W[lc]LB[mc:a][di:b]
C[Is w6 ok here?
I like chinese fuseki or kobayashi fuseki recently, but I'm not sure which move is better.
w6, a, b, or any other moves?

6 is not right, or at least not typical.  The more propere move would be in the lower right to prevent b from making a shimari in the corner or an extension on the right or on the bottom without compensation.  A more typical sequence would be something around O3 or O4.  B then extends along the r side, but w gets compensation along the bottom.  Too many options to explore.]
;B[qj]C[This is not really the right move here.  An extension to k4 is better - then a move by B around q10 would be very big so w is almost forced to play on the right and get into a fight.  There are lots of other choices, of course.]
;W[di]C[This is good here, though I kinda prefer c14.  B should take the remaining big point then w takes d15 and b invades at the top or extends along the bottom]
;B[ce];W[cd]C[Tough choice.  the cap at e15 plays nicely to both sides.  the play at f16 looks good to the top and center.  the move played makes b strong and defends the corner, but leaves some weaknesses on top and on the side]
;B[ch];W[de]C[B should have played here - andd thiss is why.  this is a good move]
;B[cf];W[ci];B[bi];W[bj];B[bg];W[id]LB[dh:a][be:b]C[I was trying to seal the blacks and made a thick wall.
After b17, I thought it was not urgent anymore, so I chose w18.
Is it ok? Is a or b more important?

neither a nor b makes sense here.  b will live so no point in making b stronger yet unless you get enough for it.

18 is good.  also playable would be something on the lower side or even making shape with c9.  b should approach or extend along the bottom now.  I like k4, though if b doesn't mind the pincer, a closer approach could be ok - but the w pincer is not good for b here, so  a simple extension is probably best.]
;B[cq]C[Poor timing by b.  10 pts for b and huge strength for w]
;W[dq]LB[cp:a]C[I guess w20 is my fatal mistake.
After going w20 then, I was deeply regretful.
If I went a, I'd have a huge territory surrounded by w2.8.14.16.20.
Is that right?

w20 is the wrong direction and is very inconsistent with the choices at b10, c11, d11.

but it is not fatal.  it is playablee - probably about a 5-8 pt mistake.  w is still in the game, though it is uphill from here.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cr]C[this is the wrong joseki. give up the corner, take the outside strength.]
;B[br];W[bq];B[bp];W[bs];B[aq];W[ds];B[cn];W[do]C[Is there any mistake when I dealt with black's invasion since b19?]
;B[cm];W[bl]C[this series is not well played by w.  leaving behind the weakness at e2  is not good.  34 does nothing possitive -  better would be d9 or some such looking to the center.  Best would be 04, leaving the side white group to fend for itself later.]
;B[bm];W[am];B[an];W[al];B[cl];W[ck];B[aj];W[bk]C[all of this is too small unless you want to fight the ko fight. - and I think it is too soon to set it up because b can run even]

;W[bc];B[ad];W[ac];B[be];W[ih]C[up to 74 this sequence is ok - not best, but good enough.  But 74 is misplayed an may become the losing move - w should reinforce the drifting w center stones and seek to reduce the b right side a cap on the stone on the right center may work here.]
;B[fk];W[fi];B[fj];W[jk];B[jj];W[ii];B[ij];W[kj];B[ji];W[jh]
;B[ki];W[lj];B[lh];W[lf];B[mj]C[what is happening now?  where does w need to play to keep b from getting too much?  W has substantial points on the top side and must keep b from getting too much.  instead w is creating a target w group for b.]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[nj];B[mi];W[nl];B[ok];W[nm];B[pm];W[qq]C[This invasion should result in a ko at best.  better is attaching at r4 and looking to sacrifice some stones while reducing b.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[oq];B[op];W[nr];B[mq];W[sq]
;B[mr];W[os];B[kq];W[np]C[this not a good cut - it doesn't work and the center w group is vulnerable.  so something to stablize that group, taking some points, and keeping  b from attacking or getting too many points here.  then the fight becomes what happens on the upper r side.]

;B[kc];W[kd];B[ib];W[hc]C[From w132 to w200, I think I played pretty good.
But I wonder if there's any move unnecessary?

Well, I would need to really study the fight in detail to figure it out.  I think you did ok.  both b and w could have played in a more sophisticate fighting style here, but w did fine.

The  problem now is to save enough from the bottom.  This requiresss recognition of th weakness of the formation and deciding what to give up.  essentially b gets the three w stones or more if b plays more sophisticately or w makes an error.]
;B[fn]C[ok.  w just plays f5 and w is probably ahead. even losing the center stones.

you can also see that now you like to have not finished the lower left corner so that you would have the ko fight in reserve.]

If I can make it, I guess the scores would be very close.

Thanks for your review and suggestion!

not now.  but much earlier you had to sacrifice the three to save the rest an get about 20 points in the process.]
