C[Hi.

This was an even game. I played white, with a komi of 7.5.
I won this game by 2.5 points.
I'm not very satisfied with the game, I'm sure I could have done much better. That's why I would like you to comment on my game, so that I understand the main mistakes. I have put lots of comments, so that you can understand what I was thinking.

Thank you very much.

Hello!

My name is Kyle Blocher, from Indiana, USA.  This game was an exciting one to examine - both Black and White made some key mistakes, that hopefully you can begin to think about and apply to your future games.

This game is a showcase of a variety of the kind of mistakes that are easy to illustrate, and give lots of different kinds of situations.  It's a great game to review.  Thanks for sending it in.

The first, 15-second impression of this game was your attitude of approach.  You do use lots of emotional words, like 'feels good' or 'strange' but the majority of your comments were negative.  Changing your attitude from a negative or defensive one to a positive look will help to improve your game as well.  Remember, [especially in this game\] your opponent might be thinking "Boy, I'm way behind - how am I going to make enough points from my moyo to win?"  I know when I was your level when I had a thought like this then I was sure to make direction mistakes and lose.

I will begin all my comments with [kb\].  Have fun reading!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]
(;W[cd]C[[kb\]: I hate to pick on White's game so early, but I don't like this W4 here.  Intuition tells me that if you want to play on the 3-4 point, then play it facing the other direction.  That way, when you pincer (as you did with W6), your pincer stone works directly with your star-point stone in the bottom left.  See variation.]
;B[ed];W[hd]C[I usually don't play this pincer, it was a try.

[kb\]: It can be played here, I think.];B[ef];W[cf];B[cc];W[bc]
;B[cn]TR[cc][ed][ef]C[[kb\]: Keep in mind that Black is one move behind in the top left corner.  Pick a move that allows you to use your H16 stone to attack Black's three stones on a large scale later.  Pincering this stone is correct but maybe high is better.]

(;W[cl]C[I played this move, because I was hoping to have some territory on the left. My goal was to push black in the center so that I can make territory both at the left and bottom. I also hesitate to approach the top right corner (see variation)

[kb\]: You can also consider pincering lightly with D11, for the reason I listed at Move 16.]

(;B[en];W[fp];B[gn]
(;W[el]C[I play this move, because I didn't want a pincer around C11

[kb\]: D11 feels good here.  Your future attack on Black at the top can then be strong.  See variation.]
;B[hp]C[After this move (that I expected), I didn't know what to play.]

(;W[bp]LB[ip:D][gq:C][hq:A][iq:B]C[This move seemed ok, but I didn't feel very happy. I would have like to play at the top before black.

[kb\]: Usually White plays A-D before defending at B4.];B[jc]
;W[hf];B[mc];W[dg]C[I think I was to concentrated about territory, so I added this move. With this move, both white and black will escape to the center.

[kb\]: You should be attacking these Black stones with your two center stones, ruining Black's plan of a moyo in the middle.]
;B[fg];W[ke]C[I tried to make shape for my stones.];B[fi]C[This move made me feel bad. I feeled like I had to add a move in the left. But black is building a huge moyo in the center and the right (if we omit my three stones at the top).

[kb\]: Black is only running away with his weak stones.  G8 is urgent - it makes both groups weaker.  See variation.]

(;W[eh];B[fh];W[ei]C[[kb\]: At least, play something to reinforce your middle stones.]
;B[hh];W[fe]C[Again, I tried to make shape. So I peeped here.]
;B[ee];W[fd]C[Complete the shape and threaten E17

[kb\]: This really doesn't do much except help Black make eye potential on the edge.  If you must play in this area, try to take away eye shape from Black, such as playing lower (F17, G17) or capturing C17.]
;B[ec];W[fj]C[Then it was urgent to escape, otherwise black would have increased his stones in the center.]
;B[fc];W[gc]C[I didn't want black to link up his stones.

[kb\]: Absolutely.];B[cb];W[gj];B[bb];W[ad];B[gq]C[Black is correct here - he can live at the top or escape.  This is a huge point.]
;W[fq];B[pj]C[At this moment, I was afraid by black moyo. I didn't know where to approach (invade).

[kb\]: Black is ahead to my judgment right now.  How to invade the black moyo?]

(;W[qf];B[qh];W[qc]C[This wasn't really good I think. I was then confined in the corner. And if I had jumped in P14, black would have taken the corner with S16, which is lot of territory. Both moves seemed bad, so I conclude that R14 wasn't good.

[kb\]: You're right.  You can try something more dynamic like R16 or S16.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[rf]
(;B[og]C[Now, my white stones in the center are beetwen two black walls, so I decided it was urgent to do something and took some territory before black attacked.

[kb\]: This is a bad decision by Black.  The white stones near the top already have one eye and enough potential to make another;  this means that Black can't hope to make any territory.  Black should have blocked in the other direction.  In any case, P13 is a blind joseki move - the cut is not threatening here.

Black could have played something like O4 and have a won game.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[lc];B[lb];W[md];B[nc]
(;W[me]C[At this point, I felt ok for those stones, but black took the initiative to play a big point.

[kb\]: K16 is better.];B[pm]C[At this point, it was really hard for me, because black seemed to have both territory on the right, and a really good influcence in the center. I hesitated to resign.

[kb\]: If Black played O4 you have little chance, but the bottom is still pretty open.]

(;W[np]C[With this move, my goal was to establish my stones on the bottom and go to the center when attacking black stones on the left.

[kb\]: The Black stones on the left will be hard to attack, but if Black pincers you here then you can get some corner territory at least.  If Black defends the corner you can establish a presence on the bottom.

Maybe probing Black's intentions with Q3 is good.];B[oq];W[nq]
C[But this move put an end to my strategy because black took the big point of L4. I thought to extend to K4 instead, but I was afraid of the invasion in M4.]
;B[kp];W[ih]C[I then decided to do something in the center and then rescued my stones at the bottom.]
;B[lq]C[Now, I have nothing in the bottom, so I escape.];W[nn]
;B[nl]C[Black can now attack my stones when building influence in the center, and territory on the bottom. I was totally crushed here.

[kb\]: Your three stones are really heavy, yes.];W[lo];B[oo]
;W[lp];B[mq];W[ml];B[nr]
(;W[no]TR[gn][hp]C[[kb\]: Just run.  You can aim at slicing through on the left.]
;B[hi];W[gl];B[gr];W[fr];B[bo];W[co];B[do];W[cp];B[bn];W[dm]
C[I was quite thin here, so I reinforced.];B[dn]
(;W[ng]TR[bn][cn][dn][en][gn][bo][do]C[[kb\]: You can cut ALL the triangled stones.  See variation.]
;B[oh];W[nh];B[ak];W[bk];B[ni];W[mi];B[ii];W[jh];B[al];W[aj]
;B[am];W[bj];B[fs];W[es];B[gs];W[dr];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[jk]
C[I have no choice but to take the center and rescued the stones at the bottom.

[kb\]: you can already get them out.  Cut off Black's stones by playing H5 and you win the game.

This is the end of my comments.  The game is even and the endgame is where thisis game will be decided. Whoever makes the bigger mistake wins!]
;B[ik];W[jj];B[nj];W[mj];B[mm];W[mk];B[nm];W[on]C[This move was really bad. I was thinking black will block at Q6 and then I could play M7 to stop blacK...]
;B[lm]C[But he didn't];W[kn];B[gm];W[km];B[op];W[pn]C[same here. There are bigger points elsewhere (maybe H7, or the monkey jump T11]

;W[ga];B[ab];W[of];B[pf];W[pg]C[This move has no goal. Better play P15.]
