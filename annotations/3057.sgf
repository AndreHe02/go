AB[jd][dj]C[Okay as you can see, i set a handycap on myself.
Most of my comments were made while a was still playing, I'll put

P: text entered while playing.

E: text added by me after looking through game again.


R:  Hi there!  i will mark my comments with R:
Hope I can be of some use to you.];W[dd]C[P: I figure the star point is nice and simetrical.]
;B[jj];W[fk]C[P: I'll play at E3 and hopfully protect the corner.

R:  sensible];B[ek];W[fj]
(;B[ej]C[R:this is defensive.

perhaps D7 or D6 would be better for you to make territory.  There is no real threat here.  See variation]
;W[ch]C[P: I'm a bit distrot over where to go C5 or H3.

R: C5 would be my choice];B[ci];W[dh]C[P: I choose F2 instead of F5 with hopes to connect with the other corner or atleast add area.]

(;B[fl]C[E: I'm not overly sure if i should have gone somewhere else. This wasn't the worst move but i feel like there was a better place.

R:  its early in the game to be playing there.  Something around F11 (attacking) or H11 (defensive) might win you more territory.
or indeed K7

Early in the game always look for the biggest move.

This is the move which cost you the game in my opinion.

When you are following your oponent around the board and simply responding to their moves then you are going to loose (this situation is called being in gote).
If your opponent is following you around the board then you are in sente.

This was your chance to get into sente, take the initiative, tell white where to move instead of letting her dictate where you move.

If you don't have to respond to a move then that is your chance to have a think about where to move, what will be best.  Keep in mind that the move you make you want your opponent to respond to, you don't want them to have the luxury of being allowed to move anywhere.

As this is the most important move in the game I will outline a few alternatives in the variations.]
;W[gl];B[el];W[hc];B[ic];W[hd]C[P: I've narrowed the options to either K8 or 7, but the star point is possibly too far.

R:  I would agree];B[jf];W[hk]C[P: A move at K or L3 seems apropriate, but i can't help but notice the large potenshaly soon to be white teratory in the middle.

R:  a move at C11 should enter your mind before it is too late.  I will try and see when I would play it.  Not yet though - J3 is needed.]

(;B[jk]C[R: J3 should have got you a few more points than K3]
;W[fi]C[P: I feel the need to play H6 or 4, but don't know it'll put enough presure on white.

R:  Now is when I would play C11  I will demo here in a variation.  It is a well-known joseki and well worth knowing.

You were worried about white getting large territory in the middle - perhaps G7 would neutralise this.]

(;B[hj];W[hg]C[E: Well, my plan kinda back fired here a bit, sould i have played around H6?

R:  or H7.  Something in that area.  If unsure of a move ask yourself where your opponent wants to move next.  A good move for them is usually a good move for you.]
;B[ig];W[hb];B[ib];W[bh];B[bi];W[ia]
(;B[jb]C[E: This is actualy what cost me. One really stupid big blunder. Even know i still don't have a clue why i thought i had to do this. This single move cost me 8 points.

R:  K13 would have been fine];W[ja];B[kb];W[ka];B[lb];W[ai]

;W[ij];B[ii];W[gk];B[if];W[ha];B[id];W[di]C[P: Okay to pass or just one more to secure. One point could change the outcome. I'll secure just in case]

(;B[ki]C[E: Now that i look at this i probly didn't need to do this but i wasn't sure.

R:  If in doubt then defend - you'll really kick yourself if you don't defend and then it turns out you should have]

R:  Well I hope this has been of some use to you.  The main thing to learn from this is as follows:

if there is not an urgent move (something you have to do) then what is the biggest move on the board?  what will gain you the most?  what will keep you in sente and out of gote?

Ask yourself after every move your opponent makes:  do I have to respond to that or can I take sente?]
