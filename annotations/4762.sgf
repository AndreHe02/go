C[For Reviewer: Hello, I have left notes at locations of interest but please do review other things, as I have only asked what I can comprehend.]
;B[pd]C[idonotknow [3k\]: hi
nub [4k\]: hello];W[dc];B[pp];W[cp];B[ep];W[dq]C[I believe this exchance is bad for white...

Yes, I would agree with you but it is still in the early stage of the game, so you can't make any conclusion.]
;B[eq];W[cm];B[ip]C[Correct to play high?

J3 is just as good, it is a matter of style and preference, there is no right or wrong answer here.]
;W[qf];B[mc]LB[qh:A]C[Just a personal style move, did not take in any deep consideration when playing this...

Pincher at somewhere around A is as good.];W[rd];B[qc];W[pi]
LB[qi:A]C[White to play A better.

3rd line is the line of territory.];B[qk]C[Correct punishment for white's high play?

Yes, good move, S16 is not agreeable as black N17 is in a better position as compared to O17 (let's if white R14 and black O17, then S16 is OK).

Normally, white enter 3-3 when black play N17.];W[qj];B[pk]
;W[nq];B[lq]LB[pq:A]C[Looked like a good move...

For me, I would play A to protect the corner, but again, this is a matter of style.]
;W[no]LB[qq:A]C[White should enter 3-3 here.];B[pn]
(;W[jq]C[Gah, hate when people play this :(

Rather too aggressive and look like an overplay.

Pls look at the variation for optimal play.];B[jp];W[iq]LB[kq:A]
C[Maybe black should play A here.];B[hq];W[hr];B[gr];W[ir]LB[kq:A]
C[Another chance for black to play A.];B[gq];W[kq]
(;B[kp]C[L4 I would say is a weak move and white get a good position early.]
;W[lr];B[lp];W[mq];B[ce]LB[dh:A][cf:B]C[White should pincer around A.

Black can consider to play B instead of C15 to avoid the pincer.]

(;W[cd];B[de];W[gc];B[ci]C[Again, better exchange for me?

Well, black is only marginally better, may not have an impact on the final result...]
;W[jc]LB[ck:A][ei:B][pr:C][qq:D]C[White should play A, hoping for black B and then white C, hoping for black D and then back to K17.

White K17 is big but not forceful.];B[rc]LB[ck:A]C[Black A is much bigger.]
;W[pr]LB[ck:A]C[White A bigger.];B[qq];W[qr];B[rr]LB[rk:A][rl:B]
[ck:C]C[If I am white I would like to play A, hoping for black B and then play C.]
;W[nf]LB[qh:A]C[White O14 is bad, black can still invade at A...]

(;B[em]C[Good move.];W[ck];B[cj]LB[ej:A]C[Seemed like a good move...

OK, you can play A also.]
(;W[gn]C[:( Unsure how to deal with this, I just gave up my wall and decided to build a second one up top.]

(;B[gl];W[in];B[il];W[kn];B[mn];W[fm]LB[el:A]C[Black should play A then white wouldn't be able to connect.]
;B[fl];W[en];B[gm]C[This atari can be omitted.];W[fn];B[dk]
;W[cl];B[ho]C[This is a "thank you" move, you can wedge at H6 and cut white later...]
;W[hn];B[jm];W[jn];B[mo]LB[rk:A]C[White should play A.];W[lm]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[dp];W[cq];B[ge]LB[qh:A]C[Good move, you can also invade at A.]
;W[gh]C[White really like deep invasion...

Somewhere at H12 is more reasonable, I feel that white is ahead, so there is no need to take risk.]
;B[hc];W[hb];B[hd];W[fb];B[ih];W[ii]LB[ji:A]C[Black should play A.

I feel that black is behind, so you have to capture J11 as well.]
;B[hh];W[hi];B[gi];W[gj];B[fi];W[hk];B[hl];W[fj]LB[ji:A]C[White F10 too greedy, should play A instead.

Here, position A is urgent for both sides.];B[ei]LB[ej:A]C[Wrong move... Should have play A instead.]
;W[ej];B[dj];W[ek]LB[dl:A]C[=(

Black A better, force white to cut in gote.];B[jj]C[Is this a misclick?]
;W[ji];B[lk]TR[jj][ji]C[K10/K11 exchange, black did not gain anything, but rather helping white to escape...]
;W[kj];B[kk];W[jk]LB[ik:A][ij:B][km:C][ln:D][kl:E][ll:F]C[Here, if you exchange A for B and C for D...

White will not be able to cut at E as you got F to capture.]
;B[jl];W[ik];B[ll];W[mm];B[lj];W[ki]LB[nn:A]C[Here, black need to play A for safety.]
;B[nk];W[nn];B[go];W[fo];B[fp];W[io]TR[mn][mo][lp][lq][kp][jp]
[ip][ho][go]LB[fr:A][hp:B][cs:C][gp:D][ds:E]C[Here, black A is the correct move.

White B can capture 9 stones in gote.

The correct sequence - black A, white B, black C, white D.

If white B were to atari at E, black can play B.

This is why black need to play O6.];B[hp]C[White can kill black here...]

(;W[pm]LB[om:A][fr:B]C[Q7 is an overplay, black A can capture rather easily.

The keypoint here is rather B for kill.];B[qm];W[qn];B[po];W[ql]
;B[rm]C[Misread this... Alternative???];W[pl];B[rl];W[rk]LB[om:A]
C[White S9 is like a trick move.

All black need to do is play A and capture 3 stones...]

;W[lg]TR[em][fl][gl][gm][hl][il][jl][jm][kk][lj][lk][ll][nk]
[mh]LB[fr:A]C[I feel like ending the review here, however I still dropped a few comments at the later part of the game.

White got A to kill and the marked dragon is not alive yet.

Black should resign here (the elegant way).];B[el];W[dl];B[lh]
;W[kg];B[kh];W[jh];B[jg]C[Not a cut...];W[ig];B[hg];W[jf];B[mg]
;W[mf]TR[mg]LB[le:A][ke:B]C[Here, N13/N14 exchange is very bad.

You lose sente at A and B and you make yourself tight in liberties.]
;B[ol];W[om];B[nl];W[nm];B[km];W[mp];B[dn];W[cn];B[do]LB[dm:A]
[ln:B][lo:C]C[White should cut at A.

Black can't cut at B (white C captures), white in time trouble here?]
;W[lo]C[Only worth gote 5 points...];B[dm]C[This is like 1000 points.]
;W[hf]LB[ff:A]C[Here, black A better.];B[gg];W[gf];B[fg];W[fe]
;B[ff];W[fd];B[bd];W[bc];B[dd];W[cc];B[pg];W[pf];B[og];W[ng]
;B[nh];W[oh]TR[mg][mf]LB[li:A][qh:B]C[Here, white A or B miai.

Now you can see N13/N14 is real bad, or black B actually works.]
;B[qh];W[qi]LB[rh:A][li:B][of:C]C[Black should play A.

If white cut at B, black cut off 3 white stones at C also.

So actually white should just play B.];B[ri];W[li];B[of];W[oe]
;B[rh]LB[nd:A][nc:B][pe:C]C[To make things simpler, white can exchange A with B then connects at C.

If black choose to cut at C, white can take A and B, which seems to be bigger.]

Still white A to kill, a pity white did not realize it through out the game.]

LB[ap:A]C[I think you know you should play A and white need B1 for 2 eyes.

Guess you are trying to create a situation to resign.
