Hikertrash [17k\]: Hi ... have fun


Hi, this is an even game I played recently. I am black against a player 2 stones stronger. I eventually lost due to a catastrophic ko mistcalculation. In my own review of the game, I've become fixated on that one crucial error. The game was pretty close but for that one mistake, I think :-)

I'd love to have another set of eyes on the game. I've recently been told in a teaching game that I need to pay attention to cutting and connecting more.

Thanks for your comments and your review.];B[pd]C[espiral [15k\]: thanks, you too :)]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[cd];B[oq]C[This is my standard hoshi-keima enclosure opening. I've been thinking alot about this opening lately. As I was coming up through the low 20's, my opponents often let my forma a double wing formation with the keima enclosure.

What is your general opinion of this opening and the moves that follow?

- opening is mostly personal preference. I feel that R4 is oddly placed with respect to Q16. I like Q3, but this is ok.]
;W[qj]C[White won't let me get that double-wing :-D];B[ql]C[Is R8 right? I read recently on Senseis Library that R12 is preferable as it pressures R10 and helps build a formation on the top right.

- take this into consideration: W has other positions to play that will be of equal/greater gain. G9 would put some pressure on your weak left group. M3 is a natural extension for W as well.]

Thanks again for your comments!

- i felt that the ko fight for the K2 group was yours to win. had you seen that ko threat at H8, you would've won the game! after you lost that group, it was game over. I quickly sped through the rest of the game and played out the end game. W wins by a lot. Your main issues are that you don't know when to fight and run - you seem to have them mixed up. you fight when you should run and, well sometimes you dont run until its too late.
Most notable was move 35. That is a move that I think you should analyse on your own time. Ask yourself  "why did I make this move? what could I have done better? why was/wasn't it effective?". I can probably answer most of those questions to a degree of competency, but I feel that it would be very good for you to explore the reasons behind that move. If you understand why you did it and why it was wrong, then your game will improve dramatically.]
