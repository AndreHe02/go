AB[pd][dp]C[This was a game on the KGS. I (14kyu) played black with a two point handicap against white (12kyu). It looked quite good for me up to the end game when I started losing points to W.


Hi there!

This is my first review for the GTL, I hope you enjoy it. To distinguish my comments from yours, I'll put "fey:" in front of them.

As it is easier for me, too, I'll comment on both your and white's moves, giving some variations along the way.

Please note that I'm only a  3-kyu and far from skilled in the game of Go, so take everything I say sceptically and feel free to contact me in case you have any further questions.

Also see my comments at the end of this file, please.

fey
(Nadja Sommerfeld, 2ndtry@gmx.de)];W[dd];B[qp];W[nc];B[qg]C[fey: As white played the small knight's approach move of O17, R13 gives a thin feeling.
It's certainly playable, but one should be aware that it leaves white more space to have fun with in the corner.
Usually, invading the 3-3 point after black "enclosed" the corner with a large knight's move is a nice move because it faces black with some directional difficulties. See also the variation some moves ahead.]
;W[jd]
(;B[jq]TR[dp][qp]SQ[kp][kq]C[fey: This point is fine, though you should note that the triangled stones on hoshi and komoku form one of the standard opening patterns of go. It can lead to the so-called chinese opening which emphasises influence as well as territory and is therefore also popular among pro players.
The proper moves to complete the chinese opening are the marked points, which balance nicely with your two bottom stones. As you saw later on, K3 doesn't affect the lower right corner too much and can't be considered a true pincer for any white approach move.

At my club we use to call the move you played the "pseudo-chinese". ;-)

For some developments after having played the chinese opening see the variation.

Some moves ago, I mentioned black's problem when white invades the upper right corner. Let's look at this in a second variation starting with WR17 (though this move may be a bit early to play now, just for reference)]

(;W[cn];B[cl]
(;W[cq]C[fey: Just because this move starts a common joseki, it isn't necessarily good. Say "thanks" to white for helping you to strenghten your moyo and being contend with a few point in the corner. :)
Probably, white could consider jumping to E6 instead in this case, flattening black's moyo and aiming at a counterattack on black's C8. I've added a var.]
;B[dq];W[cp]
(;B[ci]C[fey: Here, you should calmly play the normal joseki. See the var.]
;W[cf]C[fey: I don't like this move on white's part. It leaves still room to invade the corner and doesn't threaten your two stones much as they already form a quite solid shape. White *has* to play against your moyo!]
;B[ql]C[fey: Consider making the P4 shimari here.];W[pb]C[fey: As explained in a previous variation, white missed a chance here. Say thanks again! :)]
;B[qc];W[oq]C[Up to here I thought I was doing pretty well.

fey: You play solid, calm moves up to here and solidified quite a large territory on the right. But notice most of your stones were played on the third line, emphazising territory. The handicap stones you recieved demanded a moyo-orientated game - by playing just third-line moves you played against the hoshi's intention in a way. 
The game is pretty open at this point , and white doesn't really have a need to feel uncomfortable because he has lots of possibilities to reduce your territory and he -as the player giving the handicap- can count on his superior skill in close fights.]
;B[pq]C[fey: This'd be a fine move if K3 was L3, acting at a pincer at the same time. Q3 is certainly not inferior in this case, too, considering you can't be easy on white here as he's the one who invaded your sphere of influence.]
;W[op];B[mq]C[fey: Agressive! Your move shows the right attitude and looks much better than letting white form an easy base after bQ6 wM3.]
;W[pp];B[pr]SQ[qq]C[fey: This move leaves a weakness, as you saw. Better to simply connect at the marked point.]
;W[qq]C[Here point I didn't know how to treat this attack properly

fey: I guess he played R3 simply as a forcing move to get R5 in sente.
To avoid wP2 to be sente, too, you could have played as in the variation.]

(;B[rq]LB[qo:A]C[Here point I didn't know how to treat this attack properly.
Should I rather have played A instead?

fey: The move you propose lets him capture Q2 group and gives him an easy base in the corner. R2 looks best here (see previous comment), but S3 is ok, too.]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[pn]
(;B[ol]SQ[ne]C[fey: Good.
You face quite a difficult choice of direction here: Should you chase the weak white group by pushing from the bottom or by pushing from above, as you did?
If you get to follow up your move with something like the marked point in the future, it is fine.
Consider the variation, too.];W[nn]
(;B[fc]C[Should I have started this attack at all?

fey: There's nothing wrong with invading, but I don't like the place you chose. Look at the variations for some alternatives.]
;W[ec];B[ic]C[fey: You may feel an urge to create a base for the F16 stone, but in fact it's better to simply extend to F16 (which is a nice point for both of you) first. If he stops you from running out by capping, you can try for a base, too.]
;W[jc];B[id]C[fey: Usually, this move is considered bad style because it leaves white with the extremely nice point of J15 (almost a no-brainer from point of shapes - "hane at the head of two stones" is almost never wrong). In this case, however, you don't seem to have many alternatives, sadly enough. :/]
;W[ie];B[he];W[je]C[fey: Timid, but ok, since the ladder works for black.]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[fe]
(;W[fd]C[fey: This moves doesn't gain white anything and loses lots of aji.
In fact, white really made it easy for you here. Your invasion can be considered a success. Also keep in mind, that you can still play C17 in his corner.
At least white should try to reduce you to one eye and maybe aim at a splitting attack on the invading group and your left-side stones, possibly starting with F18 instead of this move, though I admit I didn't think about this too carefully. ;-)]
;B[gd];W[ed];B[fb];W[jh]C[fey: This white move is a bit odd. It is played on a nearly neutral point and it hasn't much effect on your group (which, btw, looks already safe, alive and all fine - if white tries to kill with the H17 placement, you simply play H18).]

(;B[eg]C[This was an attempt to connect to the group on the left to make it safer.

fey: You are right, it's important to keep an eye on your two stones on the left side, though they are far from being in mortal danger, it's better to play a safe defense move early than having to worry about some eyeless stones later. 
But maybe you could try for a connection to your bottom stones instead, simultaniously building up some kind of moyo. See the var.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[of];B[oh]C[fey: Nice point!];W[mg]TR[jf][kg]

[sq][sr][rr][qq][qr][hq][gq][eq][fq][lr][kr][jr][ir][hr][gr]
[fr][er][ak][aj][bk][bj][hd][gb][gc][hc][hb]C[fey: Let's take a look at the board now: Most of the groups are safe, black is ahead in secure territory and will win if he plays a solid endgame.
I'm not good at counting, but I'll hazard a rough estimate:

Black:
Left side: 4 Pts.
Upper side: 5 Pts.
Lower right corner: 7 Pts.
Lower side: 13 Pts.
Right side: 26 Pts.
==Total: 55 Pts.==

White:
Upper left corner: 11 Pts.
Lower left corner: 7 Pts.
Upper side: 22 Pts.
Komi: 0.5 Pts.
==Total: 40.5 Pts.==

Plus, the marked white group isn't all settled and black could still profit from attacking it, perhaps starting with M6.]
;B[gp]C[fey: Good, makes the bottom black territory. Consider D5 or E7 first, though, as they are sente against the white corner.]
;W[do]C[fey: Indeed a nice point! Could have been played by both of you for some time ago.]
;B[eo];W[en];B[fo];W[fn];B[dm]C[Thinking about this move now, it doesn't seem very good.

fey: It's not too bad, at least, it doesn't do any harm because you couldn't have cut white here anyways. 
But as you correctly spotted, it doesn't help you very much, too.]
;W[dn]LB[ja:F][qb:E][cr:D][bg:C][bm:B][ca:A]C[fey: Yose time! I have to admit that the endgame isn't my strong point, but there are some big points not to be missed which I marked here. (Big endgame points for black)

Sadly, it seems like white got most of the big yose plays...

As already mentioned above, you may also be able to chase white's weak group around a bit, thereby taking profit.]
;B[fk];W[fi]C[fey: Actually there isn't much to reduce for white here, both of you could simply stick to the big endgame points along the edge and gain more. Plus, this "reduction" seems a bit deep to me - trying to save this stone white should damage his position elsewhere.]
;B[hh]C[Here I wanted to answer the attack by isolating the single white stone

fey: Your plan is correct and of course it'd be a nice bonus if the invading stone actually died.
Just as a "feeling" move, I'd suggest H11 if you try to caputre white because this way, white can play H11 and try to connect to either his upper side group or one of his groups in the lower half of the board.]
;W[dh]C[The answer of W then took me by surprise

fey: Yep, a somehow strange move...]
(;B[di]C[fey:...which you answered much to submissively. At least separate his forces by cutting as shown in the variation.]
;W[eh];B[gh];W[gj];B[fj];W[gi];B[gl];W[ch];B[bi];W[bh]C[fey: White got a nice result here :/]
;B[hn]C[fey: This move doesn't gain you much. Your group on the left side is safe enough to look after itself, neither of white's groups is threatened by H6 and it doesn't stake out much territory.
R18, for example, looks more appealing now, as white might even consider it sente due to the threat of bP18.]
;W[or]C[fey: A well-timed move on white's part, which allows him to jump to M1 in sente later.]
;B[qr];W[lq]C[fey: As white is behind, he needs to play agressively, but actually I reckon that M1 is sufficient for him here.]

(;B[kq]C[fey: You shouldn't give way so easily here. M4 looks quite nice here - I've tried some variations starting with this move.]
;W[lp];B[jo]C[fey: As this is territorially small and doesn't put much pressure on white, it should be better played at M2 to connect your lone stone.]
;W[kn]C[fey: M2 is a nice point for white, too, making his group perfectly safe while undercutting black's territory.
I can't really grasp his intention for playing this move.];B[mm]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[ml];B[mk];W[ll];B[mi]TR[dr][ah][lr][bm][qb][ca]
C[fey: A nice sequence, enlarging your territory,
But though I don't want to pick on this to much, there are still other huge points to be taken, which I triangled here.]
;W[qb]C[fey: Certainly big!];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd]C[fey: As you saw right on, this is clearly an overplay. Simply grabbing the big point of C18 would be enough for you to maintain your lead.]
;W[od];B[pc];W[nb];B[rb]C[fey: Big, but gote. C19, again, or D19 if you want to be sure of keeping sente.
A12 is sente for both players and therefore well worth being played, so is B7, D2 keeps you sente , too and M2 isn't too small either.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[lr]C[fey: See the difference now that white played M2?]
;B[kr];W[fg];B[ff];W[ef];B[gg];W[fh]C[fey: White should simply capture at D13 here.]
;B[ee]C[fey: Exactly!];W[df];B[de]
(;W[cd]C[fey: This move is too careful on white's part - black's cut at C16 doesn't cause much trouble. Check the variation.]
;B[ce];W[be];B[ca]C[fey: One of the biggest points remaining on the board!]
;W[cb];B[db];W[eb];B[ea];W[dc];B[da];W[ba];B[fa];W[bc]LB[bm:A]
C[From this point onward I think I went wron. I thought there were points in the centre of the board. But probably A would have ensured a lot more territory

fey: Yes, A strikes me as being, along with S6 maybe, the biggest point on the board. It's double sente, too.]
;B[ik]C[fey: As you already mentioned, there are not much points to be made here.]
;W[jl];B[il];W[cm];B[el]C[fey: B8 instead of this move would be better, you can be sure white will play B7 first and you can protect D7 afterwards.]
;W[bl];B[ck];W[bk];B[bj];W[em];B[dl];W[dj]C[fey: Is white trying to kill an already connected group?]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[gk]C[fey: You don't need this move - S6 is big and could still win you the game.]
;W[rm];B[rl];W[sl];B[sk];W[sm];B[rj]C[fey: White gained a lot here.]

fey: The game still isn't lost - though gote, K19 is a big point for you now, too, and M1 is some additional points in sente as well.]
;B[nj];W[om];B[km];W[lm];B[jn];W[ko];B[kp];W[lo]C[fey: Does white really need all those defensive moves? He seems to want to stay in gote badly. ;-)]

==============

None of you seems to have noticed that the lower right corner can be turned into seki by white - see the last variation. :)

Though I seem to have criticised a lot, most of my comments are merely suggestions and "betters" - In my opinion, you played a good game here which was lost in the endgame because your opponent grabbed most of the big points while you took gote for not-needed or small moves.
Maybe you like to have a look at the books "Get Strong at the Endgame" and "The Endgame".
(But who am I to talk, I'm just the same and even managed it once to lose 40 [!\] points in yose.)
Plus, there were some opportunities for you to build a big moyo and thereby put your opponent at a disadvantage. A book on handicap go could be very instructive here. ("Handicap Go" from the "Elemementary Go Series" for example, "Kage's Secret Chroncicles of Handicap Go" is a non-dry and quite useful book, too)

I hope my comments were helpful and not too extensive (If I once start typing, I tend to be very wordy ;-) ), as this was my first review I'd be of course glad to hear which points you liked and where I could improve something.

Keep GOing! :)
