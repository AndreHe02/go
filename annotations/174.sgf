;B[pn];W[pj];B[dj]TR[pj][nq][nd]C[possible. but white has some weak stones (marked). black should
consider to put pressure on these stones. maybe a pincer in to
top right or bottom right corner? since black already has extensions
from the hoshi-stones, a pincer would be a strong attack.=20]
;W[dh];B[kq];W[fq]
(;B[hq]LB[eq:A]C[possible, but a little overconcentrated. i'd consider to play
14
at A. see variation.];W[cq];B[cp]LB[dq:A]TR[dj][dh]C[ok, since the marked black stone is in place. but black
has to be careful about the marked white stone. there is already
a threat to invade a territory black hasn't even claimed yet!
on the other hand, 16 at A would be  a little overconcentrated
(=3Dno too big problem in a h5 game). i don't know if 16 or A is
better.];W[dq];B[fp]LB[fr:B][ep:A]C[A would be the joseki move. white could answer with 18 (but black
can cut) or B (which is slow for white in a h5 game).];W[gq]
;B[gp];W[hp]LB[ep:A]C[there is the cut! and black has a weakness at A. ok, white is
weak too, but in a h5 game black wants to keep things simple.
complication will (most likely) turn into white profit.];B[ip]
LB[iq:A]C[after a cross-cut: extend (here: play A)!];W[ho];B[hr]
C[22 was atari instead of extension, so black has to spend one
more move to defend. now white can take the initiative.];W[ep]
;B[eo];W[eq];B[cn];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm]LB[do:A][en:B]C[this exchange (18-32) was better for white, and black has
still some bad aji at A and B. but hey, it's a h5 game.];W[mn]
C[now blacks 4 stones on the lower side are under attack. but whites
2 stones on the right are weak too. black should run to the centre,
helping his own stones and attacking white at the same time.]
;B[mp]LB[jn:A][ko:B]C[i'd rather play something like A or B.]
;W[oo];B[po];W[np];B[on];W[nn];B[mq]C[still posible, but i think that is the wrong direction. black
should go to the centre.=20];W[io];B[jp];W[pr];B[qq];W[qr]LB[kn:A]
C[white has the chance to seal black in (and stabilize his own
groups by connecting) with a move like A. black would be forced
to answer to make his group definitely alive.

White should play moves like 45 in the endgame, but not now.]
;B[rr];W[pq];B[rp];W[cj]LB[kn:A]C[i'm surprised. i think a move around A is now very important
for
black AND white! first white plays end-game moves to settle himself
and now he leaves the group still unsettled and plays tenuki.
(if white really wants to tenuki, i'd rather play on the right
or upper side)];B[dk];W[ck];B[cl];W[do]C[yes, that is blacks weak spot. and yes, white will take some
profit. but this is not big enough for white. black can't expect
much more than capturing two stones - and this is end-game =3D
too small now.]
(;B[dn]LB[en:A]C[i'd rather play A. see variation.];W[en];B[em]
;W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[gm]LB[kn:A]C[not really a mistake, but not very effective. what is the purpose
of this move? the white group is too strong to be attacked. and
the black group is hardly any stronger after adding this stone.
i think it's (still) more important  to attack the weak white
stones on the lower right (with a move like A).];W[il]C[after this move it will be more difficult for black to cut the
white group on the lower right off. but i think it would be even
better for white to make a simple connection.];B[mo];W[no];B[ln]
C[OK. 62 and 64 show the right attitude, but after ignoring 61,
black will have to make a little (!) sacrifice in this area of
the board. still i'm convinced that it is better for black to
play on the lower side, than answering 61 on the left side.]
;W[hj];B[fi]LB[ci:A]C[possible, but what about cutting at A instead? if the black group
needs to be stabilized, this would be a nice way to do so.]
;W[fg];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[hg]C[the last moves have been a little better for white, but black
is not in any trouble (so far).];B[nf]LB[lc:A]TR[pj]C[hmmm. if 72 aims attacking the marked white stone, it shows the
right attitude. but this white stone has so much room to move.
it will be hard to attack it effectively. i'd rather play a pincer
around A - attack the white stone on the upper right and build
a solid position on the upper side.];W[bg]C[i think i'd rather answer 72 on the upper right. but, on the
other hand, it is almost a sente move.];B[bf]C[ok! i do not know, if balck needs this move to make his stones
alive. but it is a good idea to play safe.=20];W[cg]LB[ch:B]
[ci:A]C[because of the weakness at A i'd prefer 75 to be at B.]
;B[cb]C[ok. solid move.=20];W[dl]C[i do not really understand this move.]
;B[bl]LB[ci:A]C[good. after 78 black has again the possibility to cut at A. that
means that 73 and 75 are not very effective. and 77 has only
little aji left. this sequence was not so good for white.=20]
;W[fj];B[ei]LB[ci:A]C[i'd rather play A. black can sacrifice his single stone (66)
- it no function anymore. and if white really starts to play
more moves to definitely capture 66, black can be happy, because
that would be really small.];W[fk];B[el];W[bn]TR[ck][cj]C[since black can capture the marked white stones if necessary,
this is not much of an attack. whit is playing end-game again
and so many big points on the right side of the board are waiting
to be played.];B[bm]C[same as white 83: small endgame instead of big and urgent moves
on the right.];W[ao];B[dm]LB[ci:B][ek:A]C[this is one of the smallest possible points. it doesn't even
make
two eyes (after white A black has only one eye). once again:
B would settle the black group.=20];W[qm]LB[kd:C][nl:B][lm:A]
TR[qr][pr][pq][nq][np][oo][no][nn][mn]C[finaly on the right side! but a little dangerous for white. the
marked group is not alive yet. creating another unsettled group
in this area maybe not the best idea. locally i' rather play
A or B. considering the whole board, a move around C seems most
important to me. white and black are ignoring the upper right
corner after 72!!];B[qn]LB[nr:B][ol:A]C[possible. but i'd try to settle my group and attacking the weak
white stones at the same time with a move like A.=20
if white answers on the right, his stones on the bottom are getting
weaker (if black gets to play B, white has only one eye). if
he answers on the left, his stones on the right are getting weaker.]
;W[le]C[there it is!! (15 moves to late, but since black hasn't played
there either - early enough). white is claiming a big area on
the upper side. but playing on the 5th line (instead of the 4th
line) leaves a little bad
aji (black can invade a little easier).];B[lg];W[li]C[i don't understand that one. what is the purpose of this move?
it doesn't really help the weak white stones on the lower right,
it doesn't defend the potential territory on the upper side an
it doesn't really attack a black group.];B[ll]LB[ol:B][nl:A]
C[attacking the weak white stones is good, but i'd play from the
other side. 92 is only threatening to connect to the handicap-stone
at tengen, but there is no big profit in the centre of the board.
not for black and not for white. A move like A or B would  have
the purpose to prepare a attack on the white stones on the right.]
;W[nl];B[im]C[not the biggest move on the board. i'd rather play on the right
or on the upper side.];W[kk]LB[je:B][qh:A]C[What is white doing? is he really going to capture that one =
handicap-stone?
that is small (the black stone has no function). and moves like
A or B are still waiting to be played.];B[qh]C[good!];W[nh]
;B[ng];W[mh];B[lf];W[ph];B[mk]C[white is almost connected. this move will not make much profit.
rather go for the right side and answer 101.];W[pg]C[yes.];B[qg]
C[white has now some chances for cutting (because black ignored
101).];W[oe];B[of];W[pe];B[qe];W[qd]
(;B[pc]C[this is one of the rare moments where extending after a cross-cut
may be not the best move. i don't know for sure, but i think
atari at san-san and the making a hanging connection (see variation)
would give black better chances to win the semeai. (but it
needs a stronger player than me to read out all variations :-)
but black definitely is in troubles now.];W[re];B[qf];W[qc]

this exchange 124 would make two eyes.];W[od]C[a big success for white! now he is leading approx. 20 points
and
black has a unsettled group!! this game is almost lost for black
after 125.];B[qj];W[pk];B[qk];W[jh]LB[id:A][ql:B]C[ok, white has a big lead, but 129 is awful small. compare it
to A or B.];B[ge]C[big.];W[hd];B[if]LB[rf:A][pi:B][ql:C]C[since this move is not really connecting the two black groups,
i'd rather play on the right to settle the black stones there
(A, B or C).];W[qi]C[ok, that will be sente for white, but it will force black to
settle his stones: aji-keshi. (but white can afford it.)];B[ri]
;W[pi];B[ql]C[necessary.=20];W[ml];B[lk];W[kl];B[km];W[he]LB[je:A]

this move will help making eyes.];W[ec]

is sente, see variation) or B.];W[gb];B[ef]LB[ed:A]C[Play the atari at A first!]

will answer at B, black plays C and white has no eyes on the
left side.];W[ii]LB[ci:A][hh:B]C[hmmm. brave. i would be to coward to do so! i'd rather play A
or at least B.];B[ih];W[hh];B[ke];W[kd];B[kh];W[ji]C[white must be careful.]

right
