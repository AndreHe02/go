C[Hello, I play black here. It was a pathetic game by me and I had to resign. I would like to know where exactly did I loos so much.

Hi,
I'am richard (rhi) and i hope the review will help you :)];B[pd]

C[rhi:
right time to invade W's moyo.
good move :)];W[nc];B[oc]LB[pf:A]C[rhi:
nope, bad move:
play contact for defensive moves.
Here, U will strenghten W's position (which was weak)

'A' was better move.];W[nd];B[ob]C[this is a yose move.
'A' is still better.];W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[qd];W[pf];B[qf];W[pg]
;B[qg];W[ph];B[qi]C[rhi:
good. That a nice sequence.
Good balance between 2 forces.];W[oj]LB[gd:A]C[rhi:
I don't like that W move.
He should have extended towards 'A'];B[cf]LB[cg:A]C[rhi:
yes ! good.
You don't play under W's sphere,
but still, you shrinken him while extending yourself.
Very good move.
U have a good sens of the game.
(Unless I wonder if 'A' isn't safer, considering W's big wall)]

oups ...

still to far.
'A' is better.];W[gi];B[hi]C[rhi:
:(
reading error.
U will be cut off];W[hh];B[hj];W[gg];B[bh];W[bi];B[bg];W[ci]
;B[bj];W[ai];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc]LB[hh:A]C[This move was the one that got me the whole group killed I think

rhi:
nope.
In fact, since U were cut off ('a' stone) U don't have enough space to live.]

rhi:
in fact, this group is already in a very bad position.
U can witness the very power of the initial W's wall
(triangle stones)

but, there is a weakness in white structure:
square point.
let's try it in a variation.];W[kg];B[kh];W[le];B[ql];W[ol]

ZeroCool [24k\]: thx
This is where I decided to resign the game.

rhi:
main lesson to remember:
beware walls :)
This is what makes white win the battles.

See you.
And feel free to post any other questions on the review.])

this is where it leads, but I'm not sure it is right.
However, it could have occured like that :)
There was at least one way]))
