;W[qr];B[qp];W[or];B[on];W[mp];B[pl];W[fq];B[fp];W[gp];B[gq]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[hq];B[gr];W[hr]C[NM: This sequence is not so far as I know regarded as joseki, but it seems playable to me: the overall effect is to leave W somewhat overconcentrated next to his strong N4 group. But now,

before going on, you should play G5. It's a kikashi which can only be played now.]
;B[dq];W[fr];B[er];W[gs];B[dj]C[NM: This is a good move to finish off the previous exchange, giving B a good claim (but not certainty) on some 30 points.]
;W[cd];B[ql]C[NM: I like this - it completely annihilates any remaining aji, and looks to building up the R side. However, it is a bit slow at this stage.]
;W[nc];B[cf]C[NM: This is not really consistent with your last move. I would have replied Q14.]
;W[ec];B[ef]C[NM: ... however, if you are going to play C14, this is a good follow-up.]
;W[qf]C[NM: To be expected.];B[oe]C[NM: OK.];W[rd];B[qh]C[this doesn't seem right to me any suggestions?



NM: It looks playable to me, but maybe better would be R17, followed by pincering the O17 stone somewhere round L17.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[jd];B[re]C[kind of a wasted move here if anything it hurts me i think



NM: Yes, you lose the endgame moves of R19 and S14.];W[qe];B[qd]
;W[rb];B[lc]C[i really don't like this move i was thinking maybe something around g17 would be better now what you think? but after the r15 exchange i felt like i had to settle myself



NM: H17 is also possible, but this looks fine to me.];W[md]
;B[mc]C[NM: I prefer M16, but this is also a matter of style.]
;W[nd];B[nb];W[ld];B[kc];W[jc];B[jb];W[ib];B[ka]C[NM: L18 is much better here, keeping sente.]
;W[kd];B[mb]C[ i didn't even really settle myself and white made thinkness which made it kind of hard for me to decide what i wanted to do when white c12



NM; The group is settled, but in gote. But you're right that W's thickness is relevant.]
;W[gn];B[fm];W[ch];B[dh]C[i spent a lot of time on this move i don't really think it was the best any ideas?



NM: With the open space below, I don't think you can kill the W stone. I think I would play C10, which may offer the chance to link up later, and accept a race out into the centre. You have some resources available, such as G17 and H18. Another possibility would be D13, which makes him find life on the side.]
;W[ci];B[cj];W[cg];B[bf]C[NM: I don't think it's realistic to try and cut him off - you have too many weaknesses.]
;W[di]
(;B[ej]C[NM: Now you really have to worry about your C14 stones. See the variation for a way to avoid this.]
;W[ei];B[gf];W[fj];B[fk];W[fi];B[bj];W[gk]C[NM: OK,  you can link now if you want at B11.]
;B[gl];W[de];B[df];W[fe];B[hb]C[NM: Frankly, I would link up first. Then you can fight much more securely.]
;W[ia];B[hc]C[NM: Surely J17 would be better? If W tries to fight it, he may lose the whole M16 group.]
;W[ic];B[ff];W[hd];B[ai]C[this was a big mistake i think cause i could have kept attacking whites f11 group now white can run away



NM: I disagree. It is clear W's group can run away easily, and if your D14 stones die you lose the game.]

;W[hj];B[ii];W[jj];B[ji];W[jl];B[if]C[kind of waste



NM: Yes, it's not the urgent area - I would play either J7 or N6. But if you're going to do it, you shold follow it up.]
;W[hf]
(;B[im];W[lj];B[og]C[NM:Seems unnecesary to me, and makes no points. J5 would be better.]
;W[pj];B[rf];W[rg];B[qg];W[sf];B[pf];W[se];B[qj];W[pi];B[qi]
;W[mg]C[NM: big, because now W can answer H15 with J15.];B[nq]
C[NM: Wouldn't it be better to play something like N5 first? Still, this works reasonably well.]
;W[op];B[kp];W[mq];B[jm];W[kq];B[ac];W[bc];B[ad];W[bb];B[ge]
;W[gd];B[he];W[ie];B[jf];W[jg];B[ki];W[kj];B[kf]C[NM: These 3 stones aren't going anywhere.]
;W[kg];B[li];W[lg];B[mi]C[hane at n10 instead?



NM: Similar.];W[mj]C[NM: If you play at M7 now, it looks difficult for W to make 2 eyes for this group.]
;B[ni];W[nj];B[mn];W[km];B[kn];W[lm];B[ln];W[il];B[hm]C[NM: YOu must play G9 first]
;W[hk];B[mm];W[ml];B[nl];W[ll];B[nk];W[oi];B[jp];W[jq];B[nh]
;W[eh];B[fg]C[my last two moves don't seem that great i don't know why i was so worried
