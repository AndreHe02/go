AB[dd][pd][dp]C[{I played white; giving 3 stones and -5.0 komi to black}

I think my main problem was with my opening on this game.  I feel I relied too much on building center influence and not enough on securing territory.  Any advice on 3 stone strategies would be very helpful.  Please comment on any other areas of my game you feel are weak too.

Thank you for your time.

I'm not much stronger than yourself. Take what I say with a grain of salt, and forgive me if my review is not very extensive (I don't want to say anything that might be flat wrong).]

Jumping into the corner instead of e14 would have been fine if you don't like this. Still, from here you might be able to play e7 in sente and still invade at c3, which would be a good result. It's something to aim at, at least.

Also, note that generally in this joseki, Black can cut off c14 starting with Black e13. White gets some more thickness facing the centre, of course.

I see high dans and pros playing this joseki in handicap games, but personally, I wouldn't do it - giving away all that territory on the side for central influence is a strategy that is very hard to follow up. Of course, it might also be that the pros and high dans just know *when* to do it, and so they can pull it off.

If you don't like c17 after Black c12, it is also joseki to play d12.]
;W[cp]C[Both c3 and c5 look reasonable here. Perhaps you are trying to create complications. That is okay, I suppose. Let's see how it goes.]
;B[cq]C[Of course you must consider c5. Let's see where that would go...]

[co:34][do:32][cq:28][bq:30]C[I'm not sure about these nine moves.  Didn't seem to achieve much.

--

No, it did achieve something. g3 is cut off, and you have long term potential for surrounding the centre, with White stones on the left side, the bottom (just played), and the bottom right all facing that way.]
;B[fq];W[eq];B[jq]
(;W[ip]MA[jo]C[k5 might have been better?

--

Both are good, as far as I can tell. This leaves an interesting weakness at h2. But k5 would have given you good potential for surrounding the centre. If you were going to do that, though, you would want to try to close off the left side in sente first - perhaps d8.]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[kq];W[kp];B[lr];W[mq];B[mr];W[nr];B[jj];W[nd]
C[You should have played d8 by now. It strengthens your floating group on the left (which can otherwise be cut off starting with Black d8 - a very good move locally). It helps to cut off k10, which should be your focus, stragecially, at this point. And of course, it is sente because if Black ignores it you can cut at c9.]
;B[pf]C[I was expecting / dreading M17.  This turned out nice for me.

--

I would think after Black m17, White n15 puts pressure on both sides, and Black can only defend one.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[qb];W[kc]C[Didn't feel safe playing k17, so played it safe.

--

It's a two stone handicap game. You can't afford to be timid. Besides - the two Black stones in the top left are not secure yet. Black can only cut off c4 if you don't want to let d12 etc. into the centre, but otherwise you can keep them connected, and keep d16 and d12 separated.

L17 gives Black a good move in j17. You should have played k17.]
;B[lj]C[As Black, I'd prefer j17, because it makes territory, protects the weak stones in the top left, and indirectly helps k10.]
;W[qg]C[looking back c17 probably would have been better here.  Not really sure...

--

Your move is bad shape. Black is quite strong, and you just played your move in such a way that Black already has a shoulder-hit move played against you. It's the single-digit-kyu equivalent of not seeing a ladder :)

Now I think black should play r14, which would make himeself strong and also still leave room for moving into the centre from q14 (to help m10, etc.)

I'd prefer h17 for White, by the way.];B[pg];W[qi]C[This is good - kind of light play.]
;B[ph];W[qh]C[This is not so light. s14 or s10 might have been better.]
;B[cd]C[This is a really slow, heavy, way to play. Wouldn't j17 have been good? Still, this move does mean Black can connect underneath starting with d14.]
;W[re];B[qe];W[rd];B[qd]C[Good sequence for White, these last two moves.]

(;W[dg]C[I've put in a variation where White plays h17];B[ic]
C[Black 68 seemed to gain more than White 67.  Maybe should have H17.

--

Absolutely. You saved one stone with d13, and still didn't make these stones so secure. And you certainly didn't put any pressure on any of Black's stones. But Black certainly did with j17.]
;W[ke];B[ie];W[ig]C[You should be aiming at splitting Black's middle stones from his top left stones. They are the only weak groups now. Your move cuts off Black's middle stones from his top left, but the top left is already alive, so now the middle stones can join up with the top right stones.

How about o11 instead? And you've still got j13 for later, if you need it.]
;B[mh]
(;W[hj]MA[li]C[I should have made him fight with White M11.

You'de be a move too late :) But yes, you probably should have tried to cut Black apart somehow. A purely territorial move at this stage of the game is not the way to win.]

You didn't lose by much.

I don't have much general advice. You need to be a bit more willing to fight, especially in a handicap game. In the opening, focus on trying to keep sente, and try to make your stones work well together across the board (f3 instead of p7 at move 13, for example).

Let me know if you have any questions, or need any clarification.]
