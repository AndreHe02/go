C[This is a game with a very interesting opening position, with Black resisting White's
joseki plans. White makes an unreasonable move and Black gets several chances to
severely punish White - unfortunately Black gets tricked instead.
The middle game is comparatively uneventful. Black makes a few endgame mistakes,
however White is the last person to make a mistake and loses the game by misjudging
a Ko.

I have added several variations in the opening to show how Black can resist White more
strongly.

(;B[rm]C[Good! Black resists White's plans.. In the next 30 moves, Black gets tricked. However, there were several chances for Black to resist. I have included a few ideas that Black can try in the variations.

For reference, I've included the normal joseki, which I am sure Black was aware of though.]

to play there later, giving Black a very bad result];W[sl];B[sk]
;W[sj];B[no];W[mn]C[White takes the key point. Now white is poking his nose into what could have been a black moyo and has taken all the profit. Furthermore, black has a weak group on the board..
