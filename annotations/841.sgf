C[In this game black plays some good fighting moves and has a good
opening fuseki. Black needs to look at his groups in terms of
life and death and be willing to give them up when they are dead
and to develop security in his knowledge that a group will live
no matter how many stones white decides to give you!!

I enjoyed reviewing your game and hope my comments are helpful


Robin];B[pd];W[cp];B[dd];W[qp];B[jd];W[cf];B[pj]C[perhaps this should have been at r10?

No this is fine it is a good response to c14 and is consistent
with your opening of building a large framework];W[qf]C[My preference would be as follows]

(;B[pf]C[preferred this to o16];W[pg]
(;B[qg]C[wanted to cut in order to make white's life as difficult as poss

I think this makes it too complicated. You should just follow
the joseki and build on it. A cross cut normally results in solidifying
territory on both sides and you don't want that to happen now]
;W[gd]
(;B[fc]C[Maybe variation is better as it keeps your shape good]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[mc]C[I like p17 defensive and attacking];B[oc]
;W[of];B[pe];W[pi]
(;B[qi]C[don't think I had any choice here??];W[qj];B[rj]C[better than r9?]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[ql];B[rl]C[should I have left this area and played elsewhere?

Yup see variation porblem is white builds lots of thickness]
;W[me];B[gf]TR[eq][op][oj][ef]C[This too loose .. doesnt look like it is going anywhere .. I
have marked some possible other moves];W[eq];B[ck]C[seemed like a good time to invade

I agree need to do it now and this looks like a great place]

;W[ce];B[cd];W[ei]
(;B[fg]TR[gd]C[wanted to give this group some eyespace

This is a good move not for the eye space but because you isolate
the marked stone];W[bd];B[bc];W[be]
(;B[cc];W[oj]
(;B[og]C[wanted to somehow use the aji that I thought I could see in this
area

I don't think you can use the aji that way];W[kp];B[pk]C[in hindsight it really feels like I should have played elsewhere!]

(;W[qm]C[I suppose W (MFGO2) played this because if it played q8 or p9
etc then B would play here?

MF makes big mistake];B[oi]C[nice to catch these stones];W[rm]
;B[nf];W[rg]C[seemed a good idea to attack these white stones]
;W[nj];B[ni]C[wanted the upper right quadrant to be B so obviously needed to
block here?];W[fh]TR[kq][ln][eo][bp][bk][ck][cn]C[Black needs to invade white somehow .. but it looks difficult
to do

I have marked possible places but first of all black must protect
marked group]
(;B[mi];W[en]
(;B[dm]C[didn't know best move to play lightly/make good shape

See variation for better response .. playing lightly wont help
as black has no where to go!!];W[ak];B[al];W[bo];B[bn];W[ek]
;B[em]C[thought if I played d8 W would play e7 and seal me in]
;W[fm]
(;B[el]C[E8 .. empty triangle .. not a good idea];W[cl]C[this was a nasty surprise...even though this B group's shape
didn't feel good all along]
(;B[aj]C[This will not help black .. cannot get eye here];W[an]
;B[bi];W[cj];B[bh];W[ch];B[bg];W[dk];B[bf]C[pitifully misguided attempt to get eyespace for this group...]
;W[fl]C[A good strategy is having realised that a group is dead you play
outside making white have to play to stop you rescuing the group
.. you then get thickness outside .. however because of how well
sealed in blcak is + how strong white is it is better to wait
and see if womething evolves later on that you can do like this]
;B[cm]C[oh dear, getting rid of my own eyespace! Should I have abandoned
this group instead or was there some way to make life??---b8
perhaps???

I dont see anyway it can live];W[bl]C[Now as group is dead don't respond .. this is a mistake by white]

(;B[ak];W[ai]C[didn't anticipate this obviously...];B[ah];W[am]
;B[ai];W[af]
(;B[jg]C[thought that after the left side mishap I needed to make as much
territory as poss in the upper right quadrant

I think invasion is best now];W[nl];B[pl]C[didn't want W to seal me out of the lower right by playing at
q9 himself];W[om];B[pm];W[pn];B[mj]C[seemed important to block W and not allow him to play here]
;W[ol];B[oh];W[dn];B[ll]C[again, wanted to eat into what looked like becoming a huge lower
side area for W];W[mk];B[lk];W[ok]C[You might even let white take those stones]

(;B[pi];W[on];B[ml]C[how to explain this move?---I suppose I wanted to make the W
eye false for some reason and thought this move would also somehow
be good for further eating into of the lower side...];W[nk]
;B[rn]TR[ld][lp]C[thought I was being clever here...

Its an endgame move but there are bigger moves around];W[qn]
;B[sm];W[ro];B[kn];W[np];B[hh]C[this looked like it helped me define my upper side territory]
;W[ip];B[hi];W[ke];B[je];W[jb]C[didn't like the look of this...I'd thought all these W stones
were definitely dead...on reflection I'm sure a skilled human
or a stronger program could have made these stones more effective]
;B[kc];W[kb];B[lc];W[ic];B[hb]C[Good move .. makes white heavy]
;W[lb];B[nb]C[is there some mischief W can do by invading at r17??]
;W[md]C[Don't need to play here anymore];B[mb]C[seemed a good idea to cut!]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[fd];B[ed];W[hd];B[ib]C[not necessary];W[jc];B[kd]
;W[le];B[mf];W[jk]C[this seemed like a painfully good move from W!]

move?];W[kg];B[lg];W[hk];B[jj];W[ik];B[gb]C[Not necessary];W[in]
