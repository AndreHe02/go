C[Hi.  Thanks for looking at my game.  I played white.

** Let me say that I will attempt to give you some advice, but i still make quite a few mistakes.  I will try to give you sound advice.  The variations that I include might not be the best alternatives, but they are some possibilities that occured to me.  Needless to say, the feasibility of some variations depends on your opponent's response.    Please feel free to email me with any questions.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dq]C[My opponent chose the two 4-4 points for openings.  I see a lot of players use 3-4 points also.  I chose R4 and D3 for this game.  With the choices of C4, D3, D4 in one corner, and Q3, Q4, and R4 in the other, there are actually 9 possible openings.  Are some combinations bad?  Are others better?

** As to which combinations are better or worse, a lot has to do with player preference.  Two opposing 3-4 points are a very common opening.  If you are interested in different types of openings and opening strategies, you might want to purchase a book about openings.  You can email me for suggestions if you like.]
;B[op]C[My opponent approaches.  I want to use the pincer . . .]
;W[mp]C[** This is fine, though the one space pincer against a high stone is more often played on the third line at N3.  However, N4 is another variation on the one-space pincer.  I am less familiar with this pincer.]
;B[on]C[As I expected, he runs out . . .];W[mn]C[I pursue on the left side of him, building a wall.  But now R4 looks lonely.

** You are correct.  In general, it is best to follow with R6 to do two things.  First, build a base for the R4 stone and second, to pursue the running black group.  N6 is begging black to attack the R4 stone and there is not much room to make life for R4.  In some games, I have seen skilled players sacrifice corners to build large outward facing walls, but they plan on doing that for a specific reason.  In this case, N6 will either result in R4 being killed, or making very tiny life.  Without question, the group you pincered has a lot more breathing room now than it would with R6.]
;B[qn]C[When he turns like that, R4 seems trapped.  Was the pincer a bad idea, then?  or should move number 8 for white have been at R6 instead of N6?]

(;W[pq]C[I wish to cross under.  would p3 have been better than q3?  is there an even better move?

** Q3 can let you live, but there are other possibilities.  See the variations.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[pr]C[Crossing under didn't work.  I guess I should have known that right from the start.  Now I have to make life in the corner.]
;B[mq];W[rr]C[Looking back, I think s2 was a wasted move.  Now black has sente . . .

** At first I thought that S2 was a wasted move also, but now that I look at it, I think without S2, the black invasion at S3 is very dangerous.  At any rate, it would be a very interesting life and death problem.  Given the fact that you have a lot invested in this corner, I think defending was probably a sound move.]
;B[lp]C[Agghhh!  So much for having a wall.];W[mo]C[I should have played elsewhere, taking back sente.  What do you think?  If I did, these seem like my best choices: take a side point, approach one of black's top corners, or reinforce at C5.  C5 is gote.  For that matter, so is a side point.

** N5 keeps some pressure on black, but you might gain more by playing elsewhere and if black insists on killing N4, you get two moves for the price of a dead stone.  I have had some players insist on continuing with a fight I gave up long ago and let me get three or four very big points while they killed a couple of stones and secured five or ten points in one place.  Watch for this type of misake.]
;B[hq]C[** this is a huge play for black.  You can still invade at K3 with the support of the three stones at N5 so if I was black, I should make the extension one space smaller at J3.]
;W[fq]C[I made a base, but way too small, I think.  Maybe C6 would have been better?

** Either C6 or D5.  Comapred to C6 and D5, F3 looks very small.  However, F3 would make an invasion at K3 very dangerous for black.]
;B[pi]C[** another very large point for black.  In retrospect, N5 was very small compared to H3 and Q11]
;W[co]C[Well, I guess this move was redundant.  I don't know why I didn't try to get some more territory.  Where it stands now, it looks like the opponent has way more than me.

** This is very over concentrated and highlights the fat that F3 was a bad play.  If black plays K16 next, the game will practically be over.]
;B[jd]C[** Sorry, I write my comments before I look at the next play.]
;W[dj]C[** good, but it still looks small in comparison to black's moyo.]
;B[kp]C[** Since black is so far ahead at this point, L4 is a nice play since it protects against the invasion at K3.]
;W[fc]C[** I would have a tendency to play C14 and then invade the top.  C14 would let you make territory along the left even though it makes black stronger on the top.  You also have a lot of room to invade on the right side and the 3-3 invasion at R17.  However, playing F17 pushes black into the moyo that you started to build on the left side.]
;B[hc];W[fe]C[** Given the situation on the board, I would have a tendency to go for a corner invasion in response to this pincer.  It will give black a wall, but gives you some territory in return.  This move just gives territory to black.]

(;B[df];W[fg];B[ch]C[The opponent is making nice territory in the corner while I chase him and gain nothing.  I wanted to invade, but I didn't quite know how.

** You could still invade at 3-3, but that makes things very difficult for the F15 group.  Again, I think the approach was from the wrong side.]
;W[cj]C[**  This is not tiny, but since you are so far behind, you should be a little more aggressive.  At least play D18 to take some of the corner territory.  Or, invade the top right and press the K16 and H17 stones against the wall.  Not matter what, you will have some tough fights if you want to reduce black's moyo.]
;B[ig]C[** Another large play for black that threatens the F15 group, builds a larger moyo, and makes K16/H17 stronger.]

(;W[ei]C[** This is overconcentrated again, but white is in a difficult position.  See the variation.]
;B[ee]C[**This is a trick move.  you have to do something to connect those stones.  G14 is a nice move to protect against the cut.  See variation.]

(;W[db];B[ff];W[gf];B[fd]C[I see what he did.  he split me all up.]
;W[ef];B[gd];W[ec];B[cc];W[cb];B[bb];W[dg];B[cg];W[dc];B[bd]
;W[gb];B[hb];W[ga];B[ea]C[I guess black knew what he was doing.

** instead of G19, you should have played F19.  However, black C19 would still kill (worth a shot in case black doesn't see that).  You had a very small space to make life.  I don't really see any way to do it. Unless you gave up the connection when black played F14 and started making life then.  See variation.]
;W[fa]
(;B[eb];W[ed];B[de];W[ca]C[** Black can ignore this play.];B[ba]
;W[gc]C[I don't know why I kept throwing more stones into that area.  I saw that it was dead several moves earlier.  I guess I was just hoping I could cheat death.]
;B[ge];W[hd];B[ff];W[ic]C[now I'm thinking that if i can win this ko fight, i can save my top group.]
;B[ib];W[fe];B[he];W[id];B[ie]C[but now I have 2 groups in atari]
;W[jc]C[so I try to save one];B[kc]C[But my opponent shoes me that it is hopeless.

** yes.];W[qc]C[Black is clearly winning.  I want anything at this point.  I know how to invade at the 3-3 point, but I also know it gives Black outward-facing influence.  Still, I don't know what else to do.

** very difficult to say at this point in the game.  Black is so far ahead that the only way to win is to kill some of black's groups.  However, black is very strong most everywhere.  Bottom right can still be invaded, there is a lot of aji in the dead white stones at the top that white could use to reduce black's territory.  I think you have to invade the 3-3 to get some territory and maybe invade on the right side after the 3-3.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[mc];B[lb];W[lc]
C[Maybe O16 instead of 82.  Then I could play N15 or L16 and try to come out of there.  But I think Black would still have been able to kill those stones.

** see variation];B[md]
(;W[ld];B[le];W[rd];B[re];W[qe];B[rc];W[od]C[** Excellent use of the aji.  Looks like the N17 stones were useful after all.  very nice way to play.]
;B[kd];W[pe]C[Well, it wasn't all a loss.];B[ff]C[** This seems to be a wasted move on black's part.  For black, R13, O8 or L6 are much bigger plays.]
;W[qh]C[** good.];B[qi];W[rh];B[ri];W[ph];B[oh];W[og];B[ng]
;W[nh]C[** P11 seems potentially more promising.];B[oi];W[nf]
;B[mg];W[mi];B[pg];W[qg];B[of];W[pf];B[eg]C[Ouch.  I guess I let myself get distracted from that area.

** that is pretty small.];W[og]C[looks like another ko fight.]
;B[cm];W[dm]C[An invasion.  I know I am strong in that area.  I think I should be able to kill.  But how?  I think I will start by taking away one of black's liberties immediately.

** it might be better to press Black against you wall by playing D6 instead.  I think black would have a hard time living or escaping.]
;B[dl];W[cl]C[I cross cut.  2 liberties gone now.];B[el];W[em]
C[black is running, i pursue.];B[gp]C[is he trying to reduce?  or save his other stones at E8?

** reduce probably.];W[fl];B[fp];W[ep];B[fm];W[ek];B[en]C[he has reduced a large chunk of my potential territory.]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[gm];B[fn];W[gk];B[pg]C[eh?  we're back over here again.

** all things considered, I think you played well in the center.  He reduced a little bit, but you are in the center with G6  You could begin trying to build center territory with something like J6 while reducing his lower territory.]
;W[po]C[my ko threat.];B[pn];W[og];B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[mf]C[I'm thinking that if I'm going to win this ko, it would be better for me if the win had more impact.  So 138 is with the intention of killing N13, O13

** good.  it also reduce some more of black's territory.];B[pg]
;W[oo];B[no]C[** if I was black, i would have ignored this.  A better Ko threat would have been K18.  remember, when making Ko threats, the threats have to be larger than the Ko.  what would black lose if you played O5?  What would you gain?  The only thing this does is put a bit of pressure on N5 group.  However, that group has quite a bit of room to fight for life.  Black would have a very hard time killing N6.  Finally, White can play O4 anyway to connect the groups.]
;W[np]C[** :-)];B[nn];W[nq]C[These last few moves were meant as ko threats, but I never really expected to be able to connect my two groups.  Maybe the tide can turn now . . .]
;B[mr];W[lq]C[so I'm trying to kill the 3 stones on the bottom.  idiotic.]
;B[lr];W[og];B[sg];W[sh];B[pg];W[jb]C[Bad ko threat - I'm going to lose those stones anyway.  Why increase the loss?

** WRONG.  good ko threat because black HAS to respond.  If you can find ko threats that do not involve losing stones, that is great.  Otherwise, adding one stone to your loss on the top right is nothing compared to what you might gain from the Ko fight.]
;B[ja];W[og];B[pb];W[qb];B[pg];W[nd];B[mc];W[og];B[na];W[pa]
;B[pg];W[kq]C[I did the same thing here.  Adding stones to what's already dead.  I mean it works as a ko threat, but the ko has to be really worth it to justify moves like this.  Or so I'm thinking.  Any thoughts you might have?

** Again, when playing a Ko, think about what you will gain from winning the Ko versus what you lose with the Ko threat.]
;B[jq];W[og];B[lf];W[lg]C[I HAVE to win this ko.  he he.

** good response];B[pg];W[ha];B[kb];W[og];B[qo];W[pp];B[pg]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[og];B[er]C[his move here didn't seem too threatening.  I realise he can com into my corner, but i want to get this ko fight over with and start growing towards the center . . .]
;W[mh];B[eq]C[i didn't expect E3.  I thought he would play C2.]
;W[dr];B[dp];W[cp]C[** good way of limiting your losses];B[eo]
;W[do];B[ep];W[nk]C[Now I want to use the big corner group that i fought so hard for to try to kill the 5 stone black group on the side.  or the 6 stone group just below.  or both, by splitting them down the middle.]
;B[ol];W[ok];B[pk];W[pl];B[ql];W[pj];B[pm];W[qj];B[rj];W[qk]
;B[rk];W[pl];B[rp];W[oj];B[rq];W[rl]C[I'm ignoring the threats to my corner.  Maybe that's a bad idea.  But i want to kill another group of black stones on the side so i play S8

** S8 alone will not kill the S10 group.  You shouldn't ignore S4.  White S3 is worth about 6 points and like I said, S8 will not kill.]
;B[qm];W[rm];B[sl];W[sk];B[rn];W[sm];B[sn];W[sj];B[sl]C[it looks like I didn't succeed.  :(]
;W[si];B[qr]C[and now black took my whole corner.

** R3 saves some of it.];W[nl];B[om];W[jm]C[I thought I would try to get some territory in the middle.  I'm not too sure how, though . . .

That is a little high.  You have enormous strength in the middle, USE IT.  for example, H6, J6, or K6 (maybe, I haven't worked it out).  However, you should go one line deeper.  The corner hit at k5 would also be nice followed by L5.]
;B[fh]C[Oops.  Maybe i should have tied up a few loose ends before worrying about the middle.]
;W[ii];B[in];W[im];B[jn];W[ko];B[jo];W[lo];B[kn];W[jp]C[Was this a mistake on black's part?  or did he have a better view of the bigger picture?]
;B[ip];W[js];B[is];W[ks];B[rs];W[ir];B[iq];W[hs]C[what is black doing?  are these mistakes, or am i missing something?

** they look like pretty big mistakes to me.];B[hr];W[gs]C[maybe i should have connected at J1 instead.]
;B[fr];W[jg];B[jf];W[kg];B[is];W[ih];B[gr]C[** another mistake.  Black should play J2.  there is no way for those two stones to live.]
;W[ir];B[hj];W[hg];B[if];W[gh];B[gg];W[ni]C[i haven't got the faintest idea why i did that.  maybe i just noticed a way to put him in atari, and i did it.]
;B[rl];W[fg]C[Ah.  I remember why I did O11.  It was a ko threat.  Well, it worked.]
;B[lm];W[fi];B[gg];W[ho];B[hn];W[fg];B[is];W[eh]C[i took back some of what I lost earlier in the game.  (I don't know why I didn't answer move number 255 - M7.  It seems to me that this was a big move for black.)]

;B[me];W[ne];B[pk];W[hf];B[pl];W[ia];B[tt];W[qq];B[sr]C[Black won by 1.5.

** overall evaluation.    1) black almost lost because of costly mistakes in the lower center and top right.    2)  White did a nice job of reducing right side territory even though White lost part of the corner.   3) White almost won because of black mistakes and building some nice territory in the center.  In addition, White reduced black's bottom right and lower center territory.

What White can learn from this game.

1) keep in mind that ko threats should be weighed against what you will get by winning the Ko.  If opponent makes a small threat during a ko that is very large.  ignore it.  However, when making ko threats, be sure to make ones that are large enough that opponent cannot ignore.    2) Always keep the whole board in mind while playing.  If the loss of one stone will give you the opportunity to play a big point somewhere else, give it up.  Sometimes it might even be worthwhile to sacrifice a small group if you gain something large elsewhere on the board.    3) if you have strength to back up an invasion or reduction, don't be afraid to use it.  However, make sure that you don't invade or reduce too deep unless you can live if your opponent cuts you off.

4) if your opponent has CLEARLY cut you or killed you, take the sente and use it to do damage somewhere else.  for example, when black cut you apart in the top early in the game, let the cut go since there was no way to connect and make life for the top group.     Let me say again that even though you lost the game, you should be happy that you came back from a huge imbalance early in the game to make it a very close game in the end.  If komi was 5.5, you would have won.  Nice job.]

It is always a tradeoff.  You might do better by not playing N17 at all and then trying to reduce the territory.  However, no matter where you play, black is likely to strengthen by attacking you.]
