C[Review by shadow (IGS 2k*) for White
I use white.];B[pd]LB[kd:a][pi:b]C[shadow: influence areas are near "a" and "b"]
;W[dc]LB[di:a]C[shadow: influence over "a"];B[pp]LB[pk:a][kp:b]
C[shadow: influences areas "a" and "b", notice how the nirensei covers the area "a" twice?]
;W[dq]LB[dk:a]C[shadow: influences area "a" which overlaps the first point.  An opening like this indicates whites gonna fight and try to overcome blacks apparent moyo game.]

(;B[de]C[shadow: black jumped right into whites biggest area of influence.  The proper direction of play screams for a pincer here.  If you ignore the proper direction of play, you will be helping black build a moyo, in effect you help black play his game and ignore your own.]

(;W[ce];B[dd]C[shadow: excellent for black];W[cd];B[ec];W[cc]
;B[df]LB[jc:a]C[shadow: blacks wall influences the area around "a" overlapping his black stones influence in the top right.  All of blacks stones are working together.]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc]
(;W[nc]C[shadow: wrong side I think.  there are 8 lines between blacks left (6 high wall)  and right side (4-4 stone), and Black is open at the bottom.  On the right side we see 11 lines between two 4-4 stones.   Wider is bigger, so the right side is best]
;B[kd];W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[shadow: this is a mistake in direction.  Q17 is correct]
;W[pc];B[od]
(;W[nd]C[shadow: this is an overplay.  White just needs to play O18 and settle himself.  Black built a wall facing the left side and you get to move there before he can.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[pb];W[qb];B[nb];W[pa];B[ne];W[me];B[md];W[mc]
;B[mb];W[lc];B[ld];W[kb];B[nf]C[shadow: much better for black.  Tremendous thickness in the center and no flaws in the wall.  This is a huge moyo!]
;W[qn]C[Which way is better, R6 or O3?
How about D5 protecting the corner?

shadow: from the point of view of which is bigger, you got the correct side.   But maybe R9 would have been best leaving the extension to R6 or R12 miai.  this makes the pincer too nice!]
;B[pk]C[shadow: excellent play by black.]
(;W[qq]C[Is a one-space jump at P6 better?

shadow: yes, the corner is small compared to the area he's building in the top left.  R6 can escape to the middle and since Q9 is high, you can live underneath it, and the corner is still open if you want to give up on R6.]

(;B[np]C[shadow: pushing one more is usually bad here.];W[mq]
;B[lo]
(;W[qi]C[Is the invasion too deep?
Where is the best position?
How about big points at C5 or C9?

shadow: it has to be this deep.  if you invade any higher, then it's not an invasion its a reduction.  And a reduction is not enough to get you back into this game.

shadow: If the open territory is greater than 21 then you can usually invade it.  If there is an escape route as well, then just take the most open area like you did.  However you can't escape to the middle safely so this is wrong here.  When you can not escape you must play in the middle by attacking to a  strong stone.  Q9 is the stone you must attach to first.

shadow: C9 is not big, c5 is an ordinary corner enclosure which is too slow.  A c5 enclosure changes the direction of influence of the D3 stone towards the bottom.  However the bottom is uninteresting for developement as your stones are low.  at this point C5 is just taking territory.  And if you start trading taking big spots with black, he wins.]
;B[qj];W[rj]C[Would you please show some variations of  this fight?

shadow: this is a good start.  Play lightly and get as many forcing moves in as you can!]
;B[rk];W[pj];B[qk];W[pf]C[shadow: good forcing moves so far]
;B[of]
(;W[og]C[shadow: this is not forcing, this looks like it's trying to escape.]
;B[ng]C[shadow: black lets you get away with it.  He's not using his thickness properly]
;W[oh];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[rh];B[sj];W[si];B[sk]C[shadow: capture first at least. You can always connect after the first ko threat.]

;B[do];W[gp]C[Is this a good move?
How about C5 to take the corner?

shadow: black center is huge getting into the center is a must]
;B[cq]C[shadow: let the corner go and get into the middle!]
;W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[ck]C[shadow: black should play something near F6 to solifidy his middle moyo]
;W[cg]C[shadow: black was already open at the bottom, just jump up into the middle to destroy]
;B[dg];W[ch];B[ei]C[shadow: white got an additional 4 points and black made his middle even bigger.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dn];B[cn];W[dl];B[dk]C[shadow: this is a mistake by black, he's pushing white into the area that he wants to be black territory.]
;W[fm];B[fo]C[shadow: wrong direction by black.  attacking from the middle making it territory is probably best]
;W[gn];B[go];W[gk]C[shadow: maybe you can destroy the middle after all.  If you get away with this, it's huge!]
;B[hp]C[shadow: wrong direction of play  Black must attack from the left center side and force white to live small in the middle. black takes territory in the middle while attacking and save the reducing of white till last.]
;W[gq]C[shadow: white is alive on the side here.  white can play B3 or B2 for life are extend along the bottom for two eyes.  G3 defends 3 points on the side.  White should destroy the middle as best he can.]
;B[hq];W[gr];B[br];W[bs];B[id]C[shadow: black played wrong again here, it should be around J9 to seal off the center.]
;W[ib]C[shadow: there is nothing to defend here, white just expanded his territory by 1 or 2 points on the side.]
;B[lq];W[ek];B[ej];W[fj];B[hn];W[hm];B[in];W[jl]C[shadow: taking bigger points into the middle would also get you alive and destory black faster.  These were slow moves, but thankfully black played slow as well.]
;B[km]
(;W[kl]C[shadow: contact moves strengthen the opponent.  You contact stong stong because you don't mind making them stronger in exchange for you to gain strength.  white doesn't need any strength here just jump into the middle from a live group.  threaten to escape with the white group as well.]

On the left side we are talking about  13 lines wide, and on the right only 11 lines wide.  The top and bottom are also 11 lines wide but between a 4th line stone and a 3rd line stone.  Playing high takes into account blacks moyo aims, and playing in the middle eliminates whites ability to pincer.  left or right is miai for black now.  white should probably play "a" next]
