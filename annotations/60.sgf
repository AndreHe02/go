;W[gc]C[I don't know the joseki for this.

schorsch: better to look it up then (after the game!)
Your response is actually following one possible joseki, but then
w normally plays the hane from the inside. In the end, w would
get the top, and b the left side.

But pincers like G17 generally lead to complicated play and it is
hard to remember all the variations. At your strength, you may
just want to avoid the most obvious mistakes, since your opponent
usually doesn't know the "correct" solution either.];B[cc];W[bc]
;B[dc];W[be];B[gd];W[hd];B[fc]C[schorsch:
This move by b is a little defensive. G15 would have much
more effect. You don't need to worry about living in the
corner when you can walk to the center. Remember that
the w position at top center is also everything but strong!]
;W[hc];B[oc]C[I think maybe L16 or around it is better?

schorsch:
If you want to take the basis of the w stones, then you probably
rather play L17 or even M17. Note that especially M17 would be an
optimal combination with the stone you actually played!
If we assume that w plays a quiet move to connect H16 to the center,
then you could still play P17 and have the best of both worlds.

However, since you didn't play G15 a few moves before, w can now
play an atari there, and you really should care for your top left group,
so that it doesn't get sealed in. It's not obvious if you could get out of
this struggle with sente and with enough time to play again on the right.]
;W[lc];B[qc];W[rc];B[pd];W[qe];B[qb];W[pg];B[cf]C[schorsch:
As you will notice, this move is disconnected from your group.
If you play D14, then w can't seperate your stones, and the following
fight is much better for you.

This seems to be the topic of this game:
Don't attack with moves that get easily disconnected from your
remaining groups. If you can force w to crawl on the third line,
and build a wall towards the center at the same time, then that
is good enough for you. The w stones can't get killed anyway,
since they can either live in the corner, or extend downwards.]
;W[de];B[ef];W[df];B[dg];W[cg];B[ee];W[dh];B[jc]C[schorsch:
Now that we have to relatively weak b groups at the top, why
add another one?

The w stone at M17 has optimal distance from his friends, so
you normally won't be able to seperate them. Optimal distance
is calculated as follows: If you have a wall like H16/H17, then
count the hight of this wall (here 2) plus one, and you get the
gap that you can safely put between the wall and your next stone.
If there was another stone at H15, then M17 would go to N17.
If you have a "one stone wall", then you get the basic position
of two stones with two points distance.

All of those positions are considered stable and connected,
so you want to think very carefully before trying to disconnect
them.

But maybe the top isn't the most urgent place to play right
now anyway? What about R7, C7 or K4 ?];W[kd];B[id];W[ie];B[he]
;W[ic];B[jd];W[je];B[jb];W[ib];B[gb];W[ge]C[schorsch:
It's surprising, how often this missing b stone at G15 can
cause even more trouble!];B[hf];W[fd];B[gf];W[kb];B[fe];W[ja]
;B[rb]C[schorsch:
White says thanks for a move that can be easily ignored...]
;W[qk];B[jq];W[jo];B[mq];W[iq];B[fq]C[schorsch:
Extending the attacked stone to K4 would strenghten the b right
side significantly, while probably forcing w to answer.
After this, the left corner may want an extension along the outer side.
Since you want to make territory, it is more interesting to walk
where there is still more room to grow.];W[jp];B[kq]C[schorsch:
After not defending K3 once, doing so now makes little sense.
Wouldn't something like C7 or even C8 be much bigger?
If b doesn't play in that area now, w will do so!];W[cn];B[dk]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[bq];B[br];W[cp];B[dq];W[do];B[eo];W[ho]C[schorsch:
Why doesn't w continue with E6?
This would soon cause problems for the b stone at D9.
securing J3 doesn't look very urgent in comparison.];B[em];W[bk]

;B[cj];W[bh];B[qn];W[on]C[schorsch:
W didn't realize that R3 is still possible. This invasion would
take almost all b territory in the corner away.
On the other hand, connecting the bottom center w group
also isn't a bad idea. The next move by b at Q7 may be on
the wrong side under this aspect. It could be interesting to
consider M5 or even M6 instead.];B[pm];W[op];B[oq];W[np];B[nq]
;W[po];B[qo];W[mp];B[lp];W[lo];B[qi]C[I try to cut again , but It seems fail?

schorsch:
That shouldn't surprise you! :)
The problem is that you don't only seperate R11 from his friends,
but you own stone is pretty lonely as well there. Did you expect that
stone to live in there? Did you plan to connect it to some other group?
Which one? W can just walk out with his stone, which leaves you with
a very hard fight.];W[pj];B[pi];W[oi];B[oh];W[ph];B[rk];W[qj]

schorsch:
You need to consider that your opponent also tries to win the game...  This move is an "obvious" overplay. Well, it's obvious to me, and
will hopefully be obvious to you as well within short time.

For this kind of problem it may help to study life and death problems.
This will improve your reading ability and teach you to consequently
count liberties when fighting.];W[mn];B[ko];W[no];B[kn];W[kp]
;B[lq];W[ln];B[pn]C[schorsch:
It looks as if you haven't seen the ladder for your L6 stones yet.
If you consider the most likely response by w on your move,
then you'd soon notice that you can't kill the right w group
as easily as you would wish.

As an alternative: If you now play L7, then w probably needs to
make the second eye at Q6, since you can close in the group.
Now it may become interesting to threaten the K4 group.
It's not obvious if you can kill it yet, but while attacking, you
might gain a lot of strenght in the center.];W[km];B[jn];W[in]
;B[eh]C[schorsch:
Ah, now we have seen the ladder.
Unfortunately, E12 has no threat for w, so that he can savely
ignore it and capture. In this situation, it may be better to look
for the biggest sente move elsewhere on the board and play there.

B2 and B19 are both worth about 7 points.  J10 is also a ladder braker and looks like a good starting position
to prevent w from making any territory in the center.];W[jm]

C[schorsch:
W schould first connect at N5.
Assume that P7 is not played immediately as in the game, but is
later used as a ko threat. With the connection at P5 in place, the
threat is worth 14 points. With the connection at N5 it's only
4 points. Always connect from the save side, and consider to
sacrifice the last few stones if it helps in a ko fight or if you find
some bigger move elsewhere.];B[om];W[mo];B[mm];W[lm];B[if];W[jf]

;C[I try to cut three times , but it fails all and this
game I win 4.5 pts.  Thank you

Invading a strong position with no plan for an "emergency
exit" is dangerous! Trying to kill at all cost is also not a good
idea. The strong player prefers to let an opponents group live
small and to take profit elsewhere. It also helps to count the
position and think carefully if you really need an attack.  If you
are ahead, then there is no reason to take any risk, so you can
quietly reduce your opponents territory from the outside.

But of course, the only thing that really helps is to play many
games to get experience about what works and what doesn't.

Have fun!
