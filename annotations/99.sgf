C[Hi, I am Stephane, stef2 on IGS. I played this game yesterday, and lost by a big amount. I don't understand exactly why, so any comments or suggestions on how to improve are very welcome. Thanks in advance for your help.

White : stef2 17k*
Black : paul 16k*

It was a game 8/8 if I remember ...

The game was set improperly : the komi was 0.5 and I had white. I reviewed it and found a few mistakes of mine, but none of them explains the big difference in final score (82 to 38.5 for black). I also made a few suggestions where I think there was maybe a better move.

*Ok, I'll see what I can see.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd]
C[I'm usually bad at coping with this opening (3 stones on 4th line).

*It is a challenge.  This black opening generally forces white to invade at a disadvantage or else give black a huge territory, which is exactly what you had to confront at move 60.]
;W[qj]LB[jp:a][jq:b]C[*ok, I've looked the game over quickly, and I think you largely got in trouble with this move and the next one, so I'm going to talk about them.   As a category of mistakes, your fundamental one seems to be not knowing how to use a wall and possibly knowing when to build one.

Your move here may be ok, but I'm not fond of it.  If you move at "a" or "b" instead, your move works together with *both* of your corner stones.  You will see why in a couple moves.]
;B[cn];W[cl]LB[cq:a][en:b][fq:c]C[Now here is the real problem.  When you make a tight, one space pincer like this, one of two things will happen:  Most commonly, black dives into the corner at "a" and gets the corner easily.  Less commonly, black makes some move like "b" or "c"  and an ugly complicated fight follows.  The problem is this -- you *don't* want black to jump into "a" and live because you have no good use for a wall right now.  You see, when you push black into the corner, black gets profit and you get a wall, but you need for the wall to be useful.]
;B[cq]LB[jp:a]TR[cl]C[as expected.  Now your problem is which way to block.  Either way is bad.  The way you chose leaves the marked stone much too close to your wall to be very useful.  If, however, you had a stone around "a", then a wall facing the other way would be quite useful.  So -- the lesson is, you generally don't use this pincer unless you already have a stone at "a".]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[jq]C[contrast this result with variation 2 here.]

(;B[nq]
(;W[pn]LB[oq:a]C["a" would be better.  You are stronger around here so this is a good place to attack and start a fight.  See variation 2.]
;B[pr]C[this way, black lives very easily.  A large loss for white.]
;W[gq];B[qq];W[qp];B[fq];W[fp];B[gr];W[hq];B[lp];W[qf]TR[bo]
[co][dp][ep][fp][gq][hq][jq][cp]LB[cf:a][df:b]C[Here is a very important lesson:  You have a very large wall (marked) facing up the left edge of the board.  It is the most important thing on the board.  You gave black about 12 points of territory in the corner in order to build it.  Now you must make it useful.  It is VERY IMPORTANT to make an extension from a wall.  This move should be around "a" or "b", threatening to turn the entire left side into territory.  Any time you build a wall, an extension is URGENT.  Also, if your opponent builds a wall, beating him to the extension point is similarly urgent.]
;B[ip]C[I thought : "this might laid to complications"];W[jp]
;B[iq];W[io];B[hr];W[ir]C[In fact not ... but maybe black had better moves ?

perhaps, but then black would be a better player!  In any case, you handled it well.]
;B[em];W[ho]C[I think I would have better play H4 : it would have given black less forcing moves. I didn't play it because of the bad shape G3-H3-H4 (empty triangle).

I don't see anything at all wrong with your move at H5.  Very good for being sensitive to empty triangles too.]
;B[ek]
(;W[bn]C[Maybe I should have use my wall to be more agressive ... like playing D7 ? But I don't like it when games become complicated and I haven't got much time ...

*your analysis is correct.  When you have a wall, you use it for attacking.]
;B[gl];W[dn];B[cj];W[cg];B[eg];W[bi];B[bj];W[bd];B[cd];W[be]
C[Maybe I could have been more greedy and play B17 ? I tryed a few variations but it's a bit too complicated ...

*I think B17 is unreasonable.];B[bc];W[di];B[ci];W[ch];B[dh]
;W[dg];B[eh];W[ah];B[jg];W[mc]LB[nc:a]C[I hesitated with a 3-3 invasion on the upper right corner but prefered to split black's big formation.

*difficult choice.  If you make the invasion, however, it's a bit easier generally to start one space to the right at "a".]
