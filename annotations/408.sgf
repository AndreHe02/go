C[Toshiro claimed to be 8 kyu. I don't know my own level, and would appreciate any information on that.

djna- NOTE: the sgf that arrived was difficult to udnerstand because of the variations. Arno tidied it up a bit but there are some strage one move
variations left. I have ignored those. Afraid that I simply don't have time
to fix it up.

djna- There are so many different grading systems. You don't say where you played this. If on one of the Go Servers it's pretty easy to find your level. Otherwise it can get tricky. I can all too well remember claiming to be 1 dan to a Korean, in the UK that's what I am, but in Korean 1dan means what I would call a 6 dan! I ended up being very embarrassed.   Japanese grades are in the same ballpark as UK and US grades, perhaps European grades being generally a little stronger and Japanese a little weaker. Korean grades and IGS grades are (as I've shown above) much stronger. My 1 dan translates to    perhaps 5 or 6 kyu on IGS and 5 gup in Korea. Other go servers have different
approaches. I htink NNGS is closer to US grades.          Just play a few games with someone who knows their grade in whatever context     you are playing and you'll rapidly figure out your strength.          Overall in this game B got off to a difficult start, misplaying a joseki. W mishandled a     weak group and suddenly B had a territorial lead. W never then was able to find     a way back. I think that W needs to look at how he dealt with weak groups, both     his own and his oppoents. B needs to pay more attention to what he's going to do     after his opponent plays the response he's demanding. At least twice B gave W     sente for no good reason, in a tight game that would have been losing.]
;B[dq];W[pc];B[qp];W[dd];B[pe]C[djna- OK. But a shimari in the bottom left would be good too.]
;W[oe];B[of];W[od]
(;B[qd]C[     djna -This is very bad. B must protect the weakness at Q4. The hanging connection     at Q13 is common.          The important question here is what response B expected to 9? Did B     envisage 10? If so, what did you think of the result? Ideally, now you     can see that the shape is terrible for B. So you need to ask yourself     did you play your move:          a). without considering likely responses ( a habit to get out of)     b). you just didn't spot the answer (forgivable)     c). for want of anything else? We all do that, but you need to     develop the habit of finding options.]
;W[qc];B[pj]C[     djna - I think that this is tricky. Q13 is still urgent, but then W moves around 11     would be annoying, however I think that probably Q13 is best. The move played    at Q10 is reasonable but B will always be worried about Q13]
;W[jd]C[somehow I feel that this was not Joseki. I left too many weeknesses in the upper right corner while Toshiro had none what is the usual moves after white P 16?          djna- Undoubtedly this is better for W.]
;B[cf]C[     djna-This seems to be a good idea, B is building a large sphere of influence.]
;W[fd]C[     djna- I think that W should pincer, 14 seems a little gentle]
;B[bd]C[     djna- I wonder whether this is a little slow. If the joseki is played out to an extension     from 13 then you have a lot of low stones. Perhaps immediately playing the     star point on the left is better.]
;W[op]C[     djna- Leaves the top left unfinished. As W playing the 3-3 is big and also almost certainly     sente probably W should play there. We now have two unresolved corners.          If W is determined to tenuki then it seems correct to appraoch the 3-4 stones.      Which one? Well the bottom right looks a very nice place for a black stone.     So 16 is reasonable.]
;B[oo];W[no];B[on]C[     djna - This is one joseki. Seems to work well with 11.]
;W[mp]C[     This is a key point, protects the weakness we talked about in the top left.]
;B[jp]C[     djna- I understand the urge to play here, but it's premature. You need     to examine the shape in the corner. Can you see that 3 and 17     look somewhat disconnected? Q4 is huge, and strong, and pretty     much absolute sente, why not play it?]
;W[pp]C[     djna - Very big];B[qo];W[mm]C[     djna - This does seem like a big point]
;B[do]C[The black stones in the lower right corner seem week. If I had played against a stronger and more daring player, I should probably have defended the corner O 8 to avoid an attack on the corner.          djna - it's not so much that they're weak as that they're inefficient. I don't     think W can actually threaten their life, but he can erase most of the territory     by threatening to do so. 22 destablised the position. I think B should     play R3. However 25 is big and makes sense of 21        It's very tempting as W to play outrageous things such as Q8 or Q13    and in fact I'd probably do so. I don't think you know that W won't do    this when you play 25? So you're correct something should be    done about the right.]
;W[ch]C[     djna - This is an interesting idea. I like the idea of disrupting B's framework.          26 is a joseki move.]
;B[cc]C[     djna Correct. W should now press at C15. W gets thickness down the left and B     gets a nice big corner and undercuts W's upper side.]
;W[dc]C[djna But W changes horses. Note that the space between 14 and 12 is now     interesting for B and 26 is rather lonely. 28 is the first truly bad W move]
;B[ck]
(;W[ef]C[     djna- Missed a chance. C15 would be very annoying for B. The whole upper     side gets very big. Second bad W move.]
;B[dg]C[    djna - often pushing through like this is bad. Here it seems OK.]
;W[di]
(;B[dh]C[djna- Each side needs to have a plan here. B wants to take some profit by     attacking. W has nowhere good to run to and so should try to stablise     quickly.          33 is rather helping W, effectively W has made B 32 into a good move.          See the variation]
;W[cj]C[djna - perhaps a little heavy. If B now play D9 B is getting what he wants.        A strategy of sacrificing 26 by playing at E11 might be better.]
;B[ek]C[Would black at D 9 have been better?          djna - yes I think so. You have made it very easy for W to live]
;W[fi]C[     djna - I think that C9 is urgent.];B[eh]C[     djna - empty triangle. Feels like there should be something better but perhaps     after 33 and 35 this is unavoidable. Certainly getting out to the centre is important.     However, usually asking your opponent to get stronger (he must play 38)     while making bad shape is a bad idea. I think you need to forsee this     before you play 33.]
;W[ei];B[fh];W[cl]C[     This seems like a bad mistake. Looks like a tesuji but isn't.     Hane at B9 seems better.]
;B[bk]C[     Good. B gets territory W is much weakened.]
(;W[fk]C[djna - W now has problems, everything he does helps B. I can't see a good    plan either W tells B to build a large lower left or invites the desruction of the    top.        Probably wedging at D9, and sacrificing 40 is best. B gets less territiory    and at least some use comes of 40.]
;B[el];W[fl];B[em];W[gn]C[djna - this really is bad. Better something in the middle and hope to invade      either bottom or right.]
;B[gp]C[     djna W has effectivley solidified a large B territory. B has done very nicely     without actually doing more than staring at the W group!          At this point W has got to find a way to prove B's Right side has serious weaknesses     because B seems to have loads of territtory]
;W[qf]C[     djna This seems to miss the point. It's big but effectively only yose.          Q13 seems more annoying.]
;B[pf];W[rd];B[qg]C[djna Often sacrificing a further stone at S15 works well to keep sente and     complete the blocking of the side.]
;W[qe]C[Problme after this is that W has further large sente yose at S13.]
;B[db]C[it was probably too early to make alive. I think I should have played G 12 to put some pressure on the white group.          djna - Yes G12 is nice, H16 is a likely follow up.          If B does want to tidy up his corner group then C18 is better because     it keeps sente.]
;W[eb];B[cb]C[     djna - Argh! Now W has sente again. 53 is very bad because of that.]
;W[rg]C[djna - Back to unfinished business.          But W's large terriroty is now much more invadable. the two B upper groups are     pretty stable so B can be aggressive.]
;B[rf];W[re];B[rh];W[sf];B[qh]C[     djna It's now quite difficult for W to grow enough territory to win the game.]
;W[nf];B[me]
(;W[md]C[djna - This seems too relaxed. O13 seems to ask more questions.          It all depends on how you estimate the score. If W is ahead, 64 is calm]
;B[le];W[ld];B[ne];W[ng];B[lg];W[pd];B[oh]C[djna Terrible exchanhge for W. If W 70 was at 71 he'd be a lot happier.]
;W[mh];B[mg];W[nh];B[lh];W[mj];B[nj]C[M 11 would probably have been more meaningful.          djna - unless there is some weakness in the right side that you are     protecting then looking after the centre group is better          I think W has some annoying reducing moves but nothing fatal. So 77 is bad.]
;W[li];B[hd]C[Again I have the feeling that I was lucky to get away with such an aggressive move since the bigger black group in the area already was rather weak.          djna - this feels like an overplay, you're right to be concerned about having two weak groups. However it's all pretty complicated because yout threaten to cut off some W     stones in the top left. If you think that things are desparate you might do this sort of thing     to cause confusion.          However, as I count the game B seems to well ahead so some move around J12     seems enough W still has enough potentially attackable groups of his own.]
;W[oi]C[    djna - seems off the point, W needs to keep up the pressure on the 79 and 67    groups. He needs to be sensitive to the weakness of his upper left group.        G15 could be troubling for B. It would be all too easy for 79 to run towards the    69 group and the whole lot be in trouble]
;B[ph]C[    djna - P10 might be better. Do you care about 71 or the three stones?        If you have any long term goals of attacking the 62 group then    yes, otherwise you don't care.          My feeling is that B would quite like W to spend a move capturing    three stones.]
;W[nk]C[djna - 82 seems to be a serious threat. The game isn't over yet.    See the later variation.]
;B[je]C[djna- 79 has been ignored. F18 will threaten to destroy white's shape.        I'd like to find a way to punish white for ignoring 79, 83 is mking things too easy.    However, we really don't want the large B group to be attacked. So,    if B know that he is winning, then 83 may be OK.]
;W[id];B[ie];W[he];B[hf];W[ge]C[djna- 79 has effectively been lost for no great benefit.]
