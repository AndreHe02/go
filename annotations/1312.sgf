C[I played this game this week. I only recorded the first 105 moves or so, I hope that isn't a problem. It was a close game between me and a 1k player. I (white) lost with 4 points. Many thanks in advance.

Forfun (ff) - This was an interesting game.  It began with some reasonable plays in the upper left that look like what we see in the various Go books.  Both sides were a little bit off the mark, however, and may not have fully understood the tactical implications of what they played (not that I do either of course :-).  White was not able to strongly pressure Black's pincer stone and suddenly found it difficult to formulate an effective plan.  This is such a common problem for all of us!  One or two missed opportunities and suddenly we are struggling.

This remained a main theme to the end of the game record.  One issue that did not really come up was the fate of a string of weak White stones in the center of the left side of the board.  These could have been cut in several ways, potentially leading to a quick finish to the game.  Neither player seemed fully aware of this.  One of the basic skills in Go is, of course, identifying weaknesses in both our own positions and those of our opponent.  The next level up is the ability to identify profitable ways to exploit/protect those weaknesses.]
;B[dc];W[pd];B[dp];W[pp];B[nc];W[de];B[dh]C[ff - This fuseki variation is very much in flux.  The pincer here has been played by the pros but more common are the double approach move at R14 or attaching underneath at C15.]
;W[fe];B[fc]C[ff - More common is a two-space extension to G17.  Black's stone on the right is low so Black can not be satisfied if White and Black jump along the top turn by turn.  After G17 if White jumps again to H15, Black will play J16 to raise the top position.]
;W[cc]C[ff - White should jump once more to H15.  In the one-space jump joseki, If White does not do so now, Black is left with the opportunity to play H16 making a nice shape.  Additionally, when White pincers the Black stone on the left side, the white wall at the top is not tall enough to seriously threaten Black.  This gives Black much more flexibility in deciding how to answer.]
;B[cb];W[cd]C[ff - These days White usually skips this move for now.  The previous attachment is enough to prevent Black from playing C15.  Continuing with C16 now settles the shape here.  White may regret not having played differently depending on how things turn out in this area later.]
;B[bb];W[cj]C[Im really not sure wether I am in a situation to
attack the black stone and if so, whether this is
the correct way.

ff - C10 is one choice for attacking the Black stone/invading Black's area of influence on the left.  D9 is an alternative that is more common in professional play.  In the case where White has not played H15, White can not expect to attack strongly here so the purpose is mainly to cut the connection between the lower left and Black's pincer stone.  D9 would expect Black F12 and White C6.  A low stone like this always has a better chance to connect underneath but puts less pressure on the stone under attack.]
;B[cm]C[ff - Because of the choice of C10 by White, Black does not feel pressured to answer the pincer.  Even with a pincer at D9 it is not uncommon for Black to play something like C7 here anyway.]
;W[ej]C[ff - If Whte had played H15 already, this stone would normally be the shoulder hit at E11.  In this case it looks unreasonable.  Exchanging E10 for F12 is painful for White.]
;B[fh];W[he];B[hc]C[ff - Although Black ends up low at the top, White does not get full value for the move at H15 since F12 has already been played.]

(;W[hh]C[ff - In light of what happens from here, it seems unreasonable to attack the two black stones this way while the 2 White stones on the left are weak.    RIght now the 2 Black stones are not very important and they are difficult to attack in a profitable way.  As the rest of the board develops the relative position on the left side may change.

See the variation for one idea.  Playing at K4 in the middle of the lower side is another.  It would limit the development of Black's enclosure in the lower left and prepare a direction in which to drive the Black stones in a possible future attack.]
;B[gi];W[gk]C[strange move maybe

ff - Yes, when White plays H12 it should be in order to build influence on the right side.  Playing here next contradicts that purpose and drives Black into the right.  Despite this move the white stones on the left side are weak.  Since finally White plays B12 to secure the left-side stones, this move should be at J10 perhaps?]
;B[hi];W[ih];B[ii];W[ji];B[jj];W[ki];B[ik];W[bh]C[Can black cut? I was afraid so, but it didnt
happened during the game

ff - Yes, a cut at K12 can not be captured in a ladder or in a geta at L13.  On the other hand, the immediate cut does not seem to accomplish to much for Black.  Nevertheless, consider the result of the hane at K11.  White has a defect left at K12.  Meanwhile Black has been "forced" to make a hanging connection at J9.  As a result of Black's strong position White feels the need to connect under at B12 which neither attacks Black nor makes any significant territory.  In addition, the connection has some significant bad aji left.  Black can still play E14 followed by B13 in order to cut.  Alternatively Black can cut through the E10/G9 knight's move at any time.  The series of plays starting with H12 has helped Black more than White.]

(;B[jp]C[ff - This is a nice move that:
* develops in front of the Black enclosure on the lower left,  * loosely connects to Black's center,  * and builds a large-scale net to hold White's left side stones if they end up being cut.    Suddenly the cuts at F10 and F9 start to look dangerous since even if only a few stones are cut off, they may die on a large scale.]
;W[pj]C[ff - This looks too slow.  White is not going to win by matching a single territory on the right against everything that Black is going to get.  But basically White is in a tough situation here.  Black has more solid territory and fewer weak stones than White.  I think that White has to try something like M9 here.  If there are no threats left against the center Black stones, the game is already close to being over.]
;B[qf]C[ff - This is close to being an overplay.  White might suddenly have a chance yet.  Of course after this play there are two Black stones to one White one in the upper right.  But White has the central position and gets to choose which side to concentrate on.]
;W[nd]C[ff - Natural and good.  Suddenly the Black stone on the right side looks out of place while the Black stones on the top are going to end up even more over-concentrated.]
;B[md];W[ne];B[qc];W[qd]C[ff - Right.  With the stone at H17 there is nothing interesting at the top for White (or Black).]
;B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[od];B[mc]
(;W[me]C[ff - This should be a cut at O18.  Black has to answer at Q18 so White ends up with some good aji.]

(;B[kd]C[ff - Black should never have played this move.  I is very small and gives sente to White.  Black should play hane  and connect at S16 followed by O3.  I think that White would then have no chance to compete on territory.]

(;W[lp]C[Im not sure wether this is a good idea.

ff - This is a reasonable idea.  Black has a little over 30 points at the top since S16 will be sente at any time.  So White needs 30 points somewhere and then needs to come within 5 points of Black's total in the lower left (this is really Black's only other potential area.  If Black uses plays like the E14/B13 combo to torment White's left side stones, Black should be able to win.  In the game, however, Black did not seem to realize that this opportunity existed.  So in the mean time White needs to go all out.   Afterthought (after further email discussion with White) - Despite having said the above, White needs to try harder here.  White's left-side stones are weak.  This is the chance to try to strengthen them and pressure Black's center stones while there is still time.  See the variation.]
;B[jn];W[ln]C[ff - This is a logical continuation from the last move.  Maybe White should have considered M9 instead though.  Black's next move (M9) is a double purpose play that both strengthens the center stones and pushes into White's area.]
;B[lk]C[because this move seems very strong];W[qp]C[Again a difficult situation

ff - The exchange of M9 for R4 does not look right.  To my eye it has a strange relationship to the previous play at M6.  Also in this type of position White can think of the invasion of the lower right corner and the invasion of the lower left corner as miai so there is no need to rush to play here.  Nevertheless it is easier to say what White shouldn't do than recommend something clearly better :-)]
;B[qj]
(;W[qi]C[ff - I believe that this is the wrong side.  White would be better off to hane at R9.  White should be interested to force Black to live in front of the wall in the upper right. while grabbing the territory in the lower right.]
;B[pk];W[oj]C[ff - The simple connection at Q11 would be better.  Black immediately demonstrates a problem with this idea.]
;B[ri];W[rj];B[qk];W[rh];B[ok];W[nj]C[I wasnt satisfied with this result, but are there
better options?];B[nk];W[mj];B[mk]
(;W[dq]C[or just on 3-3?

ff - See the variations.  Since White is thin, the 3-3 looks interesting.  It does not create another weak group.]
;B[cq];W[eq]C[ff - White should seriously consider cutting at C4 here.  There are many variations that might arise.  But Black has to be careful that the stone at C7 does not get cut off.  White should be able to settle the stones here without having to run out.]
;B[cr];W[hq];B[jr]C[ff - The exchange of H3 for K2 is regretable since it greatly diminishes White's chances in the lower right without really settling White in the lower left.  White should play F5 first (before H3).  If Black answers at D5, White should not rush to play H3.  Even if later Black pushes through and cuts with E4 and F3, the two stones are not big yet.]

prevent black from cutting.];B[lo];W[qm];B[rk];W[si];B[pn];W[qn]
;B[bk]C[From here the endgame started and I havent
recorded the game any further. I (white) lost
with 4 points. Who's position is better, or is it
roughly equal? Im very curious. Many thanks in
advance,
Milan van Hoek

ff - I think that you must have done well in the end to make it 4 points.  Unfortunately White got off to a disappointing start.  Black ended up with the more dynamic center stones and White had to struggle at times to find reasonable ideas.  Nevertheless, White remained calm and the game was certainly countable in the end.  From the questions/comments included here, you seem to have some reasonable feeling for what went wrong or where the issues might be.  This is necessary if you want to improve.]

(;W[em];B[dn]C[ff - If Black does not reply in this direction, White is willing to invade the corner enclosure.]
;W[hm]C[ff - This move and the last greatly strengthen White's stones.  By now they hardly need to fear being cut.  Meanwhile White threatens to cut off the Black center stones or alternatively to reduce Black's lower left.]
;B[jm];W[lk]C[ff - White gets to take the key point that Black played during the game.  By now White can be pretty confident that the right side will more than match Black's top.  Black's center is stil thin.  White is having more fun than in the game :-)]

(;B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qe];B[np]C[ff - At this point the cuts on the left side look very dangerous while White can not win without answering on the right.]

(;W[je]C[ff - I think that this is an interesting move to add at this point.  Remember that Black's two issues up to now are: the status of the two stones on the left side and the low position created at the top.  This move directly confronts the second while indirectly looking toward the first.]
;B[id]C[ff - If Black plays like this to raise the top position, it strengthens White.]
;W[ie];B[kd];W[ke];B[ld];W[gi]C[ff - By this time White has develop the resources needed to attack strongly.  This is an ideal development for White.  In other words, Black probably can not afford to play this way, and won't  :-)]

The right side is wide open but White can look forward to having the initiative in any fight against an invasion by Black.]
