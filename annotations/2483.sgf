C[Koosh [5k\]: Hello. Thanks for playing! ^^
jared [4k\]: hi

Student: Koosh 5k KGS

To the Teacher:

Thank you very much for accepting the task of helping me with this game. I am frustrated because I am at a point where I am fumbling over myself. My friend tells me that the key to improvement at any stage is to think outside the box. I will point out some places where I tried to do this. Other than that, I feel that I am somehow lacking a basic strategy since my recent games have been leaving me about 20 points behind when the endgame starts. Any help you can give me is greatly appreciated! Now...to start.


Comments by Jarkko Lindblad (JL), IGS 1d*

JL: My theory of go says that in a perfect game every move is heavier than it's predecessor. This means that at first one does not really think of making territory much, but instead builds light shapes with lots of miai-potential. Only in the end the shapes get fixed and territories formed.

In addition to the game comments and variations I added some comments to the end. I hope this helps you and enables you enjoy the game even more.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[cp]TR[oq]C[I cannot resist the urge to play the "Opposing komokus" where it looks like I will be the first to approach at the triangle.

JL: so far it looks interesting.];W[cd];B[oq];W[mq]C[The dreaded pincer. I dislike playing against this pincer the most. I am hoping the pro games I am studying will come across this soon, so that I can learn a few basic variations.

JL: whatever you do with the pro games, do not memorize the variations as they may only be proper in some positions. Instead of memorizing joseki, one should create joseki. When you study those pro games, try to understand why each and every move was played, then implement the same kind of thinking in your own games.]
;B[oo]C[JL:  I usually play like this here too.];W[pn];B[pl]
MA[pd]C[This is a new line of play for me. I am hoping that I can help develop Q16, but the problem is that in the fight with the P3 stones, White will most likely get to approach at C4 ideally. My only hope then is to make that approach overconcentrated.

JL: this is a modern way of playing - I play this move often myself, but in any case, you want to have a position in the top right corner. In this game you have the marked stone there which is good.]
;W[on];B[mp];W[pq];B[nq];W[lq]
(;B[lp]MA[lq][mq]C[JL: there are problems with this move. Mainly you are "pushing from behind", which is usually wrong, especially if done for several moves.  You will lose potential to attack the marked stones playing this way. The alternative is better.]
;W[kq]C[JL: white probably should have jumped one space further to A. One should always try to play lightly and relatively fast moves in the beginning.]
;B[kp]MA[on][pn]C[JL: black is still pushing from behind. The wall black is making is not strong enough to justify giving white easy life and territory, especially since the marked white stones already eliminate much of the power of the wall.]
;W[iq]MA[pl]LB[jp:A][mn:B][qj:C]C[I don't think that white has made any overplays, though J3 may be suboptimal. As black, though, I am not happy with a floating group and a stone at Q8 that I think needs support.

JL: J3 is one move too late, but otherwise ok move. White is slightly better, but nothing disastrous has happened. As you said, the marked stone needs help, but so does the small dragon. White has now maybe three key moves where to aim real soon now, A, B and somewhere around C - I have no idea which hasami is proper as black can treat it's marked stone lightly.]
;B[jp]C[JL: a white stone here would have been disastrous, but now you have been pushing from the behind for quite a while.]
;W[hq]LB[hr:A]C[JL: 'A' maybe better.];B[nm]MA[pd][pl]C[This is an experimental move. I don't like it now. Maybe Q11 or E16 is better? E3 is too small in my mind to play now as black.

JL: experimenting is good - that is the way to learn and improve. This move seems like a move you gave a lot of thought. Blocking white's access to the center would give you nice potential there. Considering the fact that you pushed so much from behind to make the wall, this move looks like just the right move. However it is a bit thin and also the distance between the marked stones is too large as white can remove the potential there easily. This is the most interesting and creative of your moves in the game.]
;W[nn];B[mn]LB[mm:A][ol:B]C[JL: this seems a bit too agressive. Maybe just pust at 'A' with no regrets. Now white's cut at 'B' looks really dangerous for black.]
;W[no];B[np]MA[mn]C[JL: big, but ah so heavy. Now it is clear that the marked stone was an overplay. Black has just too many juicy cutting points in his shape.]
;W[mm]LB[ol:A]C[JL: I'm not sure this was the right cut. I would have cut at 'A' myself leaving this cut as aji for later operations.]
;B[jq];W[jr];B[ho]LB[jn:A][fq:B]C[JL: this seems a bit thin considering all the weaknesses black has in his shape. White might want to play at 'A' as a kikashi. Right now white should probably answer simply by playing at 'B'.]
;W[qi]TR[oi][qg]MA[pl][nm]C[white's territory is likely to become very large if he captures Q8...but it doesn't feel right to move out with it. I wonder if it is correct to try something like R13 or P11?

JL: R13 is not a good idea as it just forces white to attack the marked black stones in large scale. P11 is more interesting, like P10 - the problem with both is that all they do is reduce opponents territory. Especially this early in game one's moves should do as much as possible. I would play the variation.]

(;B[gq]C[JL: if black can keep sente, then this is of good timing.]
;W[gr];B[fq];W[fr];B[hp]LB[eq:A]C[This sets up a tesuji at L2, however, that tesuji is gote and not worth enough now.

JL:  white can play elsewhere now, so these moves seem slightly premature. Also this is locally not the right move even though it looks so solid. It is better to "stay ahead" and prevent white from playing nasty hane by playing a move both players would like to play - 'A'. It is almost never a good idea to allow the opponent to hane on both ends of two stones.]
;W[dl]MA[qi][pl][nm][mm][mn]LB[dj:A][eq:B]C[JL: this is totally wrong direction. THe marked stones indicate the most urgent area of play. Also this move is locally too close to black stones on the bottom as if black later attacks it with 'A' white may be forced to induce a black move of 'B' later which would harm the bottom white group tremendeously.]
;B[dj]C[Defending the lower right seems pathetic. I had to try something else, and with the idea that I can settle easily with L2 if need be, I wanted to push this white stone against my thickness...even though the D3 area isn't really thick ^^,

JL: this attack shows the right idea, but the other side of the board is more urgent. D3 and it's neighbourhood is actually quite strong  - there are no white stones facing outwards and the lone white stone is facing a tough battle so close to all those dark stones.]
;W[eq]MA[hp]C[JL: this is good. Black surely regrets he didn't play here but the slow marked move.]
;B[ep];W[fp];B[gp];W[dp]
(;B[eo];W[dq];B[do];W[cj]LB[cq:A]C[JL: 'A' will be a huge move regardless of who will play there. I don't like this white move. It seems too heavy and also is aji-keshi IMHO.]
;B[ci];W[ck];B[dh];W[fl]MA[cj][ck]C[JL: if white plannes to escape to the center (too slow and heavy move btw.), then why play the marked moves and strenghten black?]
;B[hl]LB[gj:A]C[JL: I like capping plays myself a lot, but in this case I would have play at 'A' or so instead and tried to drive the white stones close to my wall.]
;W[cn]C[JL: it is horrible to force black to make this connection.]
;B[cq]C[JL: it is horrible to force black to make this connection.]
;W[co]C[JL: the weak white stones got much more eye space now, and in sente.]
;B[cr];W[dr];B[ds];W[er];B[bo];W[bn];B[ap];W[en];B[fo];W[an]
;B[ar];W[ml]C[I did not realize until after the game that playing L2 now is sente!]
;B[pi]MA[nm]LB[pj:A][oj:B]C[I think to myself...I must do something over here or white's territory will grow too large. I think I went about it the wrong way.

JL:  if your idea was to first create strenght here and then escape with the marked stone to leave the white stones weak, then the idea was good. I would probably had played at 'A' instead, or maybe at 'B'. Too tired now to read out the variations, but I think it is too open field here for black to press the panic button and start desperate tsuke-moves - tsuse is a move that tends to make the opponent stronger than oneself.]
;W[ph];B[oh]C[The cross-cut at R12 looks interesting instead.

JL: this move is odd - maybe black is trying too much or is too fearful?]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[qj]MA[nm][mm][ml][mn]C[JL: now what will happen with the marked stones and this are in general is critical for the outcome of the game.]

(;B[pg]SQ[pl][nm]MA[qi][qj][pj]LB[qh:A][og:B]C[JL: This is maybe the game losing move. I went through some variations and it looks like after this move black has surprisingly little aji left in his stones markes with a square. The white marked stones will now not only became stronger (more libertires in fighting is critical), but also a cutting point of 'A' will vanish and a cutting point of 'B' appears. See the variation for more interesting sequences.]
;W[qh]
(;B[ed]MA[oh][oi][pi]LB[og:A]C[JL: Please analyze the previous black moves - they helped white much more than black. The marked stones are still just sitting there wating to be attacked by the cut of 'A'.]

(;W[ec]C[JL: white is not obligated to answer here - it is better to play the variation or some such moves. This move helps black a lot more than white.]
;B[fc];W[dc];B[fd]LB[nk:A]C[I am tempted to say that G16 connection is better because it helps the moyo...but two of the same shapes (with two weak points) doesn't settle well with me.

Or....instead of connecting like joseki says to...maybe I shoudl just play some where around L16?

JL: connectionwise this is better IMHO, as less aji is left behind. The other connection is faster, but leaves more for white to fool around. Instead of connecting you could also have played tenuki. L16 would have been bad as it would not really do anything well - it would not protect the corner, not prevent white from gouging the side while making territory etc. I would have played tenuki of 'A' I guess.]
;W[kc];B[mc]C[JL: it will still be hard to close the corner with one move.]
;W[hc];B[ce];W[be];B[cf]LB[dd:A]C[JL: slow - better to play 'A' or tenuki (play elsewhere).]
;W[he];B[le]C[JL: relatively pointless move. Sure it makes some points here, but the corner is still wide open and much bigger as it is "double territory" (makes boths for whoever takes it). The area in the center offers possible territory only for black.]
;W[ke]C[JL: I'd just have played a tenuki.];B[lf]C[Something has seriously gone wrong, and I don't think black has enough potential territory to win.]
;W[fj]MA[fc][fd][ed][ce][cf][ci][dj][dh]C[JL: interesting move. The marked black group is maybe weaker than it seems.]
;B[dd];W[cc];B[gf]LB[bf:A][fb:B][gb:C]C[JL: maybe better to block at 'A' as it makes black 'B' or 'C' more severe towards the corner.]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[hj]C[JL: this moves just separates black for the joy of separating stones. There are points to be made on the right hand side of the board.]
;B[hg]C[JL: I've always been quite bad with life and dead struggles with shapes like the white stones, so I'm not sure if this is severe enough.]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[qg];B[pf];W[re];B[ij]LB[qc:A][nk:B]C[JL: what is the purpouse of this move? It does not attack, nor does it make territory. White will not either take the corner ('A') or play 'B' or some such move to close the huge side. I'd play 'B'.]
;W[gl]C[JL: is this really necessary?];B[hk];W[fn];B[dn];W[dm]
;B[ek];W[el];B[ih]LB[nk:A]C[JL: so black is now hoping that white wil somehow let him make territory in the center. Of course white will now play 'A' or so.]
;W[mj]LB[nk:A]C[JL: seems a bit loose, but might well be ok. A simnpler move of 'A' would have been easily enough for victory.]
;B[id];W[ic];B[je];W[jd];B[ie];W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[if];W[jg]
;B[ig];W[kh];B[lg];W[jh];B[ld];W[kd];B[li];W[jb];B[nk]C[As far as I can see, nothing works here for black. I am wasting time and points by playing this.

JL: in a position like this, if there is something unclear you might want to fool around for a couple of moves, but if nothing works and you're a zillion points behind, it is best to just play the endgame or resign.]
;W[nj];B[oj];W[ok];B[ol];W[pk];B[mk];W[lk]C[JL: an overplay.]

(;B[qc]C[JL: black let's it slip by his fingers. See the variation.]
;W[mr];B[fb];W[eb];B[bf];W[bd];B[hb];W[ib];B[ca]C[A wild shot that fell short.

;B[lj]MA[pl][ol][nm][nl][nk][mk]LB[ll:A]C[JL: this is just plain silly. Black marked group has two liberties left, you must atari-atari (start with 'A') and then capture the two white stones.]

;W[lh];B[mh];W[eh];B[eg];W[ej];B[di];W[hd];B[ga]C[This screams "bad move". Maybe I should play A14 now.

JL: at this point is makes little difference :)  Simple and fast moves are enough when there is no way of winning the game as it's most polite to the opponent. At this point it is relatively easy to count how much a move is worth, and if it is sente, gote, or whatever. For example black habe of N1 is bigger than it seems as Whit O1 is very sente. Black A14 is 1.5 ponts in gote, hardly worth a move at this point. Sente moves are typically worth twice their nominal value.]

MA[ns]C[JL: the white hane (marked stone) made white one extra point had black played a hane here first, and black lost two points - it was 3 points in sente for white - a huge move in late endgame, much bigger than most of the last moves.]
;W[cs];B[bs];W[ge];B[fe];W[gc]C[To the teacher: The end! Thank you for taking the time to help me! My goal is to reach 1k KGS by the end of this summer. I can't help but wonder if that is a feasible goal or not, but I will try my best regardless. Again, thank you very much!


JL: genal notes:

* Do not leave all those cutting points - only leave those cutting points you don't mind if your opponent cuts. 

* Don't push from behind

* In the beginning, play lighter moves - don't be too preoccupied with territory, nor with thickness - try to play moves that will be useful no matter how the game goes.

* Study the endgame - I have won lots of lost games in the endgame phase.

* Your most interesting move in the game was move #21 (O7) - keep on thinking the same way which made you play that move.

* When in close combat, count liberties of the groups - they are essential.

* Do not play aji-keshi - if you pay atari for the sake of it being sente, it is probably a mistake. When you play an atari and your opponent connects, it is likely that he gained more than you.

* Instead of fancying with corner joseki etc, I'd try to choose the lines of play which I understand - it is vital to have a reason for each and every move one plays. This is easier to achieve in the fuseki if one playes komoku etc. less and more hoshi-based openings (not necessarily san-ren-sei, but ni-ren-sei or diagonal hoshi).

* When attacking, if you don't know how to attack, do not attack - yet (save the aji).

* Don't worry about winning and losing - play interesting moves instead and after the game analyze them.

And yes, you can improve 4 stones at this point of your career by the end of the summer. Just keep on practising. Also remember to study simple life and death as reading skills are vital.

And finally, remember that go is fun - don't take it too seriously!]
