C[Notes for the reviwer :
In this game, I played B.
I won, but I am not sure why. I am rather thinking that W lost, because I had no specific strategy. I just played opportunisctically (?).  It has to be said that I had some on-line comments by "malf" during the game, but he let me play, and then added a comment sometimes. We did not discuss the reasons why I won, and where I could have improved in this game, which is my request here.

2 main areas may need specific comments : early game (fuseki ?) and yose.
Also, the reason why I won ... which is unclear to me];B[pd]
C[Notes for the reviewer.
I had for this game the backing of a stronger player];W[ed]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[op]C[idea here is to preserve right side for moyoing if possible]
;W[pq]C[Not josekish to me ..., but a kind of "thank you move" to me ... let me strengthen]
;B[pp];W[nq];B[cp]C[Comment - [B9 is inconsistent with 3-5-7  moyo idea.   Finish moyo with play around Q10 or  Q9.\]]
;W[eq];B[dn]C["malf" pointed out I should I have invaded at C16 instead]
;W[ce];B[nc];W[qg]C[Comment - [W at R9 would live easily in  the middle because B played away from  this side.\]]
;B[qk]C["malf" : should have been R10];W[cj];B[gq];W[fp];B[gp]
;W[fo];B[hn]C[Comment - [B21 has no chance to catch W,  so just make life with B at K3 or L3 is  simple plan.\]]

C[I liked this, triple aim on :
- territory
- W R13
- W N6];W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[dl]C[Comment - [B35 at S17 is big point.\]]
;W[fk];B[jd];W[hc];B[dj]C[I was not sure it was a good move after I played it, because I thought there might have been plenty of bigger moves around ...]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[cq];B[bq];W[dp];B[co];W[ci];B[kk]C[Idea was to put pressure on O3 group, as  well as on F9, to play F11 afterwards.
But W is alive on the right side, and very  likely to be on the left, so something more  efficient could probably be found ... any  idea ?

Comment - [Lower left - C2 or C8
Upper side K18 or K17 takes territory at top  and prepares invasion in upper left.
Lower right - N2, T2, M5 and O7 look  reasonable.
Upper right - S17 still big.\]];W[sr];B[fi];W[il];B[km];W[ij]

;W[hf];B[ph]C[Is this correct in any way ? (I knew I was  helping W solidify, but I was doing the  same towards centre)

Comment - [If B had played S17 earlier the  attack would be much stronger.\]]
;W[qh];B[pf];W[qf];B[of]C[Comment - [B83 doesn't work.  Connect  B81 solidly to B1or B79  is better.\]]

Especially for kyu-level players, a  score difference of less than 10 is  very close.  Until someone is at least 3d*  on IGS, whydid  they win is a  pseudo-question.  The player wins, at our  amatuerish level, who makes the  penultimate mistake or whose sum of  mistakes is smaller than the opponent's  sum of mistakes.\]]
