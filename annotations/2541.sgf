C[Glad to meet you.
I love the game
so i am eager to improve my playing skill.
:)
I will try to my best to help you.
I don't give exausting variations. I just point out some general usefull 
ideas.
Dimitris Regginos];B[cp];W[pd];B[qp];W[nq]
(;B[pq]C[the move is solid
Yes, but a pincer would be more interesting strategicaly, because it 
would be an extenssion from the black stone at the bottom-left. For this 
reason the white move at O3, allowing Black to take the initiative, was 
propably not the best.];W[kq];B[qn]C[this move looks a bit overconcentrated. Now White should play at the 
upper-left corner. A move there looks like the biggest thing now.]
;W[pl]C[What is the idea of this move? Are you trying to attack the Black 
stones? But they are so strong! Are just making extension? Remember 
the proverb: "stay away from strength!". This move is too close to the 
Black strong position below.]
(;B[op]C[This is really bad for Black. His position is very strong there. He sould 
use this strength (and White's mistake) by pincering the white stone 
that came so close to his strength.];W[po]C[This move is only helping white become even stronger!]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[qm];W[pm]
(;B[np]LB[qk:a]C[the point "a" was more important.];W[mp];B[nn]
LB[qk:a]C[again "a" was more important. Black must try to be ahead in this race.]
;W[ql]C[good!];B[oq]C[bad! Black only helps White and get's almost nothing in return.]
;W[nr];B[iq];W[fq]C[this is a fighting move quite justified by the position in my opinion.]
;B[io]
(;W[ln]LB[mo:a][on:b][lm:c]C[run out.

Yes, but maybe first -play at "a". This would allow you to run faster. It 
uses properly the thickness white has on the right. Black would respond 
at "b" and Black could play as far as "c".];B[gr];W[fo];B[gq]

(;W[dc]LB[cj:a][km:b]C[instead of this move a move at "a" seems more natural. "b" also looks 
ok but I think "a" is more important.
when there is a race like this try to get ahead. usually this is very 
important.];B[dj]C[See? Black didn't lose the chance. good move from Black!]
;W[ej]C[This is natural.]
(;B[di]LB[ei:a]C[This a bit passive. Adouble hane at "a" is more severe.]
;W[cg]C[I think this is an overplay.
I think a move around the star point at the middle of the upper side is 
better.];B[ce];W[de];B[dd];W[cd];B[df];W[ee];B[cf];W[ef];B[dg]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[kd]LB[fh:a]C[now "a" was absolutely nessesary.
But the move move you played is very good too. It is the ideal 
extenssion from the wall you created and works well with the corner 
stone on the right.];B[jc];W[kc];B[jd];W[je];B[fc];W[fd];B[gd]
;W[hd]LB[ge:a]C[strange move. "a" looks more natural.];B[hc]
;W[ic]LB[ge:a]C[also strange. "a" was still more natural.];B[id]
;W[jb];B[ib];W[ie]
(;B[ic]LB[he:a]C[strange move. Black should capture at "a"]

(;W[kb]LB[nm:a]C[very small!
something like "a" looks nice. See variation.];B[he]
(;W[me]LB[ke:a]C[this move is rather strange. Propably the idea is to protect agaist a cut 
at "a", but this is not a good idea. The cut at "a" is not dangerous. In 
case of cut white could even sacrifise two stones and make hudge profit 
on the right.

Ok, white made a hudge capture. the game is won for him.];B[ek]

simple and enough. When you are winning keep the game simple.]
