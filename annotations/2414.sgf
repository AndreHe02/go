C[I'm playing white. I don't have a rank on IGS and neither does black. We have both played around 20-30 games. I guess we are around 25k-27k. The reviewers opinion on this matter is welcome...

I thought I played better than black in the opening but I lost two corners in mid-game and that made me loose the game.

I added thoughts and questions throughout the game as "jrdavid".

mb> Hi. My name is Meikel Brandmeyer (10k). I reviewed your game and added comments with a leading "mb>". The endgame is nearly not commented, since this is one of my weak points. So I concetrated on the opening und the obvious mistakes in the middlegame. I hope, that I could help you (and that my comments are halfway sane. ;))

mb> I'm not good enough to judge your strength, but something between 23k and 26k seems reasonable to me.]
;B[pp]C[BadGamin: Hello, I am Francois McNeil, playing as Black.
In general, I think I played a decent opening but I failed an important battle and made some tactical mistakes...although I won the game, I didn't feel that I deserved it :)  I have added some questions/comments through out the game, as BadGamin. Thank you for your time !]
;W[dd];B[qe]TR[pd]SQ[pc][qd]C[mb> I'm seeing this move more and more lately. I would stick to Q16 or Q17/R16 as those are easier to play for beginners. They are played more often and thus the consequences of playing them are easier to estimate. Wait until you are around 15k, before play such "exotic" moves.]
;W[dq];B[kd]LB[oc:C][pc:C][ck:A][qk:B][cn:D][qn:B][co:D]C[mb> B wants to build a moyo on the right. W has now different ways to answer this "threat":
 - Play at A for chinese fuseki. Build a countermoyo. But: B is one move ahead.
 - Play somewhere around B in to get a foot into the door.
 - Playing somewhere around C is maybe possible, but I think playing in such a way strengthen B too much, since B will get good outside influence. Playing here is only good, if W absolutely knows, that he will end in sente. (Or later on, when outside influence is not that important anymore.)
 - Playing somewhere at D is secure, but maybe too slow.];W[jq]
TR[dq]C[mb> This move is too slow for my taste. The lower border is not interesting since D3 is on the third line. Either play shimari or chinese fuseki. (See previous move)]
;B[pj];W[co]C[mb> Too slow. Play D10/C10/C9.]
(;B[df]LB[cf:A]C[mb> Play on the third line: C14. (See variation)]

(;W[fd]LB[ch:A]TR[fc]SQ[df]C[mb> Too high. Stones on the fourth line are either played in "secure" regions in order to make territory or in "insecure" regions in order to run away into the center to allied forces. However: Here are no allied forces! The better play on the third line (F17) in order to build a base. (See previous variation)

mb> However: B now wants D14 on C14.

mb> It's also possible to pincer the B stone from below. (See variation at A)]
;B[ff]SQ[ci][cj]C[mb> First build a base! (eg. with C10 or C11) Playing there has two purposes: a) build a base and b) prevent an extension of W from the lower corner.]
;W[cj]C[mb> Good! This move takes away B's base and extends W's territory.]
;B[hd]TR[hc]SQ[fb][ec]C[mb> Better play on the third line! This opens the door for the peep at E17. Or a jump to F18. Either way: It helps to take away W's base in the corner.]
;W[ce]LB[eo:A]C[jrdavid: Here I felt I had a pretty solid position, more so than black who is almost entirely on the fourth line and above.

mb> The position of B clearly does not want to be solid. It's a moyo. It is not intended to get the whole territory B currently claims. However: Even if W invades, there is enough territory left. AND: (very important) No matter where W plays on the right... B is already there and strong all around.

mb> W also needs an additional move at A in order to make the territory totaly secure. Otherwise B will play there and reduce W's territory. W will not be able to capture this B group. It can escape easily into the center. (W's position is too low for interception maneuvers.) However: W cannot afford to play there! Then B will play around tengen or in the top right corner and W will be behiiiiind in territory!

mb> I would prefer B's fuseki. It was fast paced and B has now a good foundation for the middle game fighting. Only in the top left B made a mistake, when not building a base for his stones.]

(;B[bg]LB[ge:B][cf:A]C[jrdavid: Does B13 seal off the D16 corner from the white stones on the left? I still thought I could make the corner live so I played elsewhere but the corner ended up dying.

mb> I don't like B13. It introduces a cut. Just play at A. It also seals off the corner (see variation) without leaving a cut.

mb> The corner gets in danger because it stands on the fourth line. Then the opponent may take away it's base. However it is not dead yet. In contrary: There is a splendid move, which you should see with a glance: G15!]

(;W[nq]LB[hb:D][cf:A][cg:B]TR[gc]C[jrdavid: I thought this was a bigger move than defending at A, B or even C or D.

mb> A,B: Did you read out what happens, when W plays there? There is a go proverb: Knight's move: Cut it or leave it! Either the cut works, then you may cut. Or it doesn't. Then it is bad idea to cut. (Obviously!) Only cut a keima if you really know, that it works. In this case B does not work and A results in a difficult fight. Save those cuts until you know that they work and use them as aji (potential). Every cut in the position of your opponent is a problem for him. The more problems he has the better.

mb> C: Hmm... C got lost. In my version of this sgf there is no C.

mb> D: Is no defense. B can cut at G17. Then either your corner gets weaker than it already is or B can secure the whole top part of the board. This is not tolerable for W.]
;B[pr];W[no];B[np]C[BadGamin: this was a bad move since it allowed W to enforce his border...

mb> Correct. Bad move. Moves like this one are only good, if there are enough allied forces around. Read: If you are strong enough to get some reward from the resulting fighting.]
;W[mp];B[op];W[mq];B[nm]TR[om][on]C[mb> This is too thin. Better at P6 or P7.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[nc]LB[mc:A]C[jrdavid: If R17 hadn't touched Q17 I would have extended further at A. In retrospect I think I should have extended anyway.

mb> W invades B's sphere of influence. So it is clear, that W will have a hard time. Since this is a deep invasion, W cannot run away. So the way to go is: Play lightly! Don't try to save every stone, you put on the board. If you have to throw away a stone in order to make life don't hesitate to do so! (I don't know wether N17 is better or not. A friend of mine (1k) judged this developed is "Ok.")]
;B[mc]C[mb> Good. Take away W's base. If this move is omitted, W can jump to L18.]

(;W[od]LB[qb:A]C[mb> Wrong direction. There are no W allies in the center. You have to make eyes at the edge of the board. If you want to live in your opponents sphere of influence play contact plays. It strengthens your stones and weakens those of your opponent. (However don't play contact moves "in the open field"!) (See variation)]
;B[ob]
(;W[pd]C[mb> Empty triangle is baaaad. Think twice before playing it and then don't play it.]
;B[qd]C[mb> I don't see any obvious way now, how W could make life for his stones...]
;W[me]LB[lc:A][as:B]C[jrdavid: I thought that defended my stones at P16 pretty well. This corner too ends up dying however.

mb> No. Your stones look pretty messed up. They are in very bad shape. However B should not play tenuki here, since W has the attachment at M17. (Click on A1 for tenuki variation.)]

(;B[ei]LB[cl:C][fq:A][hq:B]TR[eo]C[ BadGamin: this move and the previous O7 were an hopeful attempt at preparing an attack in W's territory while increasing my presence in those areas. I am not sure that this was better than a direct attack of W's territory...something like A, B or C

mb> A and B are too deep for my taste. It is hard for B to live there. C looks better, since B's invasion has some allies nearby. However E5 is also a considerable move. (It is the attacking point of this position.)]
;W[ej]C[jrdavid: Should I have stabilized the P16 corner more or did E11 need an immediate reply?

mb> E11 is overconcentrated. B should have invaded at B8. The P16 corner is more important, than answering E11. As you saw in the variations, W should have stabilised the corner.]
;B[di]
(;W[ci]LB[dj:A]C[jrdavid: Would A have been better?

mb> Absolutely! W gets huge territory and B a totally overconcentrated wall.... (See variation.)]
;B[dj];W[dk];B[ek];W[dl];B[ln]C[BadGamin: kept working on that attack.]
;W[jn]LB[mo:A]C[mb> W should connect the single stone! Otherwise... (See variation at A).]

(;B[of]C[BadGamin: sealing of that area was a priority for me and I decided to act upon that before W does.
jrdavid: P14 is beginning to make me nervous about the P16 corner. My defense of it was obviously inadequate.

mb> Good. Keep up the attack. (This should have been played earlier.)]

(;W[ne]LB[lc:A]C[mb> You should attack your opponent! Remember: You try to live in his sphere of influence. You can't sit back and wait for good weather.]
;B[gb];W[fb];B[gc];W[gd];B[he];W[md]LB[lc:A]C[mb> And B says "Thank you!" to W. Now he has an excuse, to remove his weakness at M17. (Empty triangles are baaaad.)]
;B[lc];W[lo]LB[lg:A][mg:B]C[jrdavid: M5 is probably the move that made me loose the P16 corner.

What would have been the way to save it? A? B? something else?

mb> It was a combination of several mistakes. The only way to save it is running away. But this helps B to solidify his territory. (And without M5 B can still cut there!)]
;B[lf]TR[lc][kd]SQ[fn][gn]C[mb> Hmm. I don't like this move. The marked stone form an often seen attacking form, but in this situation, I would have tried to reduce the W moyo. Somewhere around F6/G6. After the O4 desaster, W got a nice moyo, too! And: P6 is a biiig point for both sides. However it is gote. Hard to say what is best... I don't dare to judge here...]
;W[nf];B[nh]TR[og]C[BadGamin: this seemed very logical since it accomplishes many things: encapsulating W, weakly linking my areas and starting a potential grab in the center.

mb> Play more solidly. Just extend at P13. Just keep the W group dead. You don't have to link your areas. They are all alive by themselves. They don't need to be connected. (Yes! Connecting is Good Thing(tm)!) (Chase the W group solidifying your territory.)]
;W[gm]C[mb> Nice timing.]
(;B[hq]LB[dr:A]C[BadGamin: this is a bold attempt at attacking directly this zone. I could have played a better tactical sequence but I am wondering if it was a good idea to attempt this...

mb> Hmm... I don't think, that this invasion even has a chance to survive. Please note the strange play of D2! I don't know what's best here.]

;B[lp];W[mo];B[mr];W[lr];B[nr];W[lq];B[im];W[gn]C[mb> No. Run away with K7. B can't stop W. This is not a ladder!]
;B[jm];W[kr]C[jrdavid: I won this fight but the price to pay was a big black region in the center.

mb> B had luck, that W did not push out.];B[hk]C[BadGamin: from my lost battle I gained an interesting area in the center. I decided to work on it right away.

mb> However, this area is not very stable. The black "wall" has many cuts and positioned against a strong W position.]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[hl];B[fk]TR[ik]C[mb> Better stretch on the other side. The B wall has many many cuts. B has to play solidly or W will push through.]
;W[fl];B[ec]C[jrdavid: E17 made it painfully obvious that the D16 corner wasn't properly stabilised.]
;W[fc];B[ed];W[ee];B[de]
(;W[eb]LB[dc:A]C[mb> Up to here things were okay. However: the ladder doesn't work. Play ate on D17 instead.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[cc];W[cg];B[cf]C[jrdavid: Only here did I realize that I wouldn't be able to make the D16 corner survive.]
;W[hj]TR[ec]C[mb> This move shows, that E17 was a mistake of B. B cannot win this Ko, since he has no ko threats, wereas W has an huge source of ko threats in the top right, which are getting bigger with every move.

mb> E17 (being a good point) was played in the wrong moment.]
;B[gl];W[mm];B[mn];W[gk];B[bd]C[BadGamin: this move was probably useless but I wanted to absolutely secure this area.

mb> B passed.];W[ik]C[mb> Huge loss for B.];B[ji];W[kl];B[km]
C[mb> Those two stones are not important anymore. Rule of thumb: Cutting stones are important stones. Those two stones, don't cut anything.... Play a big move instead. (eg. P6)]
;W[nn]C[mb> Now you trade around 15 points for fourty points and weakening your corner.]
;B[ml];W[jl];B[ch]C[mb> Small. You captured one single stone. Your stones are alive! Focus of the game is currently the rotting B moyo on the right.]
;W[om];B[nl];W[po];B[on];W[oo];B[pn];W[pb]C[jrdavid: In retrospect I find this a strange move. I wanted to find some space to survive I guess.

mb> Save such moves as ko threats. If you see a way to make life, then play it. Otherwise save this weak group as a huge source of ko threats!]
;B[nb];W[oc];B[lj];W[ih]C[jrdavid: Here I'm trying my best to eat at blacks region in the center. I also had a faint hope of linking with the stones in the upper left but black didn't make that mistake.
BadGamin: on my side, I underestimate the damage that this invasion would cause...I've learned something :)

mb> The ko was already a desaster for B.];B[ii];W[hi];B[gh]
LB[hh:A]C[BadGamin: I should have played at A...

mb> Definitively! B is strong in this area. Cut!];W[hh];B[gi]
;W[if];B[ig];W[hg];B[gf];W[jg];B[kh];W[jf]C[mb> Again. Empty triangle is baaaad. Don't play it! Only in very rare cases it is good idea to play such shape.]
;B[kf];W[jh]C[mb> No need to play there. Very small.];B[mg]

;W[pm];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[ql];B[rk];W[rl];B[ok];W[qj]C[jrdavid: Wasted move.

mb> Think about S10 instead!];B[qk];W[pk]C[jrdavid: Dumb move.]
;B[pl];W[rm];B[je];W[ol];B[pk];W[nk]C[jrdavid: Another wasted move. There are a few more to come. After seeing my two corners die I tried a few foolish things to try and eat away at black's territory.

mb> Up to now, W does a good job eating territory...];B[mk]
;W[nj];B[mj];W[oi];B[pi]C[jrdavid: O10 and P11 are obviously hopeless.]

;B[rq];W[so];B[sq];W[sp];B[ls]LB[oq:A]C[BadGamin: instead of grabbing a little point I should have blocked at A  !!

mb> You should have played there, as soon as W cut the connection of the corner with right edge. If W pushes through there, you have to fight for life in a position, which was once a moyo of yours. That's awful.]
