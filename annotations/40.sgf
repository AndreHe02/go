C[Hello and thanks in advance for reviewing my game. This game was played on IGS with 1/12 time limits. I have played 10 games against tsliu winning 3 of them.   I find his/her style tricky and difficult to deal with. In this game I thought I got off to a reasonable start but then gave too much ground away. I also lost too many points early in the endgame.

I would be very interested in yours views regarding my general strategy and direction of play.

;B[ce]C[I'm not sure if this was a good move, any comments ?]
;W[cg]C[I think perhaps I should have played here instead of the last move. This makes a good extension from his thickness.]

;B[ic];W[cj];B[kc]C[Its at times like these that I think I often tend to make mistakes, ie play in the wrong part of the board.]

;W[qn];B[ql]C[At this point I thought I was doing ok, considering I am playing against an opponent who generally gives me a tough time.

I also thought about playing the two space high pincer. But one of my faults is that I can be too aggressive.]
;W[pl];B[qm]C[I think this was a mistake now, perhaps I should have played at Q9 instead ?]

;W[rn];B[qk];W[qq];B[oo]C[p5 not sente.    maybe O3 instead to protect both the cut and lower territory ?]

C[not sure about n4.   one thing to think about is whether b r15 is sente, especially since w push-through and cut there could be irritating.]

;W[ll]C[I think this would have been a better spot for my last move.]
;B[nl]C[This is where it all starts to go wrong ...

instead of b O8 i'd answer the w m8 at M9 to make nice moyo in center]
;W[lk];B[mi]C[I tried to secure my territory here and ended up losing quite a lot of it. When I play stronger players I often get a reasonable moyo and then don't handle the invasion / reduction very well. This is definately an area that I need to work on.]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[li];B[mh]C[you let w into your large center.  too bad.]
