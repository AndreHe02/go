C[paprat 28k : hi

SC:  I will put my initials in front of my comments.  Be sure to look any variations I add.  Be sure to go all the way to the end since I have added a lot of comments there about your overall play.]
;B[pd]C[
 Hyoga 28k : Hello];W[dp];B[dc];W[qp];B[ce];W[cn]TR[oq]SQ[eq]
[co]C[SC:  This is not the best.  Since your first stone in this corner is on the 4x4 point, this move does not secure the corner.  Black could still invade.  See the variation starting next move for an example of a black invasion.

If you want to secure a corner with one stone on the 4x4 point then you need to do one of the marked squares.  Since this move doesn't secure the corner, it is too small for early in the opening.

If you want to secure a corner, then play P3.  Since your first stone in the lower right is on a 3x4 point, you can secure the corner with one additional stone at P3.]

(;B[qj]C[SC:  See variation for an example of a black corner invasion]

(;W[jq]TR[mc][gc]SQ[jc]C[SC:  This is OK, but I would prefer to play on the top.  You don't want black to build a huge Moyo up there, so jump in early while there is still enough room to secure your stones easily. If you play at the square, then you can play either of the triangles as a followup and secure your stones.  You could also play at L17 and shift everything to the right one move.

See variation.];B[cj];W[jc]TR[nc]SQ[dc][pd]C[Is this ok?

SC:  Yes, it is probably the best move on the board right now. A good rule of thumb in the opening is to play in the largest gap.  Currently, the space between D17 and Q16 is the largest gap on the board.  You don't have to play the center of the gap, just play in it somewhere.  For example, white could play an approach move at O17 this turn and still be playing in the largest gap.]
;B[pp]C[SC:  Now we have a contact fight.  Once you are in a contact fight you should generally stay with it until someone is dead or until your stones have at least 5 liberties.]
;W[pq];B[po];W[pm]SQ[qq][oq]C[SC:  No, this is leaving the contact fight too soon.  White has two "strings" each with three liberties.  You want all of your stones to have at least 5 liberties.  Either of the squares is good right now, but I like R3 best.  It makes a nice solid connection.

Later in the game, white lost this corner and this is how that loss started.

BTW, a string refers to stones that are close enough to be considered one group but are not actually connected.  White has two strings in the lower right and weak group at Q14.  The Q14 stone is far enough away that we can't consider it part of the corner group. So, Q14 is it's own group.  The two corner stones are both part of one group, but it is possible to cut them apart so they are seperate strings.]
;B[np]SQ[qo][oq]C[SC:  Black also should stay with the contact fight and play one of the squares.  This move is closer to being in contact than white's last move so black's isn't as bad.]
;W[mq]SQ[np]C[Not sure i made a good start here... indeed i lost this corner in the end.

SC:  White has played a contact move against black's last move. This starts a new contact fight before the previous one is settled. R3 is still the best move for white right now.  It is a dangerous cutting point, as white finds out later.]
;B[oq];W[pr]C[SC:  This is a reasonable response and continues the contact fight.  White has a one stone string with 3 liberties and a two stone string with 4 liberties.  We want all of the strings in the contact fight to have 5 or more liberties to be settled. If white plays at R3 next turn the result will be a single string with 6 liberties.  Then white would be stable and could begin to play elsewhere.]
;B[qn];W[qo]C[SC:  Butting against a stone like this is almost never a good move.  You had a 1 stone string with 3 liberties.  Now you have a 2 stone string but it still has only 3 liberties.  This move didn't increase your liberties, so it really didn't accomplish much at all.  The only time this would be OK is if you are surrounded and have to make two eyes right away.]
;B[pn];W[qm]TR[pm]SQ[nl][ol]C[SC:  No,  this will just force black to extend towards the side. A black stone at S6 will undermine your corner group and weaken it.  R3 or possible S3 is still the best move.  If you want to save the Q7 stone, you should run it out into the center. Either square would be a good way to start running Q7 out.

Don't force your opponent to strengthen his position or weaken one of your positions.]
;B[rn];W[rm]SQ[qj]C[SC:  This group should be running out into the center, not going towards the side.  The marked stone will prevent these white stones from making eyes along the side, so if you let black enclose them, they will probably die.]
;B[om]SQ[rm][qm][pm]C[SC:  Now they are dead as far as we are concerned.  They might be useful later for some purpose, but for now treat them as dead. This means you stop worrying about them and move on to something else.  White does actually play elsewhere, which is good.  I just want to be sure that you realize it is time to give up on the three marked stones.  Trying to save them now is too small for this early in the game.  White has much better things to do with the next several moves.

S3 is still a very important move for white to make.];W[mc]
SQ[md]C[SC:  good extension along the side.  N16 is also fine.  N17 makes a more secure group while N16 provides more central influence. N17 is better for a beginner.]
;B[oc];W[nb]SQ[gc]C[SC:  This just forces black to secure the corner even better. It does very little to expand white's group.  White has lots of room to expand around G17.  Compare how big an area white has with the current move vs. with playing at G17.]
;B[ob]
(;W[na]C[SC:  This is an endgame move played during the late opening to early midgame.  This is much too soon to play endgame moves. There is almost never a good reason to play on the first line during the opening.  Even in the middle game, the first line is only useful if someone is struggling for life.

It is also a bad endgame move.  See the variation for better endgame play but remember that now is not the time for endgame moves.]
;B[oa]SQ[pa][pb]C[SC:  Notice that black has two more points of territory than he did in the endgame variation I showed starting last move.]

(;W[qh]TR[om][oc]SQ[oh][og]MA[pk][pj]C[I thought i'd try to pincer black with this move. didn't work out in the end.

SC:  Since black is strong on both sides of this area, this is a deep invasion by white.  Deep invasions are only a good idea if you are losing by a large margin.  Since the game is fairly even at this point, a simple reducing move is more prudent.  The squares are reducing moves.  Imagine a line drawn between the center most stones of black's two groups.  This line would be between P17 and P7 in this game since O4 is too far away to affect this area.  This line marks black's area of influence. Anything right inside this line, like Q12 and Q13, is an invasion. Going another line over, like white did in the actual game, is a deep invasion and very dangerous. Anything at or just outside this line is a reduction and is much safer.

Another possibility is to make a contact play against the black stone at R10.  Either X would work for this.  The contact fight is a way to use the dead stones at R7.  Don't expect to save those three stones, but by threatening to save them, you can make a nice wall and reduce black's territory.  See variation

In general, contact plays don't kill anyone.  Contact fights build walls and can strengthen stones.  If you are slightly weaker in a given area, a contact play can be a good way to build strength. Conversely, if you are stronger, don't initiate a contact fight since it will probably help your opponent more than it will help you.]
;B[qf];W[pk]C[SC: Now white tries the contact move.];B[pj];W[nk]
TR[oj]SQ[ol][ok]C[SC:  Don't jump out yet.  This is a contact fight and you need to stay until you have 5 or more liberties.   Either of the squares is good.  The triangle is dangerous since black's two stones at Q10 are stronger (meaning they have more liberties) than the white stone at Q9.]
;B[ph]SQ[ol][ok]C[The sequence until white 45 seems bad for white. How should i have played?

SC:  The invasion at R12 is dead, but it was a desperate move to begin with so death is no suprise.  White has started a contact fight but isn't continuing it.  Either of the squares is good for white.  See variation beginning next move.]

(;W[mn]C[SC:  See variation];B[pl];W[ql]SQ[ol]C[SC:  Don't try to save dead stones.  Give them up and play P8 instead.]
;B[ol];W[qk];B[ok]C[SC:  White has wasted three moves and now has six dead stones instead of three.]
;W[oj]TR[qf][ph][pj][qj]SQ[ok][ol][pl][om][pn][qn][rn][po][pp]
[oq][np]C[SC:  This cut is unlikely to affect black.  White has cut apart two black groups (the groups are marked).  Both of these black groups are fairly strong, so cutting them apart doesn't hurt them much.  If nothing else, black can alwasy capture the six stones at R8 and then black has one huge living group along the entire right side.

Don't cut two live groups apart.  These black groups are not completely alive yet, so the cut might accomplish something. However, I think white is weaker in this area than black is so the cut is unlikely to be any use.]
;B[rk];W[oh]SQ[nj]C[SC:  You are leaving contact fights too early again.  Connect at the square now or you will regret it later.]
;B[oi];W[nj];B[ni];W[nf]SQ[nl][mi]C[SC:  Stay with the contact fight and play one of the squares.]
;B[ng];W[og];B[mg]TR[ph][rk][qj][pj][oi][ni][ng][qf][pd][oc]
[ob][oa]SQ[qh][oh][og][nf]MA[rq][of][me][ml][lk]C[SC:  White is creating lots of little groups inside an area where black is strong.  Now, anything inside a line from P17 to N13 is inside black's area and is a essentially an invasion.  White's group at O10 still has less than 5 liberties and needs help too.

Having one weak group is OK.  Having two weak groups is bad and one will probably die since you can't normally defend them both at the same time.  White has  three weak strings in the marked area which we could call one group.  O10 is another weak group. Finally, the white stones in the lower right corner consist of two strings of stones both with less than 5 liberties.  So, white has three weak groups as well as the dead stones around R8.  Pick one of these weak groups to save and let the rest die.  Trying to save them all at the same time is more likely to result in them all dying than if you focus on just one to save.

I personally would not pick any of the marked stones as the ones I would try to save.  You could try playing N15 or P14 if you decide to try to save these stones, but I wouldn't do that now. I would play S3, which essentially connects the stones in the lower right corner. They would be stable, so I would then try to save the three stones around O10 with N8 or M9.]
;W[nh];B[mi];W[pg];B[pi];W[mh];B[nl];W[lg];B[qg];W[lk]SQ[lh]
[mf]C[SC:  This move tries to help the three stones at O10.  It is too soon to play here, however.  White has chosen to try saving the stones around P13 and needs to stick with them until they have more than 5 liberties.  Either one of the squares would make them stable.  Only then should you move on to another group.

The stones at O10 are probably dead already so don't waste any effort on them.  White can find better moves than working with these three stones.]
;B[mk];W[ml];B[mj]
(;W[nm]C[SC:  Make a solid connection somewhere.  Don't leave so many cutting points.  See both variations]
;B[ll];W[lm];B[kl];W[mp]C[At this point i feel like black is quite ahead.]
;B[il]
(;W[kj]C[SC:  Here again, we have a lot of weak white groups and you keep jumping from one to the next trying to save them all.  See variation.]
;B[ki];W[on]TR[gc][gq][eq][rq][mf]SQ[km]C[SC:  Don't cut two stong groups

You can't kill the five stones around P8.  They can connect to the stones around Q11 at any time. 

The five black stones around Q6 have 4 liberties while the white stones around R8 have only 2 liberties.  Black can always capture those 6 stones before white could capture the Q6 stones.  So, this black group is also safe.

If you want to strengthen the white stones around N6, then the square is probably best.  Better still is to look at the whole board and find a bigger, better move somewhere else.   All of the triangles are better than anything is this area.]
;B[kn];W[km];B[jm];W[kk]SQ[lk][kj]C[SC:  Switching groups again.  Plus, making an empty triangle (marked with squares) is almost always bad.  The only time an empty triangle is good is when you have a group that is surrounded and needs to make eyes.  This group is surrounded, but it has no hope of making two eyes in this area.

You are also forcing black to turn a weak connection between his stones into a strong one.]
;B[jl]SQ[jm][il]C[SC:  Well, at least you made black make an empty triangle too.]
;W[jj]TR[ij]SQ[kk][kj]C[SC:  Another empty triangle.  Instead, jump out to J10.]
;B[ji];W[ij];B[hi];W[ii]TR[ji]SQ[jj][ij]C[SC:  This is not an empty triangle because  the marked black stone "fills" the triangle.  So, this triangle is fine.]
;B[ih];W[gc]C[SC:  Good!  This is a big gap.];B[lh];W[kg]C[SC:  No, capture at N14]
;B[of];W[mf];B[oe];W[nd]SQ[je][ke]C[SC:  This connects the right side group to the top, but is rather small otherwise.  Either of the squares would connect this group and also starts to seal off some territory]
;B[jh];W[hj];B[gi];W[gj]TR[il][gi]C[I guess black just let me escape, i felt like thej10 group was lost before white 96.

SC:  I thought it was dead also.   Your stones are finally outside the edges of black's influence.  Black's influence in this area right now is inside a line drawn between the two triangles.  If black expands his area of influence, you need to keep your stones out past it.]
;B[fi]TR[il]C[SC: Now your stones are right on the line];W[hl]
SQ[gl][fk]C[SC:  I like either of the squares better.  This is a contact play.  Right now, since the stones around J10 are alive, the black group around K8 has been weakened.  A contact fight tends to strengthen both players.  Since black is weaker right now, he has more to gain.]
;B[hm]TR[fi]SQ[gl][fk]C[SC:  Now your stones are back inside black's area.  If you had played on either of the squares, you would still be outside black's area of influence.]
;W[kh];B[li]SQ[kh][kg][lg]C[SC:  Your stones still have the same number of liberties as they did before this move and black now has a solid connection.  No benefit for white from this exchange.]

(;W[gm]C[SC:  G8 is better.  You make too many cutting points.  See variation.]
;B[gl];W[hk]SQ[fk]C[SC:  Sacrifice one stone and play at the square instead.]

(;B[ek]C[SC:  Black should block at E10.  This should capture the center white stones.  See variation.]
;W[mm]
(;B[gn]SQ[ej]C[SC:  Black is suddenly worried about his stones around K8.  He wants to defend them.  You don't always have to play near a group to defend it, however.  In this case, a black stone at the square kills the large white center group.  Once this group is dead, black is safe.  See variation.]
;W[fm];B[in]C[SC:  Again black missed playing E10 because he is focused too closely on one group.]

;B[bf];W[go];B[hn];W[jo]C[SC:  Good, this helps keep black from making an eye here.]
;B[ip];W[bi]SQ[cl]C[SC:  This didn't change the number of liberties for your center group.  If you want to capture the black stones around C9 then you need to come up from lower left corner so black can't extend down that way.]
;B[cl]C[SC:  Now the black stones here will be much harder to capture.]
;W[jn]C[SC:  This is the weaker black group so focus on attacking it.]

 Hyoga 28k : yes.. but i nearly didn't see it
 paprat 28k : eheh

This could have made me win the game i think.

SC:  You cut off and kill part of the black stones that were enclosing your center group.  The center group is now safe.  My variation went after a different group of black stones, but it works either way as long as you win the capturing race.]
;B[ah];W[gf]SQ[ho]C[Is this the right timing/place ?

SC:  This is a good move, but I would play H5 to remove any hope of black escaping.]
;B[ai];W[ho]C[Not sure i needed this one right away, but i was quite unsure. Maybe later i would need a safety for the white center group.

SC:  Good move.];B[fe];W[if]SQ[ge]C[SC:  This is another contact play.  The square is better since it continues the contact fight black started.]
;B[hg];W[hf];B[gg];W[ge]C[SC:  I won't complain about the empty triangle much since you are making endgame moves.]
;B[ff];W[nq];B[or]SQ[pr][pq]C[SC:  The marked stones are now weakened and need help.]
;W[no]C[SC:  Forcing another solid connection by black.  This does gain 1-2 points for white, so it is a reasonable endgame move.  In this case, however, a strong black connection weakens the white stones in the lower right corner even more.]
;B[op]
(;W[ro]C[SC:  No,  the empty triangle should be a clue to look for other possible moves.  Whenever you find yourself about to make an empty triangle, stop, take a deep breath, and look carefully for a better move.   There almost always is one.  In this case, the better moves is the same S3 I have wanted you to play for about 100 moves now.  If you look back 99 moves, I said that S3 was my choice for the best move.  I just looked, the first time I suggested S3 was at move number 22.

My point is that errors made early in the game often don't actually hurt you until many moves later.  It takes a lot of careful review of your games (probably with a teacher) to spot the bad move you did or didn't make 100 moves ago as the cause of your current problems.

;W[sq];B[so];W[rr];B[rp]SQ[sr][rs][ps]C[SC:  White needs to play all three squares to live.  Black won't let that happen, so you should be able to tell that you are dead and take Sente now.]

[ak][al][an][ao][ar][as]C[SC: Black wins by 8 1/2 points.
(Including 6.5 points komi).

Both players made some errors that lost them large groups of stones.  White was ahead until you focused on an unnecessary attack on the lower right corner and missed an important connection. The point is that you should try to keep in mind whether the game is close or if one of you is losing by a lot.  You don't have to count every spot.  Just look at your 3 or 4 largest groups and compare them to your opponent's largest groups.  If you are ahead, play conservativly and don't attack.  Just consolidation what you have.  If you are behind, then get much more aggressive. If th game is close then you need a balance.

Early in the game, once stones are probably dead, like the ones at R8 in this game, then stop worrying about them and move on to something else.  You should only "fight until the end" in the late midgame or in the endgame when there is no other "big" places to play that are worth more.  In this game, the areas around F3 and G17 remained open for much longer in the game than they should have.  Also, you can try to use your "dead" stones as part of another plan.  Pretending to try to save them is a good way to make your opponent focus on the dead stones while you accomplish something else near by.

White needs to work on contact fights.  You should at least review the "rules" I have mentioned during this game.  

First, once a contact fight has started, don't leave it until somone is dead or until all of your strings have 5 or more liberties. You can count stones as part of one string if your opponent can't cut them.  For example, black's two stones at D2 are considered part of the string of stones at E3 since they are connected with a bamboo joint which cannot be cut.

Making solid connections helps turn several small strings of stones into a fewer number of strings with more liberties.  This finishes the contact fight sooner and leaves less cutting points.

Don't bump right into your opponent's stones unless you are preparing to cut.  

Don't make empty triangles.

If you are willing to spend some money, Bruce Wilcox's Go Dojo computer program is the best thing I have found to teach contact fighting.]

C[SC:  The stones marked with squares have only one eye now.  The stones marked with triangles will die is a ladder.  Now black's stones around K8 are probably dead too or will live with barely two eyes.  Compare this result to the variation where black did play E10 to kill the center white group.]

If the white group around P13 dies, black territory in the upper right grows by 20-30 points.  If the white group in the lower right corner dies, the black gains another 20 points or so.  The area around M9 is worth around 4 points.]

[gc][nj][ok][pl]C[SC:  Now white has a strong group and has actually saved the three stones at R7.  The white group here can turn two of the squares into eyes if needed, so it is alive even if black surrounds it.

White can take Sente here and play at one of the squares.  Black as made some more secure territory  in the upper right, but now black's group in the lower right corner is looking weaker.]

(;W[pj]SQ[pm][qm][rm]C[SC:  Contact with a threat to save the three marked stones.]
;B[pk]C[SC:  Black tries to keep the dead stones enclosed.]
;W[qk]C[SC:  White expects this stone to die along with the three just below it.  White plays this stone to make the stones around R8 close enough to living that black will have to spend a few moves making sure they stay dead.  Meanwhile, white can make a wall outside of black.]
;B[ql];W[ok];B[pl];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph]TR[nk]SQ[ol]C[SC:  White can be happy playing up the fourth line this way as long as black follows.  White has a nice wall and black no longer has a area of influence that extends out to P7 and P17.  White has cut the center out of this area and made sure black will get little if any territory around R13.  In exchange, white sacrificed one stone while getting some use out of the three stones we had written off as dead earlier.

Black will probably play P8 eventually and white can respond with O9.  The cutting point at P10 isn't dangerous right now since white can capture a black cutting stone in a ladder.  Once black plays a stone around K15, then the cut becomes dangerous and will need to be defended somehow.]

(;W[oa]C[SC:  This is the usual endgame move for this sort of situation.]
;B[pa];W[na];B[pb]SQ[pa]C[SC:  White still has Sente.  Black has two stones sitting on spots that were points of territory for black in the real game. So, black has lost two points compared to White just playing O19.  Finally, sometimes black has to connect at the Q18 location, but not in every situation.  Be sure to think of this before you play since this exchange becomes Gote for white if black can safely skip playing the connection.]

;B[cp];W[co];B[dr];W[er];B[bo];W[bn];B[br]C[SC:  White could stop here, and probably should in a real game. Beyond this is endgame play (unless white thinks black can be killed, then it is midgame play, which still should wait).  I will show this "all the way" to prove that black can live here.]
