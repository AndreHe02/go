C[Hello,

I play black. I lost this game to one gross error of judgement in yose.  I have also pointed out other mistakes I made and shown what I believe I should have played. I ask that you verify my conclusions. Any other comments would also be more than welcome.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[ed]C[This would be better played closer to the corner, as it won't be able to defend the corner against an attack, and would require a follow-up move even if not attacked to be more secure.]
;W[pp];B[cg]TR[dc][de]SQ[cd]C[Here you followed up to secure the corner. Unfortunately, the stones are too far away from the corner and each other to be effective. This type of play might be used by an advanced player to choose to go for centre influence. It requires much skill however to turn inside influence into territorial points. C16 would be a good follow-up. Even better would be D17 and D15, as it forms a three-high wall facing your top right corner stone. Together they influence the top edge, giving you an advantage there when play enters that area.]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[jq]TR[qc]C[The usual response to W in the top right would be R17, otherwise you are giving up on what was already well established. Playing first in a new area will likely not pay off as well. Go for and protect corners first, then edges, then everywhere else, in that order.]
;W[gq];B[nq];W[oq];B[or]TR[np][nr]C[Playing O4 or O2 would be a much better move. From this position, you cannot cut the white stones which can be connected. W can however cut your two stones on the next move, even though you can capture that cutting stone, it will weaken your position, because you will be forced to play defending moves without freedom to play elsewhere. Do not trade off a few points instead of a strong position.]
;W[pr];B[op];W[pq];B[mr]C[If you had played O2 instead of P2, on this turn you could have been the first to play in a new area of the board.]
;W[oo];B[np];W[no];B[mo];W[nm];B[pj];W[pm];B[cn];W[co];B[dk]
C[Good sequence by B, not as good by W.];W[dn];B[dm]TR[cm]C[Again, much better to play C7. It strenghens position and more solidly connects with D9.]
;W[bn];B[cm]C[Again, this required an extra move to support a weak position.]
;W[en];B[em];W[fn];B[fm];W[hn];B[jn];W[mn];B[ln]TR[lo]C[Here, you know what I'm going to say, M5 is stronger and better connects with your other stones.]
;W[lm];B[kn]TR[lo]C[I would prefer M5 to cover a potential weakness later, and it does as good a job of connecting with K6.]
;W[km];B[jm];W[iq];B[ip];W[hp];B[ir];W[hq];B[hr];W[io];B[jo]
;W[in];B[hc];W[qd];B[qe];W[qc];B[lf];W[ng];B[ni]TR[ph]C[This stone does not have a definite purpose. Better to keep your earned territory on the right side. W does not gain territory points by making a single chain in the middle. B can make territory on right edge and top left center area.]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[qg];W[pi];B[qi];W[of]
(;B[rl]LB[hl:A]TR[cc][cd]SQ[kl]C[Good idea to extend you territory, however there are bigger areas. First the top left corner is still open to attack. Playing one stone there would guarantee you many points. Another big area now is the top left centre area because you already have outlined the entire quadrant. A very good strategy is to fight W on the edges of that quadrant. B and W will fight forming front lines, the difference is that the line that B makes will be making territory behind in the quadrant, while the line of defense made by W will not generate points. For example, starting a fight at L8 will likely make walls going upward. The move at A is also very good, as it prevents W from having a secure group enter that big quadrant. The reason A is better than H7 is that when W pushes upward, B will have better connections because it was already a step back. An invasion is much less successful if it is isoloated and needs to make life on its own, rather than just connect to an already living group. See variations.]
;W[rm];B[ql];W[qm];B[jj]TR[lh][hl]C[Good idea. It is trying to cover too much though. Better to fully cover one boundary or the other. Rather than weakly try to help both. On the right path, though.]
;W[gm];B[gl];W[hl];B[hj]TR[gk]C[G9 is much better. It guarantees making territory with D9. It is already too late to avoid invastion by W. Better to let it enter part way and form a line of defense a bit further back. Think of it this way, the further away you position your line of defense, the stronger it will be by the time W's advances reach it, as you would have had roughly as many turns as the distance away from W that you positioned your defense. The wider the gap you are trying to cover, the further back you should set your defenses.]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[fl];B[el];W[fk];B[fj];W[il];B[jl];W[kl];B[kk]
;W[lk];B[lj];W[mk];B[mj]C[That was a good sequence by B.];W[nk]
;B[oj]TR[cc][lh]C[This move wasn't necessary. Both your groups on the right edge and bottom edge/centre are strong and don't need to be connected. This play doesn't make much difference in score for either B or W. Still missing plays in top left corner and closing gap to stop W.]
;W[ok];B[pl]C[Again not really necessary. Could defend well against another move by W playing Q8 elsewhere this turn.]
;W[ol];B[pk]C[This move only makes a difference of 1 point, as you could have played R9 in defense later. Playing in a new area instead is definitely worth multiple points. Don't play tit-for-tat defense. Think whether you can still be safe if you don't defend this turn and do defend against continued attack.]
;W[sl];B[sk];W[sm];B[rj];W[oe];B[pe];W[od];B[pc];W[oc];B[rd]
;W[rc];B[se];W[sc];B[sd];W[qa];B[md]C[Playing too close to W. Better to connect solidly and form a strong wall for the sake of all the territory on the left side of the wall.]
;W[cd];B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[ce];B[bf]
;W[cf];B[df];W[dc];B[db];W[dd];B[ec];W[ca];B[da]C[Actually B can be captured, if W plays E18. See variation.]

(;W[ba];B[fb];W[ab];B[ad]C[B was lucky to kill W here.];W[dg]

;B[ag];W[ci];B[di];W[fh];B[gh];W[gg]TR[de][df][eg][fg]C[Be very aware of this type of small box, as it is small and can often be broken because of too few liberties.]
;B[gf];W[hg];B[hf];W[ef]TR[de][df][eg][fg]C[Now you see the double atari. Next time you see this pattern, you will know to defend it immediately before this can happen.]

(;B[ff]LB[ee:B][ff:A]TR[gg][hg]C[The correct play here would be the variation correct?
Yes, the reason is that this way the two W stones are still struggling for life, rather than connected to a 'home base'.]
;W[ee];B[fe];W[ig];B[jf]TR[lh]C[Here B is playing with a very large advantage with supporting stones all around the fighting area. It is much better to just keep the weak W group cut off from other stones, than fighting head to head. Just seal the borders and W will die a natural death as it is too small a space in an area encompassed by B to live. Imagine the move at M12 instead. Now what possible shapes could W hope to make for life.]
;W[kg];B[kf];W[lg];B[jh]TR[jg][mg]C[Much better to cut off some of W from connecting to its top right group. Either at this point or at N13. At N13, even if atari'ed, defending will automatically connect to B's group on the top or right edges.]
;W[jg];B[mh]TR[mg]C[Now that W can connect, B has lost quite a bit of territory that it could've had, and now has to defend against a living group in the middle.]

Be careful near edges and corners, as common tesuji often does not play out as expected.]

MA[gh][hh][fi][fj][gj][hj]C[My fatal mistake was not seeing the threat to the marked stones, the correct move is clearly at A.
Yes, a pure classic snapback shape.];B[ak];W[hi];B[gi];W[hi]
;B[tt]C[Overall, good game. Your mistakes were not so big, even at the end it was sizeable, but more strategy in the middle game could easily make up for that loss. With little effort, you could have owned all the territory in the top left centre quadrant without much work after you established walls down from the top edge, and inward from the left edge. The big lesson to remember is that the biggest points lay in the open area where stones are not played. These 'uncontested' areas naturally form and belong to one side or the other out of fights resulting on neighbouring boundaries. If you stop and look at these open areas, and pick your fights carefully, you can make territory without your opponent realizing that each fight makes territory for you but not for him. Apply just a few of the ideas and your next games will be at a new level.
1. When following up a lone stone, connect rather than pushing diagonally. This usually means that you don't need to follow up to defend it later, saving a turn that you can play elsewhere.
2. First go for corner territory, then edge, then remember to keep an eye out for uncontested territory that will just fall into the laps of one side from border skirmishes.
3. When you are at an advantage, like almost having a group encircled, though not closely surrounded, just maintain that isolation, and only make sure that you don't permit so large an area that it can make two eyes. This takes a rather large area, that is rare, when fighting in the centre without support.]
;W[tt]C[You can check your score with the score command, type 'done' when finished.
Click on a group of stones to mark it dead and remove it from the board.]
