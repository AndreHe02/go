;B[qd]C[Hello everyone,
This review was requested by black. I will try to do my best to pin point to some critical steps in the game...]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[oc]C[I will be making comments for both W and B.

What we generally see, is a sequence where W goes takes the fourth corner. In this case, W play on one of Black's corner to stop him from making a corner enclosure.

It's fine...];B[pf];W[dd]C[AFter W takes his corner, ...
See variation.]
(;B[qn];W[lc]
(;B[pj]LB[pc:A]C[Black choses to solidify right side, which is fine...

B has to option of making W overconcentrated by playing at 'A' Q17. (see variation). When W reponds, he his stone at M17 should have been at L17. That would be the good shape. In this shape M17 is close to the 2 W stones.]
;W[nj]TR[dj][jp]C[This W move doesn't help any of the other stones on the border.   Would be better on the other marked locations.]
;B[jq]C[In this case, I would play on the left in the middle of W. Just to in a large sense split W.]
;W[gq];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc]
(;W[cd];B[dc];W[bd]C[Was white 18 strange?  Shouldn't it have been at B17?]
;B[ed];W[df];B[ee]C[I was thinking this was slow and I should have extended out along
17.

Well, it may kind of be considered as a forcing move...   But you could definitely play f17]
;W[fc];B[hc];W[gd];B[eb]TR[ec]C[this move had to connect at E17,.]
;W[gf];B[gb];W[ec];B[fb];W[ef];B[jd];W[jf]C[W should have played on the left side. W was planning to either claim a huge area in the middle and left or trying to keep B in. But it is not possible to do any of these with this move.]
;B[he]
(;W[ge]C[could be played at the marked location. see other variation..]
;B[hf];W[hg];B[le];W[jb];B[gc];W[fd];B[hd];W[qc];B[pd];W[pc]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[ck];W[en]C[B was to the first to play on the left. If W had played there before Black, it would be very difficult for Black.]
;B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[cg];B[gg]C[I thought this was pretty good, but I lose it later.]
;W[ff];B[gh];W[hh];B[gi]C[it is good till now.];W[hi]C[Here, I should have connected the two groups of stones instead
of playing G5 which meant nothing in the game.];B[go]LB[gj:a]
C[yes you are right. playing at G5 does not give you anything. you should have continued playing in that region. playing at 'a' would be good.

'a' serves 2 purposes. 1) connects your stones with two 2 at D11/12. 2) Keeps pressure on the W group in the middle.]
;W[gj]C[Is there any way to save the three stones?]
(;B[cj];W[fi];B[fh];W[eh];B[ei];W[fg];B[fj];W[ek];B[dj]C[The last few B moves were not helping in any way...]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[dm];B[cl];W[bj];B[bk];W[bf]C[Was this necessary now?
Something around N3 looks good for white to me.

You are right!

W lost sente. The last 2 white moves were definitely not necessary. Actually the same is true for the 2 moves coming before them. Afger B connected at D10, W could go for N3.

Q8 and Q12 are other points for W but N3 looks better.];B[bo]
;W[co]C[Why C5?  I would have played white at B4.

so would i :)];B[bp];W[bq];B[bi]C[I don't think I needed to take this stone.  Maybe it wasn't worth
enough now.  There are probably bigger places to play...

OF Course! Weren't you the one mentioning of N3? You should have played at N4 (not N3).]
;W[ip];B[mp];W[pl];B[ql];W[pk];B[qk];W[pn]
(;B[po]CR[oj]C[here P 10 (marked place) would be better I think... see variations...

It attempts to cut W, enforces B formation towards Q14.

And then, you could come back for Q5 after this P10, P9 exchange.  (Actually W could respond with O8 which is better.]
;W[on];B[li]LB[kn:a][ln:b]C[I felt I needed to invade this center white was developing...
but is this the best way?

Well, i guess not... i would use  'a' or 'b'.   maybe later consider extending from top.]

He was thinking of blocking the connection of M9 stones with G5... He did not want to lose all that area.]

(;B[jh]C[Is this better at K11?

yes actually K11 is better. but still you could work this out with a correct response to W's following move...]

C[I lost a lot of points in those center stones.  What could I
have done better?];B[jm]C[As for the rest of the game.  Are there any points that I really
missed in the end game?  This game was close, only 5.5 points,
so I was wondering if I could have taken those in the end game
and I missed it.];W[il];B[kn]C[Actually yes, i noticed very big moves that each side missed.]
;W[mm];B[ko];W[lm];B[km]C[now B lost sente :(];W[in]TR[rc][bc]
[aq]C[W gave big points here....

Let's look at the board now. and find the points. Now it is the end game. Groups are well defined but the borders are not.

I will just mark the areas bu Triangles. They do not represent moves. Because the appropriate move changes depending on who plays there and the investigation of sente/gote.]
;B[nd];W[nc];B[md];W[mc]C[These two moves helped W to get a solid top. And B got no territory for those moves.  B should have played at S17 for example.]
;B[bc]C[good.
W could play at B18.];W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[lf]LB[if:a]C[B should have played at J14.]
;W[ig];B[ni];W[mj];B[jc];W[kc];B[ib];W[al];B[ak]SQ[bh]C[??

wrong answer...A8 is not threat to B.
locally B12 is a response. but S17 is bigger.];W[rd]C[B];B[re]

Things I need to work on?  Thanks.

The only meaningful suggestion I can have for you is to look at the whole board and try to identify the most important points to play...

There were very small points that were played when there were huge points waiting on the board. A bit more careful look could easily change a game drastically...]
