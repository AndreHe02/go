C[Hello,

I am Dusan 2dan, my opponent is firstgrade 3dan.

Thank you for reviewing my game.];B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[ce]

(;W[qf]CR[ed][dc]LB[nc:A]C[* The shape of the two circled white stones is meant to expand territory on the upper edge of the board. Therefore, move 8 should be at A.]
;B[nd]LB[jc:B][pj:A][nc:C]C[I played here because I expect white A black B.

* As mentioned above, White has the potential to expand its territory on the upper edge. It would be better to play at C to minimise the chance of White to form a moyan at the upper edge.]
;W[lc]C[* This is a good move.];B[qj]LB[me:A][qk:B]C[Should I first play at A.

* I think A is too slow. The real game or B are good.]
(;W[rd]LB[qc:A][qn:B][ql:C]C[* Because White can always exchange at A, it is better to play at B to force an exchange. I prefer B over C because the following variantion is expectable]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[rb];W[pb]C[* This is overplay. Black does not have many points on the corner. Therefore, it does not worth a move.]
;B[qb];W[oc];B[qh];W[of];B[pe];W[pf];B[ne];W[nf];B[mf]C[Maybe M15 better.

* The real game is ok.];W[mg];B[kd]C[Maybe still M15.

* Yes, M15 is better now.];W[kc];B[lf];W[ld];B[le]
(;W[lg];B[jd];W[jc];B[id]C[Should I play K14 instead of J16?

* No. This group of black stones are strong enough and have no need to worry about K14.]

(;B[ig];W[jh];B[ih]LB[gc:B][hd:A]C[Is it good to exchange black A for white B before this move.

* As mentioned before, White's shape has lethal weakness. There is no need to play this sequence to remove the aji.]

TR[jh][ji][jf][kf][lg][mg][ng][nf][pf][of][qf][rd][rc]C[It seems I extend to far.

* Because the marked white group is not alive, Black does not need to worry. R6 is a fine move.]
