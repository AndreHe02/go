C[Dear reviewer:

I played this game on IGS, against another 15K. I played as White. On some of the moves I've added what I was thinking when I played them, I'd appreciate it a lot if you could also comment on the validity of my reasoning. Thanks! -- Kinnik]
;B[qd];W[dd]LB[od:A]C[[Kinnik\]: Whenever my opponent starts by playing on 3-4 as black 1 does, I tend to play on the opposing star point in preparation for an approach at 'A'. Is this correct thinking?

[Vador\] I really don't know, and I don't think the beginning has been analyzed to this point. P16 is very far from D16, so it is difficult to view a complete sequence showing the benefits of this connection (I don't know if all this is too clear...). I think you should stick to your preferences, first about corners, then about relations between the corners. The rest is up to you and your opponent.]
;B[cp];W[pp];B[nq];W[od]LB[qn:A][pp:4]C[[Kinnik\]: Normally I tend to answer black 5 with a move at 'A', but lately I've been studying when I can tenuki during the opening, to take a big point. I figured that I was better off by playing white 6, which black would tend to answer to protect the corner. Even if he didn't, and instead continued attacking white 4, I could always live either in the corner, or run away to the center. Was that too risky?

[Vador\] I think this is not such a good choice in this case, for the 4-4 point play is not played to be abandoned soon. Answering Q6 is better, but again, it's just my opinion.]
;B[mc];W[qc];B[pc]C[[Kinnik\]: I didn't expect black 9, so didn't know how to answer.]
;W[pd];B[oc];W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[nc];B[nb];W[nd];B[qb]
;W[fq]C[[Vador\] Odd move. trying to get near O3 ? Now would be a good time to play Q6.

And, to be completly honnest, I don't think the NE sequence is over. The W stones are still weak, a move at N16 would be good. At least it would prevent a B move here.]
;B[qk]LB[qk:21][fq:20]C[[Kinnik\]: Now I think that white 20 is a mistake. Even though I was approaching an unbalanced corner, black was able to play black 21 and waste the wall I had built, in exchange for giving black such a big corner. Now I think that white 20 at 21 would have been better. What do you think?

[Vador\] yes, that and the fact that 21 also attacks your SE corner stone. 20 looks wasted.]
;W[qm]C[[Vador\] Just too late, I think.];B[qh]C[[Vador\] Now your wall is in danger, AND the SE stones.]
;W[pg];B[ph];W[og];B[oh];W[cq]LB[ng:A][fq:20]C[[Kinnik\]: I thought of pushing one more time to O13, but I was concerned with the wall that black was building, so instead I decided to jump in the corner, since black had ignored my earlier approach at white 20.

[Vador\] You are right about the danger, but don't answer it. Strange.]
;B[bq];W[dq];B[dp];W[ep];B[dn];W[cj];B[cl];W[cg];B[iq];W[pq]
C[[Vador\] Again : J3 is a direct attack on the SW stones, which are unsettled.]
;B[kp]C[[Vador\] Q3 anly invites B to reinforce himself... and the attack against F3 and co.]
;W[mp]C[[Vador\] Useless, I think. You are being too smooth on B.]
;B[mq];W[np];B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[cb];B[ed];W[de];B[ee];W[ib]
LB[fa:A][ib:50]C[[Kinnik\]: I played white 50 thinking that if black approached me from the right side, I could try to connect by playing at F19, 'A', but now I realize that the connection doesn't work. Luckily my opponent played on the left.

[Vador\] Anyway, playing on the second line in the beginning without being forced to do so is not the good point of vue. J17 or J16 would accomplish the intended job just as well.]
;B[db];W[lb];B[mb];W[lc];B[md]C[[Vador\] Another group smoothly isolated without any answer...]
;W[fb];B[ld];W[jc];B[kb];W[kc];B[la];W[gd];B[df];W[cf];B[ef]
;W[gf];B[ca];W[bb];B[cd]C[[Vador\] Not the right time for those moves... anyway]
;W[ce];B[bd];W[be];B[eh];W[dh];B[eg];W[je]TR[ca][db][dc][ec]
[ed][ee][df][ef][eg][eh]SQ[cl][dn][cp][dp][bq]C[[Vador\] Wrong direction. You should prevent B from joining his two groups. The Delta stones are very weak, you should attack them.

And even worse, K15 tend to induce a N14 move from B which completly isolate the NE stones. This group is in great danger (this said not knowing the outcome of the game).]
;B[ej];W[hp];B[br];W[er];B[ng];W[qg];B[di];W[ci];B[gg];W[hf]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[rh];W[nf]C[[Vador\] VERY HEAVY (11 stones for just 4 points) and still unsettled (a bulky five).]
;B[mf];W[me];B[of];W[ne];B[mg];W[le]LB[le:96][pf:A]C[[Kinnik\]: I thought of playing white 96 at 'A' to make two eyes, but I was afraid that black would seal me in by playing at white 96. I figured that if black played at Q15 to reduce me to one eye, I could connect to my other group at L15. Was this correct?

[Vador\] This looks coorect... all previous warning being forgotten, of course.]
;B[kd];W[jd]C[[Vador\] Oups...];B[ke];W[lf];B[kf];W[lg];B[mi]
;W[kh];B[gr]C[[Vador\] B has so many targets he doesn't know how to choose ... K13, continuing the attack, and putting pressure on the J18 group (that would be my choice), or G2, which is verty good too...]
;W[fr];B[hq];W[gq];B[om];W[pm];B[po];W[qo];B[oo];W[op];B[ol]
;W[mn];B[eo];W[fo];B[fn];W[go];B[gn];W[hn];B[io];W[ho];B[ip]
;W[ko]C[[Vador\] I think I understand B's plan : he tries to make something big in the center. This can't work, for he plays too close to you, and this is your chance. But I think B wins even without this center group.]
;B[lp];W[lo];B[mm];W[pk];B[pl];W[ql]C[[Kinnik\]: misread this move, and thought black was going to be in atari after this, allowing me to play at S9 to reduce black's territory. :-(]
;B[rk];W[rl]C[[Kinnik\]: Didn't want black to reduce me with a monkey jump.]
;B[nn];W[lm];B[ml];W[em]LB[ll:A]C[[Kinnik\]: Didn't want to play white 38 at 'A', because if I did, then black would simply keep running ahead of me, and solidifying his territory. I thought black was going to respond to this white 38 by connecting, and then I was going to connect with my side group by playing at D8. It didn't work out that way.

[Vador\] D8 is not such a good connection. D9 would be better, I think, trying to unsettle the NW B group. This is too close from B strenght. A is useless, I think. You still have groups to settle.]
;B[el];W[en]C[[Kinnik\]: I was surprised by black 39, since it meant that black would lose either the cutting stone, or the two stones to the right.

[Vador\] This is a good choice for B, definitly closing the problem of the NW group.]
;B[do];W[gm];B[dm];W[fm];B[pr];W[qr];B[or];W[hr]C[[Vador\] Too small]
;B[ir];W[gs];B[ds];W[dr];B[cr];W[dk];B[dj];W[ek];B[fk];W[ck]
;B[dl]C[[Vador\] I see two moves much better for you than the one being played :]

(;W[bl];B[bm];W[al];B[am];W[bk];B[fl];W[ih]LB[fj:A]C[[Kinnik\]: With white 66 I'm aiming at the cut of F10, 'A', but want to make sure that I can run to my top group.

[Vador\] "If you can cut, cut" !!! Don't wait for a better chance.]
;B[jg];W[jh];B[hg];W[ig];B[gi]C[[Vador\] See what I mean ?]

;W[jb];B[ka];W[nl];B[jf];W[if];B[pk];W[kg]TR[ml][mm]C[[Kinnik\]: I played white 32 as a proble, to see if black would think that I had forgotten the triangled stones, and would try to save them instead of paying attention to the top group which is now in danger.]
;B[nm];W[ob]C[[Kinnik\]: opponent resigned the game. Thanks for your review!!

[Vador\] My overall analysis on this game : you took a very bad start, creating too many weak groups. B, on his side, was quite OK, maybe with your help : you forced him to reinforce were he was weak, instead of attacking him.

In the middle game, you payed the price for this poor beginning, being attacked on all sides. B was not strong enough to fully take benefit from your poor position, and all in all, you managed to fortify your weak groups.

At the end, B made a lot of mistakes, and although you were not strong enough to make him pay for all, you won on a big mistake from B, but all in all, B would have lost without it.

In the beginning, try to build your position, and learn the basics from each corner stone. When you make a 4-4 play, you don't want to abandon it one move later. You aim at quick development on the sides. A 3-5 stone is much more flexible, but you have more josekis starting from it.]

(;B[gj]C[[Vador\] There, you have nothing very good in prospect.]

(;W[fl]C[[Vador\] That one...])
(;W[fj]C[[Vador\] and even better, this one ! Now B will have to try VERY HARD to save his group.]
