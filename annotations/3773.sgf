C[Piotr: Hi,
thanx for agreeing to review our game. In this one, I have tried to challenge DeltaVII who is some 3 levels stronger. My impression is, however, the game was quite even, and I lost by 10.5 (having 5.5 komi for B!). I were very much grateful for pointing at my mistakes, especially in the middle game. Some questions from my site, I have included into the file.
Once again, many thans!
Piotr


Hi Piotr, this is Tim Campbell, I play newsman 12k on IGS. I've gone through your game a number of times to try to help you out as much as possible. I'll include notes as we go along. You have a good grasp of the basics, so my advice will be mostly on specific move choices, especially playing in one area versus another, known as direction of play.
Hope this review helps.];B[pq];W[dd];B[qd];W[dp];B[oc];W[po]
;B[qo];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[qq];W[pm];B[op]LB[np:2][pm:1]C[This is a very aggressive move for black, probably too aggressive at this stage since there are other areas on the board that are more wide open and offer good possibility for expansion. Your idea seems to be to divide white and make him weak. But with such a wide open board white can easily survive and now black gets counterattacked. Even without black's move, white's wall is weak, and his move at 1 probably should have been made around 2 if he wanted to protect himself, so, in short, since he has to make an additional move to protect himself, get a start somewhere else while he's patching that up.]
;W[or];B[oo];W[pn];B[mn];W[mp]C[Regarding my previous comments, you can see how white is divided, but both groups are not threatened but black's group is getting squeezed on two sides. 
White's strategy in this part of the board would be to attack the black group from both sides, making black run into the middle, and building up his two groups at the same time]
;B[kp];W[nn];B[mo];W[no];B[lp]C[Piotr: should I try to save P5 group? Or do something completely different?

Tim: I can't see a way for you to save it unless white allows you to, so it's best to save it as a threat for later and move somewhere else.]
;W[mq];B[kn]LB[lo:1]C[Piotr: too heavy?

Tim: this time, no, it's a good move. It gives your stones eye shape, and if you didn't play there, white may do so himself, forcing you to connect at 1, which would leave your stones without eye space and floating in the middle of the board.]
;W[hq];B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[cj]C[tim: a good move for white, playing a squeeze play on black while developing. Giving a move two purposes is always stronger]
;B[cg]LB[cj:2][cn:1]C[Tim: This move is also very aggressive, but I like it. Your group at 1 is being threatened, so you defend it by attacking 2 on the other side. It's important to remember in these kinds of fights to keep an eye on both groups, since if 2 tries to flee he could cut you in half.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[ce];B[de];W[bg];B[ch]MA[cj]C[Tim: Note, as you defend your group, his stone at X is slowly getting choked off.]
;W[ed];B[ff]MA[dg]LB[bh:2][cj:A][fh:1]C[Tim: You have the right idea with this move, but I prefer a move around 1. It defends the cutting point at X better, and puts more pressure on white's A stone, which is facing the possibility of being swallowed up whole. Or, a move like Black 2 almost kills the white stone, though it doesn't have as much effect in the centre]
;W[jc]C[tim; This is a large move by white, aiming to take a large chunk of the side.]
;B[lc]MA[qi]C[Tim: wrong direction. Your shimari is facing the X. Even though white is grabbing the side, the bigger move for you is to grab the other side, which is wide open. A move around the X, or thereabouts, is big.]
;W[bh]LB[cj:1]C[Tim: White saves his lone stone at 1. You respond by connecting your groups. It works, but you have given white a lot of territory and lost a chance to really grab a good piece of the side.]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[dj];W[ck];B[dk];W[qf];B[qh]C[Tim: White invaded into the last large open space and you attacked correctly by squeezing him and chasing him into the centre.]
;W[of];B[oh];W[mf];B[mh];W[ke];B[ql]C[Tim: a very good series of moves for you, pushing white into empty space and establishing yourself on the side. Notice white has a string of five lose stones. His strategey needs to be to connect these to something since they are floating lose in the middle of the board]

[rs][sa][sb][sc][si][sj][sk][so][sp][sq][sr][ss]C[Tim: This is the point where I had to take the longest think in the game. you have built up walls facing the centre and now white is starting to break into that area. You have options: defend your centre or counterattack his corners. And then you must decide what direction to attack from. It's a good habit to calculate potential territory at times through the game, but especially so when there are important turning points. This is one, since your next move will change the direction of the game. I've marked the potential territory with squares and triangles. That gives him a 62-44 lead, Of course, you have more potential territory in the centre and his in the corners is not 100 per cent secure.]
;B[ih]MA[cq][fo][fq][gc][hc][lj][pl]C[this is a good move, starting to secure a good chunk of territory in the centre. I've marked Xs at other potential moves, they are simply ideas of other direections to approach the board at this stage. Determining which is ideal would take professional calculation. However, I've based them on how I analyzed territory: you strategy, since you are losing at this point, is to counterattack his territory while making sure you don't lose much of yours in return. Sounds easy, eh?]
;W[mm];B[km]C[Tim: This moves seems too small at this point. The black group is quite safe. There are larger moves in other areas of the board, as we just discussed.]

;W[gd];B[fe];W[hc];B[gb];W[fb];B[hb];W[hd];B[ec];W[eb];B[dc]
;W[cd];B[db]C[tim: you've now succeeded in cutting off white's centre stones. they are in danger. white must protect them]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[ea]C[Tim: This exchange worked very well for you, breaking into his side and corner territory. good job.]
;W[ig]C[Tim: An important move for white to secure life for his group]
;B[hg];W[if];B[hf]MA[lg]LB[lj:1]C[tim: this is a small move. your stones on this side are relatively secure, while those around Q10 are getting less so. An easy way to make your group stronger is to attack his weak group. So attacking white at X starts to severely cut into possible eye space. Or come from the direction of No. 1, which cuts off white from his other group and gives your group better shape.]
;W[he];B[cq]C[Tim: Good move again. after securing your territory in the centre you are counterattacking his]
;W[dq]
(;B[cp]C[Piotr: I guess 89 at B5 were better?
Tim: yes];W[bo];B[cr];W[dr];B[do];W[bn];B[bm];W[bp];B[ep];W[eo]
;B[eq];W[er];B[pr];W[ps];B[qs]MA[fm][kk][kr][ne][pl]C[tim: Is this the largest move? It's important to calculate your endgame moves and take the largest first. Moves at the Xs are worth more. Try to make the largest move, and not only respond to your opponent's moves. Tenuki is always an option.]
;W[os];B[ok]C[tim: good, that group was looking thin. A white move there would have been very strong. expanding his lower group and attacking you]
;W[nk];B[nj];W[mk];B[mj];W[lj];B[ln]MA[cl][fm][jj][kr][lg][me]
[ne][nf]C[tim: another small move. Those two stones are safe. better to play in a more open area and finalize some territory. The Xs are some ideas.]
;W[cm];B[dm];W[cl];B[dl];W[fm];B[lk]MA[jj][jk]C[tim: a bit agressive. pull back a line or two. this only gives white the chance to counterattack]
;W[ll];B[kk];W[kl];B[kj];W[jl]C[tim: which he does, forcing himself into your large centre territory. Now your game is in big trouble. White is threatening to take away a lot of points, and your black group on the bottom is getting squeezed]

Tim: Yes, instead of playing at 1 in the first place, you could have played at X, it gives up a couple points but saves you. Now you can play at 2, which forces white 3 and allows you to live with 4. If white instead plays 4, then you take the white X stone instead. Sometimes to live you have to give up a few stones.]

Many best thanx and greetings once again.

Tim: Some closing remarks. You generally played a good game. Losing your points in that corner near the end hurt, but overall, it was very close. I suggest a few ideas to work on. 
- Remember that you don't always have to follow your opponent around. Some responses are essential, but many times the largest move is in another part of the board.
- look for the largest move
- build up your groups by attacking others. attack your opponents weak groups, protect your own weak ones.
- every once and a while stop and calculate the potential score in the game (this isn't always exact) it will give you an idea whether to be more aggressive, defensive, what direction to attack from.
- sometimes the exact move isn't as important as attacking from the right direction.
- don't waste a move
- learn endgame moves, how to count, etc. so you can squeeze every possible point from the situation.

Hope this helps.
Much apologies for taking a while to get this back to you,]
