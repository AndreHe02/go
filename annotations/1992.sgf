C[Thank you for taking the time to look at my game.



I'm a beginner, having started playing almost a year ago. I have played many games on a 9x9 computer program (igowin), but have only played maybe 10 or 15 real games (19x19, vs people). Could you make a guess as to my level? I'm guessing around 22kyu.



When I began, my strength was local fighting, and I couldn't do any global fighting at all. But after improving some, I'm not sure what aspect I need to focus on most. If you can suggest something to focus on studying, that would be really helpful.



Again, thanks for your time.

Hi my name is Josh,

There are two areas that you ought to think more about in your next few games. (1) Try to avoid making too many weak groups. Weak groups require constant attention and the more of them you have the more moves are required to maintain and secure them. They are also become the targets of your opponents attacks. Even if your opponent does not kill them, he may be able to build territory or influence by attacking. (2) Do not play moves that you know cannot work. You may get lucky - as in this game - but in the long run, your opponents are not going to make these kinds of mistakes and you are going to be wasting your stones. Apart from these criticisms I think that your ideas are good and that you are asking the right kinds of questions.

Good luck!];B[pp]C[I'm black.];W[dp];B[pd];W[dc];B[jq]C[** I prefer to prevent white enclosing the upper left corner by playing at D15, however, this is probably more a matter of preference...]
;W[hq];B[jc]C[Should I have responded to white's H3?];W[lq]
C[I think I should have played here a move earlier, seeing as I don't know how to work around white from this, only to run to the center.

** playing at M3 in response to H3 is far too timid. White's attack is not all that threatening.]
;B[jo];W[lo];B[pk]C[** I feel this is too far];W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[** Correct direction?];W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[nq];W[rn]
;B[qo]C[** A thank-you move];W[ro];B[qn];W[qm];B[pm];W[ql]C[** Not a great outcome for black]
;B[pl];W[lm];B[jm];W[lk];B[ce]C[Could I have played this earlier, or did the bottom right need securing? And I can't just leave the K3,5,7 stones to be killed, right? They feel weak, though.

** At the moment the K stones are fine because black can connect underneath using M2. I think it is a good idea to get some stones on the left hand side.]
;W[gd];B[ci]C[I don't fight for the corner, but instead try to secure my own territory. I've heard that you should respect your opponent and recognize that they deserve some territory. Thoughts?

** I don't particularly like this extension - it is a little weak. I would have played something like D11 or D12. These extensions are a little more secure. Not delving into the corner immediately is fine - afterall there is much more to be gained along the side anyway!]
;W[ck];B[cn]C[This needs to be fought, even though invasion is one of my weaker points.

** You have a weakness at C13. Invading at C5 is going to prompt white to move into the centre. This will split your groups, which are not especially strong. So I think that playing C6 right now is premature. I would prefer to strengthen the upper group and then invade.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[ek];B[fp]C[Connect the left and right by threatening the corner?]
;W[fq];B[ep];W[eq];B[do];W[cq]C[** Playing C4 would be a better connection here...]
;B[bo];W[cp];B[hp];W[ip];B[iq];W[gp];B[ho];W[go];B[fn];W[hn]
;B[io];W[gn];B[hr];W[gq];B[lr]C[This makes me feel a lot more comfortable about playing M2. Did I really need this much back up to make the connection secure?

** I'm unsure what you mean, but after the exchange with white it is clear that the black stones in the middle are becoming isolated. This ensures their safety. You have too many weak groups around the board, so ensuring that this groups is safe is one less problem to think about.]
;W[kq];B[kr];W[jk];B[fl];W[fk];B[dl];W[dk];B[cl];W[el];B[em]
;W[gl];B[bk]C[** I don't like this move because it is forcing white to lean on your other group and it is likely to cause you trouble.]
;W[bj];B[bl];W[cj];B[bi];W[di];B[dh];W[ai];B[ah];W[aj];B[bg]
;W[eh]
(;B[dg]C[I feel this isn't aggressive enough. It invites him to build a wall with center influence. Would E13 have been safe enough a move?

** E13 would have been a disaster (see variation). These moves are necessary and a consequence of playing B9.]
;W[eg];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[df];W[ef]C[** This is rather unfortunate for black. Being shut in, these stones are worth little more throughout the game, but whites wall is going to be important.]
;B[je]C[I play here to get some center influence of my own after letting white build that small wall. Should I have played along the third line instead, securing territory along the top?

** I'm not sure if it is too bold but I like the attitude :-) It should, however, provoke an immediate invasion by white and you should expect it. That being the case, how should black defend and how are you planning to make life? If a white invasion around N16 becomes strong, how will you connect your groups? So having said that, I think that my preferred move would be O16.]
;W[kd]C[And so I begin to feel the weakness of my last move.]
;B[jd];W[pc];B[qc]C[I want to secure territory on the right, not the top, since I can connect with my lower right stones. But after playing, I think it might have been better to have forced him right so that I could connect with those lone three stones.

** Pushing white to right and making him live small is certainly a good idea and it would be nice to lend some support to the K16 group... However, I am unsure what the trade off would be in terms of territory.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb];B[qe];W[nc];B[qj]C[I want to secure my right side, but...]
;W[md]C[...maybe I should have played this before white got a chance. Or is it too weak a link?

** If you wanted to shut white in, then you could have played N15. However, I think you should be considering the life of the central black group at the top. This group of stones occupies an important position on the board and should not be neglected.]
;B[nf]C[Unable to play N16 myself now, I opt for this. But looking back, it seems too far from the three stones.]
;W[lf];B[jh]C[Another attempt to connect, but by now white has too much influence and thus too much ability to cut.

** Connect to what?];W[jg]C[** I prefer M12 for white];B[kh]
C[I didn't want to leave K12 alone, as doing so felt like it would give white a bunch of territory in the center. But there's not supposed to be territory in the center.

** The group of three at the top is more important that the single stone at K12.]
;W[ig];B[ei]C[Using threats to hope for a wall to cut his stones in half. Not for territory of my own, but to cut down on white's.]
;W[fi]C[But he decides one stone is not worth it. Good decision on his part, but bad for me.]
;B[hi];W[hh];B[ij];W[ik];B[gk];W[hk];B[gj];W[gi];B[hj]C[And so I succeed in cutting down his territory, but now those three stones on K really look in trouble. I feel comfortable about sacrificing a single stone, or maybe two, for the greaster cause. But three? And where they might actually be of use?

** Well, it was never actually whites territory, but you have succeeding in sealing in those three stones at the top. Although those stones are only three points by themselves, they a surrounded by lots of space and lots more points for white. They ARE in important. However, life now looks bleak.]
;W[fm]
(;B[fo]C[H17 is the bigger point. Should I have ignored this threat until the upper area is settled?

** I think this point is important for the survival of those stones.]
;W[hm];B[mh]C[Again, H17 is a big point, but all those stones I used to cut his territory are worthless if I don't connect them.]
;W[kg];B[mg]C[This is the questionable move. Is it really needed?

** Maybe not *needed* but the situation becomes more complex without it...]
;W[hc]C[This kills the three black stones on K17. Should I have played H17 on my previous move?

** You should have done something to save those stones long before now.]
;B[lc]C[Is there any real hope for this group at this point?

** The chances are slim...];W[kc];B[kb];W[ld];B[mb];W[mc];B[lb]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[nb];B[ic];W[hb];B[hf]C[I might have been able to get an eye on the top line, so the hope is to get one around J15. Reading it out during the game, H16 and 15 were both losing moves. So I went for this with the hope of scaring him with threats on the left.]
;W[he]C[But he's not that scared, and I have no eye here. I need a miracle, and so I go looking for one...]
;B[if];W[gf];B[fe];W[fd];B[ff];W[fg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[gg];W[ge]C[No miracle for me.

** Black is in a snapback - there is no need to play G15];B[ea]
;W[fa];B[ml]C[My goal here is simply to not let white get any territory out of M5, 7, 9.]
;W[mk];B[nj]C[** Cutting at M8 might be better...];W[mm];B[nl]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[no];B[np];W[mo];B[mp]C[** Cut at M8];W[ko];B[nn]
C[** Cut at M8];W[nm];B[on];W[mn];B[kn];W[km];B[ll];W[kl];B[jl]
;W[om];B[oo];W[nk];B[ol];W[ok];B[oj];W[jj];B[ih];W[hg];B[lj]
;W[bp];B[an];W[gr];B[is];W[gs];B[kj];W[kk];B[rk]C[Here I hope to at the least whittle away his territory, but I get more, because...]
;W[sm]C[...white plays T7. Isn't S8 the better response to my S9?]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[qk]C[I need to take away white's liberties here if I have any hope of killing anything. These two moves are pretty much gote. I end up succeeding, but only due to white bad moves. Should I have abandoned the hope of killing white here and gone on to play territory-preserving end game moves?

** It is probably wiser to play yose moves now. You must not rely upon you opponent to make a mistake in order to win.]
;W[qs];B[sl];W[hs]C[White ignores the threat, or just doesn't see it...]
;B[ir]C[And I feel this is more important, since he could eat away at this group here if I ignore it.]
;W[ap]C[Again, white plays end game moves. But as this is gote, I get to try my hand at killing white...]
;B[rp];W[sp]C[This doesn't save white. Is there a move that can?

** No.];B[sq];W[rq];B[so];W[qp];B[sn]C[This won the game for me.]
;W[sr];B[os];W[ps];B[il]C[I end up with a lot of gote moves after this. Is there a better order I could have played the end games moves?]
;W[hl];B[dj]C[** This move should be played later.];W[ej];B[di]
;W[da];B[me];W[kf];B[le]C[** How many points does this make...?]

;W[ji];B[ii];W[fj];B[lh];W[ca];B[ba];W[ea];B[bb];W[ao];B[bn]
;W[ak];B[al];W[sp];B[ro];W[sq];B[ra]C[I know it's a pathetic attempt, but I always like to try. I've argued with my friend about this. It is my understanding that there's nothing wrong with trying, as long as your opponent responds. It has no effect on the final score, as the points he gets for my stones are balanced by his filling in his own territory.

** Again, relying upon your opponent to make mistakes in order to win is not a good idea. End of comments.]
;W[pa];B[in];W[im];B[jn];W[jp]C[White has no reason to play this, right? What was he thinking?]
;B[kp];W[lp];B[jp];W[tt];B[cr]C[Again, I like to try, but here it seemed even more pointless.]
