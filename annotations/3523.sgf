C[Hello, my name is Kevin, I hope you find this review helpful. It looks like you played a pretty good game until you got separated and desparate.]
;B[qe]C[zoya [6k?\]: thx for playing, have fun];W[dp];B[op]
;W[dd];B[jc]MA[cp][eq]LB[qp:A][cj:B]C[This is the answer for your question on the next move.

There is a simple way to approach the opening that will at least help avoid an awful mistake.

In order of importance:
1) take an empty corner
2a) make a corner enclosure or prevent your opponent from making a corner enclosure
2b) take the mid point of an open side with facing enclosures. (a facing enclosure would be a star point or a enclosure such as X.

In this case A is certainly a fine move, and B would be the mid point of the largest side with facing enclosures. Either is OK.]
;W[qp]C[zoya: I dont know if this is the right direction to play, i wasnt so sure when i played this cause now black can get nice influence. What are better places to play than here?]
;B[pn]C[A tenuki here would be an acceptable move if you wish. Black would need to invest another gote move to kill you]
;W[qn];B[qm];W[pm]LB[qo:A]C[This is an aggressive fighting move, unless your absolutely sure of what you want to accomplish, simply pulling back and connecting at A would be a good play. It leaves more possibilities available.]

(;B[po]LB[qo:A]C[Black could have atari'd at A first and then played his circle move. see the variation.]
;W[qo];B[ql];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[mp];W[no]C[This is best left unplayed. All that was accomplished is black became stronger.]
;B[np];W[pc]LB[cj:A]C[Although this is acceptable, I'd prefer taking the wide open spot on the left side, A.]
;B[mc];W[oe]LB[pe:A][od:B]C[This can be too easily cut, A and B are common white moves instead.]
;B[pd];W[od];B[qc];W[pe];B[qd]
(;W[qf]C[zoya: Right after i played this felt like a big mistake. Maybe connecting at P17 would have been better.

Perhaps its not so bad, the lower right black stones stress center influence. Playing R14 keeps you solidly on the outside, and black didn't make so much territory on the top. See the variation.]
;B[pb];W[nc];B[nb];W[ob];B[oc];W[qk];B[nd];W[pl]C[I think that worked out in your favor.]
;B[rk];W[qj]C[zoya: I dont think im playing this situation right.

So far OK, black is being forced to live small, white is connecting to slightly vulnerable groups.]

(;B[pf]LB[iq:A]C[This was really a black mistake. Black was already stable, white didn't lose that much. Black should have played A. your response was good.]
;W[jp];B[lo];W[nm]MA[pm][pl][rl][qk][qj][qi][ph][pg]LB[jn:A]
[dj:B]C[I'm not sure what this accomplishes. your white group X is safe. How about A or B. Your goal with A would be to require a black response and take sente for B.]

[qj][qi][pi][ph][pg][nm][pm][pl]LB[dj:A]C[None of the X group is in danger, you've already limited black's potential in the center, your not going to be able to develop a large territory, and triangle group has plenty of options. "A" is much more valuable.]

(;W[hj]LB[ei:A]C[This was over aggressive and the beginning of the end. The black top right and white lower left cancel each other out. The black top left and black lower left are about 30 points. you have that easy on the left three lines. A or a similar move would solidify the side.]

[jp:B]C[zoya: H12 should have been at H18....i know i know...

Yes, but at this point your falling behind in points. You really did pretty well up until your move at H10 (A). Overall, sometimes you are a little to aggressive, as if you want to win every game by 15 points. Play a little safer, evaluate how much territory you have and wether you really need to play A or wether you can play a more conservative move. Let your opponent be the one to leave the unstable groups like the triangle one, and when he does, pressure him (not necessarilly attack) with a move such as B.
