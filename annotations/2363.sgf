C[I say: hi

Hi.
I haven't play or read weiqi books for a couple of months. Feeling deproved, I'm afraid can't offer a much detailed review this time. I'm sorry for this >.<
The game was quite close. most of the times i can't figure out who's ahead during the game.]
;B[pd];W[pq];B[cd];W[dp];B[id];W[nc]LB[oc:B][pf:A]C[W played a stone which is already pincered, so you should attack it. It's the same as if you played the pincer and he played tenuki, how to follow up? A is too soft. B makes him heavy in preparation for attack.]

(;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[cn]LB[qh:1][po:A]TR[pf]C[When you play a stone high, it's usually because you want to continue to expand there. If you don't continue there quite early, W might play at 1. So, the kakari at A or B looks like the normal continuation. Your move does not follow the normal flow of the game, and although it doesn't lose very much I think it is not a good move.]
;W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[qo]C[Perhaps E17 was better than R5?

Wang: Perhaps, kinda related to the playing style i think.
Morten: No, read the comment at move 11 and you will see why I think R5 is the right point.]
;B[df];W[dj];B[cj];W[di]LB[ch:A][el:B]
(;B[ch]LB[gi:A][dm:B]C[Wang: B[c12\], too passive.
Morten: I think this is a question of style, C12 is a patient move.]

(;W[gi]C[Wang: G11, loose.
Morten: I think the sequence Wang gives is not the best for B, so W is correct to play like he does in the game.]
;B[dk]C[Morten: But this move is clearly slow. Extending on the right side is urgent, and playing on the bottom is also much bigger.]

(;W[kp]LB[fj:B][qj:A]C[Morten: The sequence given by Wang here (starting with B) is a severe attack, but it does not seem to gain anything for B. I think B is wise to play A and wait and see how to attack the W stones.]

(;B[qj];W[ql];B[hf]LB[dh:B][ol:A]C[Morten: This B move is not very good because it tries to make territory on upper side, but W can always attach in the corner or slide in underneath so the potential here is not so big in my opinion. B should instead do something about the lower side before it becomes too big.]

(;W[ol]C[E6 or F6 instead of P8?

Wang: Yes, better than p8, but settle d11 group before all these.
Morten: The D11 stones are not that big - B has to capture them on a large scale to make it worth it. F6 builds territory and makes it hard to capture G11 in an efficient way, so I think it is an excellent move. That being said, P8 is not so bad because it prepares the R12 invasion.]
;B[fn];W[ii]C[I wasn't sure about J11. I think it was slow looking at it now. maybe D9 would have been better keeping sente.

Wang: Guess you meant e9. Both e9 and j11 are ok. e9 doesn't keep a sente for you.
Morten: D11 stones are light, the only stone you should think about defending is G11. If E9 really helps you defend G11 it is OK, but I think it just makes you more heavy. However - I think W should play H4 and leave the trouble of how to attack in the center to B. If you take profit by H4 the W center stones become light, so they are not too difficult to handle.]
;B[oj];W[fk]C[Morten: Strange shape... it seems to leave all kinds of aji, I would have jumped to H8 instead.]
;B[ek]C[Morten: This push is very vulgar, just helping W to fix his shape.]
;W[ej]C[Why not draw back to F10? This way you can answer F8 at G8, and if he pushes at E10 you don't have to answer as these two stones are not at all interesting.]
;B[fl];W[gk];B[im]LB[dh:B][eh:A]
(;W[eh]C[Wang: Too slow. W can tenuki here.
Morten: W ends in gote in Wang's sequence also, the only difference being that D12 has been exchanged for C13. This is not a gain for W, he can make ko threat here and the exchange means the aji of attaching in the corner becomes less valuable.]
;B[hq]C[Wang: H3 hurts.];W[bq];B[kq];W[lq];B[lp];W[mq];B[lo]

(;W[ib]C[Morten: This W move is pretty dull... First of all W should attach in the corner to see how B responds.]
