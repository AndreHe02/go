;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[qn]C[This move is supposed to give good options against the pincer - and if black defends the corner (as he did here) then the extension up the side reduces the effect of black's shimari but would something else like an invasion in the middle of the side (q10 or r10) or maybe develop my own side with d10 be better?


Hi
There are many options at this stage of the game. My tip: don`t think too much about it and play a style you like.]

(;W[hq];B[fo]MA[kq]C[I guess it would be better for b now to take the opportunity to invade the corner, but I am not sure. However white answers, his l3 stone look overconcentrated to me.]
;W[dn];B[fm];W[dr];B[mq];W[lo];B[ho]LB[jp:a]C[this looks a little bit passive but may be its alright. What about a instead?]
;W[oo];B[oi];W[lc]C[This seems like an OK invasion point but it didn't work out too well. Is there a better point? or should I have tried to reduce this earlier?

That are difficult questions. To my opinion, locally l17 would be a better invasion point. After b k17 white has no possibility to make a base.]
;B[md]LB[ld:a][ke:b]C[At this point I looked at several alternatives for whitesuch as l16,l15 or m15 are any of these better than the move played?

m16 or l15 look best to me.];W[mc];B[nd];W[ld]C[I looked at k16 as an alternative here is followed by b m16, w l16 and  white seems to get out better than in the game but is there a better sequence for black?


Black wouldnt answer k16 with m16. White may not get an easy base but has to flee without any eye, that has to be blacks aim.]
;B[lf]C[This move hurt me

Don`t panic. Remember: with j18 you can create a base.];W[le]
C[This move looks bad to me now - but is there anything much better?

Why bad? I´m not sure if its bad.];B[mf];W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[jd]
;W[je];B[hf];W[ib]C[bad move, after w k16 its to late for j18.]
;B[jb]C[suddenly its a difficult game for black.];W[ig];B[hg]
;W[ih];B[hh];W[dh]LB[ij:a]C[better j10,];B[ii]C[white has serious problems now.]
;W[kh];B[ji];W[jh]LB[lg:a]C[uuups, why not m14??];B[lh]LB[lj:a]
C[black should now be consequent and m10 or so.];W[ki];B[cc]
C[with this invasion, black is going to loose the control of the game. if white gets strong here, the h14 group becomes weak.]
;W[dc]C[Is this the correct response - locally I thought it worked out OK but is there anything better?


I think its ok.];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[bf];B[ce];W[cf]
LB[de:a]C[d15 would have been sente, white let slip a good opportunity.]
;B[de];W[ee];B[cd];W[gb];B[fd];W[fe]C[not good, what if black cuts???]
;B[ge]C[white was lucky];W[gd];B[gc];W[hc];B[hd];W[ic];B[hi]
;W[jc]C[I felt confident at this point but...];B[co]TR[hq][dr]
SQ[qk][qn][lo][oo][kq]C[I couldn't see how to deal with this
At the time I thought that building an outer wall would enable me to cut in two the black stones above - which I did but it wasn't enough - did I execute this strategy badly -or was it the wrong strategy?
I was also worried about losing the link between the triangled stones if I resisted with consequences for the square stones]

(;W[do]C[Subsequently I thought that resisting might have been better than this - see variation.


I am not sure, too. But this cannot be too bad, black has to live in gote and white can start a splitting attack. BEcause black is leading in territorry white has to put his hope in a fight.]
;B[cl];W[dl]LB[cn:a]C[a (c6) would be an alternative, but white has not enough territorry, so this move seems good to me.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[cn];W[gk]C[Was this the best place to come in - or did I miss a better chance?


to my opinion a good move, white has now to gain from the attack..]
;B[il];W[im]LB[hm:a]C[ooh, interesting move :) but propably bad. with h7 black has no more problems and more territory.]

;B[jn];W[io];B[jo];W[ip]MA[jm][in]LB[jp:a][jq:b][jr:c][kr:d]
C[I couldn't see a better sequence than this - was there one?

this "downdriving" sequence was surely not the best. black is gaining nothing, while forcing white to catch the stones without leaving any aji. 

After the k7-j6-exchange black should try to use the aji by playing a, b, c or d. Try out the many options there.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[br]C[why not c2 with the yose-option d1 (sente)??]
;W[ck];B[bk];W[bj]LB[nb:a][ri:b]C[this is not sente, there are bigger moves on the board. for example: a (o18) is a double sente, because black l16, l17 and so on.

b (s10) is also a big sente move for white.];B[bl]C[too small.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[kk];B[ln];W[mo];B[lm]
(;W[nr]C[I'm trying to scrabble a few extra points here but I think the game is already lost unless I can find a way into black's top right area.
would something like s16 work at this stage instead - see variation


If you think, the game is already lost, then this is a stage of the game you can really learn a lot and improve. I´ll try to finish this game in variation 2. I will play fast and for a 3d it is surely not the best continuation, but it may help you to estimate the position at the beginning of the endgame (yose). A very good 6d told me once: If you really want to improve fast then concnetrate on yose.]
