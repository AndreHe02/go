AB[dp][pd]C[I am black.  My opponent is a 7k+ on IGS.  I am just looking for general comments.  I have made some guesses on a few places where I think I see my mistakes, but feel free to correct my assumptions.  Thanks in advance for reviewing this game!  -Calvin]

;W[pj];B[qj];W[pi];B[qh];W[nc]LB[qq:B][og:A][pm:C]C[Calvin: I think usually white is continuing at A (P13) or invading at  B (R3).


A is not usual here. Nor does it accomplish much.

C (Q7) is the finish to the joseki, but he is playing a handicap game and wants to keep sente.

It is too early for an invasion at B.

Since there are no unstable groups the focus should be on the wide open areas, although I might think the left side is a better approach as it is more undeveloped at the bottom than the upper right.]

[qo:A][pm:E][qq:F][nc:G]C[Calvin: I chose this, but I'm not sure it's the best.  Other choices I considered might be to seal off the corner with by exchanging A for B or try to exploit the aji in white's position by wedging at C immediately.  Simplying extending at D would be the simple way, I guess.  I would like some suggestions here.


Exchanging A for B is a normal part of the joseki and could have been played earlier. However, since white never played E he may not now play B in response to A. It would turn X into a heavy stone instead of a light flexible stone. Currently X can be attached to the group by E, given up, or help as an invasion at F. Playing B means he has to keep the two stones and that would require gote.

C is again too small a point to be concentrating on at this point in the game.

Your group at the right side is stable. It does not need additional stones. The white triangle group at Q10 is on the outside and fine. Your play at Q12 is not needed for either group, nor does it really help your square (star point) stone. Further it does not apply pressure on the white G stone (O17), so he gets sente out of this play. Therefore, I don't think it is the best move.

D helps the right side group only again, and is very similar.

See the variation for the suugestion.];W[qp]LB[lq:A]C[I think this is too small and too early. Maybe later he would have prefered to approach at A (M3).]

(;B[ld]TR[ph][qh]LB[kc:A][pc:B]C[Calvin:I am not sure about this pincer.  It is kind of impulsive.


No, it is not such a good pincer. Jump ahead to Move 31 real quick. The pincer stone ended up way too close to the wall you built. The pincer should have been farther to the left. (Not to mention what a waste that Q12 stone was)

Look at the variation for white on the next move.

A is a better pincer, although I don't think that is the best move on the board.

B could be an even better move. It takes the corner, makes good use of the triangle stones (so they don't go to waste), and requires a gote response by white,  leaving you with sente.

B is probably the best first move, followed by a bigger play elsewhere, look at the variation.]

MA[ph]C[I hope you see this as bad for black. The X stone you played became completely wasted, and the pincer stone is way too close to your wall.]
;B[fc];W[id]
(;B[cf]SQ[pe][pd][pc][oc][ob]LB[cc:B][fe:A]C[Calvin:It retrospect, I now think jumping at A might make the best use of black's thickness with the P17 wall.   This double approach is a normal move, but doesn't consider that.  Thoughts?   Invading at B doesn't look good for black here, I think.



Jumping at A is best. It separates the white stones, and you can easily make a base. See the variation.

B is not good. See the variation.];W[fd];B[cc]LB[gd:A]C[Probably should hane at A (G16) first, right?

Yes, probably.];W[ec];B[cd];W[gc]MA[nc]C[This worked out real nice for white. Very strong stable group. Blacks group on the left is low, blacks group on the white is weaker, and white has more options for its X (O17) stone.]
;B[fq]LB[gq:A]C[A would have bee better here.];W[lb]C[Too early for this.]
;B[nd]SQ[ld]C[Calvin: This is the honte move, but maybe it is not necessary here because the group is not likely to be attacked due to the Q12 group nearby.  Perhaps I should have treated the M16 stone lightly and played tenuki.



No this is the best move.];W[nb];B[dj];W[bo]C[Calvin: The invasion is expected.]

No];W[el];B[dm]LB[jp:A]C[This peep may be an aji-keshi.  Maybe I should have just played simply at A.

Its not aji-keshi because you don't have a stone to have aji to begin with =). However, you could probably hold off right now and play A instead.]
;W[ek];B[mn]LB[jp:A]C[A moyo move, but this could be too greedy.   I think maybe 'A' sufficient for black?

(;B[hq]SQ[rp][qp][qn][po][on][ol][pk][pj][pi]LB[jo:A]C[The direction is questionable.  Black seems overconcentrated in the lower left.   Maybe a cap at A (K5) would be better?  Then black could aim at attacking the marked white group later, which does not yet have two eyes.  Just a thought?

I don't think the cap would work well here. See the variation.]

(;W[sl]MA[rl]C[Actually, this is a mistake. See the variation for black for defense, and the variation for white for the correct move.

Do you remember your X stone? What did it gain?




Overall:

 Too often you wanted to concentrate on small moves in the opening, when much bigger ones were available. You don't have to always attack your opponent, you can give him a little territory.

Stop pushing through just because there is an opening. Pushing like you are should have a specific purpose such as cutting. If your not going to cut, it usually helps your opponent. You lose a liberty and options down the road. Your oppent often gains strength.


I hope the comments were helpful.
