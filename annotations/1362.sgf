AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Pieter: hello Chris

I was hoping
you'd be able to review and give help to both of us for strategy. I won,
but I wanted to fine-tune my whole-board strategy. Comments for both
sides would be appreciated.

Thank you for your time,

Chris];W[nq];B[pn]C[Pieter: answering high is good and more consistent with your handicap stones than answering at r6. After Q6, b normally has to play around r10 to avoid the peep

csh: I know that answering high allows
the peep at R8, but I thought the Q16 stone would help my pincer. I know
White likes to make that double-approach in handicap games.]
;W[gp];B[dn]C[Pieter: this move is good, D7 would be unusual. Another possibility is the attacking move of k4 (but dangerous in a handicap game)

csh: It seemed like a decent answer. I don't like the shape of playing D7.]
;W[ql];B[qj]C[Pieter: your thinking is correct. R10 is severe, R11 also possible

csh: I wanted to limit the options of the R8 stone, and then run with the Q4 group afterwards.]
;W[ol];B[nn]
(;W[rn]
(;B[rp]LB[oq:B][or:A]C[Pieter: i don't like this move, there's something wrong with the shape (double peeps). Furthermore, you should try to attack and this move only puts some pressure on w's r8 group, not on w's bottom.

csh:
Again, I thought this would hem the white group in. Other spectators suggested P2 or P3 instead. What do you think?]
;W[qh]C[Pieter: looks like a white overplay to me. B has to split the 2 white groups and w has too many weak groups. Another possible black play is r14. See vars.]

(;B[oj]C[Pieter: w can connect and that's the reason the jump is not good.

csh: I didn't mind jumping, since I knew I could connect with the wedge.]
;W[rj]C[Pieter: good: connect forces];B[qk];W[rk];B[pl];W[pm]
;B[pk];W[qm];B[om]C[Pieter: w has sente now, i think (around) k4 is very big move]

(;W[nl]C[Pieter: w is playing on your bad shape (the q9 stones and the double peep at p5 is also annoying) so i think it is possible although too early

csh: I thought this fight favored Black.];B[qi]C[Pieter: no need to play this move]
;W[ri];B[ph]C[Pieter: see var]
(;W[qg];B[oq]LB[pg:A]C[Pieter: Q13 huge!!!! If w goes one more, then b does the same. Connecting your forces and making a complete wall is very big. P3 bad, for w this stone is light: the action is in the centre now.

csh: They commented that Q13 was more urgent. Should I have pushed more?]
;W[np]C[Pieter: lower right group has a lot of bad shape, also the peep of p5 is dangerous for b after the p3, p4 exchange.

dokuganryu [3k\]: bad shape, lower right
chayashida [7k\]: nah, it's alive
dokuganryu [3k\]: but difficult to defend
dokuganryu [3k\]: bad aji
dokuganryu
[3k\]: may cost a gote move];B[jd]C[Pieter: again p13 is huge, if u play there, the w p8 stones are in good position to attack the p10 group.

csh: I thought I could settle the lower
right, so I wanted to play a "big" point. This was also fueled by a bit of
bravado. :)];W[pg]C[Pieter: good move!

csh: After white turned, I realized this didn't work with my san-ren-sei.]
;B[oh]C[Pieter: see var]
(;W[nc]C[Pieter:there is a better alternative for o17, see vars. O17 not that bad because w is strong on the other side.

csh: What do you think about the direction of this invasion?]

(;B[oc]C[Pieter: going for the outside is bigger. remember that the w's r13 group is very strong. With p17 you attack w, better just play o 16 and play the outside (see var)

csh: I couldn't read out the split at P15, so I just thought I'd secure the corner.]
;W[nd];B[of]C[Pieter: not good i think, w can cut by playing p 13, making an attack on b's centre group possible again

csh: This looks odd, but I thought the sacrifice made R15 sente later.]
;W[og];B[ng]
(;W[nf]C[Pieter: now one can see that the p 14 is not good (but it started with the p 17 move). Cutting on the other side looks better

dokuganryu [3k\]: be careful!
dokuganryu [3k\]: strange stuff abounds

csh: Actually, looking here, i don't know what I'd do if White cut on the other side. It looks dangerous...]
;B[nh];W[oe]C[Pieter: very good for w, now n6 huge for both players

csh: This was what I expected.];B[qe]C[csh: Is this sente? I thought my corner was alive after this.]
;W[pf]
(;B[cj]C[Pieter: first: is the upper right safe? (see var). Second: n6 looks good (see other var). Third: c10 also ok.

csh:
I wanted to take another big point. Again, they thought that pushing at the
bottom of the board was also big. I purposely left the bottom alone, though.
I thought if I pressed against White, he could attack the corner. The way
the board stands, though, I think I have a counter attack if he attacks my
corner.]
(;W[fc];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[cc];B[ec]C[Pieter: e17 good since the c10 is low and you connect with the k 16 stone. Making a wall (and moyo) facing the c10 stone is not so good since you have w's shoulder hit (d11 and D9)

csh: I sort of changed
my mind here. I thought that the top was more important than the left. They
said that this was a problem with my direction, though. I wasn't sure...
I didn't feel comfortable leaving K16 and then worrying about the center
black group as well...];W[be];B[gc]C[Pieter: normally f18 if there is a stone around k16. In this case, one has the aji of w f18 and  w h17. g17 is played when b doesn't have the k16 stone.]
;W[cg];B[cd]C[Pieter: this move is aji keshi in my eyes, no need to play. Is c18 important now?? B has given the corner away and now he wants it back....

csh: I thought this forcing exchange would allow me to play C18.]
;W[bd];B[cb]C[Pieter: bad: n6, e3, defendig q16 better];W[bb]
;B[db]C[Pieter: b loses sente here!];W[dl]C[Pieter: i don't think it is aji keshi, it is just the wrong place for an invasion (C8 is normal). W k4, defending the lower side is biggest (also n6 is big).   csh: I don't like this move. I think it's aji keshi.]
;B[cl]C[Pieter: good];W[jp]C[Pieter: w switches her mind and play k4. Indeed, now d8 is aji keshi

dokuganryu [3k\]: it's all in the timing
dokuganryu [3k\]: :-)
chayashida [7k\]: i was looking there... :)
dokuganryu [3k\]: heheh];B[lq]C[Pieter: b E3 or n6 better. Does m3 work? Well, it is annoying anyway :-)

dokuganryu [3k\]: well, you have to play somewhere else now

csh:
This was sort of a bluff. I knew it made things hard for White, but I couldn't
read it all out. Connecting under would be big, as would jumping out.]
;W[lp];B[nr]C[dokuganryu [3k\]: I must somehow counteract your closure
dokuganryu [3k\]: grrr
chayashida [7k\]: closure?
dokuganryu [3k\]: corner

csh: I wanted to secure the corner. I think it's sente now, too.]
;W[mr];B[or];W[kq]C[Pieter: l3 looks strange at first sight but i guess it is ok. M2 works but is much too early.

csh: I read out that M2 works, but I didn't know what to do with the O6 stones...]
;B[ln]C[Pieter: see var]
(;W[kn];B[lo];W[lr];B[ko]C[dokuganryu [3k\]: you forced me to correct my shape]
;W[jo]C[chayashida [7k\]: bigger game than the bottom...];B[km]
;W[jn]C[Pieter: i don't understand your opponent's comment

dokuganryu [3k\]: yes, but your plan is now obvious :-)

csh:
BTW, what's your take on "being obvious?" My feeling is that I shouldn't
play go like poker. My opponent like being able to conceal his motives.]
;B[dq]C[Pieter: good, e3 also good
Pieter: i am still worried about your upper right, maybe w has to try something there

dokuganryu [3k\]: good timing there];W[cm];B[dm];W[ck];B[bl]

;W[jk];B[ef];W[eg];B[df]C[Pieter: aji keshi? maybe the cut at f13 is possible]

;B[fo];W[go];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[fk]C[Pieter: END OF COMMENTS
Pieter: final remark:   for black:
1) learn to think in weak and strong groups. This will help you how to attack white in this kind of handicap game.
2) b should study shape, i suggest 'Suji and Anti-suji of Go' of Sakata Eio. You will learn a lot with this book.

for w:
although it is an handicap game, i think w creates too many weak groups. It is better to slowly build and win in the endgame than to attack bravely and praying that b will defend wrongly.]

chayashida [7k\]: just don't connect...

(;B[ci];W[bh];B[qn]C[dokuganryu [3k\]: not paying attnetion]
;W[rm];B[ik]TR[lj][lk][ll][lm]C[csh: I carefully misread a nifty damezumari of the marked white stones. :)]
;W[ij];B[hj];W[hk];B[il]C[csh:
This was to cause more trouble. White had to respond from what I could tell,
so I thought I got free aji out of my bad move. :)];W[jj];B[ii]

csh:
I was trying to save a point at D8, and threaten to capture at E12. I didn't
think I could get H12 and C12 to get two points. I thought E10 made E12 and
F10 miai for one point at D8.];B[fr];W[pe];B[qd];W[eh];B[fl]
