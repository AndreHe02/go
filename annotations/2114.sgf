C[Comments by Azazel, bixbyr@umail.ucsb.edu];B[qe];W[ed]C[Somehow I am not very sure how to deal with a 5-4 opening.]
;B[pq];W[dq];B[pi]LB[qk:A][jd:B]C[This is an odd move. It is too close to your upper right corner, and doesn't have enough of a relation to the bottom right. A move such as 'a' might strike a better balance (if you are familiar with the chinese opening, you will recognize the signficance of 'a' for the bottom corner). Alternatively, black could play a big point such as 'b']
;W[od];B[pc];W[pf]C[This is a strange, non-joseki move. Black answers correctly]
;B[qf];W[oc];B[pd];W[kc]LB[ke:A][md:B][cd:C]C[The direction of play now is on the top side. With L17, white is trying to make the top into a large framework. Black should not wait to enclose a corner (not to mention r5 is focusing too much on just one side). B 'a', W 'b', B 'c' is a natural way to do this, though it is not the only sequence. The idea of playing 'a' first is that you make white defend before invading and allowing white to become thickner. If you invaded first, white might be more agressive than playing 'b']
;B[qo];W[jp];B[do];W[cm]LB[cq:A][en:B]C[I am not sure how to deal with this pincer. I thought it was only applicable for hoshi point (w d4, b d6, w c8)



Az: This is a standard pincer, old as dirt and still going strong. Black has to choose between trying to live in the corner (with 'a') or move out into the center to leave options open ('b'). There are other moves, but these are the two most common ones.



In this case, with W k4, 'a' would build thickness in a direction that would be useful to white, so I think 'b' would be a good move]
;B[cp]C[Very bad! Just makes white stronger without gaining anything for you. Now instead of being able to potentially threaten the corner, you've just made it strong. This is a big 'thank you' move.]
;W[cq];B[ci]LB[em:A]C[The concept is ok, but since you made the corner stronger, when white plays 'a', you are under attack, not the other way around. It is difficult to find a good move for black here]
;W[ce]C[Mistake by white, see previous comment];B[cg]LB[em:A]
C[It would be more effective to play around 'a' to try to close in the W c7 stone, since as long as it's free, black is weak]
;W[em];B[fo];W[fq];B[hp]LB[ho:A][gp:B]C[This is an overplay. 'a' is the correct move, white can play 'b' to cut this way (since W has k4)]
;W[mp]C[This makes no sense];B[iq];W[jq];B[gq];W[fp];B[go];W[pp]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[op];W[np];B[po];W[or];B[ok];W[om];B[pm];W[ol]
;B[pl];W[nk];B[on];W[oj];B[pj]LB[pk:A]C[Mistake: should be 'a' instead. That way white has many cutting points, and your profit is equally secure. Allowing a ponnuki where you have an easy alternative is never good form]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[nn];B[oi]LB[gl:A]C[Too small. Black needs to defend his potentially weak group on the lower side by playing 'a'. Since white is weak, black can attack and defend at the same time. The right side isn't urgent]
;W[ni];B[ok]C[This only helps white fix his wall, there is no purpose to this move]
;W[nj];B[nm];W[nl];B[no]C[This is rather blunt. B can't break through, only making white stronger. Better to play elsewhere altogether]
;W[mn];B[mo];W[lo];B[oo];W[lp];B[nh];W[mh];B[mm];W[ln];B[ll]
C[This is very unreasonable. B cannot save these stones without being pushed all over the place and giving white even more thickness. Black must think about the consequences of doing this before hand.]
;W[ng];B[oh];W[li];B[hl];W[jl];B[im];W[jm];B[ej]LB[dl:A]C[Too far out, leaves white room to make good shape. The peep at 'a' is severe now that white's escape route to the right is closed]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[fk]LB[ek:A]C[W 'a' would be better shape for white. If white had played there, much less likely that black will profit from the attack]
;B[ek];W[el];B[fl];W[fm];B[gl];W[ck];B[dn];W[dm];B[bj];W[bk]
;B[bn];W[bm];B[cn];W[cj];B[bi];W[di];B[fj];W[gk]LB[hj:A]C[Black 'a' is the natural move to kill white and keep everything solidly connected together]
;B[eh]C[This is the wrong cut to worry about];W[hn];B[in];W[io]
;B[ho];W[gm];B[hm]LB[hj:A]C[Pointless move. Just play 'a'];W[gn]
;B[hj];W[gj];B[gi];W[hg];B[gh];W[hc];B[dc]LB[cc:A][oe:B]C['a' is the best point to invade, though really black should play moves such as 'b' in sente first]
;W[ec];B[cd];W[bc];B[bd];W[be];B[bb];W[ad];B[cc];W[de];B[ac]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[bg];B[mc]C[This is an overplay. Too deep, better to gently reduce]
;W[nb];B[mg]C[Another overplay];W[nf];B[kk]LB[jh:A]C[Black is blindly trying to save stones without reading. All of this is unreasonable. A move like 'a' is better]
;W[jj];B[jk];W[ik];B[ij];W[il];B[hk];W[ji];B[jo]LB[hr:A]C[This weakens your position. Better to play 'a' to have miai between going left and going right for eyes]
;W[ip];B[jn];W[km];B[jr]C[This is another overplay. Black must look for eyes]
;W[ir];B[hq];W[kr];B[hr];W[js];B[fr];W[er];B[gs];W[bq];B[bp]
;W[es];B[fs];W[hs];B[is];W[cl];B[al];W[hs];B[gr]C[Black must not fill. This wastes a move. Better to let white take these stones and get two moves elsewhere. By filling you loose your chance to make a second eye, which costs you a lot of points since you have to win the capturing race against white (if you can!). Very serious mistake]
;W[eo];B[en];W[ep];B[fn];W[am];B[ak];W[an];B[ao];W[aq];B[aj]
;W[bo];B[ap];W[dp];B[co];W[gp];B[is];W[pg];B[jr];W[qg];B[ks]
;W[lr];B[jc]TR[hg][ji][jj]C[This would be a good move, if the marked stones weren't there. As it is, there isn't enough of a threat to connect back to the center]
;W[kd];B[ff];W[ge];B[ih];W[jg];B[ig];W[if];B[jh];W[kh];B[kg]
;W[jf];B[lg]C[Overplay];W[lh];B[ki];W[kj];B[lj];W[ii];B[hh]
;W[kl];B[lk];W[mf]LB[mi:A]C[Oh my...... W should have played 'a', which makes the situation a seki - until white kills the n13 stones. This is a disaster for white]
;B[lm];W[kn];B[hi];W[mi];B[ki];W[rg];B[pr]LB[rf:A]C['a' is bigger, since white can reduce your corner in sente, whereas this is gote.
