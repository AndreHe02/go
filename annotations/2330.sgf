C[Hi.

I'll try to review this game doing my best. I'll add some variations to help my explanations, but if you find them too difficult, I hope that you can learn something without them.

I'll start my comments with pajaro.];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[de];W[ee]C[pajaro: This doesn't seem very good. This means that white wants the upper side, but as Q16 is there, it isn't easy to get very much at the top.]
;B[ef];W[ed];B[df];W[cd];B[dn]C[pajaro: This doesn't feel good. Black tries to extend from the top, but that group isn't that strong. White can invade and play a splitting attack. Moreover, with a stone at C4, it is more natural to attack (or defend) at E4, E3 or similar.]
;W[cl]C[pajaro: As D6 shouldn't be there, I don't know whether this is really a good pincer.]
;B[cm]C[pajaro: Don't touch what you attack.];W[ch];B[dl];W[ck]
C[pajaro: Black touched C8 twice. White has now a base at the left. D14 can be attacked now.]

(;B[bf]C[pajaro: Black should jump. That white group can probably defend  by itself. See var.]
;W[ep]C[pajaro: This seems ok. This defends the corner, puts pressure on D6.]
;B[co]C[pajaro: This tries to make life,  but it makes the white corner safer. Jump before securing life.]
;W[ei]C[pajaro: White feels bad. This makes things very good for the C5 black group.]
;B[fh];W[kc];B[fe];W[fd];B[ge];W[gd];B[bp]C[pajaro: Good for black. The corner is gone now.]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[hq];B[cr];W[dr];B[br]
(;W[dp]C[pajaro: I think E3 is better shape. See var.];B[bm]

(;W[dk]C[pajaro: E9 better. Play lightly! See var.];B[el];W[fi]
C[pajaro: white tends to play contact moves a lot. This must be avoided many times, as it can help the opponent.]
;B[dh];W[di];B[eh]C[pajaro: This is a wasted move. White won't play there, as it is unuseful.]
;W[bi]C[pajaro: This is the same that black did before. It tries to secure life. But white can easily escape! You should try to avoid danger, so you won't have to live this way.]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[hi];W[fk];B[ic];W[id];B[jd];W[jc];B[hd];W[ie]
;B[he];W[hc];B[ib];W[hb];B[pj]C[pajaro: Black takes a big point on the right. Until now, nearly all the game was played on the left. Usually, you should play on all the board.]

(;W[if]C[pajaro: Not needed. White can capture j18 whenever. Better have a look at what black is building on the right. Play O4, for example.]
;B[ke]C[pajaro: This is bad for black. K16 is worthless, as white can capture j18. It doesn't cut, it doesn't build, it takes no territory... White should take a big point now.]
;W[gg];B[hg];W[hf];B[ff];W[nc]C[pajaro: O3-O4 is bigger. White plays too close to his own strength.]
;B[gh]C[pajaro: Black connects to avoid any danger. White should take the initiative.]
;W[ig]C[pajaro: No. H13 is useless. G13 is useless. Forget them.]
;B[lc];W[jb];B[mc]
(;W[od]C[pajaro: This makes black stronger. O17 isn't important. Locally, I think white should invade at R17. See var.]
;B[pc]
(;W[nd]C[pajaro: NO! An empty triangle. This is very bad shape. Those 2 stones are already connected. They are becoming a burden, but if you want ot save them, just jump.]
;B[le];W[nf];B[pf];W[of]C[pajaro: Another contact move that connect connected stones. You opponent is getting very strong.]
;B[pg];W[oh];B[lg];W[mh];B[kh];W[ph];B[og];W[ng];B[qh];W[pe]
C[pajaro: Black should say thank you. White is helping him to complete his territory.]
;B[qe];W[oe];B[qg]C[pajaro: Thanks to Q15, now white can't reduce the side at R11.]
;W[oj]
(;B[pi]C[pajaro: You should stay ahead of white. R9 better.]
;W[oi];B[pk];W[ii];B[jh];W[ih];B[kj]C[pajaro: White should play H10 and try to kill.]
;W[li];B[jj];W[ok]C[pajaro: white is pushing from behind. The most natural for black now is Q8 or even P8, getting more and more. White doesn't realize how he's helping black.]
;B[hj]C[pajaro: lost chance.];W[ij];B[hk];W[ik];B[kl];W[lk]
;B[kk];W[pl]C[pajaro: Good!];B[ql];W[qk];B[qj];W[qm];B[rk];W[om]
C[pajaro: That's the end of the growing right for black.];B[pn]
;W[pm];B[ll];W[mk];B[nq];W[kq];B[jp];W[jq];B[ip];W[iq];B[fl]
;W[ek];B[gk];W[bl];B[il];W[jl];B[im];W[jk];B[jm]
(;W[mp]C[pajaro: Why? Does white want to cut at M7? Is this a ladder-breaker? Black could capture a white stone at M7 without a ladder. See var.]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[gp];W[hp];B[ho];W[gq];B[go];W[km];B[ln]C[pajaro: good!]
;W[kn];B[ko];W[jn]C[pajaro: white should realize that those stones are dead. Adding stones only helps black.]
;B[in];W[lo];B[lm];W[mn];B[np]C[pajaro: This doesn't add very much. Better R6.]
;W[qq]C[pajaro: Too deep. This should die.];B[qp];W[rp];B[ro]
