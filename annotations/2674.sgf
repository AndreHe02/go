;W[cp];B[qk]LB[ep:A]C[JL: in my opinion it is not only boring to play "book" fuseki, but also playing those may slow down one's progress as a player.  Thus, I'd played 'A' myself instead of going for chinese fuseki.]
;W[fp]C[JL: this is of course an interesting move. It looks like white is planning to go all-out for outside influence, though the top left stone is a bit oddly placed for such strategy.]
;B[de]C[JL: usually when one plays the chinese fuseki, one would like to form a double wing by playing either on the top or the borttom side. Usually IMHO it is better to extend from the 3-4-stone, to the bottom star point or so, but now I think 'A' would be best such move. Another idea is to play a probe against the white shimari with the idea of selecting the line of play depending on white's answer. Still, the black move played is ok.]
;W[cg];B[cc]C[JL: I've never really liked this attachment though it starts a joseki variation. I would keep as many options open as possible and would probbaly play the kosumi of 'A' instread]
;W[cb];B[cd];W[eb]
(;B[fd]C[JL: black deviates from  the joseki.]
(;W[fc]C[JL: this is bad as it forces black to enforce his weakness (variation)]

(;B[ff]LB[gd:A]C[JL: black misses his chance and tries to play lightly for some reason. Now for example white hane of 'A' is very nice in the future. First he'll protect the lone stone though.]
;W[dj]C[Not good for B

JL: I agree, though the game is far from over. White is  still thin on the side.]

(;B[jp]C[JL: I am not sure I like this move. White 'A' looks juicy now making territory while threathning the stone black just played. On the other hand black is getting ready to do something about the white moyo which is good.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[po]C[JL: clearly an overplay. white must make a base for the stones he just played.]
;B[np];W[nf]LB[qi:A]C[JL: still it'd been proper to play 'A'.]
;B[qh]MA[po]LB[ph:A][qp:B]C[JL: too low - one point higher is better (A). Now white can more easily lean on the black stone to make himself safe. Also it would have been better to attack the marked stone instead (B?). This way you'd make territory while attacking and if white decides to run with the marke stone, the marked black stone would become stronger naturally weakening the other three white stones.]
;W[ph];B[pi]LB[qi:A]C[JL: better to just play 'A' as then you may get sente and will have a more solid shape.]
;W[oh]C[JL: really pity to let white get such a great shape here.]
;B[qo]MA[pi][qk][qh]C[JL: no, this is very bad. when you attack, touching what you aim for is usually bad as it helps the opponent to settle tactical situation lightly. Also by touching the stone you may make the marked stones weaker by giving white some kind of shape.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pn]LB[ol:B][ql:A]C[JL: extremely heavy move. white is creating a heavy group black will enjoy attacking. Instead white should have played smething light, either 'A' or something like 'B'. I like 'B' myself as it aims to 'A' and escape.]
;B[qg];W[rf];B[ok]MA[qn][pn][po]C[I do not know how to handle this kind of play with weak groups.

JL: then maybe you should avoid making weak groups for yourself :) Anyhow in this position it is the marked stones which are by far the weakest stones on board and the best target for attack so black should have no trouble.]
;W[nm];B[mk];W[lm];B[kk];W[lp]MA[pq][np]LB[re:B][jm:A]C[JL: the only thing worrying me as black woudl be the weakness of the keima (marked black stones).  As black I would now play 'A' trying to confine white and would aim to use the thickness generated to invade the white moyo and to attack the other weak white group by playing something like 'B'.]
;B[mo]
(;W[jm];B[lo]C[JL: black is really happy to play this, though creating territory here now is a bit heavy (=inflexible) way of playing.]
;W[ko];B[kp];W[lq];B[nq];W[nl]C[JL: white is still very heavy.]
;B[nk];W[kn];B[hq];W[gq]C[JL: this kosumi leaves quite a bit aji.]
;B[hp];W[hm]
(;B[re]C[Trying to make points while hurting white base.

JL: idea is right,];W[oi]C[JL: slow and aji-keshi.]
(;B[pj];W[ri];B[qi];W[rj]C[JL: white forgot that he is not attacking but defending.]

(;B[rk];W[rg]C[JL: way too slow - black should tenuki and attack this group frorm the other side - white only has at most one eye.]
;B[rh]C[JL: too slow. you take away one eye in gote but you don't really attack white much - try to not kill, but to force opponent live small.]
;W[sh]LB[mh:A]C[JL:  way too small and slow.  Bith players are giving each other chances now. Maybe black should now play 'A' or so to strenghten himself while weakening white.]
;B[pg];W[og];B[oe];W[of];B[le]C[JL: this can be dangerous. the big center black group has no eyes and is running towards white influence.]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[lg];B[jj];W[jg];B[je]C[JL: dangerous. Also lots of aji in the top - black can not hope to turn it all into territory.

JL: I've not commented much on the followin battle as it is rather complicated - maybe in the future you should try to make the games tactically as simple as you can and concentrate on proper strategy instead of tactics.]

;W[gm];B[gl]C[Now the situation is very difficult for B

JL: all you need is two little eyes. The more groups with two tiny eyes you tend to get in your games, the more you need to think about proper strategy.]
;W[ji];B[cj];W[di];B[dl];W[cm]
(;B[qj]C[JL: this move serves no purpouse. Also the variation offers better local variation.]
;W[sg]LB[sk:A]C[JL: usually this is proper way to connect, but as now 'A' is sente for black he should have made the other connection.]
;B[dm];W[cn];B[ki];W[mi];B[cl];W[ci]
(;B[bk]MA[nm][pn]C[JL: the variation would live unconditionally. Remember that keima can always be cut - of course you need thickness to back up the cutting in situations like this. And the marked stones definately form a keima shape. To play this you need to read a bit though.]
;W[bj];B[bi]C[JL: no way white can win this ko, but he'll gain someplace else.]

;W[jr]C[I'm not good at handling KO.

I thought that I had no big threats.

JL: you have a million local threaths, also you can live unconditionally as shown earlier.]
;B[aj]C[JL: You gave white too much here.];W[hr];B[mr];W[lr]
;B[hd];W[kd]C[KInd of move I do not know how to handle.

JL: well, you've been too greedy on top anyhow and now you're rather thin which is a source for all kinds of problems. You can expect maybe 15-20 pts on the top at most even though it looks much bigger.]
;B[ke];W[ic]C[JL: white is blundering big time.];B[hc];W[hb]
;B[gb];W[jb];B[gc];W[mc];B[bb]C[JL: whatever black lost on the top right, he gained back here with interest.]
;W[ba];B[ab];W[fb];B[ga];W[da];B[fa];W[dd];B[ed];W[md];B[qc]
LB[nc:A]C[JL: paranoid move. also the wrong spot locally as S17 would be better endgame wise. still, probably it's best to play 'A'.]
;W[me];B[dp];W[dq];B[cq];W[do];B[bp];W[ep];B[cr]C[B is alive. I know this shape.
I feel a little better as regards points...

JL: this is a standard shape good to know. Very useful in actualty games as you've probbaly noticed. Regarding the score, try to count not single, but double points during the game - it is much faster and very accurate (always count the minimum for both players for all the areas). This is the last comment (I think :) of the game.]

JL: in life and death stuggles, especially early in the game, try not to kill the weak groups, but instead force him to live small and then use the thickness you gain to your advantage.]
