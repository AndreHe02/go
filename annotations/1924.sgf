C[I was playing white in this game and for a while I thought things were going well. After black invaded the left side I probably didn't handle the situation well, so please comment on that as well as the fuseki in general.

I have inserted some questions later in the game.

Thanks.

Review by John Rae  3kyu UK

Generally white played cramped in the fuseki
Played thinly on the right
Picked the wrong invasion which gave black strength
Often gave up sente
And as a result had to fight to live small
Took a risk leaving a 20 point group for black to kill for most of the middle & end game

From this game I think you should make more effort to keep sente and consider a whole board view.

 I suggest you study how you/your opponent can use influence to attack thin positions. You do not judge the value of influence correctly.]

(;W[dp];B[dq];W[eo];B[fp];W[fo];B[gp];W[dj]C[JR: White needs to play something like this to make the wall gained by the previous moves do something useful - but it gives Black sente. Which suggests to me the previous moves were bad, see earlier variation

Black looks to be expanding all over the board while white is concentrated in (part of) the left side.]
;B[fc]
(;W[df]C[JR: This makes white look even more cramped.

I'd have tried one of the variations to build a large moyo.]
;B[hd]
(;W[pj]C[I was quite happy with this so far as the left hand side looked pretty good for me. Any comments on that?

JR: Well black is spread around better. The left side can still be invaded and black has top and bottom, plus the opportunity to now develop and attack this stone.

I'd say the solid territory at the bottom gives black the edge, but you have to be happy with invading the left to see it that way.]
;B[qh];W[pn];B[np];W[jq]C[JR: This feels premature to me.

Its also picking the hardest way.  Black is safe/strong either side of this invading stone So its asking for trouble. The 2 stones to the right are very weak and R11 is looking to play under them to remove eyes on the side. 

The odds are black will get a strong position with which to tear them apart.

Perhaps OK later but now I'd either develop my group on the right or invade on the top where black is less strong]

;B[hp];W[fr];B[eq]
(;W[fq]C[Even though black now has a huge wall I think it was worth the invasion. Is that right?

JR: Well I don't think you needed F3, in fact you seemed alive a bit ago so keeping on gave more strength to black than necessary. 

The stones on the right are in big trouble now, black's influence should be worth much much more than the invasion.]

(;B[cc]C[JR: Now is the time for black to use that wall to ravage the right side]

(;W[cd]C[Shoul I have cut instead at D17?];B[dc]
(;W[ec]C[JR: The trouble with white pushing in is that black's defence is atari, white has to connect so black gets sente]
;B[eb];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[fd];B[gc];W[gd]C[JR: Again this make no real threat so black can ignore it and take sente.]

(;B[ql]
(;W[qk]C[This immediately felt like a stupid move... I suppose Q8 would have been correct. Is that right?

JR: with the 2 stones being on the 4th line you are not going to capture the invader and live on the side. therefore Q8 to connect your stones seems much better. They will be adrift under the black wall but should be able to live.]
;B[pl]C[JR Black immediately tries to split white into 2 groups, which will mean that at least one of them will die( probably)]

(;W[nn]C[JR: The other group is easire to run with but Black gets a huge corner if you just sacrifice Q6. It looks a long way to run under that black cliff.

JR: Yes alive but look at the territory black gained while chasing you. black also has a stronger central position from which to invade your moyo]

;B[oa];W[sb]C[S19 was left open for a long time but I was sure he overlooked it so I risked not to play there until much later.

JR: Its a bad idea to risk the opponent not noticing, at any time you could lose the whole corner, which is huge.

I had the feeling that until now I was ahead (assuming the upper right group lives).

JR:  - an even better reason to make sure of that corner group before black notices :)]
;B[dl]C[Here comes trouble. At the end of this invasion the left hand side is mostly gone. Should I have been more defensive?]

(;W[fm]C[I was worried about my loose group on the 6-7-8 line...

JR: So you must have been thankful black didn't attack it first instead of playing D8?]

(;W[gk]C[JR: you are pushing black into your propsective terrirory. If you don't kill these invaders you will have harmed yourself. If you're not certain of killing F11 would have been better in my view]
