(;B[cg]C[I suppose that the 52th, at C13, was not sutiable, for, first, it's too small to make compound of black side; second, without stop white's stone (B18) would largely reduces the black side. However, I can't preceive a better place that can attack white and make black side larger.
Hope instructor can help me to make it clear what place is a better place. (For instance, is J5 a good place? because it looks sternly like an attack; however,  seemly too close to white side and have no idea weather would help him more be concrete his place to have impacting black side between line M and P.)

**********************

I agree that C13 is too close to thickness, and that there isn't much territory to be gained because of white B18.

How about G10? This makes the moyo imposing and puts some subtle pressure on the bottom white group. 

Perhaps though it would be better to attack the white group directly. J5 is a good peep, but it then needs to be followed up with attacking moves from above. Also, keep in mind that the N4 group is weak - if white plays M2 for example, it will have to run.

It might be best to simply play L2 now, assure the connection for the N4 group and then commence the attack in confidence.

-Dave Felcan];W[tt]C[White was ahead in this game in the opening, but failed in two major ways. The first major error was the attack on the bottom right, which was poorly executed - it was the wrong place (the left side star point would be a better place to play for example) and resulted in weak group that became a major liability.

White's second mistake was attacking on the second line on the top. As a result, black got thickness where he needed it, in the path of the weak white group. Black's attack on the weak white group was well done and got the M5 group out of danger and further established his territorial framework on the left. White's attempts to minimize this large area were failures, resulting in more weak groups requiring care, rather than destroying black territory. Thus Black victory.

I hope these comments were helpful.
