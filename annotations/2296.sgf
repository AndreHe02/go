C[Dear reviewer,
I've played this game on KGS with the idea in mind to make a plan during the game. During the game it seemed to me that I had the command and often sente. Though I've won with 1,5 points I thought that it had to be more because of my good feeling. I'll try to note what I had in mind with playing key stones. It would be nice if you could comment on how good my ideas about certain stones are and if the ideas are good in general (even if the stone I played didn't help much to the cause)

I'm playing as black.

Joonas Tyystj√§rvi: it seems to me that you need to focus more on shape and avoiding overconcentration in the beginning. I've added comments and variations throughout the game, I hope they help.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po];B[dd]LB[pl:B][qo:A]C[B: Believing that w's kakari wasn't really endangering my stone at Q1, I decided to take the last corner.

JT: this is certainly playable. Other choices might be A and B.]
;W[pj];B[np]C[B: With this move I tried to either attack white on the right or secure my stones by playing the next move at the bottom, depending on how white will answer

JT: I think playing here is not urgent.];W[qq]C[B: So I have to go for the bottom.]
;B[qr];W[qp];B[kq]LB[or:A]TR[pl][ql][pm][qm]C[B: This looks ok for me. B seems to have some prospects on the bottom and white on the left, about equalling each other. B has two of the remaining corners and white has sente.

JT: you really should play A first, to fix your shape. White is a bit overextended, so after A, black can aim at invading around the triangled points.]
;W[op]C[JT: For reference, this is horrible aji-keshi.];B[oq]
;W[no];B[pp]LB[mp:A]C[B: Simply stretching to N4 (A) seemed to good for white to me.

JT: I think this is too risky, since black loses a liberty here. If black simply plays A, the cutting point isn't going anywhere]
;W[oo];B[qo];W[rr];B[pr];W[ro]
(;B[mo]C[JT: this is too dangerous, see the variation.]
(;W[qn];B[mp];W[nc];B[qf]LB[nc:B][qi:C][ri:A]TR[pd]C[B: With this move I planned to either extend to S11 (A) or to attack W O17 (B) later while building a wall facing left. Maybe R11 (C) better? But it seems gote to me.

JT: I think this is the best move - if you don't play this, your triangled stone becomes too weak. C is too thin - white would respond with a double kakari.]
;W[pb]LB[kc:B][qc:A]C[B: Now I had to extend down, making the left pretty save in sente.

JT: I think here black should simply play A. It's sente against the white group, too - white must play B then. Extending on the second line towards a solid white position is too small in the beginning.]
;B[ri];W[qg]C[B: W kept bothering me. Seems not so tragic.

JT: this is not really a problem.];B[rg];W[qh];B[pg]LB[pf:C]
[rh:A][qk:B]C[B: I wanted to keep some connection to the center.

JT: this is inconsistent, and also, black's shape is bad. Black really needs A here. After that, black at least has a follow-up at B. If you really want to go for the center, C is better shape.]
;W[rh]C[JT: now black has bad shape.];B[ph];W[qi];B[pi];W[qj]
;B[ne]LB[qe:A]C[JT: too thin. White still has a good move at A.]

(;W[ld];B[ic]C[B: Since my left side seems safe for now, I wanted to threaten W's top while securing some territory on the top myself with the help of D16.

JT: this is dangerous, see the previous variations. Black's shape is not settled yet.]
;W[lf];B[fc]LB[cg:A]C[B: Since W's group isn't really in danger, I prefered to take some instant profit.

JT: this is very small. If you're going to play around here, you should at least play A, which also makes playing on the left side less interesting.]
;W[cf];B[ce]LB[fc:A]C[B: I tried to stick with my territory idea.

JT: this is good, but not for the territory, but for attacking white. This move keeps white from sliding into the corner, and since you already have A, you can pincer next.]
;W[df];B[mh]LB[di:B][fq:A]C[B: With this move I wanted to enforce my top right group. Thinking about it again it looks safe and maybe I should use sente to play somewhere else. Maybe F3 (A)

JT: making this group stronger is a good idea, but I prefer B. The reason is that this group is in no danger of actually dying yet, and black can prevent white from making a moyo while attacking if he pincers now.]
;W[dj]C[JT: now white makes a very nice moyo on the left side.]

(;B[fq]LB[dj:A][cn:B]C[B: W D10 (A) made it a bit harder for me. I played F3 because I thought that it would pretty much secure the bottom for me, while W's answer might still leave some room for an invasion somewhere on the left.

JT: I'd still prefer B, to break up white's moyo. Since the lower left black is solid, black can fight here.]
;W[eq]LB[fp:A]C[JT: this is very bad here. I think white should have played at A.]
;B[fp];W[cn]
(;B[el]LB[fm:A]C[B: W's left seemed pretty sealed, so I tried to threaten W, while building a moyo with my bottom stones.

JT: this is a good idea, but I'd prefer A for shape.];W[dl]
C[JT: black's shape is bad this way.];B[dm]LB[em:A]C[JT: I think simply at A is better shape. It also leaves some aji in white's left-side formation. This feels a bit like aji-keshi.]
;W[cl];B[eo]LB[em:A]C[B: With this move I feared that W might tenuki and play a reducing move on the left side of my moyo.

JT: this is good, as it also covers A.];W[dn];B[en];W[nf];B[of]
;W[ng];B[qc]LB[ni:A]C[B: Playing safe here.

JT: I think you should still play A, to keep the connection to the outside.]
;W[qb];B[ml]LB[ni:A]C[B: This was the move I wanted. Now it looked like B was ahead.

JT: I think black should still play A to prevent getting shut in - now white can do so in sente.]

(;W[mj];B[nj]LB[kk:A]C[B: I knew no reason for this move. But it looked very appealing to me. Maybe simply L9 (A) better?]
;W[nk];B[mk];W[mi]C[JT: this white move was vulgar, and white got a pretty bad result for it.]
;B[ni];W[lh];B[lj];W[li];B[kj]C[B: I thought that I had defended my moyo nicely.

JT: right.];W[nh];B[oc]C[B: Now I decided to totally secure my upper right group.

JT: this is right timing.];W[ob];B[nd];W[md];B[pc];W[ij]
(;B[jl]LB[ik:A][jk:B]C[B: I thought that my moyo was that large that I had to play a 'safe' passive move. Now I think that was not a good idea. Better play closer at J9 (A) or K9 (B)?

JT: black is ahead a bit (about 5 points by my count). I prefer A - I've added some variations.]
;W[il];B[im];W[hl];B[hm];W[fm];B[em];W[gm];B[gl]LB[gn:A]C[JT: simply at A is better, this is overplay.]
;W[jm]
(;B[ik]LB[gk:B][kl:A]TR[fm][gm]MA[hl][il]C[B: Here I misread BADLY because I thought this move would capture W H/J8. Better L8 (A)?

JT: how about B? It threatens to capture the two white stones and captures the two triangled ones. Black has nothing to fear inside the moyo, since the walls are extremely solid.]
;W[hk];B[gn];W[gk];B[fl];W[kl];B[jk];W[jj];B[kk];W[ki];B[lk]
;W[mm];B[km]LB[nk:A]MA[ji][hj]C[B: I think W wanted to kill with this sequence, but failed. The outcome  looked ok for B because W has left many cutting points on the outside and B can atari W O9 (A).]

(;W[ln];B[nl]C[JT: white should have played this.];W[ok];B[nm]
;W[jn];B[mn];W[lm];B[nn];W[cc]C[B: I wasn't sure if B should be able to kill this invasion.

JT: I'm not sure either, but I've added a few variations. I think not trying to kill is better for black, too - the loss of territory isn't too big.]

(;B[dc]
(;W[cb]
(;B[cd]LB[bd:A]C[B: This move looked very bad to me in terms of shape but I felt that I had to connect my stones in sente.

JT: black A looks better.];W[bd];B[be];W[ac]C[JT: this is called the tripod group. It is alive.]

(;B[bb]LB[db:A]C[JT: better just play A.];W[db];B[eb];W[ba]
;B[da];W[ab]TR[ig][jg][ih][jh][bi][ci][bj][cj]C[B: W living small in gote seemed ok for me, since B has a huge territory at the bottom. (W trying to revive K6 seemed quite unprobable)
W also has some kind of moyo around J12 but it seemed very open to me and would probably be easily reduced starting from F9 or the top.

JT: black is still ahead in actual territory, but white has quite a lot of potential territory in the triangled areas. K6 can't really live.]
;B[ah]LB[ae:C][af:B][bf:A][bg:D]C[B: In return for W living in the corner.

JT: right - this is big now, however, I'd like D more since it has better follow-up moves. Note that if white gets enough big ko threats, he can start a ko with A, B, C.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[ed];B[gd];W[ee];B[ec];W[ge];B[fj]C[B: Now it's really time to play here since the top entrance to W's moyo has become a bit narrow.]
;W[hi];B[gj]C[JT: better leave this as a ko threat.];W[hj];B[ej]

;W[bm];B[kb]LB[jb:B][lb:A]C[B: Looked big to me.

JT: could be at A. This is very big, since white could otherwise play as far as B.]

White forgot to squeeze out a last point with P12 (A).

Thank you.])
