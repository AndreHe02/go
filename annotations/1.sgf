C[I think I played a quite bad fuseki, but I'm not sure what went wrong.  So I would especially appreciate some comments about fuseki, but I'm sure there were a lot of bad moves after fuseki, too. :)

since black lost, it is easier to demonstrate his mistakes than whites.
Black created too much attackable groups, and made them too heavy by trying to immediately link up all and every of his stones.  Then he lost his chance to connect his weak groups, and one of them died.
White also didnt always take the most important points.  Following proverbs are applicable:  "even when ten stones in atari, tenuki" and "urgent points before big points".
Perhaps both players can benefit from studying the principles of attack/defense in the middlegame strategy.]
