;B[fp];W[dn];B[cf]C[A little dangerous because the 2 B seeds at lower side is very weak, see variation]

(;W[dc];B[be]TR[ch][eh]C[Better to play B17. This exchange favours B. W saves a little territory on the upper side but the two marked stones becomes weak.]

At the same time, B maintains an attacking posture on W (which still have not secure 2 eye). But there is no severe attacking method right now as B can't seal W in. Thus, at this point, B can consider other moves while keeping a threathening eye on W lower right group. I would choose to play C14 at this point.]
