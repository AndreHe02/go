I'm not aware of any big mistakes in this game, in fact I got
a kill and my opponent didn't, but somehow I still lost by 18.5
points - a large loss.

I suspect I'm doing something wrong in how I handle the center,
but I'm not sure.

Any comments at all on where I've played a smaller move than
what's available elsewhere, would be most appreciated.

Reviewer's comments:

Your play in this game is too leisurely/passive (not agressive/forceful
enough).  You appeared at times to be pushed around; other times
you simply answer W's moves (e.g. moves 50-55).

Just because you kill a group does not mean victory.  I may kill
a 20 stone group of my opponent's but if he has sacrificed it
for 60+ points of territory, then obviuosly it's not a fair exchange.

In the game, you killed an invading group in territory that was
already yours, but W managed to make territory in the center
out of nowhere - so he comes out ahead and I think that's where
the game was lost.];B[dq];W[dd];B[qp];W[pd];B[co];W[jq];B[nq]
