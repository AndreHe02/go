C[I was black in this game and lost by 24.5 points. I made two
obvious mistakes that I myself can see now. These would have
turned the game in my favor but at least one of them was really
white's mistake which I failed to cash in on.

In general I am mostly interested in fuseki where I'm clueless.
I don't know for instance when and how I should have reduced
white's top moyo which became a big territory. (This may not
be a fuseki issue but it's not counting liberties either.)

I placed my other particular questions within the game record.

Thanks for reviewing.

You ask about fuseki but the game seems to have little fuseki
play in it. Your opening few moves are original and I think require
a moyo building strategy by you. You seem to quickly go for territory
which redusces the potential of your opening moves. I would say
practice a fes times with this opening seeing what happens of
you try to create large frameworks. You wait for your oponent
to invade and then attack the invasion, not to kill the invading
stones but to build territory and build influence while attacking
white. Only try to kill white when you think you can do it!!

 Quite quickly the game you play goes into middle game

Hope my comments help,

Robin];B[od]C[It is interesting that I looked in a number of fuseki dictionaries
and no fuseki seems to start with this move!

So it is an original beginning];W[pp];B[de]C[I like to experiment with not-so-average openings.

It is still a new fuseki. As you have played close to p16 I would
expect you to be looking at creating some sotr of moyo];W[cp]
;B[qj]C[You create the start of a moyo .. good move I think]
;W[jc]TR[je][dk]C[I think I would prefer d17 as r10 helps p16 but there is nothing
with d17

To keep up the moyo strategy you could play at marked places

K15 makes white play low and black tries to get large moyo in
the centre];B[qd];W[ec]C[It is not a good idea to attach to a weak stone as it helps white
.. see variation]

Ti me this seems alright];W[fc];B[cc]C[Black gets a good shape]

it when it suits];B[ep]C[I think this is a good move];W[dn]

but of course it's not that simple.

I like how black plays here .. it looks to me that black is ahead
at this point];W[np]TR[oj][lc][cq]C[Looking here .. I think black has a number of possibilities 

M17 is a sente move whereas p10 is a thick move and maybe a bit
slow... I would plat m17];B[oj]C[Would extending to M17 or N17 be better?]
;W[lm]C[Now m17 .. white plays too slow];B[pg];W[ob]C[I have no idea what the correct defense against this is now that
I let it happen.

Remeber that there is the weakness ion the shape H17 so p18 is
too loose because of the weakness. Black can attack here especially
because he is so thick down the right corner .. or even black
could tenuki]

sure it wouldn't have been worth for him to tenuki and lose a
couple of stones
