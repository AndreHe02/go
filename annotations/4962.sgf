C[Dear reviewer,
this is a game played on dgs. I played black and won  with 1,5 points, but only because my opponent made three almost passing moves. Therefore I presume are many possibilities for better playing in my game.
Thanks in advance for reviewing the game.

-----

Alex: This was an interesting game to review.  Thanks for adding your own comments--if you keep on reviewing your own games carefully like this, you will surely improve (and it is also helpful for the reviewer).  I hope that I can help a little bit also.

My first impression is that you tenuki too often, leaving a lot of weak shapes behind.  I will point out some of these moments as I go through the game.  I think you did well in both the opening and the endgame, but the part in between can be greatly improved!

See also my comments after move 152.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[po]
;B[dp];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qk];B[cf]LB[np:a]C[Alex: This is the first tenuki that bothers me.  This early in the game, it's hard for me to say what's correct (I'm not a fuseki expert), but you need to be aware that the shape at the bottom right is not finished, and white has some potential to attack there later on.

Personally I would play at 'a' (O4) instead of C14.  There are plenty of other possible moves too.]
;W[fc];B[dj];W[fq];B[hq]LB[ip:a][pf:b]C[Alex: Playing a pincer is a good idea: it makes your D10 stone work well.  However, notice that all your stones on the bottom are low.  I wonder if 'a' (J4) instead of H3 would be even better.]
;W[dn]C[Alex: This move, and the next few moves of white's, are rather confusing!  I think you handled it well and got a good result.]
;B[fp];W[cp];B[cq];W[gp];B[fo];W[gq];B[eq]LB[co:a]C[Alex: This feels unneccessary: it's not a point that white would want to play, so it's not urgent for black to play there?  (It's a complicated position, hard to say without deep reading.)  I wonder if 'a' (C5) is worth thinking about.]
;W[co];B[bq]C[Alex: Good move: white's stones look heavy.];W[dl]
;B[ck];W[cl]
(;B[fk]C[Until now I am very satisfied.  White has a weak group at the left. I hoped to make profit while attacking this group.

Alex: Yes, this is the right idea.  However, you can make the attack more severe by "leaning" on the white stones at the bottom first: see the variation.]
;W[ci]C[In my eyes this is an overplay. But I couldn't handle it.

Alex: Yes, it looks like an overplay to me too, and your next few moves seem just fine...]
;B[bk];W[ek];B[ej];W[fl];B[gk]C[Alex: Up to here I would say that black is winning this game.]
;W[gl];B[hl]LB[hk:a]C[Alex: I think this move leaves too many cutting points in your position; I would play 'a' (H9) instead.]
;W[gn];B[go];W[hm];B[hp]LB[mp:a][nq:b][hk:c]C[At this time I hoped that I could make a lot of territory at the bottom.

Alex: This is where you pay for your tenuki at move 11: white has the option of pressing at 'a' (N4) or 'b' (O3), so it is hard for black to make territory at the bottom.

Capturing the three white stones at G3 isn't worth very much compared to keeping the initiative in the centre.

It's hard to find exactly the right move here, but I think I would try 'c' (H9).]
;W[il];B[nc]C[I thought it makes no sense to fight in the middle because white already could escape.

Alex: Another tenuki: I think this is your worst move of the entire game!  When white captures, the balance of power in the centre is totally changed... it is essential for you to connect at H9 here.]
;W[hk]TR[bk][ck][dj][ej][fk][gk][ci]C[Alex: Now all the marked black stones look like wasted moves, and C11 has a lot of potential to cause trouble.  At this point I think white is winning.]
;B[ff]LB[dh:a][bd:b]C[This was too far.

Alex: I agree.  The safe move is 'a' (D12), but that would be too passive now.  Maybe 'b' (B16) is better.]
;W[df];B[cg]C[Alex: This feels terribly passive, but it's hard to find a better move.]
;W[ce];B[jd]TR[ci]LB[dg:a]C[Alex: This is the third tenuki.  The C11 stone is full of aji: I think you must play 'a' (D13) here.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[dh];B[bi];W[bf];B[bh];W[np]LB[mq:a][nq:b][mp:c]
C[Alex: I think this is a mistake by white.  Now 'a' (N3) looks like a good move for black, and the bottom might still turn into territory.  White should have played either 'b' (O3) or 'c' (N4) instead.]
;B[qh]C[Alex: Yet another tenuki!  This is very small in terms of territory, because white can still invade easily...]
;W[qd]LB[re:a]C[Alex: Actually, I think 'a' (S15) would be an even more severe invasion--white either gets a larger corner, or else cuts off the R12 stone.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[qc];B[ni]LB[mq:a][hc:b][ol:c]C[Alex: This move feels too vague: it puts no pressure on white, and the centre territory isn't really as big as it looks.

Other moves that I would consider instead are 'a' (N3), 'b' (H17) and 'c' (P8).

After white's mistakes at O4 and R16, the game is still close.]
;W[lh];B[ii]TR[lh]LB[kj:a][lj:b]C[Alex: Again, this is vague.  If you want to attack the white stone, you need to find something more severe.  I would choose either 'a' (L10) or 'b' (M10).]
;W[lj];B[ol];W[pm];B[lp]C[Alex: Right area, but wrong move (N3 is better).]
;W[mq];B[rr];W[rq]
(;B[pp]C[Alex: This looks like it is helping white fix up his/her shape.  See the variation.]
;W[oo];B[sq];W[ro];B[nq];W[mp];B[lf]LB[hc:a]C[Alex: This is another move that is smaller than it looks; 'a' (H17) would be better.]
;W[ib]C[Now I feel I am slightly behind. But I am not sure. What's your opinion?

Black points:
bottom l corner: 17
bottom r corner: 4
left side: 2
prisoners: 3
together: 26

potential: middle 16

white points:
upper l corner:  19
upper r corner: 8
right side: 10
together: 37

no potential

Therefore I tried to grap the upper left corner, but I misread the sequence.

Alex: I agree that you are behind.  My counting is as follows (but I am not always accurate with this sort of thing):

Black:
  lower left 22
  lower right 6
  left side 5 (C11 is maybe captured, maybe not)
  centre 10 (around O15)
total 33

White:
  right side 10
  left side 5
  upper left 25
  upper right 5
total 45

Generally, black's positions are thin, which means that the black territory tends to turn out a bit smaller than it might look right now, whereas white's territory will tend to grow as white can take sente more often.

In any case, trying an invasion was the right decision, even if it doesn't work.]
;B[ee];W[de];B[ec];W[ed];B[fb]LB[gc:a]C[Alex: The clamp at 'a' (G17) also looks like an interesting move for black here.]

;W[hb]
(;B[kb]C[Alex: I wonder if the cut at H17 works for black.  I don't think so, but it could certainly get interesting!  (See variation)]
;W[hd];B[hf]LB[kr:a][pb:b][mg:c][rj:d][rf:e][so:f]C[Alex: This and your next few moves don't make sense to me.  It looks like you're trying to take territory around G13, but there's no territory to be made there!

I think the big endgame moves now are 'a' (L2), 'b' (Q18), 'c' (N13)  and 'd' (S11).  You also have 'e' (S14) and 'f' (T5) in sente (white wouldn't want to start a ko at T4).]

;W[sp]C[white's first "passing move"

Alex: It's not quite as bad as it looks--it's worth about 5 points in reverse sente (black should have played T5 at an earlier stage)--but I agree that white is kind to you from here on.]

>From here I tried my very best with the yose. Any improvements are welcome.

Alex: OK, yose isn't my strongest point but I'll do my best for you!

I think though that the most important thing you can learn from this game is not yose, but to think about the early part of the middle game (just after the fuseki) and how you can fix your weaknesses instead of allowing your opponent's stones to become strong--this will mean that you tenuki less often!]

;B[je]LB[bp:a][aq:b]C[Alex: This is only one point reverse sente.  Instead you should play 'a' (B4)--this is bigger than it looks, because if white plays there then 'b' (A3) becomes sente for white.  It's hard to count the value of 'a' exactly (there are several possible continuations), but I think it's about five points.]
