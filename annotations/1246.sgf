AB[pd][dp]C[Wiles: This is a game I played in our local go Club in Pisa, Italy
It was a fighting game, usually i don't play like this, especially in handicap games, but that time i want to try something different against a stronger player.
So i ask you especially about the fights.
I'm sure there were a lot of mistakes, i have seen some of them replaying the game with my opponent, but i want to see the comments of a stronger player.
At the end I was ahead, but a bad mistake lost me the game. The game finished very late, so maybe i was sleeping when i played it :-(

Thanks you for your time
Sorry for my bad English

C[Wiles: Here we go! Usually i play d6 or c6 in handicap games, but here i played the pincer just to make it not a calm game.]
;W[fo];B[dn];W[dr]LB[cq:B][dr:A]C[Nin:  In general white shouldn't play this move.  The exchange of white A and black B deprives white the chance of invading the 3-3 point at a later time.]
;B[cq];W[ip]TR[ip]C[Nin:  White can play the marked stone only if the ladder works for him.  It is fine in this game, but I would like you to understand the pattern.  When the same joseki shows up in a future game and the ladder doesn't work for your opponent, you can punish him as shown in the variation.]

(;B[iq];W[hp];B[fr]LB[gp:A]C[Nin:  Reserve this move.  In the game sequence, black helps white to solidify his position.  If black doesn't play this move, there is a possibility of him to cause some trouble at A later.]
;W[eq];B[gq];W[gp]C[Nin:  Now white's position is strong without any defects.]
;B[jp];W[jo];B[kp];W[cl];B[dl]LB[ci:B][em:A]TR[cl]C[Nin:  Look at the two groups of white stones.  The circle stones are strong and the lone triangle stone is weak.  The game move helps white to strengthen his weak stone.  Play A to get out to the center.  If white plays B to strengthen his traingle stone, black takes sente and plays elsewhere.  White's two-point extension (traingle and B stones) won't be as solid as the game sequence, and black may be able to attack them later.]
;W[dk];B[cm];W[el];B[dm];W[ck]LB[cj:C][ck:B][ek:A]C[Nin: It's better for white to connect at A and gain thickness.  If black cuts at B, white can simply sacrifice his stone by atari'ing at C.]
;B[ek]LB[dh:A]TR[ck][dk][cl]C[Nin:  This cut is premature and can easily be the losing move of the game.  White's circle group is very strong, and the trainge group is reasonably solid.  The cut creates a weak black group sandwiched between two strong white's groups.  White can certainly make good profit by attacking the cutting stone.

Play at some other places for now.  If black has some stones around A later, the cut would be more appropriate.]
;W[fl];B[ej];W[di]LB[ci:A][dj:C][bm:B][co:D]C[Nin:  There is a trade-off between the game move and A.  The game move puts more pressure on the two black stones but it is thin.  Black's descend at B is sente.  If white ignores black's move at B, black can push at C and cut.  Since black's move at B is sente, it makes white's peep at D less threatening.]
;B[gj]LB[hk:A][gl:B]C[Nin: White should play A to stop black's move at B.]
;W[jj];B[gl];W[fk]C[Nin:  This move only helps black.];B[fj]
;W[gm];B[gk];W[fn];B[jl];W[im];B[il];W[ko];B[lo]LB[lp:A]C[Nin:  The game move is thin.  White's cut at A is problematic.  Simply play A to take profit at the bottom.]
;W[co];B[en];W[fm]
(;B[ep]LB[do:B][cr:A]C[Nin: A is better and also makes good profit.  White can't cut at B.  Please see variation.]
;W[cr];B[fp]LB[br:A]C[Wiles: this start a difficult fight in the corner, what was the best way to continue for both Black and White?

Nin:  Play A instead and it is sente.  White has to connect.]

(;B[hn]LB[kl:A]TR[jj]C[Nin:  I admire black's fighting spirit.  However, the game move complicates things and it's difficult to predict who will come out ahead in the following exchange.  I prefer playing at A  to gain thickness and isolate the marked white stone.  Please see variation.]

[kl][jm][kn][ln][lo][jp][kp][lp]SQ[jj][ik]C[Nin: Compared to the previous variation, white's marked stones are weak.  Black's triangle group is very strong, while his circle group is solid.  By attacking the two white stones, black should be able to make some profit and he is clearly in the lead right now.  Black's circle group should also get stronger during the attack, and later he can play around A to cut off white's left side group from the star point.]
;W[jd];B[cg]LB[dg:A]TR[jj][ik]C[Nin:  This is premature.  Attack the maked white stones to make black's center group stronger.  The come back and play the game move.

From an attack standpoint, A is better.  White will be sealed in.]

;W[pf];B[nc];W[pl]TR[pf][qf][pl]C[Wiles: Here I haven't seen a good way to answer this move, as there was also the treath of rescue the l7 stone.
So, what was the best way to answer this move?

Nin:  Let's do an analysis of the situation.  White has two weak groups (triangles).  Black should attack the lower marked stone to gain thickness at the center.  During the attack, black should be able to link his marked stone to the center group.  As white's lower stone is being chased around, black can make terrority at the bottom.  Once he gains center thickness, use it to attack white's upper group.  Please see variation.]

(;B[nj];W[nl];B[on];W[mk];B[mj];W[lk];B[kj]LB[lj:A]C[Nin: A is more solid.]
;W[qj];B[pk]LB[mf:B][qi:A]C[Nin:  White has two weak groups.  If black kills one of the groups, he will win the game.  Play A to build thickness and seal white's lower group.  Then aim at B later to kill white's upper group.

The game move allows white to link up his two groups.  Black loses a lot here.]
;W[qk];B[ol]C[Nin: Simply cut at A.  Please see variation.]

(;B[lm]C[Wiles: this was sure a slack move. Here I did'n want that group came under attack, but there was a good way to attack it, if  Wm7?

Nin:  It's important to defend your group.  If not, white can take advantage of it.  Please see variation.]

;B[li]LB[mh:A][sr:B]C[Nin:  Locally A is better.  Since white has two groups (upper and center) to defend, black should start the ko at B.  He will win the ko because attacking the upper and lower groups will give him many ko threats.]
