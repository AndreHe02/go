C[Hi!
I am playing black here, and will mark my comments/questions with an "H".

Thanks to the reviever in advance!

-- Hello Hannes, 
my name is Zoran a.k.a. wayward[8k\] at KGS.  I will be doing the review for Black.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[H: I'm sort of trying out the low chinese opening. Nearly everything I know is that it aims at big moyo. But I obviously failed on that.

-- It is good to try out different ideas and see how they work in practice.  If you have failed at a certain strategy, you already know what type of mistake you might have made during the game, which is a very valuable thing for post-game analysis.

In the game at hand, you were too concerned about making territory -- so the moyo didn't materialize.]
;W[po]TR[qk][pq]C[-- This is somewhat unusual; White mostly approaches from the outside to limit Black's moyo potential.  Note how this White stone is already in a sort of a loose pincer.]

(;B[qn]LB[np:A][qp:B]C[H: Would A have been better? The result of teh actual sequence was not bad, but nothing like a chinese opening should look like, I suppose.

-- I have no idea whatsoever how a "typical" Chinese opening would unfold; I've seen so many of them, but not enough to form a general picture :)  I would prefer A, since White has played in an area where he can't stabilize his stones in the easiest way.  See variation.]
;W[oq]
(;B[pp]LB[qo:A]C[-- I do this often myself, but my Japanese 6dan friend has warned me multiple times that "it is bad to hit your head against a kogeima stone".  This does threaten a cut, but the threat is often counterbalanced or even totally anulled by the loss of a liberty Black stones suffer; also, they can not extend upwards any more.  White can start a fight and damage R6 stone by descending to A.  Instead, take A yourself (see variation).]
;W[op];B[qo]C[-- This is good for Black];W[pn];B[pm];W[nn];B[qf]
C[-- so far Black has been more concerned with immediate territory than with a moyo.  It's better to move out and approach the top left stone for instance.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd]
(;B[ic]LB[kc:A][jd:C][kd:B][ld:D]TR[nc][nd]C[H: Good point of invasion? b can at least extend in both directions.

-- You can't really expect to extend from that stone towards O17 invaders; points A, B, C and D are too important for White to hope that he will fail to take one of them as his next move.  Given that, Black should play a tighter pincer (A or B) and not let White settle while attacking.  See variation.]
;W[jd];B[id];W[fc]LB[jc:A]C[-- Here Black should play a simple but strong move at A.  This is punishing White for playing a long extension at K16 and then ignoring your move at J16.]
;B[kc];W[kd]
(;B[jc]LB[lc:A]C[-- You can safely extend to A, White cannot cut you in this position.  See variation.]
;W[lc]LB[lb:A]C[-- Better to keep pushing.  See variation.]

(;B[if];W[qc]TR[oc][pd]C[H: Is there a chance to stop white?

-- The two triangle stones almost always leave the potential for White to invade the corner.  This does not have to be bad for Black; on the contrary, here it seems better for Black than for White.  Black will gain strength along the edge and weaken White's top group.  See variation.]

(;B[pc];W[rd];B[qd];W[qb]C[H: Alive, right?

-- Right];B[pb];W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[pe]CR[sc]C[-- Not as alive as before; White has wasted some precious liberties there.  He must play T17 for life.]
;W[pf];B[se];W[sd]C[H: Mistake.

-- Indeed.];B[rc];W[sf];B[sc];W[of];B[qh];W[oh]
(;B[oe]LB[ne:A]C[-- I would play A here.  It is the "proper" way to cut through a knight's move, and you can do it here because your stones are safe.  See variation.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[me];B[mf];W[lf];B[mg]LB[of:A]C[H: b now aimed at the A group. At least at chasing them.

-- That is a good plan.  Also note that the other White group can be subject to an attack after a forced move at N16, which would leave it with only one eye.  See variation.]

(;W[kf];B[ng];W[og];B[mi];W[ni]
(;B[nh]LB[lg:A]C[-- This is a bad tactical play; you lose a liberty and compress yourself into a bulky shape while only forcing White to play at P10, stretching towards friendly stones.  Better to play at A.]
;W[nj];B[oi];W[pi];B[oj];W[ph]
(;B[pj]C[-- You should keep pushing from below; see variation.]
;W[qi];B[rh];W[ri];B[rk];W[om]LB[nk:A]C[-- This move is no threat; instead of answering it, capture the two cutting stones and liberate the floating center group with A.]
;B[pl];W[nk];B[iq]LB[mg:A]C[H: b forgot to help the A group

-- Yeah, a big omission];W[hp];B[lq];W[ip];B[jp];W[jo];B[kp]
;W[ko];B[lo];W[ln];B[mo];W[mn];B[no];W[oo];B[mq]LB[ih:B][kh:A]
C[-- This is small.  If you want to enlarge your bottom assets, try moving to the left; however, Black's biggest concern is his floating center group.  Basically you can either try to run with A or threaten to connect with B; I'd prefer A since White's top group is still semi-stable.  Maybe it would be best to destroy White's eye shape with a throw-in at N16, then extend to A with an implicit threat against the top group.]
;W[np];B[mp]C[-- Again, ignore this one-point move and play elsewhere.]
;W[kr];B[lr]LB[jr:A]C[H: Would A have been better?

-- This stone is a "thank-you" move, it cannot connect nor cut anything.  Simply move out to the left with H3.]
;W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[gq];W[jq]C[-- Here you should press down and close the invaders.  See variation.]

(;B[or]TR[gq][hq][iq]C[-- This means you are leaving your marked stones behind.]
;W[nr];B[nq];W[on];B[pr];W[kq];B[mr];W[lp];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[fq]C[-- How very nice of White not to cut you :)]
;W[lg];B[mh]LB[jh:A]C[H: Lost move

-- Not neccessarily; you can still use this group to make some threats near A, so White will have to keep you separated and therefore decrease his territory in the center.  But the fight on the right side is lost, unfortunately.]
;W[lj];B[lb];W[mc];B[je];W[ke];B[gp];W[go];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq]
;W[co];B[ci]C[H: where to invade?

-- This is perfect.];W[cg];B[cl];W[el];B[dm];W[em]
(;B[dn]LB[ei:A]C[-- Play A instead, to limit White's moyo.]
;W[en];B[ih]LB[ce:A]TR[dd][cg]C[H: Is there something better than just reducing w's territory?

-- This is a good move both in terms of reduction and building potential to attack.  White's biggest weakness is his oogeima on the left; typically when we have stones facing that spot, like your last move and the group above, a play at A or nearby becomes feasible.]
;W[ij];B[ji];W[li];B[jj];W[jk];B[hj];W[hk];B[ii];W[ik];B[gj]
;W[dh];B[di];W[eh];B[ei];W[he];B[ie];W[gg]
(;B[hf]LB[cc:A][dc:C][cd:B]C[-- Here Black is trying to flatten White's territory from the outside, but it is pretty well defended in that direction.  As it stands, White is still susceptible to an invasion around the corner -- there are some semeai moves which might give you life.  The important thing is to be able to recognize when is the right time to launch such an invasion; too soon might mean giving your opponent too much outward influence, and too late means throwing away your stones (unless you are planning to use them as ko threats later).  This seems like a good time to try an invasion at one of the marked points.  See variation.]

;W[mb];B[ka]LB[fa:C][bh:A][gk:B]C[-- White's last move was gote; your group is alive and he can't capture that stone in sente.  Instead, play a sente move yourself, like A, B or C.]

[rs][ss]C[H: Thanks for reviewing!

-- Nice game.  I would suggest you to try playing a little less territorially-oriented opening; I'm not implying that territory is not important during fuseki, just that you would benefit fom visiting the "other world", i.e. influence-based way of play.  You will learn a lot of ways to use the influence to build territories later on, to attack opponent's groups, and also how to prevent them from building huge moyos around your territories.

My apologies if this review does not meet your expectations.  If you have any questions, comments or requests, I will be glad to answer them at zoran.rilak@gmail.com .

Have fun!

It is not urgent to move that stone since it can either hop upwards towards the Q16 or jump to the center.  Black can now tenuki to approach White or establish a base along the right (around A, B, C).  I think a large extension around K17 is also possible, but I would not hury to play there since White can easily erase the moyo by attacking the triangle stone.]
