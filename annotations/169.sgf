(;B[fe]C[I prefer the alternate move here. This move seems a little defensive (slow) to me.

fess];W[eg];B[db]LB[cb:A][dc:B]C[Is there a better way for black to attack here?

  Jammer.

A should be considered as a deeper penetration, but I really think the game move is better. A leaves some bad potential for sente moves by white starting with B.

  Jammer.

I like the alternate better.

(;B[gi]C[Black thought this might be a better move than G2, as far as territory goes.  Valid assessment?

Let's see with alternate.

(;B[be]C[Black was hurting for territory here, and needed to try to make some.  This move worked, but only due to a poor play by white at move 36.  Could black have done better?

  Jammer

Black has no right to think that this move will work. 2 alternates are shown. One is very simple and does not quite win. The other involves a 1 point jump and wins.

fess];W[bf]LB[ce:A]C[A simplifing connection at A is better here. Black is not going to get life, so just minimize black's ability to exploit cutting points.

This does not work either. Black has a better response.
