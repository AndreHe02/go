C[This was a match I played recently on DashBaduk (Korean Server). I'm not entirely sure where I went wrong, except possibly being a little to aggressive at times.

(I played white stones)

z:  Game reviewed by zenjutsu (5k* on IGS).  Comments will be noted with a "z:" (as above).  Please note that I am only 5k, so please take all comments with a grain of salt.  If you have any follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to send them to me.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nq];B[lq];W[qq]C[z:  I also like to hop into the corner when an opponent places the M3 stone, however I am unclear if this is the best thing to do versus a san-ran-sei, as you risk giving great influence to your opponent.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[oq]SQ[rq][np][nr]C[z:  This is not standard.  Normal joseki plays are marked.  I am uncertain which would be best in this situation, but I tend to like the secure O2 play.  The concern is that if B gets much stronger in this area, W is at risk of capture.]
;B[mo];W[qk];B[qj];W[ol];B[pl];W[rd]C[z:  If you did not intend to do anything with #'s 14 & 16, then why place them?  Also, this invasion seems premature and too deep.  There are many big plays on the board.  You appear to be inviting B to seal you into the corner, and thus B will possess significant influence to use in gaining lots of territory and reducing your territory.  ...perhaps you can use their aji later? However right now the exchange appears more beneficial to B than W.]
;B[rf];W[nc]C[z:  This stone seems odd.  It is too easy for B to split the two W stones.]
;B[re];W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[od]C[z:  Mistake.  B should R16.]
;W[qd]C[z: Good!];B[qe];W[rc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd];W[mc];B[md]
;W[pm]C[z:  I think the timing is off.  It is still important to get M16 in before B gets M17 in.  Doing so ensures that you are not sealed into the corner, and that group can still influence the game.  After you M16, B will respond, and then you can play here if you still feel it is the best play.]
;B[ql];W[pk]C[z:  This is too easy for B to contain.  Try to avoid plays which try to save stones that are either (1) dead already or (2) so close to dead that saving them will lead to a series of easy threats for your opponent (which in turn build more strength for the opponent).  Instead, make plays that _threaten_ to make dead stones live.  If you feel a need to play in this area, perhaps P9 is an option.  It threatens to connect to this one stone, and also gives more strength to W in this deeply B-controlled region.]
;B[ok];W[rk]C[z:  Mistake.  This is just a gimme to B.];B[rl]
C[z:  Good job, B.];W[nk];B[oj];W[nm];B[on];W[om];B[ml];W[nl]
C[This seemed like it was going to die.

z:  It is a very heavy shape.  It can live by running away, however B will be able to chase it and make a great profit from the chase. This is where the Q9 play has led to one dead (the 3 stones) and one nearly-dead (the 6-stone triangle) group.]
;B[mn];W[mk];B[ll];W[lk];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[nn];B[oo]C[z:  B should have played O5.  Much stronger play.]
;W[no];B[np];W[mp];B[mq];W[mm];B[lo]C[z:  Odd play by B.  Not the best shape.  I think I prefer if B just captures at M4.]
;W[kl];B[lm];W[ki]C[z:  So W escaped without too much pain.  I think some of B's plays let W off easier than he should have.]

(;B[fq]C[z:  I don't like this play.  I think B should kill W's lower right corner.  I don't think it will live if B starts the attack. See alternate move tree.]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[km]C[I think i should have threatened at l6 first

z: If you feel a play in that area is essential, then I would agree.  However, I am uncertain if this is the best area to play right now.  At this stage in the game, I would tesuji if I were B.  Whether or not you capture the 3 B stones does not influence the life or death of any other groups, nor does it make a _huge_ change in the game.  You are looking at a 10-20 point play (I'd guess more like 12-15 points, but I'm not very good at estimating the value of plays very precisely).  I think other plays on the board are worth more right now.  C3 is worth that much, and it secures your two stones.  Or something on the L side (D10?) to threaten a large side.  Or M16.  These all seem larger plays than the one you chose.]
;B[ln];W[kp]C[z: The following fight seems very odd.  B should not let it evolve in the way it does.]
;B[ko]C[z: B should just capture at M1.  That is easier.  Then again, B should just let W kill these stones, and make the first play to capture W's corner (shown earlier to be killable if B places the first stone).]
;W[kq];B[kr];W[iq];B[jo];W[jr];B[lr];W[lp];B[jq];W[jp];B[ip]
C[z: B miscounted.  This won't capture.];W[jq];B[hq];W[hr];B[js]
;W[ir];B[hp];W[gr];B[gq];W[fr];B[nr];W[or];B[ms];W[ks];B[os]
;W[qr];B[er];W[ps];B[fs];W[is];B[gs];W[ns];B[jk];W[mr]C[z:  I think W can safely play L9.  W appears to have the edge in the fight on the bottom.  But I do not blame W for playing safe.]
;B[kk];W[ls]C[I figured I was lucky enough to get this chance so cut my losses.

z:  You didn't need to capture now.  There was no way B could outpace you on the bottom after your last stone.  Better to connect out with you large O8 group.]
;B[lj];W[qm];B[rj]C[z:  Mistake.  B should have S7.];W[ro];B[rn]
;W[rm];B[sk];W[qn];B[mj];W[sq];B[sm];W[sn];B[sp];W[sr];B[nj]
;W[qo];B[so];W[rn]C[z:  No!  That play just _gave_ B the seki.  Instead, use this play as your backup.  Play T8 (the ko) first.]
;B[sl];W[im]C[z:  Again, W is obsessed with every stone living.  Let stones die if saving them is too much effort.  Rather, _threaten_ to make them live, and then use the threat to make profit.]
;B[in];W[il];B[ik];W[eq];B[dq];W[ep];B[cp];W[en]C[this ok?   c5 probably better...]
;B[co];W[gm];B[gn];W[fm];B[fp];W[go]C[Ah got ahead of my self.... :(

z:  Yes.  But I think B will get 2 eyes regardless.  A good maxim I once heard went something like this: "_threaten_ to kill without intending to kill and use the threat to make shape and territory -- only intend to kill if you are 95% certain (through reading out the stones) that you will kill."]
;B[eo];W[fo];B[do];W[hn]C[z:  This stone seems unimportant and small.  Again, W likes to make small plays that save a stone or two which are not even pivotal stones to the game.  You are giving sente to B too often, and B is (sometimes) using that sente to make bigger plays.  This play was only worth 3 or 4 points, but B's next stone is easily worth 10 or 20.  B made out much better in the exchange.]
;B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[kc]C[should have just played n18 or do you think i did the right thing. I suppose i did gain sente and that is worth alot more that the one stone...

z:  If you had played N18, B would have had to respond.  Thus, either way you had sente, if B felt his response was necessary. The main issue was that you let B play at M17 before you played M16.]
;B[ld];W[mb];B[jc];W[hk];B[ji];W[dn]C[z:  Let's evaluate quickly.  W has a sealed in corner (upper right) about the same size as B's sealed in corner (lower left). B has a nearly completely sealed in area (right), while white's potential area, while larger, is still open to invasion.  If I were black, I'd invade right now.]
;B[cf]C[z:  Good job, B.];W[ch];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[bf]

;B[hc];W[jd];B[ic];W[nh]C[z:  This doesn't gain anything for W.  B's obvious response clearly works.  Save such plays for when you are in a ko.]

C[Didnt think this through

z:  I hear you.  I make plays often where I didn't think it through as throughly as I should.  However, make certain that when you realize it, don't keep placing stones that give the opponent more points.  Just cut your losses and go elsewhere.]
;B[pf];W[oe]C[z:  B doesn't need to respond to this stone.  It's a free point to B.  This is what I meant by "cut your losses and go elsewhere".]

;B[ho];W[hm];B[jm];W[jn];B[kn];W[jl];B[io];W[ei];B[ij];W[kj]
;B[jj];W[jn];B[hf];W[fc]C[z:  Horrible play!!  B should ignore and connect.  See alternate move tree for B's next play.  W needs to realize that B's last play was _very_ threatening.]

(;B[gb]C[z:  Horrible!  Take advantage of W's last play.];W[hg]
;B[ff];W[fg];B[gp];W[fn];B[jm];W[ep];B[eq];W[jn];B[aa];W[ca]
;B[jm];W[bq]C[Hopeing to make more seki

z:  I don't see how.  This looks like another free prisoner for B (much like the stone at P15).  However, B's responses make it so that this turns out to _not_ be a free point to B, even though nothing comes of it to truly benefit W either.  No harm in trying, _unless_ it is a stone that doesn't require response, thus becoming a free point to the opponent.]
;B[es];W[cs];B[bp];W[ap];B[br]C[I decided to go for a ko battle now...]
;W[ad];B[ae];W[ki]C[On that should have left this unplayed to use for threat!]

z:  Yes.  ...but it is all a part of learning the game!];W[bd]
C[z:  This stone does nothing.  B will still have 2 eyes.  Save these type of "hopeless attacks which do require a response" to use as ko threats.]
;B[ad];W[jn];B[je];W[hs];B[jm];W[jd];B[bs];W[je];B[jn];W[br]
C[Another ko?

z:  I don't see it.  B has 2 eyes.  The corner, and the D-E4 space.  This is another free prisoner, which B decides to respond to.]
;B[aq]C[Ah guess not...

z:  B didn't need to place this stone.  He could have just said "thank you for the free prisoner", but instead he responds, thus making W's B2 stone an even exchange (B+1 prisoner, -1 territory = even).]
;W[tt];C[Game ended here with him winning by 18.5.   Any advice on what I did wrong would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for reviewing my game.

z:  I think W will improve greatly in go.  This is clear due to W's interest in learning, and in trying things out.  Experimentation, when combined with reflecting on what worked and what didn't, is the key to improving in go.  Continue to do that, and you will improve.

z:  W's key areas for improvement:

z:  1. Make urgent plays first.  Urgent plays are those that (a) ensure the survival of your groups, (b) ensure the death of the opponent, (c) threaten the death of the opponent, or (d) prevent the threatened death of your own groups.

z:  2. Make big plays next.  If a play is not urgent, then make certain it is the biggest thing on the board.  There were times when both players decided to make a small exchange (such as the mess around L7 play) when there are bigger plays on the board. Also, do not respond to an opponent's "threat" if it is not an URGENT (meaning "life and death") threat.  Only respond if your response is the biggest thing on the board.

z:  3. Do not try to capture an opponent's group unless you _know_ you'll get it.  Rather, threaten to capture, and use that threat to build strength that you can convert into points.

z:  4. Know when to cut your losses.

z:  5. Don't give up on the game!  It is clear that you enjoy playing, and reviewing what you did right and wrong.  Keep up this outstanding attitude, and you will go far!

z:  Game reviewed by zenjutsu (5k* on IGS).  Remember that I am only 5k, so seek "truth in go" from those stronger than me. Please take my comments as suggestions only.  If you have any follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to send them to me.]

(;B[hg];W[gb];B[hb];W[ha];B[ia]C[z:  Let's add it up.  On the top, W gained 4 prisoners and 3 points of territory while B lost 3 points of territory -- net of W+10.  ...but in the middle, B gained 11 prisoners and 13 points of territory while W lost 1 prisoner (H12 would have died) and 2 points of territory -- net of B+21.  Overall, B gains 11 points if he had selected this route.  W's "threat" was actually a gift to B; a gift that B chose to not take.]
