Result W+5.5

[EV\] Comments by reviewer Eric Vella will be marked like this.  This was an interesting game to review.  Black won the opening and played well in the middle game.  Both sides made fatal mistakes toward the end.]
;B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[ep];B[qd]C[Is this called the shusaku opening?

[EV\] Yes.];W[ce];B[eq]LB[dh:a]C[is this right or should I play a instead?

[EV\] This move is good.];W[dp];B[dq];W[co];B[fp]C[is choosing this opening right for black?

[EV\] To answer that, we have to look at the likely continuations and see whether the B stones end up cooperating well with the rest of the board, particularly the upper left corner.  See the later variation, which looks good for B.]
;W[cq];B[bp];W[cr];B[bo];W[dn]
(;B[en]C[[EV\] This move is also joseki.  B captures the corner but gets a weak floating group in the center.  It is probably playable, though I would be a little worried that the nearby W stones Q4 and C15 might help W in the following fight.  See the variation for a different suggestion.]
;W[dm];B[fo];W[do];B[dr];W[fq]
(;B[ds]C[[EV\] This move is not quite joseki (see the variation), but the result should be similar.  The W corner stones are now captured.  How should W make use of them to strengthen F3?]
;W[fr]LB[gq:A]C[[EV\] This move is wrong.  W should extend to A instead.  Both moves force B to capture the corner, but A has more useful influence on the coming center fight.]
;B[br];W[cs]C[[EV\] Pointless.  Loses a ko threat, and possibly even some points (if W later gets B6).]
;B[bq];W[hp]C[[EV\] Overplay or miscalculation, since it looks like B can cut.  But the situation is difficult.]
;B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[gp];B[iq];W[gn];B[em];W[el];B[fm];W[dk]
LB[gl:A]C[[EV\] B has captured the cutting stones, so the center group is safe.  If W could surround this group to get a good squeeze, he would have compensation for the corner loss, but this does not look possible.  B has a won game at this point.  As B, I would probably just play A now to keep it simple and safe.]
;B[hn];W[fl];B[gm]C[[EV\] W has just removed the last bad aji in the center for B, so this is a good time to pause and take stock of the position.  B has roughly 30 points in the corner, which W cannot match.  Center thickness is comparable.  B should have an easy win from here.  Play conservatively, avoid complications, avoid risky fights.]
;W[fd]C[[EV\] This is a good try by W, initiating a complex joseki (taisha).  B should choose a simple variation which gives up a little but maintains a safe lead.  The difficult variations which leave B with a weak group in the center are bad, due to the W thickness around D9.]
;B[de];W[dd];B[ed];W[cd];B[ec];W[ee]
(;B[df];W[cc];B[fe]LB[fc:a]C[would it be better if I play at a?

[EV\] The standard joseki is A, but in this position it would be bad, as the two B cutting stones have nowhere to go.  Better to give them up now and get a bigger side.  Congratulations on finding a continuation which is more appropriate for this position than the standard joseki.]
;W[ef];B[gd];W[ff];B[fc]C[[EV\] Better to play G15.];W[ge];B[cf]
;W[ci];B[gf];W[fd]C[[EV\] Since W initiated this ko, why not extend to H15 and make it big?  The ladder works, so B cannot simply fill the ko.]
;B[he];W[eh];B[bf];W[be];B[cb];W[bb];B[db];W[dg];B[ab]C[[EV\] Both sides have three liberties, so it is worth looking for something more here.  Try reading out the cut at B17.]
;W[bc];B[ba];W[bg];B[oc]LB[fe:a]C[is it better to play at a.
I did not play at a because i fear that black would play somewhere like P16

[EV\] Both moves are good.

[EV\] Let's take stock again.  W now has 30 points on the left side, which just equals the B lower left corner.  W has nothing comparable to the B territory on the upper side of the board, which is conservatively 15+10 points.  The B thickness around H6 is worth more than the single W stone at Q4.  There are no weak groups.  So B still has a large and safe lead.]
;W[fe];B[hd];W[qj];B[np]LB[nq:a]C[should I play at a instead?
I played O4 because I was thinking if H4 escapes, it would help

[EV\] There are many good moves here, including yours.];W[pn]
;B[nn]C[is this bad?

[EV\] Good.  The spacing between these stones and the B wall to the left is good.  B makes as much to the left as W does to the right.]
;W[pq];B[oi]LB[oj:a]C[is it better to play a?

[EV\] What are you trying to accomplish here?  You need to have a strategy, not just isolated good moves.  This sort of capping move is usually used to reduce a large W moyo, which does not exist here.  If the intent is to enclose territory above, then a shoulder hit (one space to the right) would be better.  This strategy would be admirable but a bit risky -- W might take immediate profit, then find a way to reduce the top anyway.  As B I would just play conservative big points in this position, moves like R12 or O2.]
;W[qe]C[is this called the asking move?

[EV\] W is trying to stir something up, which is reasonable given his position.  B should try to avoid confusion and keep it simple.]
;B[pd]C[if yes, is this reply correct?

[EV\] This move is simple and good.  The hane at Q15 would also be good.]
;W[of];B[ne]LB[pf:a]TR[qg][qi]SQ[ok][ol][om]C[should I cut immediately at a instead of trying to secure the land?

[EV\] These two W stones are weak and should not be strengthened by contact moves or cuts.  B could attack strongly with the triangle moves, or B could reinforce the center while reducing the W side with the square moves, which are sente, before returning to the top.  Despite all this, the move B played is not bad, as long as B takes care not to let W capture P11 on a large scale.]
;W[mi]C[N11 feels weak

[EV\] N11 is certainly too thin, but W has to try something drastic to have any winning chance.]
;B[nf];W[oh]C[O14 feels wierd];B[pf]C[[EV\] Here B starts to go wrong.  This capture is too small.  The center is more important.]
;W[pg];B[qf];W[nj];B[nl]LB[mo:a]C[played this move because N5 feels weak and I don;nt know how to respond if white plays at a

[EV\] Something like this seems necessary now.];W[ke]TR[kc]
[oe][gg][rg][nr]C[[EV\] I know this move is upsetting -- it looks unreasonable and you want to capture it.  But it threatens only 20 points of potential B territory at the top, and there are many 20 point moves left on the board.  Why not play a large move like one of the triangles and let W worry about the safety of this stone?

[EV\] If you really feel like fighting it out, how about the variation shown below.  Use forcing moves to prepare the capture.]

(;B[kg];W[jf];B[jg];W[if];B[fh]C[is F12 ok? it seems to have avoided a lot of things for black, but it also let white escape]
;W[gg];B[hf];W[ig];B[hg];W[ih]TR[jg][kg]C[[EV\] Letting W escape like this is very bad.   The marked stones are now more of a liability for B than a threat to W and L17 is no longer effective at making territory.]
;B[lf];W[gh];B[hh];W[gi];B[hi];W[ji]C[[EV\] W probably did not want B to have G12 sente, but this sequence weakens the center W group again and is bad for W.  B still has G10 sente, so the capture of one B stone is small.]
;B[ki]LB[li:A]C[[EV\] A move at A would probably be a stronger attack.  The principle is to lean against a solid group in order to attack a weak group.  B could also just play big moves and let W worry about the safety of his center stones.]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[kh];B[jh];W[ii];B[lh];W[li]C[[EV\] This ko risks a lot for a small gain.  W should just escape with J10.]
;B[kf]C[[EV\] What is this?  Even if this was sente and W answered at K16, it would be a loss for B.  Why not play J10 and fight the ko?]
;W[kh];B[km];W[nr]C[[EV\] This move is much larger than the previous B move.]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[kq];W[bn];B[je]LB[jd:a]C[big mistake should have played at a

[EV\] Yes, this is the game losing mistake.  Although you do get a chance later ....]
