C[Hello,



I'm playing black here and will mark my comments with H.

Thanks to the reviewer in advance!

Hi my name is Ian Davis, I hope my review is useful for you]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dq];W[dd];B[qe];W[do]
(;B[gp]LB[fp:A][gp:B]C[H: I suppose, that A would have been a sound move, but is B a bad idea in general, or does my bad result in that area only come from later mistakes?

B allows White to cut, which gives a bad result in general I think.

There are some other moves (or joseki) to consider also];W[cq]
;B[dp]C[oh this is bad shape];W[cp]LB[dp:1][dq:2]C[the proverb is hane at the head of two stones, so Black has given white good shape]
;B[dr];W[eo];B[jq];W[cr]LB[gq:A]SQ[gp]C[Black still has a shape problem, so this oopening is very difficult for you. The marked stone should be at A.]

(;B[mq]LB[jd:C][ci:B][qk:D][nq:A]C[H: "He won't come far" was my (false) analysis, so I decided to extend again

This is quite a positive way of thinking. However you must be careful to check what happens if White does come into your position.

Also, maybe the marked stone is a little slow, perhaps you can push all the way to A ?

In any case, I think there are bigger points on the board.

B to split White's side, or C or D to extend from the shimari]

[qj:C]C[White's move is strange. 
If we look at the whole board, it is clear White wants to expand his left side. So my first instinct as White would be A,  then B and C become big for both sides.]
;B[qj]LB[qm:A]SQ[pm]C[yes the door is open. 
The marked stone is better on the third line at A.];W[oq]
(;B[oj]C[this is not small, but what about the top side? You forgot to enclose it.]
;W[jd]C[White punishes];B[cj]C[good move, but I would play one higher, a little further from the thickness of white.]
;W[nd];B[oe];W[oc];B[od];W[ob]
(;B[pb]C[this is not so big];W[mc];B[ne];W[me]
(;B[mf]TR[lg][kh][ji]C[H: Going this direction seemd good for me. He would get a "wall", too, but his territory is still open on the left.

perhaps, but it does not hurt a lot of tenuki now.
It is hard for me to judge, my feeling is N14 was a little too small.]

(;W[cl]C[White squeezes from the wrong side];B[cg];W[ce];B[gc]
;W[di]
(;B[ci]LB[dj:A]C[H: right choice? Or would A (followed by building a wall) would have been better? It would face the strong white group, so I decided otherwise.

I think you have to make life, settle the stones.];W[dg];B[dh]

(;B[mo]LB[mj:A][mo:B]C[H: Would A have been more profitable? In the end, B helped me to sort of seal white in, but A seems like more immediate points.

My feeling is B looks quite slow.  A is at least better.];W[nr]

Yes E10 is not so useful for you. Danger was waiting here.]
