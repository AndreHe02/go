C[Hello.  Thank you for reviewing my game.  I am black.  I should have won this but made a couple mistakes.  I know how I could have fixed one and gotten a better situation out of the other but in general I am wondering about the efficiency of my opening and also endgame reductions that are better than I ended up with.

Thanks.

Hi, Nathaniel,

About your remarks.The opening is a complex thing and you came out alright. In the middle game you had a few huge opportunities to kill white. Reading just a little bit better would have gotten you an easy win. Regarding the endgame; you are right, white actually won the game in last moves. 
See my comments and variations I hope they will be helpful. I enjoyed doing the review and if you have any questions feel free to contact me.

Best regards,
Lothar.];B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[cd];B[oq]C[P3 is good but a bit slow. w walked away with 2 corner enclosures (shimari's) So E16 or E17 would be prefered because it's also extends from Q16.]
;W[co]C[This is too passive by w. w 016/17 would be better or R10/Q10.]

(;B[ci]C[I think I should have prevented the ideal extension on t he bottom first, right?

Yes. Or make an ideal extension yourself or play the kakari opp. of C16. W should tenuki here.]
;W[cl]C[useless extension. w's stones are over concentrated b will extend to C14 which will induce w E17. So b will have a base right in front of w's second shimari.]
;B[cf];W[ec];B[jq]C[Now B has to prevent w taking this point so w will not make a double wing formation but obviously it's the wrong way to develop the b shimari.]
;W[nc];B[qf]C[It's not wrong just a bit passive. 016 would be better in terms of building a moyo]
;W[qh]C[This feels like he played too close to me.

Yes it's a panic move and b should extend to R10. See var.]

(;B[qk]C[Could this be higher?

As in closer to R12 yes R10 would be tighter.];W[oh];B[ok]C[I was hoping he would let me make this move.

it's a good result for b.]
(;W[pj]C[w plays the peep on the wrong side];B[pk];W[om]C[Is there a better way to handle this?]

(;B[pn]C[This is too close. be relaxed and play a solid move like R7 w is the one who is in trouble here.

w will have 3 weak groups to defend while b has healthy groups and can attack with out worries. See var.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[on];B[po];W[gq]C[Again a panic move by w. w should have extended into the center with M6/7.]

(;B[mp]C[Too submissive?

Yes :-) understandable though but remember the move thats good for your opponent is good for you. so... N6! See var.]
;W[no];B[mo];W[np];B[nq];W[mn];B[nl]C[Better move somewhere else....

yep.];W[mm];B[kc]CR[mm][om][pm][mn][on][no][np]LB[lc:→][ne:↓]
TR[nc]SQ[oh][qh][pj]C[Let's take a look a the board.

w has 3 weak groups ( one group consist of only one stone ;-) ) Attacking w O17 from the left will push him into the center towards his weak square group.

What you want to do, and I hope you already saw it in the previous vars that I added, is to keep w's groups divided and attack two of them at the same time with one move. Like here O15 or may be first M9 and the O15. Divide and rule w will have to give up one group eventually and even if that doesn't happen b can build and develop all over the board and win easily.]
;W[hc]
(;B[mb]C[I'm sure that after my previous explanation you will understand that this wasn't the best of moves.

See var.];W[nb]C[Only makes w stronger];B[ib]C[It was only a stone that you could have sacrificed easily, now you created a (weak) group that needs to be defended.]
;W[mc]
(;B[lb]C[See var.];W[hb];B[ke]C[Was that sequence right?

No b has only one eye. See previous var.];W[ne];B[pb];W[ng]
C[Here w has connected and is too large to be killed. W would almost proved me wrong later on though.]

(;B[ie];W[jd]C[I played this out incorrectly, please help.  Shape issue?]
;B[kd];W[jc];B[ic];W[id];B[je];W[jb]C[J 15 wasnt good but I think u did the right thing and sacrificed the 2 stones L18 was overplay]

TR[cl]SQ[nb][mc][nc][ne][ng][oh][qh][pj]C[Trying to set up aji. (Next couple moves)  Better locations?

Yes look at the board again. w has a weak group and territory in the left corners The square is not alive yet but seems too big to be killed. What you want is to attack the weak group and limit the territory.  So if you could build something along the slashed line that would be good.

So b should start at G5 see var];W[fp];B[cm];W[cn];B[bm];W[bn]
;B[bl];W[ck];B[bk];W[cj];B[bj];W[di];B[ch];W[dm];B[dl];W[el]
;B[hf]C[Ok let's look at board again. Instead of limiting the build up of w's territory and attaking w's weak group w has now a huge wall full of potential and the weak group seems already almost connected to that wall.]

Clearly not, K8 was a very good move that killed w's group. Try to read a bit further.]

(;W[lf];B[lg];W[mg];B[le]

;B[mf];W[nf];B[lf];W[kh];B[jh];W[li];B[ji];W[mk]C[Excellent move by him.  I tried in the branches, but I don't think I escape.  The branch is what I think the best outcome is.  I made a mistake

I disagree. The small group for the large group is a good exchange! W underestimated the situation of his upper side group.]

In the endgame sente is very important (as in all of the game). In the endgame however there are only so many moves left to play.]
