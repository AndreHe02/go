AB[dd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my game. Played on Christmas day 2004 against a much better opponent (14k) I am currently 21k on IGS.

Hello, my name is Slava. I am a 13k on KGS (zloy). I am using CGoban 2.6.8 for reviewing your game.]

(;B[ld]C[Just make it simple.];W[jd];B[kd];W[ic]
(;B[jb]C[This is too small];W[bc];B[bd];W[nd]C[Please tell me how to respond to this

The best response is to attack and push your opponent. Probably, the best way to attack this stone is to use knight moves. Using knight moves you can push a weak group of your opponent to your strong group. It is also good to make some territory at the same moment. Unfortunately, you don't have a really strong groups at that moment.  So, I would choose between N14 and P14. And I like P14 more.

The other aproach is to destroy a base for the white (N18 or P18) and chase after the white around the board.]

I have shown it earlier. But I think that the white could attack this side and this corner anyway. White could attack a C3 point. It is a mistake of the white to try to escape to the center. I would go for the corner at first.]

;W[bc];B[mn]C[And this decided the game.];W[nn];B[ps];W[qs]
;B[rs]C[White resigned.

I believe that the white lost the game when he tried to escape to the center. White lost the left-bottom there. And then white made a big mistake at the end of the game when he lost right-bottom.

Summary:
1. You have to study good shapes. Knight moves often make good shapes. Don't be overconcentrated - good shapes let you do it.
2. It is not necessary to play a side to a side with your opponent to attack/protect stones. Yes. It is a power of knight moves again. It is very hard to cut the knight move. Keep a distance, stay connected, stay alive, stay in a good shape.
3. Study some joseki - http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm
4. Solve go problems - http://gogrinder.sourceforge.net - it always helps to improve any skills.
5. Be sure that you don't follow my advices blindly because I am only 13k.

I hope that this review will make you stronge. Thanks.])
