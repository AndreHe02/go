C[buckyyowza: Hello Conway!  Comments by Mark Fyffe (prefixed by buckyyowza).  I hope you enjoy reading through my review, and maybe learn something from it as well ;-)  Don't worry about the time limit:  I lead a very busy life, so rarely play a game with the proper time limits myself.  There is still a lot to learn from having a faster game reviewed.  For example it is easier to spot faults in your intuitive responses, and this is what I have tried to do with my comments.   Closing comments may be found at the last node.  Enjoy :-)

For comparisons sake, I have cut out all my alternate paths so that when your review comes, I can compare it with my own and see where I was right and wrong.  I also realize that the game fails to meet the 20 minute per person requirement, but as we went through a number of byo-yomi periods and I myself put an extreme effort into what I believe to be my best game yet, I thought submitting this might be in order.

Thank you for taking the time to review this game.  I have cut out all the comments and discussions as well.

(;B[pg]LB[ed:A][qg:B]C[buckyyowza: this play helps white build shape.  White should not have played R15 in this position, but now it is not too bad for white.  To build center, it is better to play thick against white's sphere of influence, such as with E16.  To attack white's stones, a direct hit at R13 is the best choice.

I thought the threat posed here would be appropriate for building the center.  I play a lot of games where after claiming some side and corners, my focus is on the the center in the early parts of the games.]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[qh];B[cj]LB[pf:A]C[buckyyowza: black has to finish this situation now, by playing at Q14.  Lets see what happens if white ignores your tenuki and plays Q14...]

(;W[co];B[jd];W[cl];B[cg];W[ec];B[gc]LB[fd:A][pf:C][oj:B]C[buckyyowza: this play is too overconcentrated on the third line, allowing white an easy extension into the center from the shimari.  A better play in this area would be the upper shoulder hit at F16.  However, I'd prefer to see some moyo development with the Q12 group before it comes under attack. P10 (and of course Q14!) would be perfect moves for this.]
;W[df];B[ip];W[hq];B[iq];W[hp];B[ho]C[buckyyowza: This sequence is a mistake for white, starting with the lower shoulder hit at H3 (which is almost always bad!). If you look at this from the standpoint of how much moyo each player gets, compare the right lower side black moyo to the lower left corner moyo for white, and then consider that black's wall is one step ahead into the center because of white's lower shoulder hit.  Therefore, hane seems a very sensible play with some quite nice variations.

Not entirely sure why I did this.  Clearly the right side is still open for pickings, but I think my center-focus just took over here.]
;W[ql];B[pk];W[pl];B[ok];W[po]C[buckyyowza: R9 is a huge cut, making white's big right side into two weak groups.  Also, white's play at Q5 is too early, since it is not enough to invade the corner and he is not yet settled so not strong enough to reduce black's moyo.]

(;B[pp];W[qo];B[go]C[buckyyowza: yes, white is down a stone in this area and G5 is an excellent way to punish, but I'd still prefer R9 since it is bigger than the lower left.  C14 is OK, also E10 would have ensured life by building thickness.

Here I debated taking C14 to ensure life, but I opted for this since there was still a good chance for me to live and this allowed me to possibly take his bottom.]
;W[cf];B[bg]LB[ej:A]C[buckyowza: black cannot settle here very quickly, so a better way to protect this group is to jump out with E10.  Recall the proverb "it is better to run than live".  After E10, black is building a nice center moyo but without it things in the middle of the board are still looking pretty neutral.]
;W[bk];B[bj];W[fp];B[ck];W[bl];B[eg]LB[eh:A]C[buckyyowza: I agree, this is too close to white's strong group and is easily cut. E13 is more effective is this case.

This move after looking it over, I believe to be incorrect.  The next few moves showed me this.]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[eh]
(;B[fh]LB[fg:A]C[buckyyowza: F12 is not correct.  This pushes white into cutting your left side group off from the center, in all a bad choice especially since this left side group will likely end up having to live small in gote.  A much better idea would be to play at F13.]
;W[ei];B[fg];W[di]C[I believe he ataried the wrong way, myself.  I played it out myself to the best of my abilities, and came away with ko for life and/or death of black.]
;B[ch];W[ek]
(;B[dk]TR[cj][ck]C[buckyyowza: oh no! it's the dreaded empty triangle shape.  Don't be fooled by the other black stones in this group, this shape is still bad news even now.  I would start now at E10 to get out of this tight spot, see variations for a couple of ways that might be played out.]
;W[el];B[ci]C[Remembering the old dictum "One eye beats none," I set myself up in case I needed it.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[oe];B[nf];W[nh];B[oi];W[lh];B[mg]LB[gj:A]C[buckyyowza: white is trying to run, but has nowhere immediate to run to.  So, this attack is too close and actually helps to strength white's stones.  A better choice now might be to eliminate the influence of white's stones on the left, with a play like G10.]
;W[mh];B[mj]C[Started denying him eyespace, but made sure not to play right up there and force his hand too much.]
;W[og];B[oh];W[ng];B[mf]
(;W[ne]LB[gj:A][qk:B]C[buckyyowza: I do not think M15 works for white either (see var), and certainly O15 gains little for white.  Both players now should be thinking about G10.  Also remember R9?  It is still one of the largest points on the board.

Believe this should have been at M15.  I played it out myself and got black's death in one sequence and white getting huge influence in the center after some small stone sacrifices.]
;B[le];W[me];B[lf];W[ni];B[nj];W[jh];B[kj];W[li];B[lj];W[ij]
;B[ji];W[ii];B[ih]C[buckyyowza: An excellent result for black, although without a black stone at G10, white still gets in to erase a significant portion of the center.]
;W[ig];B[hh];W[kg];B[jf];W[jg];B[gj]C[Here I thought an improper response on his part might get me the life on the left sooner than I hoped for.

I needed to make sure the damage to my center was minimal so this seemed like an appropriate choice regardless of whether or not he responded correctly or not.  As I type this, I am realizing how dangerous it is for that black group now squished between two white groups...]
;W[fj]C[Didn't happen...];B[on]C[buckyyowza: This is not the time to tenuki!  G9 is urgent for black now, and P6 is poorly placed as white's response illustrates.

Here, I thought it an appropriate time to attack the loose stones in my area while strengthening my center.  It didn't quite go that way...]
;W[oo];B[nn];W[no];B[mn];W[mo];B[lp];W[lo];B[gk]C[I saw an opportunity to save the stones on the left, so I started to work my plan to cut out white liberties and make sure that the two white stones couldnt find proper support.]
;W[jj];B[ki];W[jl];B[kn];W[jn];B[jo];W[in];B[io];W[ln];B[km]
C[Needed to make sure he stayed cut off.  I decided that a few points on the bottom was a small price to pay.]
;W[ko];B[fb]LB[kp:A]C[buckyyowza: white may have failed in the center, but he still has a huge reduction point at L4 so F18 is inappropriately early.

Decided the middle was secured and went on to other projects...]
;W[eb];B[rd];W[re];B[pd]C[I really have no clue.  After I played this move, I asked myself why I had played such dumb moves.  F15 at this point was something I noticed on review.]
;W[pe];B[dl]LB[em:A]C[buckyyowza: white can stop this by playing E7 now.

Saw what I believed to be the solution to killing the white stones and saving my side.  I tried it out.  I believe the next sequences has errors resulting in my would be survival.]

(;W[dm];B[em]C[buckyyowza: now black escapes, and if white is not careful kills the entire center as well.]
;W[fm];B[en]
(;W[dn]C[buckyyowza: this is too easy on black, white's play should be at F6.]

(;B[fo]C[buckyyowza: I do not see a reasonable way for white to live after D6.  G6 is not good, but F6 is equivalent to this play.

I played around after the game here by trying G6 instead.  I constantly found myself giving white eyes.  Am I right?  It doesn't look much different, but I get this feeling I'm missing something.]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[gl]
(;B[hk]LB[fi:A]C[buckyyowza: the key move in this sequence is now F11.  By taking out this white group, black's later troubles on the upper side can be prevented.

Denying more eyespace.  I'm just realizing while typing how precarious the situation is in the center.  I'm quite thankful at this point for not noticing the danger as much during play.]
;W[hl];B[hn];W[hm];B[jm];W[im];B[kl]C[buckyyowza: M7 is better, as it closes white out of this area entirely.

I didn't want to give up space.  I think I was a little greedy in hindsight...]
;W[gi]
(;B[hi]C[buckyyowza: F11 is more effective. It is all a matter of counting liberties.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[ik];B[hj];W[ge];B[hf];W[if];B[he];W[ie];B[je]
;W[gf];B[hg];W[hd]
(;B[fk]C[buckyyowza: this is poorly timed, the G16 cut is better now.]
;W[hc];B[hb]C[buckyyowza: G16 is still effective, whereas H18 lets white wreak havoc on the upper side.]
;W[gd]
(;B[id]C[buckyyowza: This result is unreasonably bad for black. J18 is now urgent if black is not to lose everything up here.

J17 is something I'm just noticing during review.  Didn't see this during the game.]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[jc];B[kd];W[jb];B[fc];W[fd];B[ga]C[Only now does it occur to me that it's actually dead...]
;W[ia];B[lb]C[buckyyowza: N16 is the most efficient way to save the most points here.

Saw a danger to my territory.  Took what I thought to be an appropriate measure to secure it.]
;W[bf];B[ak];W[al];B[dp]C[Here, I played hoping to entice white into letting me play D5.]
;W[cp];B[eq];W[ep]C[Success, although in hindsight, I think I'd rather he had played D5 instead of me.]

;B[er];W[fr];B[dr];W[cq]C[buckyyowza: black cannot gain liberties, F1 kills in ko.

I think here after looking it over, that hitting F1 now looks ok.  Is this correct or was trying for more liberties right?]

(;B[cr];W[br];B[bs];W[ar];B[es]C[buckyyowza: now black dies, F1 still works here before now.]
;W[cs];B[ds];W[bq];B[fs]C[No idea...  Please don't ask...];W[cs]
;B[ee]C[This would have worked in game had I remembered to count liberties.  This is a constant failure of mine and I'm still working on that.]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[fe];B[ha];W[ja];B[ed];W[dd];B[kc];W[de]
(;B[sb]C[Um...  E10 or D10...  Yeah...  Don't know why I didn't...]
;W[fl]C[buckyyowza: an honest mistake :-)  If black played D10 instead of T18, I have black winning by roughly 20 points... I have played out a potential endgame for you, though it is a little sloppy it should illustrate the key points.

It appears that you have a relatively firm grasp on the strategy of Go, but there are some local situations that I notice you repeatedly play incorrectly or ignore.  If you begin to recognise these sorts of plays, I think it is likely that you will find that your game improves significantly:

1) do not play on the second line unless it is part of a critical sequence for life, well established joseki, or part of an endgame sequence.  I notice on several occasions that you play tenuki too early, ignoring critical plays in order make a slack endgame move on the second line.  this occurs on moves 35, 109, 149

2) do not fail to block groups from entering your moyo.  There are many points through this game where the door is left wide open into your area.  Examples are moves 89, 109, 131, 161

Between being more aware of these points and reading through the variations on the big fight in the center, I hope I have provided some insight that will help your game advance to the next level.  It is exciting being on the verge of a breakthrough in playing ability, and I think that a few bad habits left over from getting bit too often as a beginner are all that kept you from a decisive win in this game ;-)

It has been a pleasure looking over your game.  Feel free to let me know if you have any further questions - Mark


Resigned because I knew the second I played T18 that I couldn't afford him to play this or G13.

I did my own endgame sequences assuming I had played correctly and came out with B +25<.  I would appreciate it if you could do the same.  If not, I'll understand.]
