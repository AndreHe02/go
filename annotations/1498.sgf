RE[W+3.5]

C[Please feel free to give any advice. Thanks. I play black.

I first did not want to review this, since I am not much better than the White player.

However, when I saw the game, I found it very funny.

It has the usual collection of moves that are too small or completely unneccessary. Try to avoid those, and you make progress.

Also, you should look into any book about Fuseki. A normal game develops from the corners.

Thanks for asking me to review that game!];B[pd];W[qf]C[This is strange.

You do not want to commit yourself to a certain play in a corner, before you do not know the development of the board.]

(;B[nd]C[Should just ignore white and take the other corner.]
;W[rd]
(;B[qc]C[Again.

Don't follow the commands all the time.];W[rc]C[Bad. Too small. Endgame.]
;B[qj]C[You cannot Threaten White, and you have nothing to extend from. Take a corner instead!]

(;W[qi]C[Touching is not really a good strategy here. It makes Black strong. The problem is however, that Black's strenght does point in open territory.]
;B[pj];W[pi]
(;B[pp]C[Should I play R6?

This is tough, since you extended without a corner before. However, the connection to the white 2 stone wall is indeed very loose. You could think of a large corner move like Q5]
;W[qn]C[Maybe too early.

Players are too much in love with fighting.]
(;B[qo]C[Hmmm.

This attachment strengthens White and weakens your group. However, all moves have disadvantages now.

The other way could be to pinch from above on R8. I would not like that much. It looks very overconcentrated.]
;W[pn]
(;B[ri]C[Is it better to play O4?

Taking care of your group is quite OK now. But this is the wrong direction.]
;W[rh];B[rk]
(;W[oj]C[Looks normal, but white should enclose the corner first.]
;B[ok]
(;W[oi]C[Too soft.]
(;B[pl]C[Why do you guard against a cut that does not work?]
;W[no]
(;B[np]C[You could think of playing lower. Remember, attachments strengthen!]
;W[oo]
(;B[mp]C[Looks careless to me. But I cannot see all consequences.]
;W[qq];B[pq]
(;W[pr]C[Impossible, I believe.]
(;B[rn]C[Why so hard? Simply stretch down.];W[rm];B[ro];W[po]
;B[qp];W[oq]
(;B[rq]C[No, no, no!

Gives away the good game. You have such a nice attack on the White group and destroy it with one move!]
;W[op];B[nr];W[or];B[jq];W[qr];B[rr]
(;W[so]C[Does not work at all.

White should connect at R7 to keep the thread on the black middle group.]

(;B[sp]C[Even cutting at R7 should work.];W[nq];B[mr];W[mq]
;B[lq]
(;W[kr]C[Makes no sense. A terrible move.];B[lr];W[lp];B[mo]
C[Does not work. Try to read out a little bit further.];W[kp]
;B[kq];W[mn]
(;B[dp]C[You can try to break the ladder.

This move is calling for trouble.];W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[Again. Attachment strenghtens. That is not, what you want to achieve.]
;W[hq]
(;B[ir]C[No.

White cannot connect here. No need to defend.];W[hr];B[go]C[Careless.]
;W[jp];B[ip];W[iq];B[jr];W[ks]
(;B[dj]C[Is better to play H4?

If it works. Depends on your reading skills.];W[io]C[Now, White forces you to do so.]
;B[hp];W[fr];B[dd]C[Finally a good move.];W[cn]
(;B[dn]C[You do not want to do this.

This is for building a wall.];W[co];B[do];W[cp];B[cq];W[cl]

(;B[fo]C[Why not try to save your group?];W[dm]
(;B[in]C[Is it better to play M5?

That is tough to calculate. However, locally, you should play K5.]
;W[lo]
(;B[em]C[Useless move.];W[el]C[Useless defense.];B[fm]C[Another move like this. Each costs you about 10 points.]
;W[cf]
(;B[ce]C[Is it better to play C12?

Yes. Attaching again and sterngthening White is not what you want.]
;W[df];B[gc];W[fe];B[fd];W[ee];B[jd];W[fl]
(;B[hm]C[Don't fight for this small stuff! White is about to get a really big Moyo.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[gd];B[hd]C[Careless again.]
(;W[he]C[No!

F17 is big enough.];B[ge];W[gf];B[ie];W[gd];B[fc];W[if];B[jf]
;W[hc]C[Nonsense.];B[id];W[ig]
(;B[gl]C[I think maybe O9 is better.

In fact, defending the right group is very necessary, if White connects. I think this move is right.]

(;W[fj]C[Why not larger?];B[gk];W[gj]
