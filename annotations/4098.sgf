C[Sirkut> Hi James.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review your game.  I hope you find it helpful.  I'll precede all my comments with 'Sirkut>'.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[jj]C[How do I take advantage of an opening like this?

Sirkut> The tengen is a very aggressive openning.  Since it gains no territory for your opponent, I feel the best way to deal with it is to treat it as a 'free' move for you and take the time to establish concrete territory.  Black may feel that he's claiming the whole quarter of the board, but that is an illusion.  It is often used more for intimidation.]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[qm];W[kq]CR[np][nq]SQ[jq]C[Sirkut> Here I like K3 better.  In the openning it's generally safe to make a 2-point extension from a single stone, or a 3-point extension from a 2-stone wall.  It'd also make nice symetry by claiming the point directly beneath the tengen.]
;B[iq];W[gq];B[io];W[ko];B[cn];W[cl]SQ[cp]C[dont know if the pincer is best here.

Sirkut> C4 would have been better because it would have closed off your corner giving you solid territory.]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[dn];W[di]C[Sirkut> .. but I like how this turned out for you.]
;B[cf];W[ch]SQ[fd]C[Sirkut> Your corner is worth more to you, while black is still weak and not strongly threatening your side group.  I like F16 instead.  It helps protected the corner while giving influence into the unclaimed side.]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[ef];W[ec]SQ[jc]C[Sirkut> This move is slow, especially considering that black has yet to be especially aggressive.  The two marked stones you could use to pressure black's 3 stones if you got into trouble.  A stone at K16 would be helpful because you could either push towards your two corner stones, or push toward Q16, depending on what comes next.  Or you could follow-up with the more defensive E17 aftwards if you felt threatened.]
;B[mc];W[qf]CR[jc][qk][pl]TR[ic][qh]C[Im not so sure about this invasion Idea but it was the best I could think of.

Sirkut> This is not too bad, however you do need to realize that it invites black to either pincer, or push farther into the empty side (see triangles).  Both of these could give black an sizable advantage.  I think this would have been better after claiming a bit more territory and getting more strength to support you with J17, K17, or maybe Q8/R9.]
;B[qe];W[pf]CR[qi]C[Sirkut> When invading, always try and make a base first.  You don't have time for this move.  R11 would give you the space to make life and stop the upcoming pincer.]
;B[qi];W[rh];B[qh];W[rg];B[oh];W[ri];B[qk];W[rj];B[rk];W[re]
;B[rd];W[pe]CR[jd][nf][qj][qq]C[Sirkut> This move is of little use to you.  It mostly just makes black stronger.  See the marked positions.]
;B[qd];W[ne];B[se]
(;W[rf]C[I probably should have move along the top but I still would have a lot of territory to gain back. also I was afraid of if I played J16 that white would play G17. Maybe the 2 space extention at H 17?

Sirkut> I agree; It is too late to play G17.  H17 is a good move.  I would not have defended at S14 yet because you still had the option of connecting at R13.  It would be relatively safe to wait until black made another threat.]
;B[jc]
(;W[og]CR[ng]C[trying to escape and live

Sirkut> You're inviting black to be aggressive by being so direct.  What about O13?  Or push on black's weak spots first before black seals them.  See variation..]

TR[cd][cf][ef][jm][km][lm][mm][cn][dn][io][bp][cp][iq]C[whats the best way to respond to this attachment

Sirkut> I think you responded well given the circumstances.  G3 was weak and really needed to be strengthened earlier.  While you specifically asked for help with invasions, remeber that sometimes it makes more sense to just reduce instead by pressing into your opponents territory from a strong group.  Also you need to look at the whole board to decide where to invade.. look at your strength and not just black's weaknesses.  Right now black has a loose scattering of weak or small groups, but if you let him connect them all they'll form a huge net to squeeze you from all directions.  Find the joints that need to be cut to keep your opponent week.  Here, if you could connect along the marked lines, black would need to struggle to keep all of his marked stones alive.  Chances are he could keep one or more of them alive, but in the process of making him run you'll keep getting stronger and force him to make some tough decisions about what to abandon.]

Sirkut> Try to push from your live groups.  That's much safer than starting fresh invasions.  See the variations on move 118.]

[sr][qs][rs][ss]C[Sirkut> Remember to look at all 3 ways of reducing your opponents territory.. Invastions -- which require some back-up supporting stones, Reductions -- pressing into moyo from a living group, and cutting groups off before they're completely alive.  

I didn't see a great time to demonstrate it in this game, but remember the 3,3 invasion.  Don't use it too early because it's not very big if black can wall it in, but it can be very useful if you have a group on either side of the corner and your opponent does not have the corner defended with at least 2 stones.

I hope you found this review clear, helpful and that it gave you some things to think about.  It was an interesting game, thanks for sharing it!  Feel free to email me if you have any further questions.]
