AB[pd][dp][pp]C[csh: I am trying to learn how to use thickness to attack. I also have a hard time "recovering" from mistakes. Please let me know if there are higher-level "strategic" mistakes. (I already know there are many tactical ones. :)]
;W[ec];B[de]C[csh: I wanted to build a horizontal wall and not be smushed in the corner. I thought the high kakari was best.]
;W[cd];B[ce];W[ci]LB[bd:A][dd:B]TR[ec][cd]C[csh: I wasn't expecting this move. I didn't think white's marked stones were strong, so I thought he would play at 'a' instead. Since I can no longer make the ideal extension from the wall,  I thought I should push instead.
yes, white should play at A or B.]
(;B[dd]C[i dont like the push so much- see var.];W[dc];B[cc]
TR[ci]C[csh: I thought the cut would give my black group life. I wanted to build thickness, and use it to attack the marked stone later on.]
;W[cb]
(;B[bd]C[csh: Would the extension have been better?
yes, i think the extension would have been better- see var.]
;W[bc]C[your connection is sente, so it is ok];B[cd]LB[bb:a]
[db:b][be:c]C[csh: I thought I *had* to connect. There are no ko fights in the opening. :) I thought the threat of the cut at 'a' and 'b' would make my move sente. I know that I made bad shape, though. I thought that if I cut at 'a' I would be able to make life, since I already had an eye at 'c.' If he protected, I thought I was still out in the center.]
;W[bb];B[ge]LB[gc:A][jc:d][fd:b][gd:c][fe:a][cg:e]C[csh: I thought a two-space jump from a two-stone wall was okay. Is it too loose? Would 'a,' 'b,' or 'c' be better?  I also this move was sente. If white doesn't respond, isn't the extension to 'd' really big? Others commenting on the game said that a small extension, perhaps to 'e,' would be better.
the two space- jump is ok.
e is bad, because there is a rule " if you try to get eyes for your groups, move out into the center".
For a second reason, you  seperate the white groups.
if white doesnt answer this move, i think d is too loose.
A works better to build thickness if white doesnt answer g15]

(;W[gc]
(;B[id]LB[fd:A]C[i dont like this move because i threatens nothing.
you should aproach the white stone on the left.
by the way, a black forcing move at A is sente.that is very important!!]
;W[cn]TR[ci]C[csh: He approached. I thought that splitting the two stones immediately would be better letting him create a sphere of influence with 'a.' I also thought that separating the stones would help me attack the marked stone and give him two weak groups.
i dont think that white gets two weak groups when he invades the corner.]
;B[ck]
(;W[do]LB[cp:a][ep:b]C[csh: Which way, 'a' or 'b'? People commenting after the game were split.
very strange move.]
(;B[cp]C[csh: I chose 'a'. I thought his shape would be too nice if I went the other direction (see variation.) I also thought going the other way would be too easy for him to live in the corner.
this move is correct.];W[ep];B[eq]
(;W[fo]
(;B[fp];W[eo];B[fq];W[ek];B[dj]C[csh: It seemed like splitting them and running away was the only move.]

(;W[bp]C[at the moment, there is no reason for playing here.]
;B[bo]LB[co:a]C[csh: The way I read it, white could not cut at 'a'.]

(;W[cq]C[csh: See variations.];B[bq];W[co];B[ap];W[bn]C[very bad sequence for white.]
;B[pj]LB[ei:b][go:a]C[csh: I thought I was alive in the corner, so I thought the san ren sei was biggest. Other options were 'a' and 'b'. Any comments?
with B you prevent white from pushing at e10.
a is very big to build a moyo on the lower side,
but q10 is ok, i think.];W[nq];B[kq]LB[jq:a]TR[fp][fq]C[csh: I liked this move. It's a pincer, and an extension from my wall. However, would 'a' work better?
yes, a is better, because there should be three spaces between this stone and your two-stone-wall.
generally, this pincer is not so good because you cannot get a good result when white jumps into the corner.]

(;W[op];B[pn]LB[po:b][pq:a]C[csh: In hindsight, this move was really weak. I still don't know what a better answer is, though. Would 'a' or 'b' be better?
A is good];W[pq];B[qp];W[qq];B[oo]
(;W[ei]LB[no:A]C[A is important for white, after playing it you could aim at an invasion in the four-point-extension on the lower side.]

(;W[rc];B[rb];W[sd];B[qh]C[csh: Now I wanted to block him off.]
;W[rh];B[rg]C[csh: This was a serious overplay. I realized it right afterwards. But how do I recover?]

(;B[pg];W[rh];B[qj]C[csh: Whoops! That's not a ko threat. But is letting him connect so bad?]
;W[qh];B[rj];W[rf];B[sg];W[sf];B[si]C[csh: Forced, but at least I'm connected up now. And I've almost solidified territory on the righthand side.
it is not forced, because its only 7 points( small).
your "territorry " on the right is very small, too, when white gets to play s4.]
;W[nh]
(;B[oh]C[csh: Um, I think I was drunk. :) I can't explain this move. I was going for a cut, but obviously I didn't read this out at all. I suppose my question should be, "I know I made a mistake, but what do I do now?"]
;W[oi];B[og];W[pi];B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[oj]

ok, that was the game, i hope you find my comments useful.

Important points are:

1.instead of collecting small points in the middle game you should watch out for opportunities to create large moyos or to prevent your opponents from doing so.
2.it is often better to go into an enemy position from the outside ( like in the upper right corner)

i have no idea what your strength is. can you tell the reviewer when sending a game?- thx]
