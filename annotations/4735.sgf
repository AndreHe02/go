AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Comments by Andre Bergholz (2K), marked with AB.

Yxven [9k\]: Hello
LinYinHao [6k?\]: hi];W[dd];B[cf];W[fc];B[ef]LB[ci:4][di:3]
[cj:2][dj:1]TR[jp]C[AB: Yes, I think 1 (D10) or 4 (C11) are better, 2 is also possible. 3 is worse, because C9 is then a good attacking point for White afterwards. However, I like the marked point the best (K4). This makes miai (two equal continuations) of D10 and Q10, so you are assured to get a large framework. The C14 stone does not need immediate help, there is always the 3-3 invasion.


Would it have been better to play at 1-4 here?];W[ck];B[bd]
TR[ci]C[AB: C11 seems better to me, but I'm not sure...];W[cn]
;B[co]C[AB: Good.];W[dn];B[fp];W[hq];B[gq]LB[go:A][jq:B]C[AB: Maybe not so good. It seems you follow White too much. You need to counterattack, otherwise the game will be too easy for White. G5 is good, because it separates White and aims at both groups. K3 attacks from the side, so that you can hope to gain some territory on the lower right by attacking.]
;W[hp];B[mq];W[cq]C[AB: The 3-3 invasion looks possible to me, but that doesn't mean it's good. If you separate the three White groups, one of them will for sure be in big trouble. So: Let White live in the corner, at the same time strengthen your group, then separate and attack the two outside groups. This should give you a clear advantage in the game.

I was a little shocked he invaded here. It looked secure to me.]

(;B[bp]LB[bo:A]C[AB: B5 would be normal here.];W[eq]
(;B[ep]TR[gr]C[AB: Ok.

I debated this move a lot. I chose it over G2 because I couldn't see all the implications of moving there, and I didn't want to get cut in half.]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[fq]
(;B[dq]LB[gp:A]C[AB: Must connect at G4 here, only move (see variation).]
;W[er];B[dr]C[At least, it played out the way I thought it would.]
;W[gp];B[es];W[fs]C[AB: The result is rather terrible...];B[bn]
C[AB: Good, combines attack and defense.

I just wanted to ensure my corner group was alive and attack his base a little with this move.]
;W[qn];B[rp];W[oq];B[op];W[qq];B[qp];W[nq];B[np];W[mr]
(;B[pq]C[AB: I think the double hane is good (see variation)...]
;W[pr];B[or];W[nr];B[qr]C[AB: Yes, this variation is ok as well.

How was this exchange? It doesn't look that bad to me. Yeah, he got a little territory out of it, but in exchange, I got a solid wall.]
;W[nc];B[pk]LB[fn:B][lq:A]C[AB: This stone is too close to your thickness. It should be at least two lines higher up. Other important points are M3 and F6.


I may have been too happy with my wall. Should I have moved elsewhere?]
;W[qf]
(;B[pf]LB[nd:A][oe:B]TW[gq][fr]C[AB: This is probably not so good as White will be able to counter your influence by following a normal joseki stating with Q13. If anything, you should attach on the stronger stone at O16 or simply separate with P15.

I didn't know where to go here.];W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe];W[qg]

(;B[oc]LB[og:A]C[AB: I think you should cut at P13... You have influence which you need to utilize to fight (see variation).]
;W[nd];B[qc]C[AB: This result is terrible. All your influence is gone for some corner territory.]
;W[on]LB[ol:A][fn:C][lq:B]C[AB: This is an overplay and should be punished. If anything, P8 is more reasonable for White or simple moves like M3 and F6.


Nooo];B[mn]C[AB: Good!];W[ol];B[ok];W[mm]
(;B[nn]C[AB: Not so good as it helps fix White's position (see variation).]
;W[nm]
(;B[ql];W[qm];B[qi]C[AB: The attitude is too submissive as White is not so strong, but the move is not bad.

I realized it was next to two reasonably strong positions, and I didn't want it to die.]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[ri];B[oi];W[ph];B[mk];W[rj];B[qj]LB[rl:A]C[AB: A wasted move, no need to connect this one stone. S8 for example would be much better. It separeates White, threatens to connect your group with T5 or T7. Separation is very important as it has implicit consequences for the White weaknesses aroung P13 or O15.]
;W[nj];B[nk];W[ln]C[AB: Very painful for Black.];B[qh]TR[og]
C[AB: Only helps White.

With this move, I was thinking I might be able to cut at the triangle later, and I figured he'd have to respond to it.]
;W[rh]LB[rl:A]C[AB: The problem now is that White can either connect at S8 or play the game sequence. If you play S8, that at least gives you the possibility to connect your own stones.]
;B[rk];W[mp]
(;B[mo]LB[lo:A]C[AB: Bad shape, didn't they teach you this :-). M6 might have actually helped... (see variation).]
;W[lp];B[lo];W[ko];B[no];W[lm]
(;B[ps]LB[lq:A]C[AB The result is bad. White had managed to escape, his position works well with the G4 group to form a nice territory. The cutting possibilities around L4 and L6 are not so dangerous for the moment. But you have M3 now, so White should probably answer.

This move probably wasn't neccessary, but I tend to play safely when I think they can read better than i can.]
;W[ni];B[li];W[lj]
(;B[lk]C[AB: It seems you should cut right away... (see variation).]
;W[kj];B[kk];W[jj];B[mj];W[mi];B[jk]C[AB: Pushing from behind should be avoided as the opponent is always one step ahead.]
;W[ij];B[jm]C[AB: Again only helps White to fix his weakness. A so called thank-you move.]
;W[jn];B[km];W[kn];B[il]C[AB: You love to lose the initiative :-).]
;W[gf]TR[li][ck][cn][dn]C[AB: The game is over. Unless you can kill the group on the left you will lose. There is some little aji left in the M11 stone, but not that much... (see variation).]

(;B[ci];W[dg]
(;B[cg];W[di];B[dh];W[eh];B[ch];W[eg];B[dj];W[ei];B[ek];W[fn]
C[AB: Long overdue.];B[en];W[em];B[eo];W[cj];B[fl];W[fm];B[dm]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[el];B[gk];W[fj];B[fk];W[dk];B[ej]C[AB: No need to connect one stone here. White is alive anyway.]
;W[gj];B[hk];W[hj];B[rm];W[cc]C[AB: Big.]
(;B[cd]C[AB: You give the alternative yourself.];W[lq];B[oe]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[me];B[mc];W[md];B[mf];W[mg];B[nb];W[mb];B[nh]
TR[og]C[AB No way :-).

I was still hoping I could set up a situation where I'd be able to cut it at the triangle.]

[ap][cq][qq][rq][pr][rr][sr][qs][rs][ss]C[AB: In the end I always like to give some general advice. In your case this is easy. Initiative! You followed White everywhere, you always played the last move in a local situation so that White could chose the next battleground, you say yourself you like to play safely if the other one can read better. That's a bad attitude and the main reason why you lost. You have a three stone advantage. That means in every early fight you should have it easier. White tries to get a balance first before launching an attack. As for reading: Read and decide. If you think a group is alive there is no need to play there, right? You were much too concerned about your own weaknesses and did not explore White's weaknesses. I'm not saying you should blindly attack all the time, but go is a game of balance, and if you only defend you lose. For example, your middle group now has four eyes, that is two more than needed. White always had it easy to settle his groups fast. You must leave his group in uncertainty. One important aspect here is separaing and connecting. If you can connect two of your groups, do it (unless each of them has already two eyes). If you can separate two of your opponent's groups, do it (unless each of them has already two eyes). It's as simple as that. One more thing: You often played moves that actually helped White more than they helped you. Yes, they were sente, but then White could fix his weaknesses for not much gain for you. Ok, I hope this review was helpful, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at bergholz@gmail.com.
