C[Hi!  I am (or was at least before college ate into my time) a 4k on kgs.  I will use "Ix" before further comments.  

---------------------------------------------------,
Hello, I'm black in this game

i won this game on resign,
the fun is that he already lead much, but because
he still played some attacking move <greedy??>
i take the lead.^^

Thanks for reviewing!];B[jj]C[gonyanya [12k\]: hi there
Yunaleska [12k\]: hi

Ix:  Tengen--I do not play it but faced it many times.  The key for black to win is in making use of this opening stone.  The reason is because moves this early are worth lots of points.]
;W[dp]
(;B[hj]C[Ix:  VERY bad.  This is too close to the tengen.];W[qp]
;B[lj]C[Ix:  Black has now wasted two moves.];W[ec];B[cd];W[pd]
TR[hj][jj][lj]C[Ix:  White has 3 corners now and is up on territorty.  While black has the 3 marked stones.  They are not sufficient compensation BUT they are what black has.  My favorite tactic is to use such a strong group for attack.  

TRY TO CHASE A GROUP INTO THEM.  Black can then pick up points while a group tries to thrash around escaping.]

(;B[dc]C[Ix:  This is not common.  This touches a weak stone.   Better is to pincer.]
;W[ed];B[nd]
(;W[qf]C[Ix:  I think white makes a mistake here.  Extension from the E16 group or try to seal the black c16 group in are both nice options.]

(;B[of]C[Ix:  Better here is to play c14.  This stone just is not that useful.  A muyo is possible but easily prevented.]

(;B[de]LB[dc:2][cd:1][nd:6][of:7][hj:3][jj:4][lj:5]C[i played D15 because i think Because tengen is black`s, corner is not really valuable for black.

 your comment??

Ix:  The reason why this is a very bad move--it allows white to settle immediately in blacks sphere of influence.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[db]C[Ix:  White is almost impossible to kill now.  Worse--black now has to play a move to fix his shape so he ends in gote.]
;B[ce]
(;W[cj]
(;B[bh]TR[bb][bc][cd][ce][de]C[Ix:  Mistake--way too conservative.   The marked stones do not need to seek life.   They can go towards the center (plenty of help there) or make life if need be in the corner. 

I would look to play elsewhere.];W[cm]C[* i not really happy about my B12 *

Ix:  This was a bit passive for white.  P3 is big.];B[dm]C[Ix:  Black wants a fight.]

(;W[dl]C[Ix:  Generally better then hane is to just extend.  It leaves black with sort of a funny position.  This just invites trouble.]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[cn]
(;W[bm]C[Ix:  Wonder why white did not take (?)];B[dn];W[el]
;B[bn]
(;W[bp]C[B4 supprized me, are myB6 not really sente??.

Ix:  White did not want to lose the corner.  He has to capture the stone in my opinion.  Otherwise the D8 group will be VERY difficult and costly to save.]
;B[bl];W[bk]C[Ix:  Bad for 3 reasons:

1.  It forces black to take which spoils a possible ko threat.  

2.  Makes a empty triangle which is bad shape.

3.  It is not quite good enough for a killing attack.];B[am]

(;B[ep];W[do];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr]
(;B[bo];W[cp]LB[co:A]C[Ix:  Notice the way that black has played allowed white a extra liberty at A.  In a capture race this can be the difference between winning and losing.]

(;B[gq];W[hq]
(;B[fr];W[es]TR[en][fn][go][hp][hq]C[Ix:  There is a very important point to rememeber here.  The group is dead as it is. Play elsewhere!  This group can be a very nasty ko threat.  Also other play on the board may weaken the marked white group later on.]
;B[hr];W[ir];B[fs]C[UPS.. misread, used to think after i play G1 and he play F1 ,G2 becomed false eyes >.<]
;W[hs];B[ho];W[gr];B[dr];W[ds];B[cs];W[bs];B[ar];W[fp]C[Ix:  Notice how white has been forced to kill black.  Now few ko threats.]
;B[ap];W[fq]C[after this i am reallized that i had lost in semai, and that he already lead much in this game...]
;B[em]TR[ce][de][bh][hj]C[so i just try to cut him as much as possible.

Ix:  It is a very good idea!  The whole point is to make the C10 group make life which will be challenging.  Black has a lot of power in the area with the marked stones.]
;W[fl];B[fm]
(;W[gm]C[Ix:  This is a mistake.  White can not play and hope that black does not cut.  Better is to run to the center.]
;B[gl];W[gk];B[hl];W[hk];B[hm]

Ix:  White is winning right now. 

 I have black with only about 30 points.

C[from here he make many mistakes, he played like he want to take all part of the board, and oftenlly the one who get advantages from his attack is me :D.

i think if he played more defendsive he will won this game.

what do you think?

Ix:  I agree.  Play very solidly and white wins.  What white tries to do is save the H9 group.  He is winning even if it dies.  He should abandon it.]

 Ix:   I thought black played a decent game after in the last half.  Especially well done was punishing white for trying to hold on to everything.   Here are a couple of suggestions on how to improve this part of your game:

1.  Work on your fuseki.  Opening Theory Made Easy  by Hideo is a well worth a read.  

2.  Do not let opponent groups settle easily.  Also if you can take time out to make life it is generally worth the move even if you will cost a bit of territory.

3.  Try to keep your groups attached.  Big groups are very hard to kill.]
