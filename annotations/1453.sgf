C[Hi,

I am White in this game. My level is approx 15-20k. I played this game against a friend. It was his first "serious" game and it was my first in a long time (several months).
We had a strange fight in the upper-right corner, and I made several big mistakes which cost me the game.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc]C[Black: I don't know already the opening so I tried some different]
;W[qq]C[White: I almost never play san-san directly, I general play 4-4. I wanted to try something new and see how it worked.]
;B[nc];W[ce]C[White: I thought better to take the shimari than defend my corner. I thought Black would defend his corner with something like E16.]
;B[qf]C[Black: I try to keep sente here. but now, I think that i should have played a defense move on the upper left, probably c16 or g17]
;W[fc]C[White: here I thought that losing one corner would be compensated by gaining another, so I kept with my attack on the upper-left corner.]
;B[oe]C[Black: i think i already have the corner so i try to avoid the escape of the white stone]
;W[jc]C[I think I would have played w E16 to match black's P15  !]

(;B[ed]C[may be lax.  often, attaching at D15 better than just diagonal at E16 .  see VAR 2 on previous move.]

(;W[cn]C[because of black's lax move in upper left, I'd like to see w play VAR 2 in prev move]

(;B[fp]C[how about b in VAR 2 at previous move];W[dj];B[op]
C[I still don't like b leaving those 2 stones baseless in upper left]
;W[po]C[White: I didn't really know how to respond, but I thought this would let us share the corner.]
;B[lq]C[White: Here Black didn't play q3 and I have been wanting to play P3 or P2 for the longest time time in the game, but never found the right time.

Black: I found his move more like a threat so i try to get  support for my stone. Maybe it would have been better if I had attacked at p3 instead of p4 ? Anyway, I get the lower side as expected.]
;W[qe]C[White: I wanted to live in the corner or manage to escape. I expected back to let me and take a lot of influence. Is this a bad idea? Should have I just forgotten about the stone?
This began our strange fight.];B[qc]C[I think I like b Q14 better.]

(;W[pf]C[since b didn't play Q14, w can play VAR 2 in prev move]

(;B[qg]C[I would be agressive with b q15.  See VAR 2 in prev move.]
;W[of]C[I think w needs to connect at Q15];B[pe]C[this is why]
;W[od];B[ne]C[Black: i respond atari];W[qd]
(;B[rd]C[I like b in VAR 2 in prev move better];W[pc]
(;B[pb]C[how about b in VAR 2 in prev move];W[qb];B[rc]C[Black: without reading]
;W[ob];B[re]C[Black: I inderstood my mistake and I tried to suround him hopping he couldn't live.]
;W[rb];B[pa]C[looks good but you have to follow it up better]
;W[oa]
(;B[sb]C[see b in VAR 2 on prev move];W[qa];B[nb]C[White: I guess here I got lucky that the white group in o15 ha do so few liberties.

Black: Again, I tried killing too hard. Letting white play o16 and threatening my own stones. I thougt he couldn't escape]
;W[nd];B[md]C[Black: I didn't pay attention to my own safety.]
;W[mc];B[mb]C[Black: bn15 should have better then bo13, leaving my stones and keeping influence.]
;W[lc];B[lb]C[Black: Again, I don't see double atari on wn15]
;W[me];B[nf]C[Black: Know, I realised my mistake, thinging ths corner was mine but I think also that his stones have only one eyes for the moment]
;W[ld];B[ng]C[Black: To avoid 2 w stones pq14 to escape];W[kb]
C[White: this move was useless. I should have played something like g15 or m13, or even better: r10 or or c3/j3]

(;B[le]C[white thick now so b shouldn't play M15.  How about var 2 in prev move]
;W[mf]C[White: another bad move? Should I have played L15 if i wanted to play in this area?]
;B[lf]C[dangerous for b since w may get splitting attack between M14 and E16 stones.  How about var 2 in prev move.]
;W[mg];B[jf]C[White: This wouldn't have happened if i had played L15 earlier.

Black: My stones are now cut. I tried to live and reach upper left corner to rescue my 2 stones there.]

(;W[je]C[w attacking too closely.  how about w  in VAR 2 in prev move]
;B[kg]C[Black: Better way to connect ?];W[if]C[White: Trying to get out in the world rather than stay enclosed in my area.]
;B[ig]C[b defending nicely, w not making ground];W[he]C[White: ARGL! A real bad move(tm)? It seems h14 was SO much better!]
;B[hf]C[White: Instant punishment for my bad move

Black:  give atari to reinforce my stones];W[ie];B[hg]C[Black: I tried to get thickness, influence and rescue my upper left cornered stones]
;W[lg];B[ff]C[w should be aiming at the cuts at F15 and E14, but w may need to strengthen the C15 stone first.  For b's part, maybe H13 stones are strong enough and b should play C16 instead of F14 .]
;W[mi]C[how about D13 for w to make profit.]
(;B[oi]C[maybe b in VAR 2 in prev move];W[nh];B[og]C[Black : answer atari knowing i'll be cut So, maybe I should have played p12 instead of p11.]
;W[oh];B[pg]C[Black : I think BIack can live on the upper right side now but white built some influence in the center]
;W[ph]C[b P11 is silly];B[qh]C[Black: keeping territory maybe br11 is better ?]
;W[kh]C[small.  How about w D13 instead.]
(;B[jg]C[small.  how about VAR 2 in prev move instead];W[ii]
C[this w move is slack and gives b a chance to fix his weakness]
;B[dg]C[now b fixes his weakness.];W[cg]C[White: When I played this move, it looked dubious to protect and connect my stones, but i couldn't find a better one.]

(;B[df]C[b let w off the hook.  I like b VAR 2 in prev move better]

(;W[dh]C[w on the hook again.  I prefer  w VAR 2 in prev move.]
;B[cd]C[b letting w off the hook again.]
(;W[fh]C[how about w VAR 2 in prev move.]
(;B[gf]C[w couldn't cut here.  how about b in VAR 2 in prev move.]
;W[fd]C[b missed opportunity to take away w's profit here.  (see previous variations)]
;B[cf]C[Black: Now I can cut since bc16];W[bf]C[White: I think I should have given up my stone here. Black had too many opportunities to cut and kill me (I only saw that in the after game review, though).]

(;B[de]C[no.  b missed opportunity.  see VAR 2 in prev move.]
;W[be];B[bd]C[Black: the only answer. So my previous move was gote.]
;W[bh]C[White: I was lucky: Black was nice in this development.]
;B[eb]TR[qm][cp]C[seems small.  The triangled spots look bigger for b.]
;W[qk]C[leaves a gap at R7.  Maybe w R8 is better.  But C3 looks bigger.]
;B[ip]C[maybe b B5 bigger since it makes b bigger and w smaller.  This J4 only makes b bigger but doesn't make w smaller.]
;W[fn]C[w c3 still looks bigger.];B[qj]C[seems small.  How about b B5 ?]
;W[pj]C[White: Now that I look at it again, this doesn't seem like a very good move. If i wanted to protect the territory, s10 seems better or r9 maybe? Maybe something like o6 too.]
;B[pi];W[rj]C[White: this is definitely bad :(];B[ni];W[mh]
;B[qi];W[nk];B[ri]C[both players ignoring big stuff in lower left]
;W[rk]C[now w fixed up defect at R7 so b lost opportunity.]
;B[cp]C[White: was this the right time to play c4 for black?

Black: gote but protecting wild area. Now, i think, i can keep the corner.]
;W[in]C[seems too much to hope for for w]
(;B[kn]C[this b leaves a hole];W[mn]C[end of comments.];B[mo]
;W[nn];B[no];W[oo];B[pp];W[qp]C[Black: What if white played q3 instead ? black stones are weak i think]
;B[pq];W[np]C[White: I left way too many weaknesses to play this! I should have played p7 or r5]
;B[nq]C[Black : geta is already there at m3. Can't white play the hane at q2 there ?]
;W[mp];B[lo]C[Black : I forgot atari threat but I read it];W[pr]
;B[oq];W[mr]C[White: If i really wanted to do this, I should have played o5 so I could connect my stones and use the damezumari on the p3 group as a threat if black tries to kill them. This move (n2) doesn't work.]
;B[mq];W[nr];B[or]C[Black : He should have attacked wo2 (instead of wn2) or played p2 here (instead of wo2)]
;W[qn]C[White: a bit late to play this. I should have played R2.

Black: luckyly, he can't play hane at p1];B[jm]C[Black : trying to destroy white territory. Am I too carefull ? l8 isn't better ?]
;W[ln]C[White: Starting here, I don't really understand what I'm doing anymore.]
;B[ko];W[kl]C[Black : wk8 isn't the right answer ?];B[il];W[jn]
;B[km];W[im];B[jl];W[hl];B[jj];W[ij];B[kk];W[ll];B[lm];W[mm]
;B[ml]C[Black : I didn't think much here. this stone is doomed]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[lj];B[mj]C[Black : Giving two more stones since I know white can play o10]
;W[nj];B[pk]C[Black : Just trying to get a stone in exchange]
;W[oj]C[white: Here's the big mistake I was talking about at the beginning of the game. I should of course capture with o8.]
;B[nl]C[Black : Big mistake so I rush];W[ol]C[white: and another one. I should play p7]
;B[ok]C[Black: I beleave this move cost him about 15 moku];W[pl]
C[white: once again i should play p7 (or p6)];B[on]C[Black : I think there are too many weakness in his structure and he didn't pay attention to that]
;W[om];B[nm]C[Black : I'm making a huge come back. 10 moku I think]
;W[pn];B[li]C[Black : lucky move I didn't forecast];W[ki];B[kj]
C[Black: Another 10 moku];W[qr]C[White: it's too late or to early to play here now. I should try to find bigger moves elsewhere on the board. On the other hand, this was sente, so not really a big loss.]
;B[os]C[Black : forced move];W[jp]C[White: A useless move. From now on, I think i'll play a very bad yose. I can't seem to find an opportunity and all my moves  seem to be gote. I am very submissive to black and probably lose many points: (]
;B[jo];W[io];B[hp]C[Black: Avoiding atari];W[ik];B[ho]C[Black : br8 is better, wq7, then bs8 but I didn't saw it]
;W[hm];B[lj]C[Black: Aiming at the 2 stones L11 and L12];W[ql]
;B[lh];W[md];B[ji];W[ih];B[jh];W[gh]C[White: Here I have sente and instead of playing a16, L15 or B5  I play what seems like a big move at the time (what if black starts devastating my territory?) but is hopelessly gote.]
;B[kf]C[Black: bl15 is better];W[fb]C[White: anothe gote move. But this one is also quite small.]
;B[gn]C[Black: I tried to attack the left side territory];W[gm]
;B[en];W[em];B[dn];W[go];B[hn];W[fo];B[eo];W[dm];B[gp]C[Black: f8 is better, no ?]
;W[fm];B[bo];W[bn];B[co];W[ec]C[white: This move isn't really useful. It started a sequence I had misread, I thought i'd be able to capture some stones in the area.]
