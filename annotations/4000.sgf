C[This was a very bad game for me, i'm around 20k or so, and lately to get stronger, i've been trying new strategies and new moves. I had to resign the game had gotten so bad.
I would appreaciate it if you could help me out.
really what i think i need most of this game is just an assesment of my plays in general, cause i have to be doing something wrong to lose so badly.

I'll do my best.. :-)]PL[B];B[dp];W[qd];B[dd];W[pq];B[od]LB[po:a]
[fq:b]C[i've never seen anybody play there before, so ignored it.

At 20k level, that's fine. At my level, I guess it's fine also, though I would think that maybe something around A is bigger than B (because of the asymmetry of 3-4 point). At a higher level I have no idea of course.

The approach is a perfectly normal approach. It's called the "high" approach, look at some of the variations here.]

Very slow, very solid -- too solid for this situation, meaning it's "heavy."

This is the beginning of a series of slow moves which I think made the game very difficult for you. They didn't LOSE the game (it takes a lot to lose a game properly at the level we amateurs play!), but it made it difficult.]
;B[eo]
(;W[fo]C[

You're moving too slow. A diagnoal move is faster than a solid extension. (For example, think of how the diagnoal of a triangle is about 1.4 cm when each of the sides are 1 cm. So you cuold say that black is actually covering about 40% more grounds than you.)]

Bad, only solidifies black.];B[en];W[hm];B[gl];W[ho]C[I just tried to escape and ended smushed against a giant black.

It was all because you escaped too slow. That first move hurt you a lot because suddenly you were committed to save those two heavy stones in all future fighting, and so you were always fighting at a disadvantage.]

The game is very very very hard for white already; most of this because of the incredible power black has built up here...

And because you didn't kill, the white center group is pretty much just a liability.]

Stil playing slow moves.

When you are behind and you are fighting for your life, you *have* to create as much confusion and chaos as you can.

Yes it might be futile, but you and your opponent are playing at a 20k level; 50 points or more can shift back and forth in the blink of an eye.]

C[at this point, i really think i had chance of winning, though i could done some reducing with my center white group, but that wouldn't have given me the game.
If you see any major or minor mistakes in my play, please tell me so.

You are correct in that yes, white has lost rather badly.

Main mistakes were A, B, C etc, giving black a very powerful wall. Then you let the group marked D live. And finally you let E die (you should have run out promptly not half-heartedly try to live).

But more generally than that, you lost this game because you play with incredibly *bad shape* and your opponent has, overall, much better shape. Shape is a higher level concept (something higher than my own level probably, but I know the basics); you play empty triangles, heavy movies, seemingly afraid of the one-space jump and diagonal play... Understand that even a two-space jump can be irrefutably *connected* (just like a series of solid extensions) under some circumstances! (E.g. close to the edge.) But in many cases being cut can be good for you because the fight that ensues will be very favorable to you if you're willing to make but a small sacrifice (e.g. the very tail of a chain).

But...

General advice I can give you:

* Never play solid extensions unless the opponent actually attaches (touches) you (diagonal touching counts!). Never. Try it!

* Corollary of the above: speed! Speed of development is very important in the beginning. Try to avoid playing too close to the opponent and concentrate on the wide open spaces instead. If you are surrounded on both sides (e.g. pincered), look for a way out! (Jump into the center or jump into the corner, don't be afraid to give up the original stone if you can make proper compensation.)

* You do not seem to be a real daredevil in fighting. :-) Do go problems or jump around a lot, complicate situations! Two things might happen: you will have to think about complicated tactical situations and you exercise your reading ability, or, you will meet someone just like yourself who will play very solid, slow moves during fights, and he or she will get surrounded very easily and you will build huge walls and moyos.

* Corollary to the above: playing the "shape game" will help you immensely if you have a friend who plays roughly at your level. http://senseis.xmp.net/?ShapeGame]

This is a lot better than your move in the game and also kinda standard.

Do not worry about the single-space jump being cut. In nine cases out of ten, if you ARE cut, you'll actually end up with a better result than if you weren't!
