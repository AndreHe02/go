AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Dear reviewer,

Thanks for spending your time to my game. I am White, giving three stones to my friend Chris. Black wins by two points. I have listed comments and questions through the game.

Dieter Verhofstadt (dv)

reid:  Hello, Dieter.  I hope my comments are helpful.  I always suggest that anything I say should be heard with skeptical ears.  If something doesn't make sense to you, it could just as easily be my problem as yours.]
;W[pq];B[qo];W[pl];B[oo]LB[no:A][np:B]C[reid: Usually, black jumps two spaces here, to A (O5).  The reason is that white's response at B (O4) is just too good.]
;W[np];B[no]C[dv wrong];W[mp]C[reid: In an even game, this exchange is too good for white.  In a handicap game, it may be OK.  Black wants to build thickness.]
;B[qq];W[qr]C[dv: tempting to push in at q4 instead

reid: tempting, but after black answers white A (Q4) with B (R4), the corner is already alive and white has almost nothing.  The hane (R2) seems inevitable.  Black is still mostly settled, but at least white gets some profit.]
;B[pp];W[oq];B[rq];W[fc]LB[qf:A]TR[pl]C[reid: Black has built up a lot of strength against the marked stone (Q8). - it might be prudent to play at A (R14).  On the other hand, white wants to move fast in a handicap game, so F17 is not bad either.]
;B[hc];W[fe];B[df];W[id]LB[kc:A]TR[no][oo]C[reid: this joseki usually results in outside thickness for white (although it doesn't in this game :-).  Since black already has the marked stones (at O5), white's thickness would not be very useful.

I think white should try a pincer around A instead.];B[gd]C[reid: I've never seen this response to this joseki :-)]
;W[fd];B[ge]C[dv bad shape];W[fg]LB[he:B][gf:A]C[reid: this doesn't look to good for black, but white has to take advantage!  Jumping to F13 is too easy.  White needs to make black pay for this mistake - push him into bad shape.

How?  I think the hane at A (G14) is best.  Black has almost no choice but the empty triangle at B (H15).  White should not fear the cut (especially in a handicap game), because the corner is still open.]
;B[ie];W[je];B[if];W[gf]TR[je]C[dv 25: right after playing it, it felt wrong. Should I play E12 instead? Do I lean against a strong grooup - or do I strengthen a weak one? It would really help me to know whether this move was good or bad.

reid: I think the marked stone (K15) is the one that's too early.  White would prefer to settle one side first, then think about doing something with the weak stone at J16.

However, black could have done better, I think.  See the variation.]

(;B[jd];W[kd]LB[jc:A]TR[je]C[dv: I want to play on both sides of his group and attack his UR corner. Should I leave the atari unplayed ?

reid: Yes, I think so.  This is "aji-keshi" which translates to something like "erasing the bad taste".  The marked stone (K15) was also aji-keshi - white should leave both of these for later.

The easiest way to think about it is to determine which play (L16 or A-K17) is best.  The answer at the moment is "I don't know", so it's best to play neither.

It's even easier to consider the K15 stone as aji-keshi when you think that white might rather play J14 in exchange for black K15.  At the moment, it's just too early to know.]
;B[jc];W[pf]LB[jb:C][kc:B][nc:D][qf:A]C[reid: Hmmm, low (A-R14) would probably be easier to settle, since black is pretty strong all around.  The sequence white B (L17), black C (K18), white D (O17) would be even easier.

One thing to keep in mind in a handicap game: you're not going to win unless you get some help from your opponent.  That means you can't make it easy for him to split you up and keep your groups unsettled.  You need to present him with hard choices:  groups that are already alive, or so difficult to attack that he makes mistakes.  The more easy choices you give him, the more likely he is to make good moves :-)]
;B[qi]C[reid:  Like this :-)  It's almost a no-brainer for black.]
;W[kc]C[dv: I feel this is a little overplay

reid:  Well, it's OK as a forcing move, but you've got four weak groups on the board now, so it might be a bit difficult to get things settled.]
;B[jb];W[nd];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[qe];W[qb];B[qf]C[dv: the last two black moves were too easy on white, especially given the presence of the pincer

reid:  If you're going to play Q17, then you need to play P17 (although a cut at R16 might be interesting, if a bit dangerous).  But I agree that R18 is a bit slow.  Perhaps white should have gone all the way into the corner with R17 instead of Q17.  That way at least one group gets settled.]
;W[pi];B[pj]C[reid: another easy choice for black.];W[oj]C[reid: I think a cross-cut would give black more to think about here.]
;B[ph];W[oi];B[qj]C[reid: If black is going to connect at R10, it's better to leave the atari at Q12 unplayed.  Aji-keshi again.]
;W[fq]LB[dh:A]C[dv: I can't really abandon my stones at the right side, but it's a handicap game.

reid: True, but he's only three stones weaker than you - he knows a weak group when he sees one :-)

Also, you have no hope of winning a moyo game at this point - you have too many weak groups, and black has too much center strength.  So it's better to try something like A (D12) to try to strengthen your weak groups in sente, if you can.]
;B[eq]LB[dh:B][di:A]C[reid: Normally, this is a bad move because it helps white get strong.  Since we know that white cannot win a moyo game, it may be OK, but I think extending to A (D11) or B (D12) is more important - and almost sente!]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[nl];B[fn]C[reid:  Black just plays easy moves.]
;W[iq];B[dh];W[cl]C[dv: With two relatively weak groups on the board, this is yet another overplay. But can I just give him the whole side ?

reid: Yeah, white is really struggling here.

If you get to the point where you have to make choices between bad alternatives, then the problem is not here, but in earlier moves.]
;B[cj];W[dj];B[ci];W[cq]LB[el:A][bn:B]C[reid:  This is greedy.  If white runs out with A (E7), then black will have a hard time protecting against both C3 and B (B6).  Black B might do it, but the aji in this area would be a heavy burden for black to bear.]
;B[cp];W[fi]C[dv: After two submissive answers, I reinforce my group before jumping into the corner.]
;B[ej];W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[be]LB[fb:A]C[reid:  Hmmm, white should think about playing A (E18) before this move.  It could have serious impact on the black H17 group.]
;B[cf]C[Giving away sente];W[er];B[dr];W[dq];B[cr];W[ep];B[bq]
;W[fj]LB[em:C][qm:A][rr:B]C[dv: Maybe I should reinforce my right group and start threatening his LR corner ?

reid: Difficult to threaten the corner.  Looks like black A (R7) and B (S2) are miai.  Plus, he still has access to the center.  But a white forcing move at C (E7) would be a good idea before C17.]
;B[bd];W[cd];B[ce];W[bc]LB[bf:A]C[reid:  Any reason for not playing A (B14) first?  Might be the two points white needs :-)]
;B[bf];W[ad]C[dv: Black keeps sente but loses points.

reid: Yes, black should simply play at B14 instead of B16.]
;B[ek]LB[em:A]C[reid: now it's too late for the forcing move at A (E7).]
;W[ig]LB[fb:B][jf:A][gl:C]C[dv: I was particularly  proud of this move. This is tipically the move you get either praised or scolded by the stronger player. Dear reviewer, which is it ?

reid:  Well, I am also fond of the nose hit, but in this case it looks like black's answer at A (K14) takes the sting out this particular tesuji.  It's difficult for white to do *anything* around here because the F15 group is so weak.  Again, B (F8) threatening to connect while looking to attack the K17 group might be a good plan.  Or C (G8) threatens to wake up the aji in the C8 stone while helping surround center territory and strengthening the O8 group.]
;B[jf];W[mo]C[dv: I was aiming for this move for a long time. AMAOF, it invites the cut. Maybe I should simply reinforce the right group and make him run with me along the 4th line ?

reid: If it were me, I'd want to connect that K15 stone.  Without that, there is no hope of attacking the K17 group, and the white L17 group has a *lot* of bad aji (as you find out later).

N5 is big, but it's not particularly urgent.  The proverb says "play the urgent move, not the big move".]
;B[nm];W[mm];B[ml];W[nn];B[om];W[ol];B[rr]LB[ql:B][pm:A][on:C]
C[reid: Black A (Q7) looks bigger.  White probably can't let black get A and B (R8) because the side is too big, but white B may not even be sente (because of black C-P6 and S2).]
;W[on];B[pm];W[pn];B[qm];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm];B[ql];W[ro];B[rl]
;W[sn];B[pr];W[or];B[qs]C[dv: While playing the sequence, I felt quite powerful, but in the end I just lose points in the corner, while my group is still cut off.]
;W[mj];B[lm];W[mn];B[ll];W[kj];B[il];W[fk];B[fl];W[gl];B[gm]
;W[el];B[fm];W[ei];B[dk];W[di]LB[ck:A][dl:B]C[reid: Better to leave D11 for later.  It's only three points, but white loses a liberty and possibly two ko threats (A and B).  Black D11 would be three points in reverse sente]
;B[ck]C[dv: White hasn't achieved much.

reid:  True, but black has such a superiority of stones in this area that white can't really expect much.]
;W[jg];B[lf];W[kg];B[kb];W[mc]C[dv: I immediately regretted this shape: the peep at O18 is simply too easy for Black.]
;B[oh]LB[pb:B][rb:A][rc:C]C[reid: Hmmm, instead of P12, black could get nasty with A (S18).  If white connects at B (Q18), black is much better than the game.  If white plays ko with C (S17), it's heavy for white.]
;W[rc];B[qd];W[ij]LB[jn:B][jo:A]C[reid: difficult to make territory in the center.  Maybe white A (K5) is better.  Or perhaps B (K6) threatening to cut off three stones.]
;B[jo];W[kp];B[ip];W[hq];B[li]C[dv: This is where Black starts to play rather clumsily.

reid:  Blacks left side is 35 points. Whites lower side is 25.  Black's lower right corner equals white's upper left.  Center territory is pretty close to even.  So white's upper right needs to be ten points bigger than black's right and K17 groups.  Looks like black can just play easy endgame and wrap things up.]
;W[lj];B[lg];W[mi];B[kh]LB[gb:G][lb:D][rd:C][af:F][mh:A][ko:E]
[os:B]C[dv: bad shape

reid: Yeah.  If black plays a A (N12), he threatens to take as much around O13 as white is getting in the center.  Anyway, B through G all look like moves that black would like to get to before the sequence starting with M13.]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[kf]C[dv: This is of course what I have been aiming for since move 85. White can't afford to lose the ko.]
;B[ke];W[le];B[je];W[me];B[ng]C[dv: Painful. The other jump would have saved the day.

reid: OK, there's the ten point difference between white's lower side and black's left side.]
;W[mg];B[ko];W[lb];B[ld]C[dv: Of course, I still lose two stones.]

(;W[mf];B[hg];W[ih];B[hh];W[hi];B[hf];W[lc]C[dv: Well, ...]
;B[fb];W[hl];B[hm];W[ik];B[jq];W[kq];B[jp];W[jr];B[rd];W[jl]
;B[im];W[rb];B[eq];W[jm];B[jn];W[sl];B[rk];W[dq]C[dv: It's yose time now. Black wins by 2 points. In general I feel my yose is OK, or at least I know the moves and principles but sometimes forget to apply them, so right now I don't have questions on the subject.

Thanks a lot.

reid:  Looks to me like black is 5 to ten points ahead at the moment, so if you got it down to two, you did pretty well.

Handicap games are difficult, and I personally think that two and three stone games are the most difficult.  Your opponent is strong enough that you cannot bowl him over with some fancy tesujis.  He's going to see *most* of what you are seeing (you should assume he'll see everything, anyway).  That means that if you leave a weakness in your shape, he will probably find it.

White must remember that he's got the whole game to make up the small head-start that black begins with.  White must maintain patience and confidance that black *will* make the mistakes that let white win.  White needs to play honestly and not try to swindle black,  Keep your options open, and avoid aji-keshi.  Above all, don't help your opponent make good moves - encourage him to make bad ones.

In the long run, it's not the great moves that win you the game, it's the bad ones that lose it.]
