LB[of:a][nc:b][ph:c]C[joseki is 'a', making miai of 'b' and 'c']
;W[mc];B[md]C[I would not want to push here, as this makes the upper side worthless, hurting the ambitions of the star-point stone at D16.
by 'worthless' I mean that W gets a solid low position, and B gets a wall pressing from above, so neither side can make a lot of territory there (I guess you know that :)]
;W[ld]C[reckless ! the general attitude would be to let B build thickness, then use R13 to help reduce what area B can get there; the B group cannot be seen as a target for attack right now.]
;B[nc];W[nb];B[lc];W[mb];B[kc]C[B took the chance. after W M15 B J16, W can't connect the 2 stones to the 1 in one move, so B gets out and the B group becomes a splitting group. see variation for one possible way.]

(;W[kd];B[jc]C[it is generally bad style to "push the cart from behind" meaning pushing the opponent ahead.
W should just nobi at M15.];W[jd];B[ic];W[he]C[not so good. this is ok when the head stone of the opponent (J17 here ) is a jump, then this knight move threatens the attachment (here at H17).
but since B extended solidly, these pushes help B solidify his position, and W gets not enough for it.
Perhaps the basic mistake is seeing the B group at Q15 as a target for attack in this early stage.]
;B[id];W[ie];B[kf]LB[je:a][gd:b][mf:c]C[hmm, also too soon I believe. when W connects solidly, B still needs a move around G16, and the peep remains not very coordinated with B's main stones. W can play 'c' and start a free-for-all fight. Simpler to defend , and solidly take advantage of W's play, leaving open various options of aiming at W's weakness. If W decides to spend a move to defend there - that's ok too.

This way is possible too, of course - the fight is feasible for both sides, and L14 is certainly a vital point. What I am saying is, solidly taking advantage where you find it is better than a fight that you can't really predict.]
;W[jf]C[oh, not good answer, should connect solid.];B[le]C[the peep becomes a very good move now, building B's group in sente. compare : if W connects solidly and then B plays M15, W would want to jump ahead around J12, not crawl slowly to K14...]
;W[je];B[gd];W[ph]C[again, the B group is not a target, even more so now that you have the relatively weak and bad-shaped group of K14. it is ok to defend on the right side, as B has no immediate severe attack on K14, but simply taking R10 is the move. when B gets out, you'll need to spend moves for K14 group, so R13-Q12 will come under attack.

note that B can afford to answer G15 with a hane. it leaves bad aji for him, but if K14 group comes under severe attack, you can't rely on a submissive answer to G15 .]
;B[kg]C[hmm, a bit too slow to my taste. how about
 K12 ? see variations.];W[ih];B[rb];W[ra];B[sb];W[oc];B[pa]
C[good. W can't take p15 now, must defend.];W[qa];B[oe];W[lb]
;B[kb];W[la]LB[ki:a]C[ok , let's step back and estimate the position.
B has a nice formation on the upper side, that is not yet big territory since 3-3 invasion is still possible.  W has 2 unsettled groups, B has one, and with easy eye-space if needed. when B moves out at 'a' for example (urgent) , W will have to choose what to defend first. neither W groups should die, but B can profit from attacking.

so, advantage definitely B's.];B[ge]LB[ki:a]C[too slow. G15 is W's sente (if B does not see a quick way to kill W, B should extend solidly in response), true, but it also solidifies B's area, so W should not be in a hurry to play it.
and if W takes 'a', he starts to surround the B group - it would be very bad if B has to make 2 eyes inside. B can cut this knight move-cap, but  W welcomes the fight .]
;W[gh]LB[ki:a]C[notice how G15 now looks good in gauging out W's eye space. W should have still capped at 'a'. however, if now B 'a', W can ignore it and defend the left side.]
;B[qm]C[good, patient move. since neither Q12 nor K14 are attractive targets now, B invades, leaving room for 2-space extension on both sides.]
;W[qk];B[qp];W[qr];B[om]C[good.];W[ok];B[jp]LB[ki:a]C['a' is still shouting.
K4 makes N3 look very good for W. the 4th line is the line of potential, and low, solid opponent  stoned nearby limit that potential.
if B is reluctant to play K3, making a low position at the bottom, how about around D12 ? it has a nice aim at the floating W group.]
;W[mp]C[good , seperating the B stones];B[lq]C[if you want to play here, L3 is better style.
but the left side is much more urgent.];W[mq];B[ce]C[feels a little over-concentrated]
;W[ro]C[not a fery effective attack.];B[qo];W[rn];B[rm];W[rp]
;B[oo]LB[mm:a]C[too slow, B needs to jump out to 'a'. no need to worry about the R5 stones - i W cuts, sacrifice them.]
;W[mm];B[nl];W[mj];B[ml];W[lm];B[ll];W[km];B[kl];W[jm];B[kj]
;W[ik];B[li];W[gp]C[good use of the power W got by attacking  (helped by B's slowness...)]
;B[hq];W[gq];B[hp]C[good - when making life in a narrow space, play forcing moves first, and attach to the opp's stones.]
;W[go];B[lr];W[gr];B[hr];W[mr];B[jr];W[do]C[W got a nice momentum now. see what one move can cause ( P5 instead of N7)]
;B[cp];W[co];B[er];W[ch]LB[ci:a][dh:b][fh:c][bh:d]C[well, if W gets all this territory , W wins for sure.
trouble is, there are enough weaknesses B can use to invade.

Estimate :

B has some 20 pts in the 3 groups , apart from the upper side - that is another 30 pts.
W has some 20 pts apart from the big moyo, and komi.
B's areas are more solid than W, so in the endgame B is expected to reduce W a little more.
so, W needs just over 30 pts in the moyo, without allowing B more territory.
The moyo , if completed , has 50 pts; but it won't hold . I'd play E12 for B - W can't block it, and I believe it will reduce enough for B to win.
So, question is - could W play another move, less ambitious but with better chances of holding over 30 pts ?  if W 'a', B attaches at 'c' and cannot be stopped, since B has a strong position above.
if W 'b', B slides under at 'd' and gains some more points, but W presses from above and keeps close to 40 points inside. so this seems to me the best chance for W.

However, I believe B still stands better.];B[cj]LB[in:a][qq:b]
[bo:c][rf:d][nh:e]C[oh, dangerous.
here the importance of good mastery of endgame is clearly shown. if B had confidence
in his ability at endgame, then E12 should be enough. the big points in endgame are marked , and most are B's sente.
now W should play D11 and go for the kill - this fight will decide the game.]
;W[di]C[good.];B[cm];W[bn]LB[bl:a]C[not so good. should 'a'. if B B6, W B5 and B8 stone still has 2 possible connections, so B's eyespace is gone.]
;B[bm];W[bi];B[bj];W[dl]C[should first take B4 sente.];B[dm]
;W[dp]C[oops, wrong order];B[bp];W[an];B[el]C[b looks nearly alive now.]

(;W[rh]C[no need, W lives even if tenuki. if B now goes back to defend the left-bottom corner, then W gained nothing from his ko threat, so the opportunity B gave W by his life-and-death failure is wasted.
