 tannin 18k*: Hi

Hi there!  This is your reviewer speaking.

First and foremost, you are mistaking influence for territory.  A white wall is worth nothing, if it gets squeezed between two black walls, yes?  Walls should used as a sort of "tool of intimidation": If you can cut your opponent and crush him between your own stones and your wall, then your wall is working correctly.  Or you can make a really deep invasion, and not worry about your stone because you can always run to your strong wall, or just live.

For fun, grab a roughly equal friend and play a couple of games as the variation suggests.]

(;B[pq];W[dp];B[cd];W[pd];B[cq]C[PNH : I knew this invasion was bad for black but I did not succed in taking
advantage of it.

Yes.  At this early stage all this accomplishes is that black gets walled in, and perhaps 10 points, and those stones will have no effect to the game from that point on.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[ap]
LB[cn:B][ao:C][bq:A]C[PNH: This is not joseki, is it?

No, joseki would be to connect at A. White can now connect at B, and retain the potential at A for later use. See variation what happens - Black is significantly reduced if he ignores B. In addition, black push at C is now gote (w blocks, b has to connect)]

(;W[ao];B[br];W[cn]C[PNH: Could I have done better to keep sente?

Nope.  The corner invasion is fun because it's sente for the attacker.  You could've of course just taken the initiative, and ignored black, for example. Or just connected at C6 earlier.]
;B[qc]C[Again... After this, B will have four separate groups to take care of.]

(;W[qd]C[Wrong side, methinks. Try variation.];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob]
;W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[rd];W[re];B[sd];W[se];B[rb];W[qf]C[PNH: At this point I thought I had a won game but maybe was too timid
in the follow-up. Maybe you can suggest more agressive or just better
moves in what follows.

White has influence, black has territory. It's a fair deal, though white is clearly better off in this situation. Influence is not territory, though, and white has only a couple of points whereas black has about 20 points.]
;B[qn];W[qk]LB[ec:A][ed:B]C[PNH: Should I have played in front of the shimari? I was concerned
because
of the open point at G2.

You should worry about black getting two shimari, effectively getting all of the corners.  It would be very important for you to play A or B to minimize the power of the C16 stone. However, note that if your top right hand wall was facing the other direction, A or B would be much more efficient.]
;B[fc];W[ci]LB[np:A][mq:B]C[PNH: This I realize is a mistake.
I should have played farther away from my thickness.
You would be kind to indicate other mistakes that I have not seen.

At this point, black framework will grow considerably if you let him play around A or B, for example. Invading those corners is going to be hard anyway, so you'll have to do with reducing.]
;B[ch]C[B has no need to attach.  You attach only when you're in trouble and need to defend. White should immediately hane on top.]

(;W[di]C[W far too passive.];B[dh]
(;W[ei]C[There is proverb - "hit at the end of two stones". See variation.]
;B[bi];W[bj];B[ai];W[aj];B[bg]
(;W[ck]C[No need to connect. The ladder works.];B[lp]C[Big point for black.]
;W[gr]C[Irrelevant at this stage. Even the hane at E12 is more important.]
;B[ic];W[eh];B[eg]
(;W[mk]C[Too little.  White is behind, so white must be more active.]
;B[iq];W[hp];B[ip];W[ho];B[io]
(;W[im]C[P5 much bigger.

Since the white territory is totally open from the top (black can run into it from many directions, thanks to his strong groups), it's a waste to try and protect it.]
;B[gg]C[Very big for black.];W[gi];B[kn];W[mg]C[No, a black play at O6 will seal his victory. You're perhaps 20 points behind at this stage.]
;B[kc]C[Very small for black. K14 much bigger.];W[ih]C[This just helps black to solidify his own wall. White gets too little in return.]
;B[if]
(;W[nm]C[You can go farther. O6 or even R5.];B[nn];W[pm]C[Remember the proverb, "attach-hane-extend."]
;B[pn];W[qm]C[Better to connect at P7 to repair a defect.];B[mm]
;W[nl];B[in];W[hn];B[jm];W[il];B[jl]
(;W[ik]C[White is letting black to invade his own territory for free, without fighting. "Hane at the end of two stones".]
;B[jk];W[ij];B[jj];W[mi];B[ke];W[me];B[mb];W[lc]C[PNH: Maybe at this point I realized I was behind but it was too late I think.
Maybe there are some good endgame moves that I missed. (I have two
more comments at move 162 and 197)

You have fallen behind because you let your opponent to have it too easy...  Try to estimate the game score at an earlier stage - there is a saying that "the one that does not count, loses".  It's important to know if you're ahead and can play conservatively, or if you're behind, and must take risks.]

;B[ji];W[ig];B[jg];W[gh];B[qi]C[Black is obviously not counting. He has already won the game, so he should just take the final point at J2 and pass. White is so much behind, so it should be him attacking.]

(;W[pk]C[PNH: I managed to kill this invasion but barely. Maybe you can point out
more succesful moves. Thanks. I hope this unorthodox moyo game was at
least mildly entertaining to you.

In these cases, you should concentrate on taking away blacks base, and watch your cutting points. See variation for other good moves.]

;W[ir];B[cb]TR[hf][if][eg][fg][gg][ch][dh]C[PNH: Could I have invaded this corner?

It would've been very difficult, since you had no aji there left. Before you let black to build the wall at the marked location, then perhaps you could've threatened to connect to your outside group.

You gained a bit in the endgame, but in general your problems were at the beginning.]
