C[Thanks for reviewing my game. It was a tough game. I played white and managed to come out 1/2 point ahead with komi, but I felt pushed around a lot during the game. Hopefully you can help me learn to avoid this.]
;B[pd];W[eo];B[cd];W[po]C[I don't usually play a high fuseki like this.

patrickb: if you're going to play a high influence-orneted fuseki like this, you're expecting a fighting game that can utilize your influence.]
;B[dq];W[fq]C[patrickb: I'd prefer C4 or C5, I think, though with C16 where it is (preventing a natural approach from the left side), this should be okay.]
;B[do];W[dn];B[co];W[cn]C[Maybe I am too much in love with the hane-at-the-head shape, because I get cut.

patrickb: as long as you have a plan for dealing with the cut, it's okay. Here, though, F5 doesn't threaten a ladder (it's broken by Q16), which makes it harder to deal with.]
;B[ep];W[fp];B[fo];W[en];B[go]C[patrickb. b's push and cut here feels like an overplay. C3 is a real weak-point in the corner now. Jumping to H4 is natural for w now.]
;W[hp];B[gm]C[patrickb: hitting C3 now to weaken the corner and strengthen your outside stones isn't a bad idea...]

(;W[dk];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo];W[in]C[patrickb: this is still good for w. J6 feels a *little* thin, but b is weak enough to be okay for now. I'd probably have played J5 instead.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[hl];W[jl];B[ek];W[ck];B[el];W[dg];B[pq]C[patrickb: You want to make *sure* you end in sente here so that you can play E16, if you're going to respond. If you build a good wall on the right side, you also have the approach at R14 followed by E16. B has J4 he's going to want to aim for on the bottom, and it's going to be hard to make a siginificant territory there as a result. 

My first inclination is O4 to aim for a large right-side moyo. remember that black has a semi-floating group at G7, and you want to play in a way now that lets you attack it for profit without having to kill it later.]
;W[np]C[Maybe there was a better reply?

patrickb: No, I think this is good.];B[jp]C[This surprised me, and I'm not sure if I responded well.

patrickb: it's the weakpoint of your shape, but it feels like an overplay here. You respond with J4 then H6 and he has another floating, weak group. also note that you can always attach at D2 if you need eye space.]

(;W[ho]C[patrickb: not a great shape here - b has too many forcing moves on you now and H8 ends up well-positioned.]
;B[hn];W[jo];B[iq];W[hq];B[lp];W[ko];B[lo]C[patrickb: the main thing to prevent here is the connection underneat at O3, but you'd like to preserve the potnetial to play L3 later, for example, or at least threaten that now so you can play, say, M7.]

(;W[kp];B[kq]C[patrickb: all of these contact moves seem to be helping b more than attacking him...]
;W[mq]C[patrickb: too direct, perhaps? YOu'd like to be able to aim for the cut there later. My feeling is to play against the corner stone to keep it separated]
;B[mp];W[nq];B[lq]
(;W[qp]C[patrickb: small! You have bigger fish to fry.];B[no]
C[patrickb: ow.];W[op];B[km];W[jm];B[kn];W[jn];B[ir];W[ed]C[patrickb: this is a big point, but it's not urgent. You're now in danger of you being the one weak at the bottom...]

;B[ei];W[ci];B[ij];W[jj];B[hi];W[ih];B[hh];W[cf]C[parickb: why this move?]
;B[ef];W[de];B[eg];W[qi];B[qm];W[pm]C[Attaching seems to have been a bad choice.

patrickb: yes, it's going to make b stronger on the outside, where you'll have a lone stone.]
;B[pl];W[om];B[ol];W[qn];B[rm];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[qk];W[od]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[nf]C[The following is painful for me. My opponent ploughs through the space between my two weak-ish groups.]
;W[pe];B[qd];W[nc];B[ob];W[of];B[ne];W[oe];B[lf];W[lj]C[Maybe too slow.

patrickb: definitely. is b threatening a cut here? His biggest threat in the area is around J13, I'd think, but you don't really have a good place to run at this point.]
;B[kh]C[I didn't expect this. Black is bloodthirsty here.

patrickb: yes, but most all of his groups are strong, he's a *bit* this on the middle here, though.]
