(;W[bf]C[white should probably atari on top here, to prevent black from sealing him in so well.]

(;B[df];W[bc];B[be];W[bd];B[ec];W[cb];B[bg];W[ae];B[ch]C[white gets a good corner here but black's outside strength probably works well with the star-points.  White is rather thoroughly enclosed.  If black had a chance to play D18 atari earlier, that would have been even better, of course.  Even now D18 is almost sente for black (and E18 is almost sente for white).]
;W[eb]C[definitely a big move.];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc]C[is was quite pleased wih this outcome in the top left. Is it good or does black have too much power? If so, how best to counteract ths power at this point? q10? k4? o3, k4 as i played?

Black definitely has too much power.  You have played your stones mostly on the second line, getting one point each; not enough to make up for the influence, especially so early.

I would go so far as to say black has a big lead.

I think R10 is the best point.  With extensions above or below, it is hard to attack.  If black plays there, it becomes difficult for you to find a place to invade.  The lower side is big too, especially since your O3 is a ladder breaker.  Still, R10 would be my move.]
;W[nq]C[black doesn't necessarily have to capture the stone (see variation)]

(;B[dg];W[jp];B[cn]C[this is small.  Black's stones above are so strong, that a move even this distance from them is too close.  Black is better off playing F3 if he wants to approach this area, but Q10 or Q6 would be much bigger than this.]
;W[dn]C[Good idea: this helps white and tries to make black even more overconcentrated.]
;B[dm]
(;W[en]C[Now black gets a chance to jump into the corner.  Blocking at C5 is a possibility, taking the corner territory ad leaving black overconcentrated.]
;B[cq];W[cp]C[C5 makes better shape, usually, killing C6 more effectively.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr]C[should i just play f3 here to get my o3 and k4 working better with my d4 group?

Regardless, you're not going to get much territory here.  Your aim is to take the outside and counter the influence of the black stones above.  R6 is a big move for you, or Q6, so you're aiming to get a chance to take sente and play there.  In short, the corner territory is not so big; you want to be connected and powerful along the outside.  You already have territory (in the top left).]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[gr];W[dr];B[fs];W[cr]C[white takes another corner, but now a black move at G5 starts to look bad for the stones to the right.]
;B[bo]C[too early to play this sort of thing.];W[bp]C[again white takes some territory but at what cost?  The k4/O3 stones have now become weak.]
;B[jq];W[cm]C[too early?

Definitely too early.  Look at that black strength up the left side!  Is black really going to spend another move to protect that area?  No way, black has already spent so many.  Defending your weak K4/o3 group is the key now.]
;B[cl]C[Black's move is also too small, so you have a chance again to save your weak group.]
;W[bm];B[bl];W[em];B[dl];W[fp]C[how can it have been big enough to play B7 and C7 in the first place, but not big enough to protect them from B6?  If you play them, you have to finish, but now you can see that C7 was too small to begin with.]
;B[gp];W[hq];B[gq];W[kq];B[hr];W[jr];B[iq];W[ir];B[ip];W[io]
;B[hp];W[kp];B[oq]C[black is stable now, and white is pretty much stable.  P3 seems like the wrong direction: black still wants to think big with the stones in the top left.]

(;W[qf]C[is s10 a better landing spot?

Now I like this move.  If you play R10, black R12, white R7, black R5 feels comfortable for black.  Here it's harder for black to get his stones coordinated (now that O3 and P3 are on the board).]
;B[qh]LB[qh:A][hq:B]C[The long pincer at R10 might have been better: then black can play O4 next and feel happy.]
;W[of]C[this is risky, since black has so much strength, but if you can survive everywhere it may be very effective.]
;B[oh]C[this is probably the wrong direction for black.  O16 is pretty severe for white.]
;W[nd]C[good move.];B[ne]
(;W[od]C[o14 to help l3 group?

You can't let black take O16 so easily, so no, your move looks better than O14 to me.  How about P15 instead?]
;B[pe];W[pc];B[oe]C[this exchange looks good for black.  P14 and R14 look like bad moves (imagine taking them off the board, and taking R12 and P12 off.  White sure wouldn't play those two moves now!)]
;W[qc];B[rd];W[qd];B[qe];W[rc];B[rf];W[no]C[Now white is ahead in territory, but black has VERY strong stones.  So, can black use that strength to attack?]
;B[nr]C[black is trying to undermine your eyes and attack you.]
;W[pm]C[took me some time to come up with this. what do you think?

It looks overly agressive, since black has so many strong stones in the area.  If black simply intercepts at P6, what do you do?  Your groups may well get cut off and one of them may die.]

(;B[lr];W[po]C[White got off well here, black can play L2 but white has shape on the outside now, neutralizing black's strength.  Black probably thought you would answer M2 at L2, but you were wise not to.  Q5 is much bigger.]
;B[np];W[qo]C[R5 is greedy, trying to take territory.  Keep your groups linked up!]
;B[mo];W[kn];B[oo];W[on];B[nn]C[Now white is in trouble.   The lower center group is too weak.]
;W[nm];B[mm];W[qq];B[qp]C[this is a small move for black.  J7, maybe?  Some kind of servere attack in that area.  Or O8 followed by L8 might be an effective combination too.  N16 is also a large point for black tooplay.]
;W[rp];B[nl];W[qj];B[pl]C[again, small.  N16 is bigger for black, or L8, or an attacking move.]
;W[ql];B[om];W[pn];B[pk];W[qk];B[ro];W[rn];B[rq];W[so];B[qr]
;W[sq];B[pq]C[Black was foolish to spend a move taking the corner here.  LEave it open, and attack white's center!  G7 or so should be pretty deadly for it.  H6 looks good too, or J7, or even L8 maybe.]
;W[hn]C[don't want to be chased upwards...but was n16 the move here?

No, saving your weak group in the bottom is the biggest thing.  Trying to link up to E6 is a good idea.  On the other hand, if you can be chased upwards and live, you've destroyed black's big center.  So maybe a move like J7, strengthening your shape and getting ready to run left or up, would work too.]
;B[md];W[nb]C[This is big for black, but since you still have H18, the center is the important thing.]
;B[mc];W[fk];B[kl];W[mb]C[This is small.  The center is big.]
;B[kc];W[jk]C[black middle looking so big.

Yes, you tend to take territory too often (all four corners, almost, since you can play S2) and let the opponent get very strong outside groups.  Black had chances to attack your lower center group, which could have ended the game quite quickly.]

;B[he];W[hi]C[now we get to the endgame.  L2 is pretty big!  So is B6.]
;B[gn]C[This looks smaller than L2 or B6.  Black won't gain any territory, and can only take away about 12 points of white territory at most.  Meanwhile B6 saves two stones, captures two stones, and takes several points besides: at least 12 points, probably more, since after black B6 he would have A4 as well.]

C[big and sente, good sequence for white.];W[lb]C[small, since if black plays there, white can still answer at H18.]
;B[kb]C[small, since black isn't going to get any territory here anyway.  L2 is bigger.]

[bm][cm][nm][no][op][hq][nq][fr][or][pr][os]C[White should count and see just how small the corner territories are compared with black's big center.  The main lesson in this game for white is that getting completely sealed into the corner is a bad thing.  Black controlled the center in a big way.  With a little more severe attack on your group in the middle of the lower side, you would have been really in trouble.  Even without the severe attack, black still won by a decent margin.  Make sure your groups don't get enclosed!]

;W[dg];B[bi];W[eg]C[it looks like white's stones are weaker than black's, especially after the F18-G17 exchange up top.  So, black could certainly consider Q6 or even O4 in answer to your O3.  Capturing the ladder stone makes black VERY strong in that corner, though.]
