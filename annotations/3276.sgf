C[To reviewer:

I try my best to play with a 11K. But i made lot of mistakes which leads me losing.. but i won by time.

P/s: i don't really know how to ask question. if you don't mind, please review it your own way, thank you ^^

Hi, my name is martijn and i'll try to review it as good as i can, but please keep in mind that some comments may not be correct.]

(;B[co]C[The usual move here is D4 or F3. See variations.];W[dq]
;B[fp]C[I think my F4 is wrong. am i suppose to move D4?

I find it difficult. I think i'd play D5 because white cannot cut and C9 is a nice extension from it. The drawback in comparison with D4 is that black doesn't threaten to cut at C3 either. F4 doesn't look so bad to me, it threatens F3 and if white pushes at F3 he can only get third line territory.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[dp];B[bn]C[is B5 better?

Hard to say. This gives white the kikashi at B5, but if black would play B5 and white plays later E6 or D7 then black would have to defend the cut at C6]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[gq];B[eh];W[go];B[fn];W[iq];B[gf]C[Is my G14 wrong? or D 17 better?

I think G14 is better than D17 because it gains strength and blocks white's way to the centre. However, i think it's not as big as Q10.]
;W[fb]
(;B[db]C[I think quite long about the way to reduce and protect my territory but still failed = any suggestion? or is it because of my G14?

It's not possible to cut off the white stone. If you want to protect your territory, i'd suggest F17 see variation]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[cd];W[bc];B[pq]C[Here.. is funny, i was just trying out, but i think is wrong?

was it wrong?

I don't think so.];W[oq];B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[pr]C[should i cover R3? becuz i ignore

Yes, you should play R3 because if white captures the black stone at Q3, he won't have the cutting point at P4 anymore and he'll have perfect eye shape. In other words, if you don't play R3, white will and he'll gain a lot of strength.]
;B[pn];W[qq];B[pl]C[i realised Q8 was wrong.. so basically saying, i should have cover R3?

Q8 should have been at Q7 or maybe R7.];W[qn]

;B[ql];W[om];B[ol];W[mm]
(;B[qg]C[Should i have moved O7 first? but i think making framework important.. which one?

Definately. Framework is indeed important, but you don't have to choose because O7 is sente. See variation for the difference.]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[mj];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[qf]C[R14 correct?

I think S14 is better. See variation.];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[pa]
;W[qb]
(;B[jk]C[is my K9 correct? later in the game, i found it useless...so it was wrong?

The idea is right, enlarging your territory while reducing white's. But it's better to start with the atari at M9. See variation for the difference.]
;W[ib];B[ic];W[nj];B[ok];W[lj];B[mi];W[kk];B[km]C[should be at K7?

yes, that's better.];W[jl];B[ll];W[ml];B[in];W[jm];B[ip];W[jq]
C[Now you should threaten to rescue the two marked stones before it's too late. See variation]

(;B[gp];W[fq];B[hp]C[i wanted to move K4 but i realised E5 opened,]
;W[ko];B[jo];W[jp];B[hb]C[so from here... i realised my framework is breached, and failed.. losing time = but i continued

Good move, the game is now about even.];W[li];B[mh];W[ha];B[ga]
;W[hc];B[ia];W[gb]
(;B[gc]C[i want him to play KO, but he didnt, he was smart.. and so i made one mistake here

hard to say anything about it. This move makes the situation pretty complex. K18 would keep things simple.]
;W[hd];B[ea];W[jb]C[White should have captured the ko and save this move for use as ko threat.]

(;B[ha]C[this was wrong.. i was wrondering if H19 at F19. what do u think?

That's right. This move should definately be at F19 or F17. See variation. I think you could call this the losing move if you had lost. From now on white has a big lead.]
;W[ja];B[if];W[fe];B[ee]
(;W[de]TR[cd][dd][ee][fd][ec][gc]C[should be at F14, then the marked stones are all dead.]
;B[ge];W[ed];B[on];W[nm];B[ee]C[and the rest... mind do comment?

You made some desperate moves, but i think you can see them yourself.]
;W[ce];B[ff];W[ed];B[ik];W[bg];B[bh];W[lc];B[ld]
(;W[nc]C[I think white should cut. Usually black defends at the point where white plays now, but because you were so strong i think it wasn't necessary then.]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[kc];W[lb]
(;B[nb]C[This doesn't accomplish anything. P16 is better, it threaten N15. See variation.]

(;W[md]C[Should also be at P16.];B[od];W[mc];B[me];W[le];B[mf]

;W[aq];B[rd];W[rf];B[rg];W[sd];B[sf];W[rc];B[sb]C[You played well, especially in the opening. 

Below i summed up some points on which i think you can improve.

Try to make some more forcing moves such as the ataris at O7 move 55 and M9 move 71. They really make a difference. But watch out for "forcing moves" where your opponent benefits more from the exchange than you do.

A complicated position works usually in the advantage of the stronger player. So if you play against a stronger opponent, try not to complicate things (unless you're desperate)

If some of your stones are threatened, you should ask yourself the question whether saving them doesn't cause more harm than sacrificing them.]
