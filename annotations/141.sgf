;B[ol];W[jd]C[so far, seems to me a reasonable development.]
;B[ce]C[B could also play large-scale with N16, for example, but making the kakari looks ok to me. However, considering K16 stone, D15 looks a better kakari.]
;W[cg]C[the left side is relatively low-potential because of the low, solid position of C6, and if B jumps out now, he gets to press W downat D12. so I'd play D15 here.]
;B[ee];W[fd]
(;B[dg]C[this move invites W to the 4th line, why did you rule out D12 ? see variation.]
;W[dh];B[ch]C[bad, should be E13.];W[df];B[bg];W[eg];B[bi];W[de]
C[very bad result for B.

having went through the game looking back, B never really recovered from this loss. the thickness and eventually the territory W gained here are the chief reason for his victory.]
;B[lc];W[qd]C[nice.];B[qc]C[wrong direction - should R15, because of the high aspirations of R8-P8. when you let W settle himself solidly on the left side, those stones become very ineffective.]
;W[qe];B[rc];W[pe];B[od];W[qh];B[pr]C[looks like endgame move, although big.
W just has to reduce with a move around K5 to take a substantial lead. How about a move around K9 ?]
;W[ps];B[os];W[qs];B[nr];W[cd];B[be];W[bd]C[Both sides are over-concerned with corner territories, while important positions are begging to be developed - D15 and Q6 walls.
for W, M16 or M15 looks attractive, for B - around k9.];B[cf]
;W[dg];B[ad];W[ac];B[ae];W[bc]C[endgame is many moves away yet...there are much bigger moves.C11 for W, for example, should be instinctive.]
;B[jb];W[ci]C[good.];B[bh];W[cj];B[bj];W[bk];B[ck]C[this fight will be hard on B, W is solid on both sides; and it will not reduce W's area at all, just help build a W position around line 11-12, chasing B. what's more, B still needs a move to make the left side group live. so this cut is very bad.]
;W[bl];B[dk];W[ei]C[better at E10.];B[ej];W[di];B[aj];W[fo]
;B[fp];W[hn]C[good, reducing while attacking.];B[do];W[co];B[go]
;W[io]C[looking too much to reduce, W let's B off the hook - W should F7 instead, to keep the B group isolated and help W connect if needed. F7 here is a real vital point.]
;B[gn]C[B is virtually connected, and W is floating.];W[il]
;B[fm];W[ko]C[positional estimation :

W has 45 solid points, with potential in left center.
  B has about the same now, and K4 is essential,
so it's really W's move and W has a small advantage. game still open.]
;B[jp];W[jo]C[way too heavy ! M8 or L7 are a lot better.];B[mp]
C[bad. B is already very strong here. this move serves no purpose except providing W with a stone to lean against.

consider J10. if W next M3, B can safely cut.];W[mo];B[lp];W[ip]
;B[iq];W[kp];B[jq];W[lo]C[still too heavy, jump out.];B[ml]
C[when W plays H10 and is virtually connected, he gains more than the area this move destroys.]
;W[kl]C[in territory, this move is worth about 2 points in gote.]
;B[hm];W[im];B[ho]C[this is end-of-endgame move.];W[jj]C[the right direction.]
;B[in];W[jn];B[lm];W[km]C[still H10 or G10 correct, this move is useless.]
;B[le];W[hb]C[W is taking a risk with the right side group. it is not closely attacked yet, but it's escape routes are blocked.]
;B[ib];W[hc];B[oe]C[almost worthless move. S11 or P12 are the points for attack.]
;W[rj]C[W quite safe now.];B[sf]C[big endgame, but helps W build eyes.]
;W[rf];B[sd];W[sg];B[se];W[rh];B[fr];W[er];B[gk]C[what for ? if W E8, D7 and capture or connect.]
;W[gi]C[good.];B[jf];W[hf]C[J14 is better at protecting the area.]
;B[ie];W[he]C[J16 was bigger.];B[id];W[hd];B[ha];W[ga];B[ia]
