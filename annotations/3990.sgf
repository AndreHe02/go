C[Hello,

I play white.  I won this game in the end, by killing a large group.  But up till then, I was quite behind.  I think this game well demonstrates my biggest weakness -- unability to balance territory and influence; I tend to get a lot of territory in the begining, but my oponent builds a huge moyo in the meantime.  I would appreciate any hints how I could avoid this (as well as any other mistakes you might spot).

Thanks];B[ec]C[Reviewer:I'm not sure about to comment ur game coz i'm only 1 k(IGS) but i will try
This game W  give B so much influence,so when u play don't think only teritories]
