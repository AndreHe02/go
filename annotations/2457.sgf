C[Hello.  I play white in this game.  It was a pretty even game at the end, as I made up some lost ground in then end game.  But not enough to catch up.  I'm not sure where I fell behind.  So I am particularly interested in how I did that and how to do it better.  I have a few questions throughout the game as well.

Thanks in advance.

Hi snip,

I am Jing, 1d at KGS, and hope to be able to answer your questions.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cp];W[dc];B[eq];W[dj]LB[ce:A][cf:B][ci:C]C[I'd prefer to play D10 at A,B or C. A high move would be more logic if you're going for moyo-contruction.]
;B[dl]C[maybe you could play K16 here to make your move at D10 more effective, B will than probably invade at D15]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc]
;W[qf];B[og]C[( B should wait with this move and first play G16 for example)]
;W[hc]LB[hd:B][ce:A]C[Is this ok?  It seemed important to play around here as it would be too good for black to play here.  I did consider A and B as well.

Yes, it looks good to move, playing A would make you overconcentrated on the left. I'd probably play G17 to aim at K17 and maybe set things in motion with O17 later. But maybe that's just a matter of taste.]
;B[dh]LB[cf:B][fj:A]C[But this was predictable.]
(;W[fj]C[I feel it'd be better to play C14 to aim at connection with C12 and treat D10 lightly. I've added a possible alternative]
;B[de]LB[cd:C][dd:A][fh:B]
(;W[dd]C[This move isn't good, contact play will only soldify your opponent.]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[gh]C[B's weak group has made some shape will with still has none.

H10 now looks like the honte move.];W[gf];B[fg]
(;W[el]C[I'd prefer just playing H10 and not making b more solid and thus giving him solid territory]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[cj];W[dm];B[di]LB[ej:A][cm:B]
(;W[ej]C[Was this worth doing?  I considered A but didn't like all of the cutting points I was going to have.  This left side has gotten big for black..


Yes, white has definitly sufferd at the left side. E10 would be better at E7. Playing C7 yourself instead of E10 seems to risky.]
;B[cm];W[cl];B[ck];W[cn];B[bl];W[dn];B[hq];W[lq]C[good, the cutting point at E7 doesn't work for B. White will capture wit F6. Again, a play one line back would make a more solid connection with your hoshi stone. ( M3 at N3)]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[po];W[pq]C[now your stone at M3 ends up better than it would have been at N3 :-)]
;B[qo];W[qh]C[B should have played R13 first before playing in the LR corner.]
;B[qj];W[bd];B[ce];W[gq]C[Playing B15 first seems the logic move, than go after B's weakness at either R8 or set O17 in motion. 

You have to keep in mind that your group on the left is still eyeless, starting unnecessary trouble with G3 seems therefor wrong. Spending a move to make some shape is no bad idea, B can gain much influence by attacking it.]
;B[gr]LB[hp:B][hr:A]
(;W[hr]LB[hp:A]C[Better at A for the middle?  Or is the whole sequence wrong?

I don't like this whole sequence, see earlier comments];B[fq]

(;W[io];B[hp];W[hn]C[Hmm, I don't think this is good. You should leave this aji for later. First making shape/eyes is your priority. B can make it much harder for white with F7 or G6 now.]
;B[hm];W[gn];B[in];W[fm]LB[hj:B][eo:A]C[B should have used this oppertunity to shut white in. ( play H10. That's why you should first jump out and than use your inside aji.]

(;B[eo];W[en];B[ho];W[il]LB[gl:A]C[I think I should have just played at A.


First H10, you can always later go back and make the extra eye.]
;B[gk]C[This was a good move.  I had great difficulty with this.]
;W[hj];B[gj];W[gi]C[If b played H9 now white could end up with a lot of problems]
;B[fi];W[gl]LB[hl:B][im:A]C[good move!]

;B[id];W[ic];B[jd]LB[nb:B][ng:A]C[maybe play O18 now and see how B answers.


This is a very good time to look at the score.

I count for white:

UR 9  points
LR 18 points
UL 17 points

total 50,5 with komi

for black:

LR 16 points
Left middle 20 points
Right middle 16 points

this is 52 points and without the group on the side, so B's leading, white  should undertake some extra measures now ( or maybe should have done this earlier)]

(;W[ng]C[I've added an other varition starting with O18, you should look for complications now to give you a fighting chance.]
;B[nf];W[mf]LB[nh:A]C[Too greedy?  A better?

beeing greedy when you're behind is good, looks okay since white can't be playing solid now]

Yes please];B[nk];W[ln];B[mm];W[rq]C[Any advice on the endgame?


yes, first play the 'almost' sente moves  http://www.almostsente.art.pl/  ;)

these are B15, B5 and than play S3. S3 is a big point but doesn't have as much force as the other two.

these moves are really big and should have been played earlier i think]

(;W[kb]C[A better?

please play A14 first ( see variation)

Yes, K18 is better. 

If B plays M18 you have to defend with K18 and L18 is gote. If white answers K19 it's sente and thus much bigger, if he doesn't answer you get an bigger follow up than L18.]
