C[Hi Ron -

Sorry this has taken ten days, instead of the two days I had promised Matthias.  I was busy finishing my finals this week and completely forgot.  Sorry!

My comments are interspersed, and there is a summary of my thoughts at the end.  Basically, I thought you have a solid fuseki, but have weaknesses in your middle game.  You fail to capitalize on the strength you build up early on.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or are confused by anything I said.  I am on KGS as either etrynus or eggsandham.  Lately, I have not been on as frequently, so option two would be to e-mail me back at this address.

Finally, don't take anything I said as a hard and fast rule.  The most important thing is to think for yourself.

Good luck.

Regards,
John];B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[qe];W[df]C[This is a weird approach - generally you would not want to approach a 3-4 from this side.

That being said, the approach at D13 is a standard one against a Black Chinese fuseki.]
;B[ec]C[I think this and E16 would both be good moves.  You should be thanking W for making you do this.  Completing a shimari is rarely a bad move.

>>>Too cautious?];W[gc]C[As you picked up on, this move by W is not good because he is just asking to be separated.]
;B[ee]C[I think yours is a solid move.  My first impression was to play F15 because you would have miai for strong pincers on both the white stones.

The drawback to F15 is that W may cut later in the game.  The drawback to E15 is that a pincer on the G17 stone will not be as strong, and also that you have to respond to W's next move.

>>>I thought keeping white separated was important, but I don't know if this was the way to do it.]
;W[ef];B[fe];W[de];B[dd];W[ff];B[ge];W[id];B[lc]C[No, this is a good idea.  I don't like L17 as much because M17 can take care of himself if you don't spend any more moves in the area.  L17 would be too thin.

I would also think about turning at G14, a type of move that is usually big, but it's hard (for me) to say which one is better.

>>>Would L17 be better or is the idea of attacking the two white stones totally wrong?]
;W[gf];B[he];W[kd];B[ld];W[qg]C[This is awful!  Completely off the point.  It is similar to G17 in that it is self-defeating, since B can play splitting moves which harm more than one white group, and then W can only save one.

On a completely different note, you don't want to approach shimaris closely, so R13 is bad for another reason.]
;B[if]C[I'm glad you didn't respond to R13.];W[kc]C[This is another fundamental mistake and allows B to hane at the head of two stones.

Also, a point I want to make if you are ever in a similar position - running to the center is generally better play than trying to make life inside.  This is especially true in this position because life is not even guaranteed inside.  So if I were W, I would play a move like L15 instead.]
;B[di]C[Again, hane at the head of two stones.  L15 is more important.

Another sidebar - even w/o the 'hane at head' proverb, you can figure out that playing D11 immediately is not correct.  You can make several forcing moves against the top white group that W must respond to.  You can shut W out from the center IN SENTE before returning to D11.

>>>Was playing in this area the right idea?  If so, is this the best place?]
;W[dk]C[I would play F11 if I were W.];B[fi];W[gh];B[gj];W[ch]

C[I also think your group above is relatively safe, so this move is fine.  L15 is still the biggest move however, and has been for a while.

That said, I would prefer H6, P4, and K3 to G3, but that may just be a matter of style, as I can't find anything wrong with G3.

>>I didn't think my group above is in real danger so this seemed like a good time to jump in here.  Would something like H6 be better or pressing the running white group?  It's these strategic decisions that give me the most touble.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[fq]C[Odd move, should be at K3 or K4.];B[jq]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[gr];B[gp];W[jr];B[fp];W[eq];B[kr];W[kq];B[jp]
;W[ir];B[lr]C[Yeah, this is a poor move!

>>I guess I should have played M3 since the ladder works?  I missed that one entirely.]

;W[oq];B[or];W[pq];B[oo];W[nn];B[no];W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[pr]
;W[qr];B[lq];W[kp];B[ms]C[This result seems ok, although if you had used the ladder earlier, it would have been much better.  Now, W has some influence with which to help his three groups up top.  Before, W had no influence, and the game clearly belonged to B.

Also, here is something to think about.  If you are going to make life inside anyways, why did you move Q6?  Seems like a thank-you move for W.

>>I didn't think I could break out so I figured I'd better make life.  This didn't turn out very well for me, did it?]
;W[on];B[po];W[qo]C[The last three moves seemed slow and unimportant.]
;B[pi]C[Reasonable.  Going back to a previous point, if W hadn't gotten that wall around row 6, this B move would be a lot more severe.

>>Another one of those strategic decisions?  Reasonable or totally off the mark?]
;W[og];B[ni];W[mg];B[nf]C[Doh.  As much as I praised L15 earlier, it is an even better move now (or the next move), since W has brought his other group closer and L15 now is a stronger splitting attack.]
;W[ng];B[li];W[kf]C[Now W has new life.]
(;B[ol]C[Proverb is; don't peep where you can cut.  I think this situation would be an excellent example of that proverb.

Aside from that, cutting at R7/P7 doesn't work, so the best idea is to leave it alone for now, until a situation arises where the cuts do work.  More specifically, you need stones around R9.  See the variation.

Personally, I would have either connected my weak Q11 group out with K10 (more likely), or went for it with a move like K13, L13, or L12.

>>Maybe I should have just cut at P7 or R7?];W[pl];B[ok];W[kj]
C[This is why you wanted to connected your R11 group out already.]

;B[nd];W[gm];B[hm];W[fn];B[hn];W[ig]C[You really could have, as I pointed out a couple of times during the game.

>>I probably missed several opportunities to keep white from connecting his groups, but I didn't think I could actually succeed.]
;B[lb]C[Well, lets check the score.  You have (after this move) about 25 points in the upper right.  About 5 points in the middle right.  Another 5 down south.  About 10 in the upper left.  And 5 more in the middle left.  So 50 points.

W has 25 lower left. 10 lower right.  No komi, so he needs about 15 more in the upper area to beat you, which I don't think he can do.

So, your move is fine in concept, except for the fact that I am at a loss why you didn't play L18 instead.

>>I went for territory instead.];W[kb];B[ka];W[ja];B[la];W[ml]

(;B[nk]C[Why not N9?  Seems like a vastly superior move.  See variation.]

;W[fb];B[eb]C[Two good moves by W, but I don't know why he doesn't follow up with T15 and E19, both which you have to respond to.

Otherwise, I think the B6 area is the biggest now.  Also, take your shot at R1 while you still have the chance.]

;W[cl];B[jg]C[I don't know what I was thinking.  I should have defended at B8, but I didn't realize white could capture by playing B8.]
;W[hg];B[jf];W[mf];B[ne];W[im];B[in];W[jn];B[jo];W[jm];B[fa]
C[The irony is, it is possible that F19 is the correct play, because B8 and E7 are miai.

Winning by half a point seems like a tossup, since the endgame was poor it really could have gone either way.

Here is my summary.

I think B came off to a commanding start, but blew it bit by bit in the middle game.  W on the other hand has a very weak fuseki but afterwards played relatively well.

Most importantly for you, my advice would be to constantly be thinking about which groups on the board are strong and which are weak.  Then, 1) protect your weak groups 2) attack your opponents weak groups.

In closing, I think your worst moves of the game were:
D11 (should be L15)
M2 (should be M3)
O9 (should be N9)
P11 (should be anything else)
