;W[dq];B[eq];W[ep]C[tanguy : this move looks like a trick
 is'nt it ?

reviewer: i don't think white has a choice at this point. the only other move in this shape is sometimes E2, but here that would be much too limp.]
;B[er]C[i can't find a better move than this for black. B3 also seems natural, but leads to a similar sequence]
;W[dr]C[only move for white];B[bq];W[br];B[ds];W[cr];B[ar];W[bp]

;B[fr];W[gq];B[ar];W[do]
(;B[co]C[tanguy : maybe should I directly take the stones ?

reviewer: seems roughly the same, but yes, i think it's better. by taking now, you omit the G2 for H3 exchange, which is crawling along the second line and thus favors White]
;W[as]
(;B[gr];W[hq];B[ar];W[dn];B[ap];W[fn]C[this can't be considered bad for black. that's a solid 20 points in the corner, and he's not enclosed on either side, plus he got the move in at D10.]
;B[pj];W[cf]
(;B[fd];W[bd];B[ce];W[be];B[df];W[cg];B[dg]C[this is a great sequence by black. the left side is of very low value anyway due to the stones in the bottom-left. so pushing white low here is good for black]
;W[nc];B[lc]LB[ld:A]C[tanguy : maybe A is better ?

reviewer: since your stones in the upper-left are high, i think the low position here works well]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[mc];W[nd];B[pf];W[nb]
(;B[pb]C[tanguy : is this correct shape ?

reviewer: this is the right shape for the corner. however, you are sacrificing your stones at M17 and N17. in this case, i think it's probably the wrong choice.]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[lb]
(;B[jf]C[this move leaves a lot of aji for white. it's hard to call it straightforwardly bad, though]
;W[jd];B[ke];W[id];B[hc];W[kf];B[je];W[jg]
(;B[kg]C[tanguy : I did not want to overconcentrate my stones on the laft is this move correct ?

[gq][hq]C[tanguy  :
maybe should I be more agressive here
but I was afraid by white strength in the south.
Is A playable?

reviewer: playing A instead here gives white the choice of which way to connect. i think you made the right choice. in any case decide yourself, don't let your opponent choose! an earlier peep at E7 would help you with regards to white strength in the south, but now you can't be sure if it's sente]
;W[ig]LB[hi:A]C[tanguy : what about A ?

reviewer: as a next move for black? i like it]
(;B[ki]C[this move just helps white. he's happy to extend here as you ahve to be careful of your dumpling]
;W[lh]
(;B[mi];W[ih];B[ji];W[hj]C[it's a shame to let these stones escape]
;B[nf]C[tanguy : I though it was sente but...];W[ka]TR[jb][hc]
[jc]C[tanguy : but I have to protect my stones here.

reviewer: i'm not so sure you do. there's aji, but white isn't that strong either. perhaps if he gets another move on the outside later, he can do something]

(;B[ch]C[tanguy : probably out of context.];W[bh]

;W[eg];B[ef];W[fg];B[ah];W[gc]
(;B[gd]LB[gd:B][fh:A]C[tanguy : a bad move and his brother :(

reviewer: now, because white has the stone above A, the attachment on the inside is tougher to handle]
;W[ic];B[gb];W[hb];B[fc];W[ib]C[now the position is tough for black. letting white connect here hurts a lot]
;B[cb];W[bb];B[cd];W[bc];B[db]C[tanguy : I wanted to play b19, maybe should I launch this sequence as an answer to
W107 (g17) ?

reviewer: it doesn't kill the corner, but it does strengthen your stones. however, they're pretty strong already. i'm not sure when you want to play B19, because you can't any time i see]
;W[ba]
(;B[bm];W[ql]
(;B[qk]LB[qj:A]C[tanguy : I played this move in a hurry to take my train :(
maybe A is better ?

reviewer: the stones on top are strong. therefore, you should play below to help your corner.]

(;B[nq];W[oj];B[oi];W[ok];B[pi];W[rk];B[rj]C[tanguy : Maybe one day will I finish this game
I think it is still ok for black.
but fafa is a strong yose player, neverknow...

reviewer: overall you did well, but a couple of mistakes in the middle fight cost you a lot. you had some chances to kill white's floating group, and missing them hurt you. still, as you say, black is still in the game. good job!]
