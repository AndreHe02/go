AB[pd][dp]C[Comments by reviewer Eric Vella will be marked [EV\].  Hope you find them useful.]
;W[qo]TR[pd][dp]C[K: What is the best way to play in a corner that has opponent's stones on the adjacent 4-4 points (marked)?

[EV\] It is too early to pick a best move.  Not even a pro could answer this question.]
;B[cd];W[fc]TR[pd][dp]C[K: I think e15 was probably better in relation to the two marked stones. I suppose I played this way to complicate things.]
;B[df];W[ch]C[K: Trying to complicate things again.];B[cj];W[eh]
C[K: Ikken tobi is never wrong?];B[cm]LB[ff:A]C[K: Seems a bit over-concentrated

[EV\] A is the vital point.  B should play here last move to keep W split.  W should play here next move to enclose the B corner.]
;W[dg]C[K: Makes miai of c14 and e14?

[EV\]  I don't like this move, which helps B split the W position.]
;B[ef];W[cf];B[hc]C[K: Seems like the wrong direction - I would have played a strengthening move like e16. Was the move played reasonable for Black?

[EV\] This move leads to complications but seems possible, although I would not try it as B in a handicap game.  E16 would be safe and strong, a bit submissive but OK for a handicap game.  B could also try to force the C15 - B14 exchange before either of these moves.]
;W[de];B[dd];W[ee];B[ed];W[fd]
(;B[ce]C[[EV\] Cutting on the inside does not give a good result, but cutting on the outside leads to a complicated fight.  See variation.]
;W[fe]TR[hc]C[K: This turned out great for me. Was there something better for Black? Or was the marked stone the problem?

[EV\] See previous comments and variations.  This result is good for W, but B is still in the game.]
;B[bf];W[cg]
(;B[he]TR[hc]C[[EV\] This move is the wrong strategy for B.  Note that the two B cutting stones cannot escape capture, so the W group is extremely strong.  Playing close to a strong wall is not a good idea.  B is acting like he can attack the W stones, but his position is weak.  See the variation for a better strategy for B.]
;W[db]C[K: Is there a stronger move against the corner?

[EV\] This is the best local move.];B[cb];W[dc];B[cc]C[K: I had attacked in sente. Should I have left these two moves unplayed?

[EV\] Possibly.  This is a minor point, not worth a lot of effort, but since you asked, lets consider it anyway.  On the plus side, the exchange is sente and gains a few points.  However, if you save it for later, B cannot do much to prevent it.  B can exchange E18 for F18, but this hurts the outside B stones and still leaves W a clamp at D18.  On the minus side, is it aji-keshi?  I think so.  For example, if B later plays G18, would you defend your two stones?  That would give B a useful forcing move on the outside.  If W omits the corner exchange and B still plays G18 to help the outside, W happily answers at F18.   W then has more options for attacking the corner, like the monkey jump to C19 for example.]
;W[nc]TR[hc][he]C[K: Trying to stop there from being a moyo. Could I have attacked the marked stones  effectively?

[EV\] Some invasion here seems warranted.  I would play a little farther from the corner, but anything around here is the right strategy and direction.]
;B[fg];W[ff];B[eg];W[gg];B[ld];W[bg]C[[EV\] Save this for later.  W would be happy if B played here in gote at this early stage of the game.]
;B[be];W[qc]LB[pc:A]TR[hc][nc][he]SQ[ld]C[K: I jumped into the corner because I didn't think Black square would be doing a very good job of attacking White triangle after the joseki that followed, starting with Black a.

[EV\] I think it would be better to jump out to O15.  The marked B stones are still weak, so splitting B is good.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[qe]LB[re:A]
[qh:B]C[K: It's common knowledge that this move is bad, taking away the possibility of a later Black a supported by Black b.]
;W[re];B[pf];W[qg];B[op]LB[pg:B][fh:A][no:C][np:D]C[K: There were big moves on the board for White. Should I have captured at A or played another big point (e.g. B) and allowed Black to attempt to squirm out with A and then fight? Or should I have started a counter-ladder fight with a move like C or D? I have to admit that I still don't really feel I understand how to handle ladder breakers ;)

[EV\] If you allow B to escape the ladder, you will be split into two weak groups and the game will be over, no matter what big point you take elsewhere.  Moves around C are  likely to get you into trouble.  Just capture at A.  Even if B does not play a ladder-breaker, but takes some other big point (D3 for example), it would still be correct to capture, just to deny B a later ladder-breaking move.]
;W[fh];B[qq]LB[pn:A]C[K: I think this move neglects the direction of play. I think A would have worked well with the left and flattened out White's potential big right side.

[EV\] This B move looks good -- the corner is large.  There is no large potential for W on the right.

[EV\] A move like A would be good if W had already pushed up at Q13 a few times (threatening a large territory on the right) and if B already had a stone around K4.]
;W[pp]LB[oo:A]C[K: Looking at it now, this move seems to be without meaning. Would A have worked without [\] first? Or is there a better line of play?

[EV\] I think you are overestimating W's potential on the right.  Pushing B along the 4th line is only possible if W can enclose a large side area afterwards.]
;B[pq];W[oo];B[np];W[no];B[pn]C[K: Does this forcing move achieve anything?

[EV\] This is a bad forcing move.  Note how much larger a B move at S5 would be without this exchange.]
;W[po]
(;B[pj]C[[EV\] B cannot tenuki on the bottom, he must continue extending as long as W continues pushing.  B is also overestimating the potential W territory here.  Better to reduce from the outside than invade, especially since B can simultaneously expand his top territory.  See the variations for some possibilities.]
;W[mp];B[ph]C[[EV\] Consistent.  Q13 would be more solid -- it looks like W could not cut off Q10.]
;W[mq];B[ig];W[rp]C[K: I spent three moves killing this corner. Was it worth it?

[EV\] Yes.  The B moyo is still not complete.];B[rq]C[K: S3 clearly doesn't save Black. Was there a move that would?]
;W[or];B[nr];W[mr];B[pr];W[ns]LB[mo:B][oq:A]C[K: I can't beleive I played here. There must have been a reason, but I can't see how it could be a good one, when White A connects where this move leaves a possible later cutting point at B.]
;B[rr];W[qs];B[ps]C[K: I can't believe that a 3 kyu would not know that the L group is dead!]
;W[sq];B[dq]LB[lh:A]TR[cm]C[K: This is a common move for securing the corner (with the marked stone in play), but with so much open space on the bottom side, was it the right place?

[EV\] This is the best move locally.  Extending further to the right, toward the W thickness, just lets W invade the corner. 

[EV\] B could also consider a move around A, to secure the moyo he spent so many moves to develop.]
;W[hp]C[K: This big area seemed urgent. Where was the right play? Was the fourth line correct? Looking at it now, I see so much strength above, of both Black and White, that I think influence no longer mattered much, and I should have played thrid line.

[EV\] A move around here is large.  Your point looks as good as any.  You could also reduce the B moyo on top, probably in sente, before playing here.]
;B[jp]C[K: This move heralds the start of the only real fight in the game. I'd love to know what stronger attacking moves there were than the ones I played.

[EV\] B should not invade here.  This move is dangerous and does not even destroy much W territory.  A move to expand and solidify the B moyo is larger and safer.]
;W[hn]LB[io:A]C[K: Or would White A work?

[EV\] A would be a stronger attack, pushing B more forcefully toward the strong W position to the right, but this move is also good.]
;B[jn];W[im];B[km];W[jq]C[[EV\] Better to keep up the attack in the center I think.  W's goal should be to use this attack to get into the B moyo on top.  B should ignore this move and extend upward, giving W a small territory on the bottom.]
;B[kq];W[iq];B[kp];W[mm]C[K: Trying to connect and keep up some pressure at the same time.

[EV\] The cut at N5 is no threat, since you have a connection at L2.  W should play in the center for a splitting attack]
;B[ll];W[nb]LB[pg:A]C[K: I was starting to eye off A again.]
;B[oa];W[lj]C[K: I wanted to be severe.

[EV\]  Good -- best W move of the game.  I can't read out how it ends, but this is the right strategy.]
;B[kk];W[mk];B[ml];W[ok];B[nl];W[ol];B[oj];W[nk];B[nm];W[om]
LB[ql:A];B[ql];W[qm];B[rl]C[[EV\] This move is not sente, as it does not threaten to cut at P6.]
;W[rm];B[qh]C[[EV\] This move is small.  The center fight is still much more important.]
;W[ne]LB[ji:A]C[[EV\] This leads to a hectic fight which I cannot really analyze.  You could also go back to the attack on the weak B group with A and decide how to play the top later.]

;B[ri];W[rg];B[nf];W[me];B[gq]LB[fq:A]TR[rh]C[K: This is big, isn't it? If only I'd played A instead of the triangled stone.]
;W[mb];B[jb];W[af];B[da];W[eb]C[K: I've given away sente again! This is rediculous.]
;B[ek]C[K: I should have played here. It is clearly very big.]
;W[fl];B[ej];W[lo];B[lp];W[ln]LB[lm:A]C[K: Foolishly, I expected Black A.]
;B[nn];W[pg];B[og];W[bi];B[on];W[pm];B[sm];W[rn]LB[ni:A]C[K: Was this needed?

[EV\] This was your opportunity to force at A, removing the aji here.]
;B[mi]LB[lh:C][mj:A][lk:B]C[K: I should have seen this move followed by Black A combine to form cutting points at both B and C.]
;W[li]
(;B[ni]LB[ni:A][mj:B]C[K: But Black missed it, too. I've included one variation.]
;W[ih];B[jg];W[kh];B[gj];W[si];B[rj];W[gr]C[[EV\] Are you really sure B cannot capture this stone?  One possible variation is shown.]

(;B[fr];W[hr];B[fp];W[al];B[bl];W[ak];B[am]TR[al]C[K: At this point I realised that the marked stone was gote, and went back to take the sente moves I should have taken first.

[EV\] So W should either start with the small monkey jump, or play A10 instead of A9.]
