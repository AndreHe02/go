C[Bildstein: I've been experimenting with the 3-3 points and 3-3 invasions recently, and had some success. I know that this is not technically correct, but the invasions lead to firm territory in sente, and I decided that the only way to really understand what was wrong with 3-3 invasions was to learn from my opponents play.

KKMD: Great method.];B[pd];W[qc];B[dp];W[cq];B[jj]C[Bildstein: I didn't expect this, but I was happy about it because it meant I could have one of the corners for free.

KKMD: Clever play by black.];W[cc];B[pp];W[qq]C[Bildstein: And here we were, with my first four stones squarely on each of the 3-3 points. The ball was in Black's court.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro]
(;B[qn]C[Bildstein: This is the standard joseki, but I was hoping Black would double-hane, and leave me with a ponnuki around s6.

KKMD: Wishful thinking. It seems I don't need to explain you why black's choice is good.]
;W[rn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq]
(;W[dq]LB[df:B][dq:A]C[Bildstein: Now I had sente, and I think the most important thing on the board was Blacks wonderful wall. So I played here to stop black from getting another one facing it. See variation.

KKMD: Might be correct, but have you considered pushing the other side ? (see variation)]
;B[ep];W[fq]LB[fp:A]C[Bildstein: Again, pushing towards Black's wall. I understand b5 is a more standard move in this situation. But I didn't want to let Black turn at e3.

KKMD: I think this is indeed a logical followup to your beginning, but you can hereby measure a first effect of the black wall. You're crawling on the third line and declare yourself happy to do that ! If I were black, I would push once more (see variation).]

(;B[cp];W[eq];B[dj]LB[go:B][fp:A]C[KKMD: Again, with black I would have pushed on the fourth line (A and so on) as long as white plays on the third. Now A is a huge point for both players (depending on the circumstances, black could also aim at B) ; usually it is quite a big point and here the tengen stone adds even more importance to it.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[re]C[Bildstein: Because this time I wasn't worried about the turn at p17.]
;B[pg];W[nb];B[ld]C[Bildstein: I can see now that Black is starting to build a significant moyo on the central right, even without a wall facing it.]

(;W[jq]LB[iq:B][jq:A]C[Bildstein: Trying to push towards the centre. I considered j3, but figured that it didn't push close enough the the Black moyo, and would allow Black an ideal extension to l3 (see variation)

KKMD: Now f4 has become even bigger.];B[ce];W[fd]LB[ed:A]C[Bildstein: I don't know what guided my judgement here. I was tempted by e17 (nice, solid, territorial move), but I didn't like the look of Black e15.

KKMD: Your first stone on the fourth line, champagne ! :-) Seriously, this extension seems too large, too thin. You leave aji for black to exploit.]
;B[ee]C[Bildstein: And look, Black played e15. Looking at it now, it seems that I'm forced to defend, giving Black the chance to consolidate his left side some more.]
;W[dd];B[de]
(;W[ic]LB[ic:A][jc:B][id:C]C[Bildstein: Grabing some territory. I didn't want to play further right due to the fear of an invasion at h17, nor higher, since it would allow Black to descent to the third line and force a response (see variations).

KKMD: Small. You must erode black moyos.];B[go]C[Bildstein: Blacks central left was too much now. With walls facing it from top and bottom, and a stone just in the right place to protect it. I felt I had to invade.]
;W[cj]C[Bildstein: Of course, I don't really know where I should have invaded. I only really considered c10 and b10. My motivation for either would be that if black defended on one side, I could extend to the other. Unfortunately, Black gets to decide which way to push me.]
;B[ck]C[KKMD: Black pushes from his stronger side, so it seems like an error of direction.]
;W[dk]TR[dj][ck]C[Bildstein: I decided that since he was being so agressive, so should I. I figured that by cross-cutting, I'd weaken his two groups, end up sacrificing on of mine, and hopefully get enough out of it to live with the other.

KKMD: Which groups are you reffering to ? I guess you're speaking about the two marked stones, which I wouldn't call "groups". Then again, you show good technique with this invasion.]
;B[cl]LB[di:A]C[KKMD: A may show better for black.]
(;W[ej]LB[di:A]C[Bildstein: I figured that c10 was going to have to die.

KKMD: Wrong direction. You will be forced to run toward black's stronger side ; A is better (see variation).]
;B[di];W[ei]C[Bildstein: Allowing d9 to die as well if it meant I could drive Black at d12 (see variation)]

(;B[dh]LB[dh:A][ek:B];W[hi]C[Bildstein: Trying to play lightly. I figured it was the furthest I could jump, and it was here instead of h10 because it left me closer to the top, which was the only place I had any hope of running to.

KKMD: Good.];B[jh];W[em]LB[hg:A]C[Bildstein: Trying to sketch out some eye space.

KKMD: Your move isn't forceful ; I think it's better to escape right now, with A for instance.]
;B[dl];W[hk];B[el];W[hg];B[hq]C[Bildstein: I'd considered Black h3 with the support of Black g5, and decided I could connect.

KKMD: I agree. Well done.];W[hp];B[gp];W[hr];B[ip];W[he]C[Bildstein: Connected, and happy about it. Black still had a lot of solid territory on the left, but I had territory in all four corners, and Black's right side wasn't secure yet.]
;B[jl];W[qj]C[Bildstein: I hoped to be able to connect either above or below, depending on which side Black blocked.]
;B[rm];W[rg]C[Bildstein: I'm not sure that this was a connection, but Black didn't try to cut me, so I didn't have to find out.

KKMD: I believe your stones are connected. I give in variation some attempts by black.]

(;B[pi];W[qi]C[Bildstein: Making sure I was connected.];B[pj]
;W[jp];B[lp];W[kf];B[if]C[Bildstein: After Black played this move, I figured I must have tried to push too far into Black's territory. I couldn't see a way of keeping my centre connected to my top and keeping l14 connected at the same time.]
;W[hf];B[je];W[kn];B[ko];W[jo];B[jn];W[in];B[jm]C[Bildstein: Again, it seems I had pushed to far with l6. Blacks moyo seemed too well defined to do anything with.]

Where did I go wrong? I know that 3-3 invasions are not optimal, but surely they are not so poor as to make the game unwinnable after move 8.

KKMD: Not only are 3-3 invasions suboptimal, they are, the way you play them (that is, very early in the game), poor moves. I think it's the most serious reason why you were behind in this game. Apart from that, your tactical play is great.]

KKMD: The greatest danger in early invading at the 3-3 point is first of all the great influence you give to your opponent, the choice in direction is a bonus. One simple question : do you think a wall like that is worth less than the 10 points you get in the corner ?]
