C[Ok my main thing i wanna know in this is at which points should i go for moyo and if my techniques for gaining moyo were correct and if white could get through any of it.

The review doesn't have to be too long cause some better moves for moyo or territory.

Hi! I hope you like my review, and that it can help you to improve your game  :)]
;B[pd]C[Iluvatar [4k?\]: hi!
Iluvatar [4k?\]: its me shrt ^_^];W[cq];B[pq]C[Momotaro [3k\]: I know.  What's up.
Iluvatar [4k?\]: lol
Iluvatar [4k?\]: ^_^];W[dc]C[Iluvatar [4k?\]: haven't played you since my 26k days]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj];W[po];B[np]C[I would prefer a pincer here - if you give white stable, low positions both at the top and the left, it will be difficult to develop your 4-4 stone.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]LB[qk:B][jq:C][rr:A]C[This is the right move if you want to play around A (when there is a white stone at B, for example). Against a stone at 3-3 this is not so effective, so instead of B P2,B A, W B, B C is an ineresting possibility here.]
;W[qk];B[dp]LB[cn:A]C[May be better at A.];W[dq];B[ep];W[bo]
;B[cm]LB[dm:A][cn:B][eq:C]C[Here i wanted to increas my left side and still connectto my E4 group. does this stone do that? or is it too weak(or slow)?

B A is the joseki move. If you want to press White down, B B is better than the move you played, which leaves weaknesses in the black position. B C, stressing the bottom, seems also possible.]
;W[eq]LB[fr:A]C[Bad - by strengthening Black, White helps Black to cover his weakness. A is better.]
;B[fp];W[fq];B[hq]LB[gp:A]C[I don't know was this a good move here or was it too soon?

This should be at A - see previous comment.];W[dn]C[Good thinking.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[do];W[en];B[gn]LB[gp:A]C[A looks normal.];W[gp]
;B[go]LB[gq:A]C[A is the only move!];W[gq]C[here I was debating weather i shoud save my 4 stones or play H4. what was the better move here? and why?

H4 is better, I think (see variation). But since you made mistakes earlier, the position here is bad for Black already.]

(;B[fn];W[qc]LB[hp:A]C[White should play at A.];B[qd]LB[hp:A]
C[Here too, A is interesting. Black can't use the thickness resulting from answering the 3-3 invasation, so playing elsewhere seems feasible.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]
;W[qh]C[Iluvatar [4k?\]: -_-];B[oh]C[Iluvatar [4k?\]: ok I'm getting nervous -_-

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------]
;W[hp]C[Finally :)];B[jq]LB[ge:B][em:A]C[This is too small. Better A (should be the proper move), or, if you find this to slow, around B to build up your moyo.]
;W[cl]LB[dl:B][em:A]C[here I'm not too sure was C9 a good move? or is it better to play something like E8?

C9 is bad, and E8 as well. Still A, capturing firmly, seems to be best - alternatively you can play B, taking a linerty away from white at least.]
;B[ck];W[dl];B[bl];W[dm]LB[fl:A]C[Should be at A.];B[bm];W[fo]
;B[eo];W[cp];B[fo];W[fl];B[gl]LB[io:A]C[Did you think about A?]
;W[gk];B[fk];W[ek];B[fj];W[gm]C[Iluvatar [4k?\]: -_-]
(;B[in]LB[hl:A]C[A is not better... (see variation)];W[hl]C[Momotaro [3k\]: I'm trying to break a losing streak.

This hurts :)];B[jn]C[Momotaro [3k\]: A really bad one.
Iluvatar [4k?\]: XD thats encouraging
Momotaro [3k\]: I haven't played well in 3-4 weeks];W[fm]C[Iluvatar [4k?\]: 2 weks here]
;B[hm];W[ej];B[di]
(;W[ei]LB[fi:A]C[W A was worth thinking about (see variations).]
;B[gi];W[gh];B[ii];W[gj]LB[hi:A]C[To capure, W A was correct.]
;B[hh]LB[fi:A]C[May be correct. A saves the stones but doesn't seem to be worth the trouble.]
;W[fi];B[he];W[hi]C[Too small.];B[ih];W[pg];B[og]LB[nf:A]C[A looks normal.]
;W[pf];B[oe];W[of];B[nf];W[pi]C[Iluvatar [4k?\]: well guess I can alwasy help you break the losign streak XD]
;B[ph];W[qg]C[Very bad exchange for Black: while gaining nothinghe black stones lose a liberty.]
;B[oi];W[pj];B[pm];W[qm]C[Good.];B[pl];W[ql];B[oj];W[pn]LB[qe:B]
[se:C][rf:A]C[W A, B B, W C seems larger.];B[rg];W[ok]LB[rh:B]
[pk:A][nl:C]C[Right here originally i play O9. But I was thinking is something like Q9 better?

You should always play in a consistent way. So, just having played S 13,  B A seems natural. But it's hard to say what will happen after W B, B C.]

To sum up:
This was a good game, but there seems to be still room for improvement :) Your main weakness is your poor sense for good shape. To get stronger, I would strongly encourage you to get your hands on a collection of professional games and play through it several times.  That way, you could learn the shapes that help you to realise your mostly good ideas in the proper way.]
