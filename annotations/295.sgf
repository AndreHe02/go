C[When I do reviews I like to summarize at the start what I saw
in the game.

In this game the first and formost problem is that white shows
an absolute preoccupation with his opponents territory. White
goes to invade every time B threatens to make a little bit of
territory. When white invades I notice he is often leaving a
local position elsewhere to invade - then after his invasion
realizes that he will lose sente, tenuki's again leaving another
weak position. Soon the board is littlered with weak white groups.
White is very hard pressed to look after these groups during
the middle game.

In addition I suggest studying the josekis that come from a knight
move approach on a 4.4 stone. That advice would be for both of
you. If you don't have books, or software with joseki. Then I
suggest jansteens excellent web site.

After you learn some of these then study some of the josekis
that start from the one space high approach on a 3.4 stone. Good
luck   I would suggest you read Vol I of the Elementary Go series. And
if you can get the Get Strong at the opening problem book. If
you both learn the josekis I suggest and read these two books
once I bet you both would improve 4-6 stones in 4-6 months or
less.

Remember when you study joseki do not try to just memorize them.
What is imprtant is that you understand why each move is the
best move (in that local position) for both sides. Once you start
to underatnd this basic theory then you will start to know when
it is safe (and maybe better) to depart from joseki  becuase
of the global position.   Finally as always constantly make rough estimates of secure (or
almost secure) territorty both sides have. If you start to do
this and know where you stand in terms of points you will find
it easier and easier to find the next best move as your positional
judgement will improve. It is very difficult to proceed to find
the best move on the board if you don't take into consideration
the rough territory estimates and the relative strengths and
weaknesses of all the groups on the board. Thickness and thinness.

A good player does not play into his opponents strength. He/she
learns to exploit the weaknesses.

Let us begin the review];B[pd];W[pp]TR[eo][do][co][cp][dp][ep]
[eq][dq][cq]C[I would like to point out to white that by taking the same side
as black he is allowing a black a play in the marked area. By
letting black play this way you are going to get a cross corner
opening and this inevitably leads to a fighting game. If you
do not like fighting games then I would tend to play the opposite
corner as black so as he cannot get a cross corner opening. Here
is one opening white can easily avoid if he so wishes. As to
if white is at an immediate disadvantage in a cross corner opening
I would suggest asking an 8-9  dan. ;)];B[dd]C[Black is not tempted ;)]
;W[dq]TR[cn][do][dn][co]C[What are you aiming at by playing at d3? If you are aiming to
play at C5 or C6 you will be sadly mistaken. Remember in go you
must read far enough ahead and see what plays lead to what followups.

Black would want to immediatly play in the marked area to limit
whites moyo potential. Which is what black did on his next play.]

(;B[cn]LB[dn:a]C[I could not find this black approach in a fuseki library of 15,000
games.  I just don't think this move is forceful enough as white
may not even respond. If black is going to play two spaces away
then the usual play is at a. See the variation for some common
variations of this joseki.];W[cp]C[I think this is a  good response by white. As it denies b a base
in the corner.];B[ck];W[cf]C[This violates a fairly basic go proverb. When you approach a
corner stone which side do you approach on? The proverb states
the wider side. So if w feels he must approach this stone then
he should do it from the other side];B[ce];W[ci];B[jq]
(;W[mq]TR[ci][cf]C[So has white decided to abandon the marked stones for now? White
should play D14 immediatly. but then that makes black stronger
on the upperside when he plays F16. See var. I also feel that
N3 is wrong as when black plays his next move.....];B[gq]TR[cf]
[ci]C[White must play E5 to get out into the center. Especially becuase
his marked stones can be wiped out if b gets a little stronger
in this area. And as w is leaving weak groups all over the place.
As the game progresses white will progressivly lose initiative
(sente) more and more often as he has so many weak groups on
the board];W[fp];B[jc]C[I think this is an okay move by b. Normally b could not have
played so forcefully. but w's marked stones are weak and cannot
effectivly attack any of b's stones];W[pj]C[Another proverb that white constantly violates is the proverb
that you should play urgent points before big points. I know
it is hard to see the urgents points. But you must strive to
see them. Here there are way more urgent points for white to
play. Becuase white chose to  play the large knight enclosure
in the lower right. His corner is still easily invaded by black
whan the time is right.]
(;B[qn]C[Here black invades. Bad move. All black would have had to so
now was play D14 and he would have the game pretty much in the
bag. It enlarges his upper side in a huge way and attacks white
weak stones. see var];W[qo];B[pn]C[good];W[qf]TR[qn][pn]C[Good! You have to play light here as B as a fair number of stones
in this area. Problem is the marked b stones can run to the center
at any time.];B[qk];W[pk]TR[pn][qn][qk]C[I think this is a bad response as you could have got perfect
shape. Remember the proverb. Extend three spaces from a two stone
wall, four spaces from a three stone wall, etc. If white plays
R10 he gets good shape and b's marked stones are a little cramped.
In go therory you would say blacks stones are "over-concentrated"
if stones are over concentrated they are inefficent. You should
strive to look for moves that give you good shape and over concentrate
your opponent. Every time you do this you take the lead.];B[ql]
TR[ql][qk]C[When black draws back at 23 when white tenukis and approaches
at the top he is just asking for trouble. Also please white learn
to see that you can take profit by attacking your opponents weak
stones. Once your opponents stones are setteled (they have eye
shape or can easily make eye shape) then you can not effectivly
attack them anymore as you will not be able to make sente moves
against the group anymore.   White should have played at R10 now as to take blacks base. Make
good shape for himself. And if you attack the marked b stones
correctly. Even if they live you will have built up sufficent
thickness in the center of the board to invade the b moyo and
or attacked the b stones in the bottom left. Rememember you usually
have to make prepatory moves before you invade or attack. Make
your opponet heavy before you atatck is one good proverb to rememember.]

LB[qq:a]TR[pk][pj][qf][re][qd][qc][nd][nc][ci][cf]C[After 33 W should really really want to play D14 but now if b
connects at Q15 he will get a beautiful large scale attack on
the marked w stones. So w should really take this stone. As his
lower corner can be invaded at 'a'  All the marked stones are
weak. And if B invades the corner and lives. Then the bottom
stoned are weak also.];W[ec]C[Very bad move. white just has two many weak groups on the board.
And now he is offering up yet another stone for b to attack.]
;B[dc];W[gc];B[hd];W[hc];B[ib];W[db];B[cb];W[eb];B[fa]TR[hc]
[gc][db][eb][ec]C[This B move is bad. PLaying at E16 would have been enough. The
marked w stones will almost surely die.  And if w tries to save
them. The fight will make his stones on the left weaker and weaker.
Are you starting to see what I'm getting at?];W[fd];B[fe];W[ed]
;B[ee];W[fb];B[ga];W[hb];B[ha];W[ic];B[id];W[pe];B[ri]C[Here the game is lost.

So I really think that white has to remember to be more paitent.
play more subtle and look after his groups. Wait for the oppurtunity
to attack. In this game had white been more paitent and looked
after his groups. Then it would have been him with the initiative
in the middle game, and black would have been disadvantaged.]
