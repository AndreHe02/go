C[Thanks for reviewing this.

 I've added my own comments which I've labeled "mgt74:", and
a few variations as well, so you could see what I wasa thinking.
Please give feedback, to let me know if I am thinking about the
right things.

 As you will see, I am quite weak at Joseki. I think I made up
for it by connecting and separating stones to save or kill important
groups later in the game.

Just in terms of introduction, I have been playing for about
3-4 months, and have read an introductory book and the "Second
Book of Go". I am eagerly awaiting a book on the opening so I
can improve my strategy there.

All comments welcome and appreciated.   Thanks,
greg - mgt74)

I've added my comments on the comments
prefaced with "David:".  I'm AGA 2 dan, or
about 2k* on IGS.  You are quite strong for only 3 months of
playing.];B[dd]C[SpaceDog: I'll do my best. I'm about 8 kyu on NNGS, which corresponds
(roughly) to something like 11 - 14 kyu on IGS. So I'm by no
means an expert.

Regarding the opening, I personally don't think you should worry
about joseki until later; or rather, if you do study it, it is
understanding the ideas behind the moves that matter, rather
than memorising the moves themselves.

A good book on the opening in general is "In the Beginning".]
;W[pp]C[SpaceDog: Incidentally, a lot of my comments are in the variations,
so make sure you go over those as well as the main tree.];B[cp]
;W[pc];B[qe]LB[eq:a];W[qd]LB[qg:a][pg:P][ph:P][qh:P][pi:P][qi:P]
C[SpaceDog: I feel I should say that this isn't a great move, though
in truth I don't think it's *that* bad. But white seems here
and later too concerned with defending the corner. He could be
aggressive and pincer Black's stone with a move at or near a.
This would remove Black's room to make eyes and force him into
the centre.

The variation shows Black's best response to White's actual move.

David: when black approaches the 3-4 point, you should pincer.
After your pincer, you have a 2 stone to one stone advantage
locally, and black can't easily make a base, so you have the
initiative.

Besides the close pincer Spacedog mentions, any of the moves
marked P are also good pincers since they prevent black from
making a stable shape with a 2 point jump along the edge.]
(;B[re]LB[pe:a]C[mgt74: I think this wasn't a very good response on my part, and
that "a" would have been better.  Any thoughts, or is it too
small to matter?

SpaceDog: No, this is definitely important. You're correct, a
is better. One thing to realise is that gaining influence over
the centre of the board is important. Moves on the second line
have no such influence and are rarely good early on.

White could now play at a himself, getting good influence over
the top of the board.

I realise it's hard for someone new to understand influence;
I don't think I can it into words I could understand myself.
It's something that you'll develop a feel for after playing for
a while, so don't worry if it's hard to grasp now.];W[rd]C[Probably too concerned with the corner territory, which is not,
after all, very big, so a different move might have been better.]

(;B[pg]LB[pe:a][qh:b]C[SpaceDog: Perhaps a is still good, preventing a white move there.
I realise White might then attack the stones with something like
b, but see variation.];W[pe];B[pf];W[oe]LB[lc:a]C[Good. Now, White has influence over the top. Imagine, for example,
how weak a black stone at a or thereabouts would be. This has
mainly been possible because of Black's earlier move on the second
line.];B[qj];W[kc]LB[rf:a][jd:a]C[
mgt74: I feel that White did better inthis exchange, especially
considering he still has the endgame move at "a" available. At
least I keep sente...

David:  white played first and last in this corner, so he used
one extra stone.  You should expect him to have a better position
here since he invested on more stone than you did.];B[nq];W[np]
;B[mp];W[no];B[oq];W[ql]LB[qn:a][pq:b]C[SpaceDog: Unusual. I feel it's bad but I'm not good enough to
know precisely why. Though if Black responds with a this might
hurt White. The standard move for White, instead of the move
he played here, would be b, defending a fair amount of corner
territory.

David:  it's bad because it gives up the corner territory.  Playing
Q3 saves the corner with sente, since black needs to extend down
the bottom edge to stabilize his group.  Then white can play
at r8 if he wants to, but with much more territory.];B[qq]LB[qr:a]
C[mgt74: this got a little messy. I think "a" would have worked
out nicer? In the end, I did manage to profit on the right, but
I think that was luck, certainly not planned at this point...]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[qp];AB[rq]C[mgt74: if the labelling is funny, ignore it. I accidentally deleted
this move, and re-inserted it... still just learning this editor.
I played at S3, but think that S2 would have been better, considering
what happens next...

David: s2 is better shape, since it leaves less bad potential
in the corner.];W[or]
(;B[nr]LB[qr:a]C[SpaceDog: I think Black a would be fine.];W[qr]
;B[ps];W[rr];B[rn]C[mgt74: okay, if he's going to capture my pieces, I at lesat need
to put up a good fight....

David:  this is an excellent move, threatening to save two stones
or connect up the edge.];W[rp]LB[qn:a]TR[ql]C[SpaceDog: In view of what happens next, perhaps best for White
just to let Black have the corner, and connect the marked stone
to the rest of the group with a. The amount of territory he would
lose is not so great.

David:  no, the corner is huge.  If black takes the corner, not
only are there a lot of points, but the white group loses its
base and will become a burden.]
(;B[rl]C[David:  this is not best.  see the variation.];W[rk]
;B[qk]C[David:  this contact and cut works well on the 3rd line, but
not very well on the second line here.];W[rm];B[rj]
(;W[sk]C[David:  this descent is horrible, since it leaves black with
more forcing moves.  White should capture one stone.];B[pl]
;W[sl]LB[qm:a]C[No, White should try to stay connected, ie a instead.]

(;B[pm]C[mgt74: hmmm maybe Q7 better at R7 as in above variation..

David: Much better, or you could try R6, to capture the white
stones with a ko.];W[qn];B[qm];W[ro];B[pn];W[sn]LB[pk:a][ok:b]
C[mgt74: I think white let me profit far too much from this...
Also, I'm still in sente. I am a bit worried about him cutting
at "a" since the ladder to the UL favors him...

SpaceDog: Black can catch the cut with b. See variation.]
(;B[jq]LB[op:a][oo:b][po:c]TR[pn][pm][pl][qk][qj][pg][pf]MA[jo]
[jn][jm][jl][jk]C[mgt74: I was also a bit worried about what white could do to
my stones on the bottom, so I thought it smart to reinforce and
claim territory at this point, giving up sente.

Yes, this seems to solidify Black's position on the bottom well.
But there's another possibility to consider, which will make
use of the central power of Black's marked stones -

Black can cut White with a, and if White b then Black c. Now
White has some very weak stones which are almost surrounded by
Black. Even if he lives in the coming moves, Black can chase
him with moves somewhere near the Xs, building up a massive framework
on the left.

See the variation for a guess as to how this might work.];W[mo]
;B[lp];W[op]C[White sees the danger.];B[gc]LB[ep:S][dj:a][fc:W]
TR[kc]C[mgt74: I don't think this was a great move for me to make.  I
felt like I was ahead, and the battles were essentially settled,
so I wanted to  reinforce my corners. I guess this doesn't really
secure the corner anyway, and doesn't do much to the marked white
stone either... Maybe "a"  would be much bigger?? I have trouble
choosing these types of moves...

SpaceDog: I think a is a possibility.

David: this move doesn't secure the corner since a 3-3 invasion
still works, but it is still good.  A white
move at W would give white the start of a big upper side.  a
is also good, since it makes a big framework.
S is good, to increae the size of your framework.];W[qs]C[mgt74: I guess he was concerned about the 2 points in the corner??]

(;AB[os]AE[or]C[mgt74: in hindsight, I should have ignored him and let him capture
my 2 stones--only about 5 points, and I could have taken D10...
(again, if the labelling is bad, it's because of the editor)

SpaceDog: I agree. White's threat is tiny.

David: yes.  take a big point on the left side.];W[cj]
(;B[eq]LB[hq:a][cl:a][cg:b]C[mgt74: too timid? I felt like I was ahead, and just wanted to
guarantee the bottom and corner there. I guess he can still attack
at "a"? But it would be a hard fight for him

SpaceDog: I'm not sure. Which ever side you move towards him,
he can go the other way. For example, if you play a, he plays
b. On the other hand, a is a good point for you to take. Perhaps
you could play a before E3; if white takes b, you can then play
E3.

David: too timid.  He came into your framework, so you should
put pressure on him.    See the variation.]
(;W[cg]LB[cm:a][cl:b]TR[jq][lp]C[SpaceDog: Probably the wrong way for White to go. I think he
should play a instead, preventing Black from extending upwards
and creating a huge framework in the lower left. ie a Black move
at b works quite well with the triangled stones.

David:  yes.  White should extend downward to
limit the size of black's framework.  The upper corner can still
be invaded later, so there is no urgency in going that direction.]
;B[ce]LB[cd:a][dc:b]C[mgt74: again too timid? I just wanted to have that corner secure
since I feel my position is stronger.

SpaceDog: I don't think it is secure even yet. Stones on the
4-4 point can usually be invaded by a stone on the 3-3 point.
With 3 nearby black stones, such an invasion becomes difficult,
but still possible. If you really want to defend the corner,
a is more secure. An invasion on the 3-3 point is then easily
killed with b, firmly locking the white stone up. See variation
for a 3-3 invasion.

David: 'a' is better to secure the corner.  This move is OK.
Securing the corner is a fine plan if it leaves you ahead.  I
count you ahead in secure territory, and with better potential
for expanding (in the lower left), so this is fine.

Counting the balance of secure territory and the balance of strength/thickness
is a good way to help decide on strategy.]
(;W[cm]C[mgt74: I certainly let him claim a lot of territory unopposed....
and gave him a ton of influence toward the center.

SpaceDog: Hmm, his stones are on the third line, which normally
means they don't influence the centre too much. Stones on the
4th line are more centre-oriented. This is another of those things
I have difficulty explaining precisely why...

David:  The reason is that stones on the third line can be attacked
from above, giving black a wall, so white doesn;t have a wall
here.  Stones on the 4th line are invaded from below, leaving
a wall on the fourth line for center influence.  For example,
see my continuation at d11.]
(;B[dn];W[kf];B[nf]C[David:  this kind of jump works well when you are confining a
group, since if he cuts, he will have a weak group in your sphere
of influence.  But in this case, with the white stone at L14,
the cut is dangerous for you, and the group will not be confined.]
;W[of];B[og]
(;W[ne]LB[ng:a]C[SpaceDog: Instead, a cut at a might cause Black trouble.

David:  yes, white should cut.];B[mf];W[me];B[lf];W[ke];B[kg]
LB[pk:a]C[mgt74: Now I have my ladder breaker so he can't cut at "a"...
but....

David:  You already had a ladder break here.  Prcatice reading
ladders.]
(;W[mk]TR[kg][lf][mf][nf][og]C[SpaceDog: Let me tell you one of the things that I had trouble
accepting until quite recently. Walls, such as the triangled
stones, are often not good at making territory. I know it feels
like you should be able to make territory, but a wall's true
strength is that it can help you attack nearby enemy stones,
especially if those stones are isolated.

So, can the white stone at N9 be isolated?

Yes. See variation, and comments there.

David:  Spacedog is correct.  White jumped one space too far
and should be punished.]
(;B[nm]LB[pk:a][oj:b][mm:c]TR[mk][pl][pm][pn][qm]C[mgt74: I thought a lot about this move, and I hope this is a
good one... My reasons are
1) Begin threat  to confine white's marked stone if he keeps
attacking--his only quick connection is with his bottom group
2) connect with marked black stones in case he makes a cut at
"a"

essentially, I was trying to scare him into running out, or else
I would confine and kill his stones if he kept attacking.

maybe black "b" would have been simpler than the move played,
but  I wanted to try attacking, not just defending.


SpaceDog: I think c instead. See the variation. After your move,
White can play c himself, which comes close to connecting. White
c remains a possibility for some time.];W[mh]C[mgt74: for the next 5 or 6 moves, I am just trying to keep my
weak stones from being attacked while limiting white's attacking
stones' liberties...]
(;B[lh]LB[ng:a]C[SpaceDog: If you're going to defend the cut, I think you should
play one move that defends both cuts simultaneously. Black a
instead of the move you play for example.   See variation for
what happens if White tries the cut.];W[mi]
(;B[nh]C[David:  this leaves behind two cute, so you will get cut.  You
should make a solid connection here.];W[mg];B[li];W[ng]LB[lg:a]
TR[kg][lh][li]C[SpaceDog: I think the other cut is better, and then the triangled
black stones are themselves in trouble.];B[lg];W[nj]
(;B[ni]C[David:  this makes a bad shape, leaving behind an atari, and
letting him cut you.  A hanging connection is better.];W[mj]
LB[mm:b];B[oj];W[oi];B[oh];W[ok];B[pj];W[pk]C[mgt74: here's the cut... so, the real fight for survival begins.]
;B[nl]TR[pl][pm][pn][qm]C[mgt74: i think this was my strongest move here--keeps my marked
stones alive while threatening to cut him.

David: yes.];W[nk]
(;B[lm]LB[ll:a]TR[nm][nl][pl][pm][pn][qm][ng][mg][mh][mi][mj]
[mk][nj][nk][ok][pk]C[mgt74: at this point, I'm pretty pleased, but still a bit scared.
he only has 4 liberties, and needs to run, and i'm pretty comfortable
that my marked  black group is connected, with friendly stones
to run toward if necessary. I'm a little worried about my group
around M13, but hope to make eyes while threatening his maked
group, or run to the upper left if there's no other choice.

SpaceDog: I think a instead actually catches White completely
and kills him. See variation.

David:  yes, capture the white stones.];W[ml]C[David:  this white move is bad.  It doesn't gain any liberties
and strengthens black by forcing him to connect.];B[mm];W[kk]
C[David:  here you could consider attacking him strongly, and pulling
your stones out as part of the attack.]
(;B[lo]LB[kn:a]C[mgt74: here, the only other option I could see was "a"

David: I like your move better than a, but I would attack.   You always have the ko at s8 if you get desperate.]
;W[ik];B[jh]LB[ig:a]C[SpaceDog: You should move faster, ie at a.

David: Yes.];W[ln];B[kn];W[mn];B[jm]C[mgt74: i think he gained nothing from that exchange, while I
secured a nice wall facing my moyo.

David:  yes, this exchange was good for black.];W[hm];B[jj]
LB[jk:a][il:b][hl:c][hk:d]TR[kg][lh][li][lg][lf][jh][mf][nf]
C[mgt74: I think this was probably a bad move--peeping at cut point.
At this point, I thought he would live for sure, and wanted to
make eye shape for my marked group. I think I should have done
it in another direction maybe, and kept that cut at "a" open.

SpaceDog: I'm afraid I'm not sure. There are some complex possibilities
here, on account of the fact that the white group is itself still
vulnerable. I'm uncertain, but perhaps b, White c, Black d, cutting
White and creating 2 weak white groups. On the other hand, since
you have a weak group yourself, I can't be sure how this would
turn out.

David:  this peep is fine, if he connects as in the game, since
it strengthens your group in sente, and prevents him from making
any shape here with his group.  The drawback is that he can connect
with a bamboo joint and solidfy his connection to the h8 stone
as well.]
(;W[jk]C[David:  White has a better answer to this peep since he can make
a bamboo joint in sente.]
(;B[kj]LB[hi:R][hh:R][hg:R][if:a]C[mgt74: again, I don't think this was a very good move I made,
but I was trying to secure my eyes... probably best done elsewhere,
but I am not very good at making eyes. I did a variation above
that seems to work ok for black by not playing this move. But,
white may be better than me at killing my stones... ;-)

SpaceDog: Possibly a instead, reaching towards your black stones
in the corner.

David:  this move is not good, since it only makes one eye and
is gote.  If it threatened to cut it would be ok.  You should
run away instead, at one of the points marked R.  Since the white
stones are not alive yet either, you should run while attacking,
so I would prefer the H11 move.];W[ho]
(;B[jf]C[mgt74: as above, probably not good, just trying to guarantee
i have 2 eyes, and maybe secure some territory toward the upper
left

David:  this move is slow.  You should jump in the center to
attack the white group.  You should be aiming at the cut around
H8.];W[fg];B[hg]C[David: Another slow move.  You are too concerned with making
eyes for your center group, so you played 3 moves to secure about
3 or 4 points of territory.  Notice that white is not wasting
moves making eyes for his center group.];W[fe];B[fd];W[hi];B[gf]
;W[ff];B[le];W[ld];B[jd];W[kd];B[je];W[ic]LB[gh:a]C[mgt74: here I had 5 seconds on the clock to make 3 moves....
so they were just instinct reactions, not thought out....

SpaceDog: If I was White here I think I'd secure the connection
at a, which should also give good territory on the left];B[ge]
;W[hd];B[jc];W[jb]
(;B[dl]TR[hl][hk][hj][il][gh][hm][ho]C[mgt74: At this point, I think there is a chance that I can still
cut white's middle group off at one of the triangle-marked points.
or at least separate and kill his marked stones. He doesn't look
like he can make 2 eyes on the bottom. So, I wanted to build
some strength in the square-marked area to prepare to cut him
and prevent from making eyes. Here it goes...........

David: Aiming to make thickness here to cut off the white stones
is an excellent plan.  It shows a good understanding of strategy.
His connections are quite weak.

Just pushing along the top is simpler, and avoids the fight later.
Your move invites him to cut you and start a difficult fight.]

;W[dq];B[ek]C[David:  you gave up a lot in the corner for this attack.  If
white defends properly now, you will get little in return.  Usually
you have to give up something to get an attack, but this might
be too much.  Big groups are hard to kill, so it is better to
take territory while chasing a weak group, than to stake the
game on killing it.]

SpaceDog: Absolutely no reason to take the ko whatsoever, that
I can see.];B[fs]C[White resigns.

David: I think if white continues with the atari
he has a chance...

mgt74: White decided that I had won, and this is where he resigned....
Thanks for the review!

SpaceDog: Just to satisfy my own curiosity, I'm going to play
a few moves to see what might happen if White cuts...

But anyway, I think you're doing very well for only a few month's
play. IGS uses a harsh rating system; I'd guess you'd have a
much better rank than 25 kyu in the real world.

I think I've been stressing the way attacks can lead to gaining
strength and influence in this review. The book "Attack and Defense"
looks at this. This book is not too complicated, and you might
want to give it a look fairly soon, perhaps after a few more
months.

But I think you're doing OK. Your games are certainly far less
boring than my games as a beginner - I was too frightened to
get into fights...

I've been talking a lot about influence as well... the value
of this is learnt by experience, I feel, but you must remember
to consider how your stones affect the centre...]

(;W[pk]C[SpaceDog: OK, I've missed out a black move, but this is just
to show how the cut fails. The other branch of the variation
tree is about your actual possibilities on this move.];B[ok]

;B[qi];W[sj];B[qh]C[SpaceDog: And White gets into Black's territory. But Black gets
a fabulous wall facing the centre. I can't predict how much value
it will be to him, but it will likely be worth it. It could help
him cut white stones in the centre off from the sides, for example,
by ensuring that the black stones that do the cutting are safe
(because they're so close to this strong black wall).])

LB[md:a]TR[kg][lg][ng]C[SpaceDog: This variation was probably not best play from either
side, but note how Black gains power by attacking. He now has
supreme influence over the bottom and bottom left. The triangled
stones also face menacingly towards the white position at the
top, which is now not so secure as it once was. An invasion at
a, for example, now seems a genuine possibility.]))

(;B[pe];W[nc]LB[oc:a]C[SpaceDog: White must make this move, or Black may play at a,
attempting to seal White into the corner, where his stones will
have little influence on the rest of the board. I think the resulting
fight will favour Black.];B[qi]C[SpaceDog: Black makes a nice extension. In terms of the amount
of prospective (ie not totally secure yet) territory the two
sides have made, the result is about equal. But White played
in this corner first and should expect to do better. This is
why his move at R16 is not considered good.]))
