C[Hi, I'm Nacho. I played black in this game in KGS.

First of all, thanks for taking the time to review this game.

I am most interested in the strategic part of the game, and I already added some specific questions in some moves.

More generally, my main concern is in which areas to focus my efforts to improve.

Again, thanks in advance for reviewing my game.];B[pd];W[dp]

(;W[qg]LB[qf:a]C[Would it be better for white to extend to A instead?

patrickb: That's possible, yes, though not necessary here. White would have to have a plan for dealing with the invasion at R12 then.]
;B[nc]C[I have the "always answer to a kakari" thing burned deep in my mind, but given that white 8 is that far, I felt tempted to play tenuki instead.

patrickb: yes, this would have been a good time to consider tenuki.]
;W[rd]C[This feels strange to me, I am used to this after the keima-kakari, but now it seems too far from white 8.

Anyway, I just answered the normal thing...];B[qc]C[patrickb: this is fine. Note that white now has a weakness at S14. I've illustrated in the variation that follows. As a result, he hopes to play at S17 later.]

(;W[rc]C[patrickb: white plays here to avoid that, but it's too small here. Black should (and does!) tenuki.]
;B[cf]LB[fd:a][cn:c][jq:b]C[Other moves I considered where:

A: get a strong hold of the upper side

B: good extension from my shimari

C: kakari on the other white stone



Of these, C I didn't like. It seemed like giving white the chance to play at B.



A seemed good, but I thought that white had not many chances of making territory along the upper side, as I had a quite strong position there.



B seems good, but I didn't want to play for large territories.

patrickb: b is fine. An approach to the bottom left from the bottom might be interesting, too.]
;W[fc]C[patrickb: White is playing a low territorial game... You can be willing to let him do so. Reducing plays like Q11 later will be very effective, but you need territory of your own, too.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[ci]LB[hc:A]C[patrickb: my concern playing like this is that blacks position on the whole seems a little low. Almost every black stone is on the third line.

A is now actually a relatively large point for white, as black can push at B17 to create trouble for white later.]
;W[gq];B[jq]C[I was happy with this, I think white 18 at 19 was better, right?

patrickb: White doesn't want to get too close to what he regards as a strong black position. Personally, however, I agree. On thie other hand, K3 is low, and b is strong here. A higher play that aims more toward the center might help take advantage of black's low position.]
;W[jo]C[patrickb: This move is interesting, but perhaps inconsistent with white's general strategy.]
;B[lp]LB[lq:a]C[White 20 confused me. I didn't expect it. I played the keima, but I still think it was too small.

The problem is I didn't want white to play around A.

patrickb: if white plays around A, you simply push through at L4 and start a fight where you have pretty good support. that's nothing to fear. On the other hand, this *is* a reasonable move.]
;W[ho];B[cm]LB[cn:a]C[ Maybe at A?

patrickb: I'd prefer closer at A or one to the right of A, yes. Black's position is strong everywhere, it will be hard for w to do anything on the left side, and the corner is open, too. Play at A, or play a higher move if you want black's response to be gote so you can play either at H17 or O8.]
;W[co];B[em]C[ Is this correct? I still don't like it.... although it does threaten to create a moyo on the left side...

patrickb: no, this isn't good, and the problem comes from C7. Note that you may still be able to make some trouble in the corner, probably a ko.]
;W[ok]C[patrickb: ouch. Is the invasion at R6 a problem? Probably yes, as black would have to make a submissive reply at S6. However, it's probably better for black to deal with that than to let white have the large top.]

(;B[pm]LB[jc:a]C[ I wanted to play at A, but i was worried about an invasion.]
;W[jd]C[patrickb: and white gets the last big point.]
(;B[kc]C[patrickb: the first really *terrible* move of the game. This move just helps white reinforce his top and make it into solid territory, all while black gets a low and small territory to match it. *Very* bad.]
;W[jc];B[kb];W[jb];B[le];W[ef];B[jf];W[he];B[eh]LB[og:a][mm:b]
C[Black creates mini-moyo... at A maybe?

patrickb: what's the followup? The biggest problem I see is that while black is playing moves that are relatively large, none of them seems to be urgent or particularly forcing or to put much pressure on the other person. Both sides seem to be afraid to really push at the other side and mix things up and fight. This is very disturbing. *Leave* invasion points and have plans to handle them - that way if your opponent invades, you can attack for profit. If he doesn't, you get *more* profit.

First, let's count the approximate score. Black has 30-odd points in the lower right, 15 points at the top, and another 25 points on the left, so 70 points.
white has 15 points on the right, 30 at the top, and 30 at the bottom left, so about 75, so white is ahead, but only marginally. That's to be expected in a passive game like this. A isn't bad, but black would really like to get something around B.]
;W[df];B[cg];W[og]C[patrickb: Okay, we're in pure endgame here. Sente is the most important thing. B17 is, as such the most important move for both sides as it's large and sente. S18 follows closely on its heels.]
;B[mg]C[patrickb: why this move? a white play here isn't big and isn't urgent? White should now play B17.]
;W[qd]C[patrickb: white returns the favor with a mediocre move.]
;B[qb];W[pe];B[od];W[nn]C[ I don't know if I answered this the right way...

patrickb: what is there to answer, exactly? what's the threat?]
;B[ln]C[ The idea was prevent the connection to the left, forcing white to connect with his other group, and that way still have some exit into the center from the left side. Not that I needed it, but I didn't want white to build much influence.

patrickb: Okay, good, this is at least positive thinking. The center is small, however, in terms of territor, and with the fighting over (it never started), that's not as important.]
;W[nl];B[oo]C[patrickb: gote, and not huge.];W[no];B[mm]C[ Same idea as black 49]
;W[nm];B[np];W[hl]C[patrickb: speaking of small... there's no territory in the center. This move does nothing.]
;B[eo];W[ep];B[fo];W[gp];B[jm]C[patrickb: why? what does white gain of a move here? what does this threaten? If nothing, why are you playing it?]
;W[ej]C[patrickb: ow.];B[bn];W[bo];B[fi];W[fk];B[dk]C[ I didn't want to be shut in with too little territory, so I played 61 and 63 before playing this.]
;W[gm];B[hr]C[ Extend territory.

patrickb: good, but this is gote. B17 first.];W[gr];B[bc];W[bb]
;B[cd];W[db];B[nh]C[patrickb: white should probably ignore thisand play, perhaps, S9, S18, and J2?]
;W[oh];B[ni];W[oi];B[hg]C[I was planning to get some territory in the center.

patrickb: how, once white plays J10?];W[im];B[jl];W[hj];B[ii]
;W[lk]C[ I had forgotten about this move...];B[ml];W[mk];B[nj]
C[Can white ignore this? I played it thinking that he couldn't, but as soon as I saw the stone, I started to have some doubts....

patrickb: not that I can see.];W[nk]
(;B[li]C[ The right way to defend? As I said, I wanted the territory in the center. I thought I was behind (which I probably was).

patrickb: it's too small. Take the double-sente point at K19 first, for example. That's a *huge* point. J2 is very large, too, as is A5. Those points *cry* to be played. As far as score, let's count it.

Black has (approx) 35 at the bottom right, 20 on the left, and 20 at the top-middle. White has 25 at the top left, 20 on the right, and 20 on the bottom left, so black is already ahead. Play a solid micro-endgame and black will win. See the variation, for example.]

C[ To avoid white playing here. I didn't play at A to avoid white B in sente, but now that I think it, that wasn't a big problem...

patrickb: this is correct. It makes a white play at H1 gote while leaving you G1 in sente. You should look to play it soon.]
;W[kp];B[kq];W[qk];B[rl];W[pl];B[om]LB[qm:a]C[ This was just to defend the cut at A. I chose defending it this way, because I thought "well, if I have to defend the cut, at least I can take 1 point in gote"]

C[ Maybe A? The marked stone was getting cut, but I thought I could connect it to the left, so I didn't mind it.

patrickb: a is better, but G1 and G5 are still big and absolute sente.]

LB[je:a]C[White resigns.

patrickb: Nice move at the top. On the whole, I'd say your biggest problems are an overly passive game, and a real need to look at sente in the endgame. The game is close here without this play when you had the opportunity to be up by more than 10 with better endgame play.]

(;B[hc]C[patrickb: so black goes here. It's hard for white to actually build anything while attacking this stone, and this adds the threat of a black push at B17 followed by a placement at D18. If w covers that by playing B17, black simply pulls back to K16 and is happy.]
