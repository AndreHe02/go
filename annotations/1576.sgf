AB[dp][pd]C[nodrog [28k\]: hi
marhaus [30k?\]: hello!];W[pp];B[cd];W[ec]C[Good choice of attack time. I would have gone to E16 myself, as E15 does take a chunk out of your expansion room while netting him a possible large chunk of the board]
;B[ee]C[good response black];W[gc]C[Good one hop. A hope in the other direction would've been asking black to fight you. This early on, that would've been bad.]
;B[cj];W[cg]C[This doesn't look good for white. Black can easily connect out, and white has almost no breathing room, and no room to make life]
;B[eg]C[And hes just encircled you, so you can't jump out either. Good, calm move for black]
;W[dd];B[de];W[ce];B[be]C[good move black. C14 might've been disastorous]
;W[cf];B[pi]C[Nice brag for territory. K16 or K17 probably would be better, as white threatens to expand into it otherwise]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[fq]C[good point to switch gears white. nice attack point as well]

(;B[ok]C[An odd move black, not responding. F3 isn't a a terribly serious threat, but this grabs you another.... 3 points at most. Theres still an ocean of territory out there. Any of these points work well at this stage]
;W[om]C[I would've tried cutting under black here. It sort of looks like hes making a grab for the middle, but seeing as you've got a good line of stones on the upper edge, getting a large chunk of the middle is nigh impossible. But good defense nonetheless.

Black, here you would've been better with R9, or R8 if you're feeling confident. H3 would also be very good as a pincer on black, and would give you enough of a base to easily make life later. Making a grab for the middle isn't a good idea this early on]

(;B[nl]C[Any of these would've been acceptable. D7 to reinforce your framework is weak but stiull grabs a lot of points, but the two R points would be a lot better in this case.]
;W[kd]C[Good reminder that he doesn't control that edge, but the jumps a little too big. He has enough room to cut you off if he plays it right.

Whites made a huge grab, but hjes over extended himself a little. You should've pushed to force him to defend himself and get some territory back]

(;B[lp]C[N 17 would've been a safe response. J17 would've been very dangerous, but if you bolted toweards the middle or to your corner stones, you could've made a nice gain. This lone stone is a very good start of an attack, but you shouldn't ignore whites grab. I wouldn't have been surpised if he just slowly crawled across the edge]

(;W[mp]C[Nice defense. Its hard to say what the best reaction could've been, as this was a massive attack point for black]
;B[kp];W[ip]C[good job encircling. This reduces his space to expand]
;B[jq]C[Good move black. A knights jump looks more appealing but it would've killed you]
;W[jp];B[in]C[In answer to your question later, this probably would've been the best time to save the group, playing at M3 or L3. It gives you the best hope of running out.]
;W[ln]C[Because once he boxed you in here, your only real hope was making life. N3 would've put you well on your way]

(;B[mn];W[nn];B[mm];W[lq]C[and this cut off your hope of making life]
;B[iq];W[lo];B[ko];W[jn]C[good move];B[kn];W[km];B[kq];W[mq]
C[good job white. It looked a little bad for you, but now you've got black with a long line of very dead stones]
;B[mo];W[lm];B[no]C[watch out for those two stones. hes almost got you in a net]
;W[jm];B[np];W[nq];B[oq];W[op];B[on]C[Good move black.];W[nm]
;B[pm];W[hq];B[ol];W[kr];B[jo]C[This was a mistake I suppose?

For black yes. This is called a net. reagrdless of what move you make, he boxes you in]
;W[io];B[hp];W[ho]C[Here I played G4, and the J3 group was doomed. But was there anything I could have done to save it? J2 or J3 didn't seem to help. What was the mistake I made? Move 56? What should I have done?

The group was dead a while ago.as for saving it, check variation at move 30.]
;B[gp];W[ir]C[marhaus [30k?\]: oops
marhaus [30k?\]: you are good!

nodrog [28k\]: ta :p];B[or]C[These two are also dead right now. You would've been better off with R4 if you wanted to save them]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[oo]C[not necessary. There are still major points to take care of. This is a 1 point move]
;W[qr];B[nr]C[bad move. You can't get blacks m3 group, so your just giving him more prisoners]
;W[dn]C[Another good attack point white];B[cl]C[Very weak defense. I would've attached. He could threaten your upper left corner stones, but this lets white push without any arguement]
;W[bn]C[Good push for white]
(;B[gl]C[Now hes almost boxed your other corner in];W[fp];B[go]

Correct, even if you pushed at C6,hed just have to C5 and lose one point.]

MA[bg]C[Should have been at B13? Would it have helped, or was there an even earlier mistake?

He got stuck in the trap he got you with. He was surrounded without enough room to make life. He was counting on you missing it or making a mistake]
;B[af];W[dg]C[bad move for white];B[eh];W[bc];B[bg]C[I'm really proud of this one too, a double atari with a trap I guess :)

Very good. Without the snapback, he might've saved himself]
;W[ag];B[bg]C[marhaus [30k?\]: :)]
(;W[ib]C[Weak, awful expansion for white]
(;B[df]C[Not necessary yet. He can't live, and you kill him with one move. Theres still territory to be claimed. Even E16 would've been slightly better, as it gives you a chunk he could've pushed too earlier]

(;B[lj]TR[jl]MA[ll]C[Would M8 have been any better? K8 is doomed I guess.

Nope, but the fact that you recognize the mistake is very good]

You should've risked it. You could've gained a lot more in the upper right then you can here]

No, this is good too. It cuts whites expansion here];W[jf]C[odd white move. Just take the lower stone]

Nope, but white missed an opportunity it seems];B[je]C[....J12... both of you missed it?]

Right, so would I];B[qo]C[Now whites dead, where earlier he was ripping into blacks territory]

It looks like black would've come out on top, as you have even amounts of prisoners. Nice game by both. You both made some really great moves and some really bad ones.

Black, you need to ask yourself early on in the game "Will this move get me the most territory?" Also, try some basic tsumego. 
White, you need to relax. You played fantastically early on, but as the game went on, you started making bad moves, culminating with the right edge at the very end. That edge would've won you the game]
