C[Hi my name is Ronald Wopereis, woepwoep on KGS and IGS. I will review the game for black. My comment is preceded with RW>]
;B[dd];W[op];B[dp];W[pd];B[nc];W[ld];B[ne];W[nd];B[md];W[od]
;B[me];W[pf];B[lc];W[kd];B[kc];W[ic];B[lf]C[RW> Usually it is best not to leave the 3rd / 4th row at the start of the game, for the reason that most points are secured on the third row. Best K17.]
;W[fp];B[jd];W[ke];B[jf];W[je];B[ie];W[id];B[jc]C[RW> there you go ! excellent move.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[if];B[le];W[he];B[ig]C[this move i was unshure of i didnt know if it would have been better to play k15 but i moved here to try and make a stronger move to the lower part

RW> at this stage there is so much open space left for both players... neither move has large impact on the score. K15 secures two eyes, that's all. So this move is fine - but D6 much better.]
;W[je];B[ke];W[ed];B[df];W[ef];B[ee];W[fe];B[de];W[dc];B[ec]
C[i dont think this move was too go i should have prolly played on the other side or in the lower corner

RW> Lower corner indeed much better. C17 better than E17, because you don't want to play in between two white groups.]
;W[fd];B[cc]C[RW> here's the move. Very good.];W[db];B[cb]C[RW> yes, this is the right way. Now you have the corner.]
;W[eb];B[gg]C[RW> again, playing in the centre does not give you much points. But i do understand that you wish to connect the two black groups with D4.]
;W[gf];B[fg]C[i think also i should have played this at  e13 would have put him in atari and stopped him from cutting in

RW> e13 is still on the fifth column - not easy to defend all territory left of the fifth column. Either way it is a tough journey. Best stay on C and D line. Even better now to concentrate on lower left corner.]
;W[eg];B[eh]C[RW> this way you force white to surround D14 group, which is what he probably wants. Best to stay on D or C line. F14 to cut would also be nice move.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[dh];B[cf];W[ch];B[dj];W[cj];B[cm]C[RW> superb move ! excellent.]
;W[bl];B[ck];W[bj];B[cl];W[bm];B[cn];W[fn];B[fl]C[RW> this move i can see why, but it is really better to first take the lower left corner and not play in the center for a while.]
;W[gl]C[RW> white is happy to build his first wall.];B[fm];W[gm]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[fj]C[RW> this move gives away initiative. Note white G10 forces blacks next move. From there, white takes the lead.]
;W[gj];B[fk];W[hi];B[gi];W[hj];B[pj]C[RW> Q10 is ok, but much harder to get territory on the right side than in the corner. You can play Q10 after taking the right lower corner with R4 first.]
;W[pl];B[nk];W[nl];B[rk];W[rl];B[pk]C[RW> white is happy. Now he can build a second wall.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[ol];B[ql];W[qm];B[qk];W[rm];B[mk]C[RW> these moves all strengthen the white wall. Best is not to touch white stones at all. No worry, every go student must go through this phase in learning. Just play many games to see for yourself what works and what does not work for you.]
;W[ml];B[ni];W[eq];B[qg];W[qf];B[pg];W[oc];B[nb];W[ob];B[ll]
;W[lm];B[dq];W[eo];B[dn]C[RW> B6 much better. Look at it this way: it costs you two moves for each point to defend in the center, whereas it costs only one move to defend two points A5+B5. Go is about being effective - less strokes more work done.]
;W[en];B[em];W[do];B[co];W[dr];B[cr];W[es];B[cq];W[bg];B[bf]
;W[ah];B[di];W[ci];B[jk];W[kl];B[kq]C[this done an ok job in redusing my opponents teritory butit would have prolly beed better to play this sooner i thing

RW> yes agree. Now there are two white walls facing black L3. Looks like mission impossible. Then again, he who does not try does not win.]
;W[kp];B[jq];W[ip];B[jp];W[ko];B[mq];W[nq];B[nr];W[or];B[mr]
;W[mp];B[iq]C[RW> Excellent. Now you have two eyes.];W[hp];B[hq]
;W[gq];B[gr];W[gs];B[hs];W[fs];B[fr];W[fq];B[lp];W[mo];B[lk]
;W[jl];B[kk];W[ik];B[ji]C[RW> better is black B9, followed by F14 and the white group on C12 has still only one eye.]

;W[sk];B[sj];W[sl];B[ri];W[ka];B[la];W[ja];B[oa];W[pa];B[na]
;W[ca];B[ba]C[RW> counterattack Q18 possible.];W[da];B[bb];W[qb]

[gb][fb][sa][ra][qa][ha][ga][fa][ea]C[RW> i think this was a good game. Advice for black is to play on 3rd and 4th line much longer, and avoid making territory in the centre. As you can see, all group have touch down base at the sides and the corners. White won i think because black allowed him to build up two major walls , exchanging the 8 points in the black F11 group for the 30+ points in the lower right corner.

If you set out to fail, and you succeed, then what have you got? So go on and enjoy more games. It is going well.
