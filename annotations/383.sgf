AB[pd][dp][pp][dd]C[A note on black's "style": I've been reading  Cosmic Go, though as you
will see I don't know half the josekis yet. :-)   Even though I won by 7.5,
I wasn't happy with the game because all  my potential territory seemed to
evaporate.  In the end there was one big  black dragon and contrary to the
proverb, all 6 of the white groups lived.  I  guess my main question is at
what points in the game should black have  secured territory?  And when
were the white groups vulnerable to attack?

My problem with this review is that I  am are only 3 stones stronger than you  and you opponent is stronger than me. On  the other hand I am not good in theory.  This makes me feel that my comments will  not be helpfull enough for you. However I  will try to do what i can.]
;W[nc];B[jd];W[cf];B[dj];W[fq];B[jp];W[qn];B[pj]C[All this seems perfectly allright.
If i played black, I would be more  aggressive whith those white stones, but I  suppose this is only a matter of taste.]
;W[np];B[no]C[I misplayed this corner sequence, though  was satisfied that I led the
black stones out and separated the two  white groups.

The idea behind such a move is to attack  the one of the two white stones and use the  attack to built a wall to use against the  other.]

(;B[nm]LB[nm:c][mn:a][mm:b]C[Is there anyway to cut off the right side  stones?
Difficult question. Maybe not immediatelly  but he can threaten shuting them in  achieving something else for himself at the  same time. Anyway white is already  thinking the same way about the black  corner group, so one of the moves marked  (including the one played in the game) are  nessesary. Maybe other moves are also  good (like the cut shown in the variation)]

black go now?
I think it was time to attack the lower group.  Some ideas in the variations.]

I think o17 is worst but not for the reason  you said. You shouldn't hope to connect  the o11 stone.]
