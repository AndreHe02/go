C[Commentary: Andre Bergholz (2K), marked with AB.


Hallo!

I am Black.  I lost this game, but it was close.


i'm not really sure what I'm looking for by submitting this game for review, That i know is my early fight <after B51> in lower corner is terrible for me, i hope u can fix it.

And Perhaps, some general tips, comments, and alternate moves on my go.

I would like to know where I stand, and what I need to do to move up the ladder.

Thank you so very much!

;W[dd];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[kc];B[pb]LB[fq:A]C[AB: The point you play is very big, but I prefer 'A;, which seems more active to me.]
;W[po];B[cn]LB[np:A]C[AB: Ok, but answering at 'A;' is a good option as well.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[np];W[qm]LB[rr:A]C[AB: I think 'A' is better for White as it settles the group right away and has an effect on the Black stones as well.]
;B[ok]LB[rr:A][fq:B]C[AB: This is possibly the first real mistake. The move is not bad by itself, but it  feels like a reflex to answer the White move. There are more interesting points, I think. 'A' settles the Black group and has an impact on White as well, it is the best move I think. Otherwise, a second approach at 'B' is also more interesting than the move you played.]
;W[co]LB[fq:A][dj:B]C[AB: Not so good, I think. 'A' or 'B' are better.White only plays this move when White has a stone around 'B' himself.]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[dj]C[AB: The result is good for Black.];W[mp]
C[W:don`t know how to handle this];B[hq]LB[nq:A]C[AB: Well, one thing is for sure you need to answer to White move. 'A' is simple and good. If you just consider the exchange White N4-Black 'A;, then who has gained from these two added stones? It's Black, because his somewhat weak group is much more stable whereas the White stone doesn't do much of anything at all.]
;W[oq]C[AB: Now Black will run into trouble... You have permitted White to play twice in a row in a very crucial area of the board, where two groups are not quite settled. That's a big plus for White, which is not compensated by the H3 stone.]
;B[or];W[nq];B[nr]C[AB: Very plainful to play on the second line, the line of sure defeat:-).]
;W[mr]C[AB: Mistake. Just N3, then Black has no atari.];B[op]
;W[mq];B[pp];W[rr]C[AB: Big!];B[on]LB[rs:A]C[AB: I think, the hane at 'A' should be played first.]
;W[qs];B[pr];W[ip];B[iq];W[jq];B[hp];W[jp];B[hn];W[mn];B[nn]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[go]
(;B[ep]LB[ho:A]C[AB: Black should answer the peep. Cutting points in White's shape remain (see variation).]
;W[eq];B[fq]
(;W[er];B[gp]C[AB: Normally, atari is not a good move (something like F2 would be better shape), but here sente is necessary as the connection H5 is absolutely essential.]
;W[fo]C[AB: Black need not to be afraid of this fight. He lost in the right corner, but here Black should have no problems.

W:maybe if this is stronger players`s game, black should happy with this fight.

comment?];B[ho]C[AB: Good..];W[gm];B[jn]LB[hm:A]C[AB: I think 'A' is ok.]
;W[fr]C[AB: The price for the bad shape...];B[gq];W[kn];B[ik]
LB[jm:A]C[AB: Now this is too far, the connection is too vage. 'A' is good.]

(;W[hk]C[AB: White can exploit the Black weakness, I give an example of the bad aji with a complicated fighting sequence. In fact, this fight is too complicated, so the aji of it should be kept. White does the opposite, he plays an incorrect move locally, thereby helping Black to fix his shape and destroy the aji.]
;B[hl];W[gl];B[il]C[AB: Now the Black shape is good.];W[dk]
;B[ck];W[cl]C[AB: Yes, the left side is a little weak, one can't protect everything. However, I think...]

(;B[dl]LB[bl:A]C[AB: ...with 'A' Black can keep his stones (see variations).]
;W[dm];B[ek];W[en]C[AB: Very painful! The two stones are cutting stones and hence very important. Now White is alive, so the balance of the fight is destroyed.]
;B[cm];W[do]C[AB: A good  point to evaluate the game. White has 16 points in the lower left, 8 points in the lower right, 4 points on top (right), 6.5 komi and maybe 5 points for the upper left, and maybe 4 points in the lower middle, two prisoners, total of approx. 45 points.  Black has  8 points on the left, 1 prisoner,  15 points in the upper right, and no more than 5 for the two groups on the lower side, a total of 29 points.  There are easily 10 more points to made on the right for Black, which we can almost count as sure, that makes 39 points. White is a little ahead, which is what I sense, too. Mainly because of the two captured stones. His groups are more at ease. One focus should be the lower side where both Black and White are still unsettled.. A move like N7 is very big.]
;B[cf];W[jm];B[jo];W[nm];B[ko]LB[om:A]C[AB: I think the White move must be answered at 'A'.]
;W[om];B[mm];W[ln];B[pn];W[qn];B[pm];W[ml]C[W:After this i got the sente, but i didn`t know what is best move for me.]

(;B[fc]C[AB:  I think this move is good. An alternative may be to build center influence with H10 (see variation). A White move at H10 is unpleasent as it puts the Black group into danger. 

W:Simply make double approach, bad?];W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[ce]
;W[de];B[cg]LB[dg:A]C[AB: I think hane at 'A' is good.];W[he]
LB[ff:A]C[AB: Overplay I think. White should just cap at 'A'.]
;B[ff]C[AB: Good.];W[eg];B[fg];W[cd];B[cb]C[AB: Not good. Black should take car e of his own group first.]
;W[db];B[bd];W[bc];B[be];W[bb];B[ic];W[jd];B[ie]C[AB: I think this move is bad shape. You basically play a one space jump with a peep already being there. That cannot be good. J16 was ok.

i just play light to get center moyo.];W[id];B[hd];W[hc];B[gd]
;W[ib];B[hf]C[AB: The result is good for White.];W[qh]C[AB: Risky.]
;B[qf];W[pj];B[pk];W[mj]LB[oh:A][og:B][nh:C]C[AB: No. Need to take care of invasion stones. 'A', 'B', and 'C' are alternatives.]
;B[oh]LB[oj:A]C[AB: Maybe at 'A', as the Black group is not alive.]
;W[oj];B[ri];W[qi];B[qj];W[rh];B[nj];W[ni];B[nk];W[oi];B[mk]
;W[ll];B[mi];W[nh];B[lj]TR[oh]C[AB: The P12 stone looks funny now. The ponnuki is good thoug, as it helps also the group on the left.]
;W[og]C[AB: Now the P12 stone really had a purpose :-).];B[ne]
LB[eh:A]C[AB: Not bad, but 'A' seems really big.];W[kk];B[ji]
;W[nl];B[pl]LB[ql:A]C[AB: 'A' instead.];W[ij]C[AB: Overplay. G10 instead.]
;B[gk];W[hj];B[jj];W[je];B[if];W[ob]C[AB: Yes, I think it's very risky. 

W: After this i play tenuki, is that wrong?];B[bn]C[AB: I don't think B8 works. I think you can answer B7.

W:i play this because white can got the big 'yose move' with B8]
;W[qc]C[AB: That is a problem now. It seems that White can live. And then you are in trouble...You definitely should have answered P18 (with R17 BTW).

W: I don`t know if my corner is still not safe T_T];B[pc];W[qb]
;B[pa];W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[pe];W[rc]C[AB: I think T18 is the vital point for White to live. Now I think you may be able to kill. Of course, the question remains whether you have enough liberties yourself.]
;B[se]
(;W[mg]C[AB: I think this White move is not so good. If White wants to live, it is better to capture at S10, which also puts pressure on your other group. White shoudl try to live (see variations).

W: he gave me the corner, is running to center is bigger than corner?]
;B[sc];W[lh];B[li];W[fk];B[gj];W[gi];B[fj];W[fi];B[fl];W[ei]
;B[di]C[AB: Yes, H11 is big. not only six points, but no more worries for  your groups.

W: Losing move maybe? i think i should just capture in H11 now]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[ih];B[jh];W[dg];B[hi];W[jg];B[jf];W[hh]C[AB: I think not (see variation).

W: is my K14 dragon can live? if i take J11, and he play L13,]

(;B[kf];W[ii];B[jk];W[kg];B[le];W[md];B[me];W[lk]LB[rj:A]C[AB: White should capture 'A' first as it makes real points.]
;B[sj];W[rl];B[rk];W[ph];B[km]LB[jr:A]C[AB: No fancy stuff, just live with 'A'.]

C[AB: Altogether this was a pretty good game. The biggest strategic Black mistake was probably in the beginning when you let White play twice in the lower right. That changed the overall situation. In this game you could really sense that go is a fighting game and not a territory game. The weak groups haunted you until the very end. That's why it is important to settle them as quickly as possible. Then you are free to take the initiative. I suggest you look over this game again and try to follow how your three groups, the two at the bottom and the one in the top left develop until they are finally barely alive. Would you not wish to solve such an issue with one gote move sometimes. But there is also the issue of the White group inbetween your groups at the bottom. If it was weaker, your groups would automatically be stronger. Try to think about the relationships of the groups on the board. Afterwards, there are of course some tactical mistakes, but that is quite normal and will be better with increased reading ability.
