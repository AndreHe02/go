C[forfun (hereafter ff) - This is an interesting game.  The early opening was along familiar lines but then an unusual variation in the upper left led to a position that was to Black's advantage - to a larger degree than perhaps Black realized.  I think that Black went wrong in the bottom left, mainly due to an unnecessarily pessimistic assessment of the situation.  This resulted in a significant gain for White but probably not an overall lead.  In the upper right Black and White broke up each other's territory at a time when I think Black had the larger prospects.  Overall I have the feeling that Black would gain a lot from developing the ability to assess the overall position more calmly and objectively.

Let's look at some of the details...];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[cf]C[I like this approach move];W[nc]
(;B[pf]C[maybe I should play on the 3rd line?

ff - Playing at R14 would have allowed Black to take sente here (see variation).]
;W[jd];B[qj]C[I felt it was important to make shape first, tenuki would leave a weakness

ff - R10 is a big play in its own right.  It is not bad.  Black can be satisfied with the overall position here.  However, if Black felt that the weakness on the right was unacceptable, then probably R14 would have been a better choice than Q14.  It is exactly that kind of consideration that has made R14 by far the dominant response to O17 in modern professional Go.  

In looking at professional games similar to this, Black would more likely have left the right side open for now in order to play first in the upper left.  Playing away is definitely more aggressive, but that is not the same as saying it is better. :-)]
;W[nq]
(;B[lq]SQ[pj][qj]C[maybe the pincer is poor with R10

ff - White always has better opportunities to reduce the side against a low stone.  On the other hand, a second reply on the right (Q6 for example), let's White stretch out across the board as a whole.  Presumably this is what White is looking for by continuing to tenuki from the upper left.  I think that the pincer, expecting White's 3-3 invasion, is a reasonable idea for maintaining balance across the board.  However, see the variation.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]
(;W[ch]C[ff - This is a mistake in direction by White.  Normally White plays either C16 or D15 here.  The danger with the pincer is that Black will manage to make K16 a poor play.]

(;B[cc]C[only move?

ff - More usual here is D16.  See the variation.  But this is not bad.  White struggles to make sense out of the stone on K16.]
;W[cd];B[dd];W[bc];B[cb];W[db];B[bd];W[ce]
(;B[be]C[ff - See the variation for an alternative approach.]
;W[de]C[I didn't expect this joseki

ff - I assume that after playing the pincer, White realized that the usual joseki would leave the two White stones on the top with no real purpose.  This is not joseki.  Black's result is acceptable.]
;B[df];W[ee];B[bb];W[bg]
(;B[ef]C[ff - This works well in the game, but I wonder what Black had planned if White cut...]

(;W[ff]C[ff - White believes Black that B13 is not sente.  All's well that ends well :-)]
;B[bf];W[ge]LB[me:C][cq:A][fq:B]C[I think the result is good for me, at least equal. However Here I didn't know what to do.

The white kosumi on the left seems inefficient - but how should I exploit it? I invaded, but perhaps another move was better

C3 or F3?
N15 is another idea, but aji keshi

ff - First of all, White's hanging connection at G15 leaves behind some terrible aji.  See the first variation.  It should be the solid connection at F15.  As a result, the top is smaller than it looks.  Based on this, I think that Black has the advantage here.  White needs a good fight somewhere in order to get back into the game.  Black would like to make even exchanges: let White build up the left as long as Black builds up the center and right, let White erase some of the right as long as Black erases the left (for example).

On the left, the two White stones are clinging to Black's wall.  Should Black try to attack them or ignore them?  They are a tempting target but in situations like this, Black needs to be careful not to get tricked into capturing them on a small scale.]

(;B[cn]C[ff - This is an erasure play, not an attack.  As long as Black has that in mind things should turn out reasonably.]
;W[ck]C[ff - Unfortunately the perfect extension from the two White stones.  Black has to expect this.  However, the White position is not that strong yet and can never make significant territory so Black should not be too upset.]

(;B[fp]C[ff - Black changes direction.  Now, most likely the exchange of C6 for C9 will not work out in Black's favor.  See the variation...]
;W[fo]C[I felt this (C6) was the wrong decision now, maybe the joseki I choose now is wrong

ff - Maybe C6 was not the best choice.  However, we have to be very careful about just abandoning a stone already played.  In this case, not only did Black play C6 but White answered with C9.  This changes White's potential on the side quite a bit.  By giving up on this area, Black makes the exchange of C6 for C9 very favorable for White.]
;B[go]C[ff - Black responds passively.  These stones are too close to M3 and N5 to be interesting.]
;W[eo];B[hp]C[ff - more normal would be the solid connection at G4 because it is a stronger threat against the corner.  H4 is over concentrated in relation to the stones on the right.]
;W[co]C[ff - White extinguishes most of the aji from both the Black stone and the 3-3 point.  White has turned the left side into a major success.]

(;B[lc]C[not sure about this - too artificial perhaps.

ff - fundamentally this is the wrong idea.  Black's right side is larger than White's top.  Black wants to close the upper right at Q18 and/or expand the right with a play around N15.  First, however, Black should have played the sequence in the upper left corner with E16 and D19.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]
(;B[ob]C[ff - Black is still treating the upper side as more important than the right.  The right is the larger potential territory.  Black invites White to do more damage to the right than Black needs to inflict on the top.]
;W[rb];B[pa];W[qb];B[oc];W[rf];B[jb]C[I want to keep sente]
;W[ed]C[StPatrick: hmm

ff - White gives a big sigh of relief :-)]
(;B[qh]C[ff - Too mild];W[ld];B[mc];W[oj]C[good move

ff - Probably an overplay since it allows Black to attack strongly.]

(;B[mk]C[I wanted to try to resist

ff - The direction of this stone is rather odd.  It is biased toward the bottom which is Black's strongest position.  Naturally White is happy to have the widest escape route pointing away from Black's strength :-)]
;W[ni]
(;B[ok]C[ff - Black tries to make territory using the wall in the bottom right.  This is not "resisting".  White demonstrates that it is tactically unsound as well...]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[nk];B[ol];W[nl];B[om];W[nm];B[mj];W[nj];B[nn]
;W[lm]C[ff - All in all a very disappointing result for Black.  The center potential has been successfully erased by White.  The exchange in the lower left begins to look very favorable for White.]
;B[if]SQ[id]C[aiming at J16, but he didn't answer

ff - This is an overplay.  The Black stone is effectively peeping from inside White's territory :-)]
;W[ki];B[kk]C[ff - Drawing out these stones is not a reasonable idea.  White has already wrapped around the stones.  Black simply helps White.  However, White rejects the help :-)]
;W[jl]C[White attacks what are actually worthless stones for Black.  In doing so, White creates some cutting points that Black is able to utilize later.  White should have calmly jumped straight out to K7.  White should want to move out step by step and quietly absorb the Black stone on J14 while Black fails to make any territory in the center.  The game result is quite different.]

;B[kg];W[mi];B[kh];W[lj];B[ji]C[maybe I still have some chances?

ff - Agreed.  With some help from White, Black has managed to strengthen the center stones without making White completely safe.]
;W[ie];B[gi];W[fq];B[gq];W[fr]
(;B[ei]C[looked honest to me, but perhaps it is slow?

C6 is so dead looking

ff - Fundamentally this is a huge mistake by Black.  Step back one play.  Whose center stones are weaker?  Whose center stones are closer to being connected?  It is absolutely necessary for Black to realize that White's stones are now weaker than Black's.  The exchange of E11 for E9 eliminates most of Black's chances.]
