C[Sarge: Thanks for reviewing! Please look at both sides.];B[pd]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo];W[jq];B[pi];W[dj];B[jd];W[gc]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: White has gained a small advantage, because of the black shimari in the lower-right corner is facing a low white stone, but that's not too bad. I'd say so far so good...]
;B[cn]C[Sarge: Whats the best way to deal with this invasion?

Thor'Ava'Tahr: A question of choice, it is important too realise black can get a decent group here, however, white will gain points because black must make eye-shape or escape to the center.]
;W[co]C[

ThorAvaTahr: As far as i could see i think this is the best response, giving black as little eyespace as possible while gaining some points in the corner]
;B[dn]
(;W[cl]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: This is not a good move for white, white is overconcentrated, see variation for a normale joseki.]

(;B[bo]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: This however is not a good move for black, he is helping white secure his corner and doesn't even gain eyespace,]
;W[bp];B[do];W[cp];B[fo]C[
Thor'Ava'Tahr: White has a nice corner now, and black has no eye-space]

(;W[fp]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: 20 feels like an overplay, black can force white down while building strength on the outside. I propose f3 here...]

(;B[go]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: This play is too soft from black, white can now remove his weaknesses while securing points and black is not as thick as in the variation.]
;W[gp]
(;B[bl]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: This is a big mistake, I think black is trying to make eye's here, however, he has allready escaped to the center so that is not so important at this moment, however, this action makes white thick and gives white a lot of points.

I would rather propose an attack by black at for instance e13, using his gained thickness, although a previous variation (with black g4) would give a better result because black has more thickness there.

another possibility is to play elsewhere like n3 or to further solidify the black group (in preparation of an attack) with f7]
;W[bk];B[el]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: Good change of strategy, solidify the outside instead of digging in trying to get eyes, however i like f7 better (shape move)]
;W[bm]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: not really necessary; other points like k5, n3, o17 and q14 would be more interesting...]
;B[cm]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: Bad shape, costing only points (white can play B6 now)]
;W[al]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: B6 is better, gets about 5 points more than this move while costing nothing..]
;B[ej]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: touching your opponents stones makes them stronger, this is not what you want here, maybe later an invasion at c14 is possible, but than you don't want your opponent stronger,  better would be g8 if you want to make your group even stronger or tenuki n3 or something]
;W[ei];B[fj];W[eh];B[cc]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: Now black has only a last resort invasion, giving him only a few points in the corner. While if black had not played e10, f10 he would still have the c14 invasion or other plays which would be bigger.]

(;W[dc]C[Sarge: I think i should have gone c16

Thor'Ava'Tahr: Definitly, this is totally the wrong direction.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[cg];W[dg];B[bh];W[ch]
;B[ag];W[bi];B[db];W[eb];B[bb];W[ah]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: White has forsaken almost all his points and instead has a wall which strength is almost completely compensated by blacks k16 stone, very sorrow result compared to the variation with c16]
;B[he]
(;W[ge]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: What is the idea of this move, it hardly gains any points, white is in desperate need of a counter attack, invade somewhere befor black becomes too strong everywhere. (see variations)]
;B[md];W[ic]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: Again way too small, gains only a few points, while black is building tons...]
;B[id]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: no idea why black responds here, leave alone why in this way, if responding locally i would definitly use k17]

(;W[qc]C[


Thor'Ava'Tahr: finally the invasion however a bit late, but still good however, the 3-3 point is not the best choice here, because white easily gets locked in and black can still build a lot of points on the outside. (see variation)]
;B[qd]C[


Thor'Ava'Tahr: Black chooses the right direction here (the top is not so important because white is looking underneath at j17)]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[rd];B[re];W[sd];B[se]
;W[rc];B[qf]C[


Thor'Ava'Tahr: This joseki went allright, white has a few points and black has a lot of thickness.]
;W[pk]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: nice reduction move]
(;B[nj]C[



Thor'Ava'Tahr: i feel this is the wrong direction here, black is trying to build territory with his thickness instead of using it for fighting, i would rather play one of the variations, pushing white towards the black thickness (or building thickness on the other side as well locking white in te middle of two walls)]

(;W[nl]C[


Thor'Ava'Tahr: This is a strange move, leaving a cut, see variations]

(;B[ql]C[




Thor'Ava'Tahr: Right idea, wrong move,];W[qk]C[


Thor'Ava'Tahr: I understand white doesn't want black to connect underneath, because that gives him a lot of points but i think this move makes white's group too fragile, especially since it can be cut...]

(;B[pl]C[



Thor'Ava'Tahr: Black let's white group defend the cut that can't be good!!!]
;W[ok];B[ol]C[


Thor'Ava'Tahr: Black is building too slow here... giving white strength and  losing the initiative...]
;W[nk];B[nm];W[ll];B[mm];W[km];B[mq]
(;W[lh]C[


Thor'Ava'Tahr: suicide.. this is not the time to create another group, rather reinforce the first group and play the shape move (which defends the cut and reduces black's territory)]
;B[lj]C[


Thor'Ava'Tahr: Excellent, black plays the shape move and retakes the initiative!]
;W[jh]
(;B[kh]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: ??? this is hardly ever a good move, and certainly not now.. why make white stronger here?,  force cut!! (see variation]
;W[kg];B[ki];W[jg];B[lg];W[lf];B[mg];W[ke];B[kd];W[mf];B[ng]
;W[hg]C[
Thor'Ava'Tahr: black effectively forced white to build a strong group within his influence. however he can still cut..]

;B[hk];W[lk]C[

Thor'Ava'Tahr: black spoiled all aji above by sacrificing stones and getting nothing in return and neglected to cut, white has gained a lot here..]

(;B[mj]C[


Thor'Ava'Tahr: A pointless move, in general it is bad to have stones on both ends  of the bamboo joint... better to pressurize with with k5]
