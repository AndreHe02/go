AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[AvatharTri: Thank you for reviewing! I greatly look forward to your input!

NM: Hello, I will be reviewing your game.];W[fq];B[dn];W[mp]
C[What is a good response to this?

NM: Q6 is good.];B[pn];W[jp]C[Now, I have the initiative, I think I should use it to secure something in the top

NM: Yes, very possible to take K16 at top
An alternative would be to play D2 or Q2 and take territory at the sides]
;B[jd]C[Was this move, or the place above it better?];W[pq]
;B[qq]C[
NM: Good, standard reply];W[oq]
(;B[qp]C[
NM: This is good, an alternative would be R2];W[qf]C[
NM: R12 would be interesting here to stop white getting a base for this stone]

(;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[fc]C[
NM: White should take R11 or R12 to secure a base (Honte), but it is a handicap game so must play more actively.]

(;B[df]C[
NM: An alternative is to attack at R12.
You seem to be replying to whites moves too much and should consider tenuki to be more active]
;W[db]C[
NM: Consider again H17 as an alternative]
(;B[cc];W[hc]
(;B[jc]C[I've never seen this move done in a case like this, was this appropriate?

NM: It is OK, J18 would score more points]
(;W[qh];B[qj]C[
NM: again, S11 is almost sente as it forces white to defend the base of the white group while taking territory for black]
;W[fn]C[now it's my initiative again, should I work on securing or extending?

NM: Black still has an overall advantage with the promise of more territory. So black can happily secure at D8 here.

However an alternative would be to attack white first !
Perhaps S11, J18 or H3]
(;B[dl];W[rc]C[
NM: S18 is better more here];B[qb];W[cb]
(;B[bc]C[
NM: Likewise B18 scores more points];W[dr];B[cq];W[gf]C[
NM: Ok so this is a rather safe move, still it is good because black still has lot more potential territory than white.]

NM: If we count the score, we can tell whether we can play safe or have to try make a fight to win.

Best method is to count in pairs, so 1,2,3,4,5 pairs here
If we repeat this for all the groups we get
Black 29 x 3 = 87 (I counted in 3's here but 2's are what i use generally)
White 25 x 2 = 50

So black still has a 37 point lead.

Notice the middle is undecided so far.];W[cr];B[bq];W[mm]
(;B[pl]LB[pj:A][qj:B][pn:C]C[
NM: Black doesnt need to defend here.
He is already strong in this area, ABC is a strong shape

An alternative is H4 to disrupt the moyo];W[gl];B[jf]C[
NM: Not sure what the intent of this was.

NM: The bottom white moyo is forming so black should try stoppping it with H4, K7 or K8]
;W[of];B[jh]C[
NM: Again, this move does not make territory not does it reduce whites moyo (slow move)]
;W[jj]C[I now see white developing a large area in the middle, can I break it up?

NM: More difficult now than before but yes it is still possible.]

(;B[mj]C[
NM: not deep enough into whites moyo];W[mf]C[
NM: Strange computer type move, I suppose white is trying to reduce blacks territory at the top, by playing N14 before black plays there.]

NM: Black can play elsewhere instead of L10. 
Not sure what to play here as these shapes dont occur in the games I play. I play at around 1ku/ 1dan level on KGS/UK]

NM: Strange move, playing a contact move at the head of two white stones
Still, there are not many (big) moves left. Probably best to try some forcing moves now and try expand territory at right side as its probably easiest to make some more territory there]
;W[nn];B[on];W[no];B[ml]C[I don't think these diagonal stones are particularly weak, because I don't think they can be split.


NM: Worth playing N8 here, makes some points and stops white taking them away easily, by playing O8]

Thank you

NM: A few points to learn from this game

1. Try to tenuki more in the openign rather than follow your opponents moves. Sieze the initiative and Attack first !
2. Take as much territory as possible at the sides by attacking the base of your oponents stones first.
3. Watch out for moyo's forming and reduce (as deeply as necessary possible) or invade before they become territory.

Lastly try not to play computers too often as they become predicatble and ultimately harm your own Go from developing

Hope I didnt sound like I lecture you too much !

Many happy games!])
