C[Well, I played this game with the intention of improve my death & live skills...
But it didn't turn very well...
Even my fuseki and strategie weren't that good... -_-
So, please could you help me to improve my game?
Thank very much ^_^
(sorry for my bad english...)

Rev: I'll do my best.

Frank:
I think you (Rev) did a good job, so I don't see why I should correct
your work. I made some remarks here and there, but not very much. I
think that when you review a game of relative beginners, you should try
to point  out some general remarks. You are not expected to explain in
detail every fight. That would be too much work and maybe not so
effective. I try to give a beginner, when I review his/her game,  one
or two "ideas" of how he/she could improve. An then next game maybe
another  remark.];B[pp];W[dd];B[dq];W[qd];B[co];W[kc];B[jp]
;W[qj];B[od];W[oc]LB[qf:A]C[REV:
You did not play a standard opening in that corner, so I can't say what
the best move is here, but maybe you should also consider less
agressive moves in this situation, such as "A".];B[pd];W[pc]
;B[qe];W[rd];B[re];W[pe]LB[nc:A]C[REV:
This cut is a very agressive move, and if you do it well, could work
out OK.  Maybe "A" would be safer.];B[pf];W[oe];B[nd];W[nf]
C[REV: This is good shape.  Black wants to play here.];B[nc]
;W[nb];B[me]TR[nf][oe][pe]LB[qf:A]C[REV:
Here you should be nervous about the three white stones (triangles). 
Maybe a cut at "A" would work?];W[mc];B[md];W[lc]C[REV: As you said, you missed the shicho.]
;B[of];W[ne];B[ng]C[I didn't saw coming the shicho...];W[qn]
TR[mc][nb][oc][pc][qd]C[REV:
Good move, but be careful of attacks around the triangles.  All those
diagonal connections are dangerous.];B[qo];W[cl]C[This is to threathen the low and then...]
;B[ci];W[em]C[cut the shicho...

REV:
Very clever.  Just be careful here, that the stones you are placing
don't give black more territory than you are gaining by winning the
shicho fight.];B[cf]TR[ci][cf]C[REV: Now black has a powerful group (triangles).]
;W[mf];B[le];W[qf]C[Then, i cut black stones in many places
REV: Good plan.];B[qg];W[rf];B[lg];W[og];B[pg];W[oh];B[rg];W[se]
;B[mg];W[ol]TR[of][pf][pg][qg][rg]C[I tried to expend my right side...
I though the stones on R13 where dead

REV: They look dead to me.];B[ph];W[oi];B[pi];W[pj];B[ql];W[pl]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[rl];W[on]C[I didn't think very well there...
I forgot that he could connect on Q6

REV: Correct.];B[pn];W[om];B[po];W[rk];B[qk];W[rj]TR[qm][qn]
C[I wanted to keep the stones on R13 alone so, I give up the two stones on R7]
;B[rn];W[mo]LB[oj:A]C[With this move, I wanted to reduce black territory

REV: Good idea.  Just be careful of the cut at "A".  Not yet deadly, but getting serious.]
;B[nq];W[lq]LB[lp:A]C[REV:  Too ambitious.  Maybe "A"?

Frank: This move is also possible];B[lp]C[and i misread the keima...

REV:  Indeed.];W[mp];B[mq]
(;W[lo]C[Frank: Up till now it's ok, but now you should play L4. See variation]
;B[kp];W[jn]LB[ce:A][hc:B][hp:C]C[REV:
This is OK, but maybe a move somewhere near "A" would be good? 
Somewhere near "B" also maybe.  "C" also looks OK to me.

Frank: The move from the game is rather vague.  A or B are definitely better.]
;B[hp];W[io];B[ho];W[ip];B[iq];W[hn];B[gn];W[hm];B[fn];W[fm]
;B[en];W[hq]C[There, we entered a long death & live... I wanted to keep  black stones separated...]
;B[ir];W[dn];B[eo];W[do];B[dp];W[hr]TR[jp][kp][lp]C[I take some more liberties... aiming for the stones on L4]
;B[fp];W[lr];B[jq]C[This move caused me a lot of trouble...]
;W[fq]C[I try to gain some more liberties on the left side...]
;B[bo];W[eq];B[dm]C[I didn't saw this coming...];W[dl];B[cm]

(;W[kr]C[I think this move is wrong, I should have played at D2...
am I right?
(cf variation)
REV: I had a look, but I don't see white surviving anyway.]
;B[er];W[fr];B[ds]C[There I lost a lot of liberties...];W[ko]
C[so I tried to reduce the liberties of black];B[fs];W[gs];B[ep]
;W[es]C[and there come a long ko...

Rev: What does black do if he wins the ko?
I don't think it helps at all.
See variation later.];B[oj];W[nj]
(;B[ok];W[pk]C[There I entered a Shicho, not thinking that a shicho was such a ko threat -_-]

Frank: White can continue playin ko by cutting at K2];W[je]

;B[ji]C[REV:  OK, I give up.  This fight is too complicated for me.  I will send this game to a better reviewer.

I don't believe for an instant that you guys are 20k and 26k.  I'm 7k* igs, and I'm struggling to follow your game.

Frank:
The white idea to attack the black stones around M14 is very good. But
you can't expect "beginners" to play the best possible sequence. It's
not necessary to explain this in detail, I think. You as  reviewer
should point out which are the good or bad ideas/moves from the players
in general.];W[ih];B[kj]C[and there, I totaly misread -_-];W[li]
;B[lj];W[lh];B[kg];W[jj];B[hj];W[ij];B[hi];W[fi];B[hl];W[gk]
;B[jl]C[So I did lose the death & live, one more time...];W[mj]
;B[mi];W[kk];B[mh];W[li]C[Frank:
Here you could point out that if white connects at k9, black still
isn't alive. And you should tell him that's because white is so strong
in the neighbourhood];B[jk];W[qq]C[I wanted to gain the corner...]
