C[This is a game between me (white) and morli[9k\] (black) with no handicap.

I finally lost because I didn't keep an eye on the clock and ran out of time. However, I am hoping to learn from this game and any comments about my play would be appreciated.

Note from the reviewer:
As usual, I have tried to make my best during this review. Hope it will be useful for the players and may be to some other readers.

However, please don't take my comment for the only truth as it should be full of mistakes for the truth of a dan player, and worst for the truth of a pro player.

Denis, 5k];B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[cp]C[Denis: Not usual.]
;W[gp]LB[fp:A]C[Denis: Difficult to judge. It's light, but as C4 is very close, the large knight jump might be too large. May be better at A]
;B[cq];W[nc]LB[cr:A][jp:B]C[Is it all right to ignore the black move at this time?

Denis: I don't have a problem with that. You can take sente on another side of the board, but you have to keep in mind to add something in this (lower left) corner later., because your large knight extension is now open to attack. May be A or an extension at B.

You have also the risk (as it happened in the game) that black ignore your move and continue to play on the lower left.]
;B[dr]LB[dp:A][jp:B]C[Denis: too low. I think black should have attack on the upper side (A) to build thickness, or from the right at B.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[fq]C[Denis: black should be happy. he has a corner and on the counter part, white thickness is not as good.]
;B[dc]MA[cp]C[Denis: same approach as the marked stone. Still unusual]
;W[dd];B[ec];W[cj]C[Denis: I like this extension. Thought may be to far.]
;B[cg]C[Denis: seems that black also thought it was too far :-)]
;W[ee];B[eg];W[gd]LB[cc:A][ge:B][ej:C]C[Should I play this point or kosumi at F14 instead?

Denis: This move leaves weak points in your position.  I would have play B instead. A and C are also possible.]
;B[cc];W[nq]C[Again I ignore my opponent's move. Is it alright?

Denis: No. Not here. You have to continue to attack the 2 weak black stones. otherwise, you will end up in problem.]
;B[bd]LB[ej:A]C[Denis: Hmmm!? Black should have played lightly at A to do something with his original attack. I think this is not the correct direction of play.]
;W[be];B[bc];W[df];B[ed]C[Denis: Heavy];W[dg]LB[cf:A]C[Denis: leaves too many weak points behind. It's more important to avoid the connection with the group above. What about A?]
;B[ce];W[de];B[cf];W[ch];B[bf];W[fe]C[Is this the correct direction of play?

Denis: It's necessary.];B[bh];W[ci];B[fh];W[gi]C[Denis: May be too close.]
;B[fi];W[fj];B[gh];W[hh];B[hi];W[gj];B[hg];W[ih];B[gf];W[jc]
C[Denis: good for white.];B[ig];W[jh];B[jg];W[kh];B[kg];W[ik]
;B[dn];W[cm]MA[nc][nq]LB[pf:A][pn:B][qc:C][qq:D][pj:E]C[Denis: too slow. There are bigger points. You played 2 stones (X) at which black didn't answer. It's time to press black on either corner. Many things are possible, like pincers A or B, Corner invasion C or D, or may be play lightly at E.]
;B[cn]C[Denis: Black should not answer, he should play on the right side instead.]
;W[pn]C[Denis: Good.];B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[nn];B[mo];W[mn];B[lo]
;W[kq]C[Denis: This was good for white.];B[kp];W[lq];B[jp];W[jq]
LB[pr:A]C[Denis: I prefer at A. This build some base and take an option on the corner.]
;B[oq]C[Denis: Good for black];W[lg]C[Denis: what about playing in the upper right corner now? You'll have either a corner or a big moyo on the right side.]
;B[ke];W[ld]C[Denis: dubious.];B[lf];W[mg];B[mf];W[ng];B[nf]
;W[og];B[oe]C[Denis: very good for white. Black connect with the stone in the corner (where he'll have space to live), but the white moyo is impressive. White should now attack the upper right corner. If black manage to take the 4 corners, it will be very difficult to win for white.]
;W[qj]LB[qc:A]C[Denis: wrong. You are playing right inside your moyo. you should be a little be more aggressive here. For example, attack at san-san (A).]
;B[ok]C[Denis: white should not be affraid about this invasion. It's too deep. white should be able to deal with it.]
;W[ql];B[km];W[ln];B[kn];W[pb]C[Denis: this is also possible (instead of invasion at san-san).]
;B[ml];W[ll]C[Denis: good.];B[lm];W[mm];B[nl];W[lk];B[pi];W[qh]
;B[qi];W[ph];B[ri];W[qo]C[Denis: good timing.];B[qp];W[pj]LB[rh:A]
[oi:B]C[Denis: bad move. You should not care about black connecting, you should first play A to prevent black from connecting with the upper group, then B to take eye space.]
;B[oi];W[oj]LB[rh:A]C[Denis: Bad. 'A' is still better];B[rg]
C[Denis: Good for black. He'll try to connect or live on the side.]
;W[rh];B[sh];W[nj]C[Is my play like this a correct move?

Denis: Yes at this moment. But see my comments on previous moves.]
;B[qg];W[qc]C[Denis: good.];B[qd];W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[im];W[hl]
;B[hm]C[I ran out of time at this point. Any comments about the game will be appreciated. Thanks

Vanyel.

Denis: It's unfortunate that this game ended this way. You have the lead (about 5 to 10 points) and should have been able to maintain this lead during the yose.]
