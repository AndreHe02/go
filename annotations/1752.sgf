AB[pd][dp]C[Questions For Reviewer,

other then the last Ko fight I really don't know what I did wrong.  So could you please highlight some of the better moves then the onces i played? Maybe some bigger moves then the one I played.  Thanks ^_^



<W>
I'll do my best!

I'm 7k on KGS, playing as 'woldsom'. If you ever want an on the spot review, or a teaching game, just ask, and if I'm not playing I'll do it.

I hope you're not offended if my comments strike you as harsh, I try to be to the point rather than overly polite. All of the go terms I use can be found in senseis library at

http://senseis.xmp.net/?goterm 

for instance

(;B[qf]C[When should I play at Q14 and when should I play at R14 ?.? Any ideas to fellow?

<W> The conventional wisdom goes that r14 is better for fighting for the corner, and q14 is better for outside influence.

<W> Personally I would never play q14; I feel that if you want outside influence, o16 is better, see the standard variation supplied. But joseki and fuseki are my weak points.]
;W[pj]C[<W> This move is a bit strange; conventionally, white would want to make another sente aproach to a corner, or settle his top right stone. White now has two weak stones, which you might exploit later. As for now, taking initiative is preferable.]
;B[pl]C[<W> also highly non-standard, but if fits whites move well. It's high, so white will have trouble attacking that stone, and the three space distance to the corner stone takes advantage of that.

<W> In other circumstances, there is a saying that three space jump is for sacrifice.]
;W[fq]C[<W> This is good for white; if black plays c6 white can play j4 and have a good chance at limiting black on the bottom right. Thus you should play h3; don't let white have it easy. He already has two weak stones, and you can now make it three.]
;B[dn]C[<W> Outside influence might be good here, but I would advice against it; better to play h3 first and see what white does. If white plays the standard move of f5, then d6 is a much better move.]
;W[jp]C[<W> This is a good move, compared to the common j4; if you make a sucessfull attack on f3, white can settle k4 along the bottom and then use f3 to take the corner as well.]
;B[lp]C[Was this move valid? or too close?

<W> It's not as much too close, as too high. Your r4 stone is also on the fourth line along the bottom, inviting an invasion. Better m3, you then have a good follow-up in p3, making a solid double wing formation.]
;W[np];B[ln]C[<W> Do you have to save that one stone?];W[lq]

(;B[mq]C[<W> This is ok, tho starting from the other end is more useful. The proverb says "cut the side you don't want". Here you want the big corner area more than a small chunk of the bottom.]
;W[mp];B[kq];W[lr];B[kp];W[mr]C[<W> your right corner, and q8 is very weakened, but as compensation, so is whites f3 and k4. You now have white with three weak groups.]
;B[oq]C[This isn't that useful a move. p5 right away secures more for your weak stones.]
;W[op];B[pp];W[nq];B[on]C[<W> White can play p5 or o6 in sente here, and still have the option of capturing p3.]
;W[or]C[<W> This is weak, q3 would grab more.];B[oo]C[<W> You should take advantage of white's weakness and play q3; the corner is always big.]
;W[pq];B[cj]C[<W> An aproach move from above, like f17, would be better here. You have nice influence at the bottom, and can limit white on the top]
;W[ch]C[<W> White plays three space jump again, and again justified.]
;B[cf]C[<W> Your c10 stone is too weak to double pincer like this, not to mention that white can press you low along the left edge, getting much influence towards the top edge to exploit o17. A good advice is to limit the number of groups you have. Extend before you invade.]
;W[eh]C[<W> A severe splitting attack, c14 is very weak now, almost only useful for sacrifice, and white weakens c10 even more.]
;B[ef]C[Before playing this should i have played B16 ?.?  But I though it might close me off o.o so dats y i tried to run out first.  What you thin?

<W> You're quite correct; if you want to save c14, this is the only move. I don't think saving it is such a good idea tho (and in the end you don't save it after all), why not f17 or c17?]
;W[cd]C[<W> This is nice of white, letting you run away. Playing g14 now is big, as it weakens e12.]
;B[fd]C[<W> The corner is too solid to attack, and this shape is full of weakness (white e15 then f14 cuts effectively)]
;W[df]
(;B[de]C[<W> Wrong direction; you want to weaken the bottommost stones not the corner; the corner has too many options for easy life.]
;W[dg];B[ed]C[<W> This move lack purpose; if you want to save the cut of the corner, e15 is more effective, and if you want top territory, e16, or even j17, is good moves. The single stone of d15 is not worth anything after this move anyway.]
;W[ce];B[ic]C[<W> Good move, white is under attack now, a perfect opportunity to grab territory.]
;W[kc];B[ph]C[<W> This is entirely in the wrong direction, putting little to no preasure on the top group, and lets the white stones at q10 have too many options on the right edge. Later when q10 is safely connected, a move like r10 can grab very much of your influence there. If you want to attack it, r12 is the move, but better yett is to press the o17 group upwards, and in the process shut q10 in, along with the entire right edge.

<W> Other options is to play k15 or l16, for territory towards the center.]
;W[nj]C[<W> Now white have both the options of n6, to weaken (and almost elliminate) your central influence from the bottom) and a move around p12-o13, connecting and thus strenghtening two weak groups.]
;B[pc]C[<W> This is too lenient. You're very heavy in this area already, you can play a bit thinner, like p17 or even p18.

<W> Even more inportant is to split the two weak white groups, with a move like o12 or o16.]
;W[jd];B[id];W[ne]C[White has settled his top group, your hope now is to attack o10, with a splitting move like o12, to press him to the left, and in the process closing off the bottom.]
;B[ej]C[<W> This is also needed, but not as urgent as weakening o10.]
;W[fo]C[<W> Perfect opportunity to play inside his area of influence. Consider a move around g4-h4. You're strong on both sides outside of white. Or if you don't feel like fighting, you can answer white's press for space with f7, grabbing territory yourself.]
;B[dq]C[<W> Again too heavy. e3 is sufficient for securing the corner, and presses white in the process.]
;W[fm]C[<W> Now white is turning to the attack himself. At this point, I'd start to worry about the l4 group, if white cut it off from the right, it's bound to head into white walls wherever it turns.]
;B[jo]C[<W> Good!];W[ip]C[<W> Perfect result for you. l4 is much strenghtened, and white still hasn't settled his group.]
;B[io]C[This only helps white now.];W[ho];B[if]C[<W> Off focus, you need to concentrate on the h5 area before white secures it. Witht he weakness around e15, j14 is too heavy and small.]
;W[jf]C[<W> And white has the perfect answer; nullifies your move, and strenghtens and expands white's group and territory.]
;B[jg]C[A bit of an overplay, the cut of j13 looks like it could work.]

(;W[kf];B[ig]C[too passive ?

<W> Not after k13. But the h5 stones are neglected.];W[kg]C[<W> White is making a mistake here, this is much too slow, and ignores the vital area of the game, the bottom.]
;B[ji]C[<W> This is certainly much too passive. There is no reason to struggle with white over center influence now, there is little possibility of territory there, or any desiding result on the life and death of groups.]
;W[li]C[<W> Don't think white needs this.];B[gg]C[<W> Much much too small. Territory here is still close to zero due to e15, and it's simply too many stones invested in one area even if it was worth anything. Now that q10 is connected you should also give serious thought to damage control on the right edge.]
;W[gh];B[hh];W[gi];B[hi];W[gj]C[<W> You're pushing white where he wants to go; he's now connected down.]
;B[hm]C[This or D8?

<W> d8 for sure, if those two are your choices. There is no territory in the center. But a better move on the right would be e7 or e8. You still have the threat of cutting white off from the bottom.]
;W[dl]C[<W> This is huge.];B[cl];W[cm];B[dm];W[ck];B[bl];W[dk]
;B[bk];W[dj]C[<W> There's aji here, the white group can be short on liberties fast. A move like e8 might be useful.]
;B[ci]C[<W> too small.];W[di]C[<W> Now there is no more aji in white's position.]
;B[gk]C[<W> Good move, threatens both to cut off bottoma nd to salvage e10, deep in what's now white's territory.]
;W[hk]C[<W> Mistake.];B[gl];W[fk];B[fl]C[And white is safely cut.]
;W[ek];B[hj]C[<W> Nice move, now there is a slight potential for territory in the center after all, if you can somehow find a way to press the white m11 group upwards and outwards.]
;W[jk]C[<W> Too deep.]
(;B[ik]C[<W> Too small, one stone is nothing. Cut the diagonal with l10!]
;W[kk];B[ml];W[qn];B[rl]C[<W> Better to play thick here, r8.]

;W[mk];B[ok]C[<W> Save as ko threat.];W[nk];B[qo]C[<W> Unnecesarry.]
;W[dr]C[<W> Once the bottom is alive, you're in the endgame. This way white gets to start out with a sente endgame move.]
;B[cr];W[er];B[bq]C[<W> k3 for white now is huge, as is j2 for you.]
;W[il]C[<W> One point threat? (Alright, more like 3, in gote)]
;B[hl];W[ec]C[<W> Big sente move and sequence.];B[fc];W[eb]
;B[fb];W[fa];B[ga];W[ea];B[gb];W[pb]C[<W> White gets to plau sente again]
;B[qb];W[ob];B[rc];W[ee];B[fe];W[de];B[ff];W[fg];B[bh]C[<W> This is a fairly big engame move, but still nowhere near j2]
;W[bg];B[bi];W[ah];B[ai];W[ag]C[<W> You even end up sente...]
;B[bm]C[<W> ...not! this is the correct way to save your group, and necesarry.]
;W[jq]C[<W> Very big, white gets a solid lead.];B[em]C[<W> One point threat, in gote.]
;W[fn];B[ng]C[<W> Good! Alternatives are k18 and t3, and for the gote play, k8.]
;W[mf];B[mg]C[<W> Very good, white is close to being cut now!]
;W[of]C[<W> Perfect opportunity to play l12 and cut.]

;W[rh];B[qj];W[bj];B[aj];W[qi];B[cg]C[<W> Bad ko threat, removes any further potential in the area. b14 has more potential.]
;W[bf];B[qj];W[ak];B[al];W[qi];B[dc]C[<W> Good ko threat, with a long sequence.]
;W[db];B[qj];W[kh]C[<W> White backs down while you have still ko threat supperiority! Play p10!]

;W[ik];B[km]C[<W> The bottom is more important than this move, endgame is still on. Sente first!]
;W[ii];B[jh];W[ih];B[hg];W[kr]C[<W> White makes a huge gote move.]

A fun game to watch, with many places to comment.

A few specifics of the game that made white dominate (if not for the error of p10):
You didn't attack whites weak groups, instead growing passively. The best way to win in the middlegame is to press one of your opponents weaks groups in such a way that you either build up a moyo, invades and destroys your opponents moyo, or makes an attack such that the opponent has to choose a group to die.

You let white play too many sente moves. When you have a move, and don't have to respond to the opponent, make sure you play a move that he has to respond to, with a sequence that ends with the opponent having to make the last move.

You didn't see the opportunities for you both to descend towards the edge with potential on both sides.

And the generally small moves, capturing or saving single stones, or saving a cramped four or five-point territory.


Good luck with your go playing  in the future, hope I could be of any help. Thanks for using the GTL!]
