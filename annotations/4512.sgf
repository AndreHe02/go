;B[pd];W[dp]C[caol [9k\]: hi];B[pq]C[cartoon [8k\]: hi good game
caol [9k\]: u2];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[pn]C[I considered this as too relaxed an attack, but was not sure, what the best replay is.

anicka: It is OK, just one of possible strategies.];B[np]C[Maybe to defensive?

anicka: Not at all, nice move. (And it is joseki, anyway...)]
;W[qp]C[anicka: ...but White failed to play a good follow-up. This is a very bad move because it makes Black stronger and does not help White at all. If White wants to play in the corner, he should play sansan (R3) instead.]
;B[qq]C[anicka: Correct.];W[qf];B[qi]C[I do not want W to get the whole right side easily

anicka: Correct. There is a weakness in white position at R8. The last black move aims to extend at R8. White stone at R14 is also very weak - the last black move attacks at two positions at once.

White move at R14 was definitely too confident...];W[nc];B[nd]
C[Thiking: attack the stronger stone first (leaning attack). My target is the pincered W stone.

anicka: It looks like good idea. Just the continuation was not good at all...]
;W[qc]C[anicka: Mistake];B[qd]C[anicka: ...looks like the right direction consistent with Black's previous idea. But as last White sansan is a mistake, White should definitely play hane at N16 instead.

We should find a way how to punish last white move...
I think it would be better to play P17, it is very big. If White gets strong in the corner, Black can still extend at R17 and have a nice position.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[rf]C[I am not sure whether this was too risky, or if I had to play on top of the lone W stone...

anicka: Maybe just connect at R15? S14 is usually played when Black aims to connect underneath but stone at R11 is too far. I do not understand the aim of S14 much.]
;W[qk];B[oi]C[anicka:  This move protects a cut which could be already protected. (See the previous comment.) It also makes Black overconcentrated. It enables White to protect his thin position in sente. It cannot be a good move...

Although S11 stone got weak, Black should play O18, it is huge.]
;W[rj];B[ri]C[anicka: Better play just elsewhere, this move is very small at this early stage of the game.]
;W[ok];B[nb]C[anicka:  Big.];W[pb];B[mc];W[dj];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]
;W[cc];B[dr]C[anicka: Nice and big move. But maybe better to continue at F15 because it is a border of two big territorial frameworks.]
;W[jd]C[Should I have played here before?

anicka: See the previous comment. Not here (Black would be really overconcentrated) but around F15.
Even White should play F15 now and reduce Black while extending White. This is too deep, the K17 stone can be attacked.]
;B[hd]C[anicka: It is difficult to find the right attacking move, I am not sure about the right direction at all. I am considering this move  and cap at K14.]
;W[jf];B[ke]C[anicka: This is not the right direction of the peep, I think. Black is strengthtening White. And he does it from the wrong direction as he is making his stronger side even stronger. 

You are afraid of white extension at M15? White probably can live here but he will not destroy much of black territory. Black might play around H14, build strength outside and destroy even more of white territory on the left...]
;W[je];B[hf]C[anicka: Nice move.];W[kf]C[anicka: Very slow and heavy...]
;B[nn]C[anicka: Why tenuki here? White heavy stones could be effectively attacked (maybe just nobi at M15 is good enough).]
;W[qe];B[qg];W[nf];B[of];W[le];B[ld]C[anicka: I do not understand the sense of this move at all. White looks alive, maybe it's better to play forcing moves somewhere you can make territory or some useful strength. (Something like J17?)]
;W[kd];B[ng];W[mf];B[cq]C[I thought this was big. Are my groupds safe so far? Or could I have attacked a W group instead?

anicka: Unfortunately, the White group is perfectly alive. You missed a chance to attack with O6 move. Your groups look quite safe although the upper left one has a small defect around J17. Time to make some territory, this is a good start.]
;W[cp];B[rp]C[anicka: Big.];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[rm]C[I would like to see, if W could have coped with it better. I just wanted to create some trouble for W.]
;W[sn];B[qm];W[qn];B[rl]C[Here I tried to make ugly shape, so that W cannot make 2 eyes. I expected W to play above my stone now.

anicka: Nice idea. I am just not sure whether it makes sense to attack a group which can easily flee to the center, it would be better to play some preparational moves before an attack... I would like to play M9 before S7 because it plays both sides.]
;W[pm]C[looks like terrible mistake form W for me. Couldn't he have done better easily?

anicka: I think is OK.];B[rk];W[qj];B[sj]C[I did not expect this success. Was I reckless?

anicka: But it is not that great at all. You gained something like ten points in gote and White can flee to the center and destroy anything you could build here...]
;W[sk];B[sl];W[ql];B[si];W[pj]C[anicka: WHite should escape with N9 or something like that (even O7?). This move is gote and does not help White at all.]
;B[pi]C[necessary?

anicka: Not at all, there is no cut. Better to try to enclose white. (Maybe N8?)]
;W[mg];B[nh];W[nm];B[nk]C[is this safe or overplay? I want to make it narrow for the W group to escape into the center.

anicka: Overplay. White hane at N6 makes White very strong and destroy your center potential. Suddenly there is a point of attack at M4.]
;W[nl]C[anicka: mistake, White should hane.];B[mk]C[anicka: Once again, N6 is more important.]
;W[on]C[anicka: Really cowardly move. White should get out with hane from outside. He is not in real danger to play two point moves.]

(;B[oj]
(;W[pl]C[ok, sente for me too

anicka: Maybe, maybe not. See variation...];B[no]C[is this good? it was just a feeling.

anicka: Idea is OK, Black must defend. But N6 is better because it completely encloses White and does not enable him to break out with M7.]
;W[lm];B[lo]C[Now I feel that I have good advantage and play defensively. Buildiung and securing big territory. Is this the reight strategy?

anicka: You have a big territory but White side is also big and still can be extended, your territory cannot be extended that much. So you should reduce it. (Move like F5 would nicely extend black position and reduce white at once.

Anyway, M5 is a coward, there is no real hole. (If White would like to get into your territory, he would try to exploit a little bigger hole on the other side which can be nicely secured with F5.)]
;W[hp]
(;B[go]C[please comment on this one. I have no better idea.

anicka: Cannot help much, it is too late. Black should play around here instead of M5 (see the preceding comment). White has allies at two sides and you cannot block him on both, you cannot catch H4 stone.You should probably connect underneath at H3 (see variation) - shame but you are safe at least. G5 now is a bad move because of the cut. (The cut is really big because Black loses lots of his territory while White profits.)

Now please see how big is the difference between O5 and N6 - if White would be enclosed at the right side, F5 or something like that could work better and maybe there would be some way to catch H4 stone.]
;W[fp];B[eq];W[gp]C[anicka: ...and black territory becomes wasted.]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[fo];W[ho]C[I was afraid of this W replay. Now I have an isolated group with few liberties. I asked myself, if I should figth for it, knowing W will gain from this.

anicka: Yes, White will attack and build a huge territory while attacking. But I have no better idea what to do now.]
;B[en];W[do];B[gm];W[hm]C[I];B[gl]
(;W[jm]C[I do not think, that this is a good move. I made a variation on how I would have played as W.

anicka: Right, it is a strange move. Your variation looks well.]

(;B[ek]C[anicka: Hard to say what to play here. I would consider also tsuke at D9 to force White to defend his territory even more but I am not sure whether it works.]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm];W[cm]C[Things are going to easy. I feel a better player could have crushed me. However: I don't know how...

anicka: Yes, this is too submissive. What about E10 or F11?]
;B[ej];W[jq];B[kq];W[ic];B[hc];W[lc];B[lb];W[md];B[kb]C[anicka: Small. White is alive so this is just an endgame. (What about something like D11 or K2?)]
;W[jj]C[My reasoning now was: the center will be almost no territory. W groups top/middle and right side are both alive, so I do not care if he links them up.
My groups top/left and Center/left are not yet alive. However I feel, that W wants to link up, so I dare some pseudo-attacks.

anicka: It looks that White aims for neutral points...];B[ll]
C[anicka: Playing around F11 is much bigger...]
(;W[mm]C[I think this replay was non-sense. Instead he should have started to make sure his group on the center/left is alive or connected to the top group. (see variation)

anicka: Agreed.];B[kl];W[km];B[hl];W[gn]C[anicka: I would prefer to connect at J7, it is at least some kind of a peep. G6 is just a gote.]
;B[fn];W[hn]
(;B[em]C[wanna make life

anicka: But is not here still only one eye like before? I think this move is nearly a pass. (See variation...)]
;W[ei];B[il];W[iq];B[hr];W[kr];B[lq];W[lr];B[mq];W[mr];B[ir]
;W[jr];B[nr];W[fi]C[anicka: Big. Black should probably play here instead of his last move. (Or even better, instead of J8.)]
;B[hi]C[anicka: Looks thin. I would prefer H10.];W[fj];B[fk]
;W[hj]
(;B[fl]C[I felt nor well making such a cowardly move. Probably not necessary as I can still conncet to the right size.

anicka: Yes. But anyway, you should not allow to be enclosed.]
;W[im]C[but this looks like unlucky move, too. Bamboo would be more efficient.

anicka: K5 even more.];B[gi];W[ef]C[I thought of playing there myselfl, which move is bigger?

anicka: This is very big, much bigger than last Black move.]
;B[ff];W[ee];B[fe];W[ne];B[ib];W[jb];B[ja];W[jc];B[hb]C[Again: maybe a wasted move. There is no need to cover the cut here, or am I wrong?
