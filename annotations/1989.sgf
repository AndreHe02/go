RE[W+R]

AB[dd][dj][dp][jd][jj][jp][pd][pj][pp]C[z: Review requested by black (played by "zenjutsu", 7k* on IGS). Comments preceeded by "z:".

z: I played this 9-stone handi game against a 4d*.  I generally do not play handicap games, and have no real idea of strategy. I was just playing in the hope of getting a good beating, and learning from it.  Step 1 (being beaten handily) has been achieved, as I resigned.  I hope the reviewer will help me with step 2.

z: Thank you in advance for your time and your commentary!

o: So i will try to help you. Its difficult to comment such a game as one of the players is far better than me too and i can't imagin what are the meanings of some moves. But i hope to be at least a little bit helpful.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[dg];B[fd];W[hp];B[dn]C[z: Want to keep white seperated.

o: which is a good goal. :-)
Attaching always strengthens the attached stone, so perhaps a move at F6 would seperate all white stones too without helping white to gain strength.]
;W[dm];B[em]C[z: Too much?];W[en];B[do];W[dl];B[el];W[ek];B[dk]
C[z: I think this was an overplay.  But I wanted to make things tough, and see what a far superior player does when in-fighting.]

C[Game over.
wph vs zenjutsu : Black resigns.

z: I'd never played against a dan-level player before.  W's fighting ability clearly outclassed me, and it was a fantastic experience to be so thoroughly outplayed in the fights.  I appreciate the reviewer's willingness to invest time in furthering my understanding of this game, and my own weaknesses and strengths.

o: in my eyes the point is, that you much helped the white in first strengthen them before getting crushed by them. True, white fights better, but i will not say that you should avoid fighting because of that simple fact. But don't strengthen the white stones before the fight. This will help you in the next fight perhaps. :-)]

(;B[bf]TR[el][em][gl][gm]C[z: How should W then respond?

o: there are 3 separated weak groups. The keystones are the marked black cutting stones, so perhaps white will go after them?]
