`` Hello, my name is Kim.  I'll be reviewing this game for black (tchavez).  I begin all of my comments with `` to make the easy to identify.]
;W[nq];B[jq];W[no];B[qm];W[jd];B[me];W[gd];B[fc];W[gc];B[fd]
;W[ge];B[gf]C[I think I understand what he is doing here, basically "cutting" me in the upper left and lower right corners. Right?

`` I wouldn't call what white is doing "cutting."  Cutting usually means that you have two stones or groups of stones that are close together and your opponent finds a way to keep them apart.

In this case, white is simply finding space between your stones to make living groups for himself.

When you start out with a big handicap, it's tempting to think of the whole board as yours.  But, actually, white can make a living group almost anywhere.  The key stopping him from making living groups everywhere. ;-)

It seems that you're trying to kill the white group with this move.  Unfortunately, the white group is just too strong to kill, and it can easily split this stone from your corner group, as we'll see in the next couple of moves.]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[fe]C[`` As you can see, white has no trouble pushing through here.]
;B[ee];W[ff];B[hg];W[if];B[ig];W[jf];B[kf];W[ke];B[kg];W[mc]
TR[gd][ge][hf][if]C[This was a prelude to a net?

`` I'm not sure what you're referring to here.  The only shape I see that looks like it could make a net are the marked stones.  If black tried to cut them, white could use a net to capture.  (See variation.)  But, I'm not sure if that's what you're asking about or not.

Basically, white is just making a big group on the top of the board.]

(;B[ld];W[lc];B[kd];W[kc];B[le];W[je]
(;B[lf]LB[lf:A][jg:B]C[` If you're really feeling insecure here, B is a better way to contain white than A.  (See variation.)]
;W[oc];B[od];W[pc];B[nc];W[nb];B[nd];W[qd];B[qe];W[qc];B[re]
;W[rd]
(;B[sd]TR[eg]C[I've lost the upper right corner as well as the middle of the top of the board.

`` Don't worry about these losses too much.  As I pointed out before, white is bound to make living groups somewhere.

At this point in the game, I'd still be pretty happy with black's position.  Right now, white has about 30 points of territory on top.  That's a lot, but it's certainly not enough to win the game.

You don't need to keep pushing to make white smaller in the corner.  This is a good time to move on and find big moves on other parts of the board.  This could be a good time to deal with the hole around E13.  (See variations.)]
;W[sc];B[se];W[df];B[ef];W[eg];B[de];W[dh]C[This was bad. Lost the initiative there as well.

`` This actually isn't too bad yet. It's a shame that white found a hole between your two groups.  But, he is giving you a chance to cut him off now, and you take it, so that's good.]
;B[fg]TR[df][eg][dh]C[`` After you play at F13, white's three stones are cut off from his other group.  Now that they are cut off, it will be harder to keep them alive.  If you take advantage of the situation, you can still be in good shape.]
;W[fh];B[gh]C[` This move gives white an excuse to build his group and make it stronger.  Moves like this are called thank you moves because your opponent will want to thank you for playing them.  Try to avoid playing moves that give your opponents excuses to do things they wanted to do anyway.]
;W[fi];B[jg];W[fk]
(;B[ej]C[`` This is another thank you move because it encourages white to make a solid connection and become stronger.  Consider just jumping out.  (See variation.)]
;W[fj]
(;B[ek]TR[dj][ej]C[` I don't know if you've learned about this shape or not, but it's called an empty triangle.  It's a very tempting shape to make sometimes, but it is almost never a good idea.  The reason is that it is very inefficient, and there is usually a better shape out there somewhere.  In this case, you can afford to jump a little farther out.  (See variation.)]
;W[fl];B[el];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[em];W[eo]
(;B[dn]C[` Playing a stone here encourages white to try to push through.  Consider D5 instead.  (See variation.)]
;W[do];B[co];W[er]C[`` This is an awkward situation for black because blocking directly seems dangerous.  But, it really isn't so bad.  (See variation.)]

(;B[cq];W[dr];B[dq];W[iq];B[cm]TR[iq]C[`` When your opponent launches an attack on another part of the board, you should not stay behind to patch up unless you can clearly see a) that you do not need to respond to his new move and b) that you need to make the fixing move.  In other words, you should have just responded to J3 rather than playing somewhere else.]
;W[jp]C[`` Now it's a bit too late to do much for K3.];B[kq]
;W[kp];B[ip]C[Lost the middle of the lower half of the board.

`` Again, don't worry too much about the loss.  Since you played somewhere else, it is reasonable to lose the lone stone you had on the bottom.  Using those lost stones to help you play this move and make trouble for white is a good strategy, so there is still plenty of chance to win the game.]
;W[hq];B[io];W[jn];B[in];W[kn];B[im];W[gn];B[fm];W[gm];B[gl]
;W[gk];B[hl];W[hk]
(;B[hm]LB[ik:B][hm:A]C[`` You do not need to play H7 to keep your stones connected, so it is better to just reach out with them.  Think about connecting to the top or two the right with B.  As long as you have two other directions to run, you don not need to worry about capturing to connect to the left.]
;W[jk];B[go]
(;W[fo]C[I was trying to connect to the top, but lost that with W95.

`` The important thing is that you were able to connect to something.  It's good that you found a way to do so.  (See variation on move 94 for a suggestion on connecting sooner.

Unfortunately, white could protected his cutting stones here.  So, even though it worked, your connection to your group on the left isn't perfect.  (See variation.)]
;B[fn];W[ho];B[hn];W[hp];B[gp]C[`` This move is wasteful.  It only recedes white's territory by one point, which isn't very much.  Furthermore, when white ataris, you have to respond to keep your stone alive.  So, you lose the initiative in exchange for that one point.]
;W[gq];B[gn];W[pq];B[jm]C[`` Pushing out here is a little slow.  The corner is big, so it would be better to just respond to white over there.]
;W[km];B[jl];W[lk]C[W109 further limits my move "north."

`` That's fine.  There are more points in the corners and on the sides than there are in the center.  So, at this point, you can let white have the center, while you fight for the bottom right corner.]
;B[lm]C[`` This looks like a move that would be nice if white would just ignore it for a couple of turns.  Unfortunately, it's rare for an opponent to give you multiple turns in a row.]
;W[kl];B[mm];W[mn];B[nm];W[po];B[on];W[oo];B[pn];W[qo]TR[lm]
[pp]C[`` It's good that you managed to make use of M7 by connecting it to your other stones.  But, giving up Q4 is painful.  Again, that corner would be far more valuable than some points in the center.]
;B[rn];W[ro];B[sn];W[so];B[nn];W[mo];B[ln];W[lo];B[jo];W[ko]
;B[ll]LB[cf:D][ci:C][ni:B][ll:A]C[`` Look for bigger moves than A.  B, C, and D are all pretty big right now.

B could lock up some very big side territory for you, which would be nice to have.  C and D stop white from getting much territory on the side, while expanding your own territory.]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[nj];B[ok];W[mi];B[lh]LB[lh:A][oh:B]C[`` Here you have the option of containing white from two different sides.  You picked A and pushed him into your territory.  That's exactly what he wanted.  It would be better to just play at B and keep him out.]
;W[li];B[og]C[`` This is good for keeping him out.];W[nh];B[oi]
C[B138 and 140 were intended to allow connection to the top right corner. It seemed to work.

`` It does work, but I don't think you needed those moves for that purpose.  In order to connect to the corner, white would have to cut your groups, and your groups are already too strong for that.  These moves are more important just for solidifying what you have and stopping white from pushing in.]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[oj];B[pi]C[`` You don't need to connect here to save P11 until white plays O11.  Don't give up the initiative when you don't have to.  Just look for other big moves right away.]
;W[mg];B[lg];W[nf];B[ng];W[pg];B[of];W[mf];B[mh];W[ni];B[ne]
C[Do I move to capture or let them sit dead? I get greedy :).

`` I see this as being overly cautious rather than greedy.  Those stones are yours whether or not you take them now.  So, be greedy and do more damage elsewhere rather than just taking the things that are already yours.  ;-)]
;W[ji];B[ki];W[kj];B[kh];W[ml];B[nl];W[qn];B[rm];W[ce];B[cd]
;W[bf];B[bd];W[be];B[ad]LB[ad:A][ci:B]C[`` Don't keep crawling along the wall.  Play something bigger like B.]
;W[ae];B[fb];W[gb];B[ga];W[ha];B[fa];W[hb];B[db]C[`` Do you really think you needed this stone?  Try reading things out a bit before making protective moves.]
;W[bj];B[bk];W[cj];B[ck];W[di];B[bi];W[ci];B[aj];W[bh];B[ai]
;W[ah];B[ak];W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[aq];W[ar];B[bo]C[`` This is another stone that you didn't really need to play.]
;W[gi];B[hi];W[hj];B[ii];W[ij];B[jh];W[jj];B[ih]C[`` Again, you played an extra stone when you didn't need to.]
;W[ei];B[cg]C[B204 and 206 were casual "probes" to judge response. I've goofed often enough.

`` It seems like you've been burned by moves like this one a lot since you make so many over protective moves.

Playing moves like this one that don't work and protecting against them when you don't need to can become a bad habit for people around your rank and those who are a little stronger.  For one thing, it can seem a little rude to try to trick your opponent with moves that don't work.  But, more importantly, you end up hurting your own go skills.

When you see a spot that might lead to a big kill, read it out very carefully before making a  move.  If the kill works, protect or attack, otherwise move on.
  If you protect when you don't need to, you lose a point and the initiative.  When you try to kill and it doesn't work, you lose a ko threat and risk losing a point if your opponent doesn't really need to respond.

Your reading won't always be perfect.  Sometimes, you'll try to kill and it won't work, and sometimes you'll get killed when you thought you were safe.  But, you'll always learn from it when you're wrong.  With time, you'll gain confidence in your reading skills and your overall game will improve.]

`` Overall, this was a pretty good game.

The two things you need to work on are not getting caught up in little local fights when there are bigger moves elsewhere and not being over protective.  Practice reading in every game and you're sure to improve.

[cn][ao][ap][bp][cp]C[I stopped here and decided to fill-in some of the "blanks" such as at E6, E4, etc. Is this correct procedure? Is this rude?

`` Those blanks are called dame.  It is not necessary to fill them, and most players online do not take the time to do so.  Some might even consider it rude, but you can fill them if you like.

There are a couple of instances where filling dame makes sense.  One is in offline games, where it can make the counting easier.  Another is in games with Chinese rules, where every stone on the board is worth a point, so every dame you fill is worth a point.  Finally, there are some dame that when you fill them, your opponent has to fill in a space of his territory.  So, these dame are always worth filling.]
