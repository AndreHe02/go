AB[dp][pd]C[Hi. This game has plenty of mistakes but it was fun.

I'm trying to learn how to think on a large scale.  Usually i have the habit of always answering my opponent's moves with a reply in the same area. This game I totally ignore him while he bites off a pretty big chunck of territory.  Meanwhile I build a much larger but looser framework.

This is a very new way of playing for me so I'm sure many of my decisions on where to place the stones in the moyo need improvement.  Any other comments will be appriciated also.

Thanks in advance.
UH6];W[dd];B[pp];W[nc];B[dh]C[I thought this move would limit the potential of his 4-4 stone in the upper left while coordinating with the two lower hoshi stones.

I expected white to play another approach move. The variation shows how I had planned to answer.

Olaf: this move looks a bit strange too me. It is too far from D4 to be an extension and to far from D16 to be a kakari. A stone between 2 seats. Alternatives are D10 or C14-F16-D10.]

(;W[gd];B[qj]C[With the last variation in mind I played this move to make that line of play even better for black.

Also it is consistant with the whole large framework idea.]
;W[pb]C[he wants to get the other corner or at least put black on the defensive]
;B[og]C[a move emphasising that if he takes the corner i want a big side and potential territory in the middle

Olaf: looks interesting and i'm not good enough to critizice it. :-)]
;W[ld]C[white is solidifying his moyo into territory.

I admit this had me nervous.

Olaf: perhaps too slow. M16 (or L17) and R17 is miai, so there is no hurry to play one of them. I would play on the bottom instead.]
;B[iq]C[but there are plenty of other big points on the board.

the black framework is getting very menacing];W[fh];B[ck]C[now black takes a bit of territory on the left.white's move is not doing much to get him points, in fact its a bit deep and may help me attack his upper side later.  but i understand that he felt the need to get a presence in the center.]
;W[cf]C[this is big expanding his corner];B[jf];W[jd];B[he]
;W[hd];B[mf]TR[he][jf][og][qj]C[This wall looks really cool. :-)]
;W[qc];B[qd]TR[cp][dq][eg][ff][jj][mq][pn]C[inconsistant. a move around the center star point would be more in line with my previous play.
Olaf: you are right perhaps.

Still its hard to criticise limiting his corner.

What other points are big that black could look at here? I marked a few that I saw, are there others that are better?
Olaf:  i would play O4 now. You played asyymetrical on the bottom, O4 would some kind of fill a gap there. Additional effect, you build another wall with your stone at Q4, which is facing your cool wall on the top.]

(;B[oe]C[I think looking back that this is bad. the variation is how I would play it if I had to do it over.]
;W[oh];B[nf];W[ph]C[black isnt too disappointed with this result either. white has a very bad shape and black can build som more wall chasing it around.but it also disrupts the connection between the wall and blacks other stones. this could be a problem later.]

Olaf: true, it would have been better, first to step evan further in your propective moyo with A.]

;W[qn]
(;B[om]C[slack on my part. how should I play to cap? just o6 maybe?
Olaf: first R5 to make white havy, that attack with a cap.]

;W[mk];B[qq];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[pl];W[ll];B[km];W[im]C[now the opponent makes a  slacker
if he continues pushing i get about 60 points in that bottom area and will have to make an invasion on the top to regain the lead.

this move is just a little too far and gets white into trouble]

however. black is  ultra thick and its hard to picture him not getting a huge amount of territroy in the rest of the board no matter white white does.]

(;W[pj];B[jd]SQ[cf][gc][kb][qm]TR[cl][gq][hg][ml][mq]C[The squares show the areas where whites stones have potential to expand and get more territroy.

Triangles are points where I feel black has potential to get territory.

I dont mind giving white the 25 points of territory on the side and upper right because it seems that area only has the potential to get about 15-20 more.

Its seems like white can probobly get another 20-30 points around the hoshi stone if black ignores it.  other than that almost anywhere white invades black should be able to make him live farily small while converting territory by pressuring the invading stones.

White will have to figure out something to do with the o17 stone later.]
