C[Perhaps something closer to the white wall would have been better?

C5 looks good];W[ge];B[fd];W[gf];B[dl]C[I feel I have got the better start here.

yes, but the advantage is not big];W[hq]
(;B[jq]C[Proper direction?

I feel closing the corner is better since there is more potential territory there and the O4 group is strong anyway]
;W[eq]

(;B[pe]C[I was at a loss what to do here and chose a funny move. Simply p11  probably be better.

yes, or playing O16 seems also possible.];W[qf]
(;B[of]C[I think the main thing here is that you want R11 to run out together with W. If you want to take the W base, S15 seems better. Otherwise you should just jump to P11 immediately.]

(;B[pl]C[did you consider trading groups at this point? I think it's not better than the game, just wanted to make sure you consider this.]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[rn]
(;B[mi]C[I think you should complete the connection, attaching to the weak group is not good. First make yourself safe, then attack - but not from this side since you can't make a big territory here.]
;W[li]
(;B[nh]C[another aji-keshi];W[ng];B[lh];W[mg];B[mj]C[Should have been m10

why? you still have to go back and play N10. The way I see it, exchanging M10 for L11 first is very bad since it lets W capture M12 in a net instead of in a ladder. Playing atari just for the sake of it is helping the opponent.]

;W[hd]
(;B[lf]C[why here??? you're helping W remove a problem... If you read out what happens when you move out the M12 stone, you realize that there are many better moves than M14 that can also force W to capture. But most importantly, because of the bad aji W cannot do anything to hurt you on the upper side, so you can simply tenuki. Later you can  L15 M13 H18 which is huge endgame.]
;W[lg];B[kk]C[this looks a bit slow since W is already alive.]

(;W[hb]
(;B[ib]C[you cannot answer here - if you think this is necessary you should have played H18 instead of L9. Anyway, I think you can take C11.]
;W[ga];B[cb];W[bb];B[ea];W[ia];B[jb];W[ja];B[ka];W[ha];B[kc]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[cj]C[up to here your mistakes have cancelled out so it seems like it's going to be a close game.]
;B[dj];W[di];B[ck]C[E10 better?

I don't think so since L9 is poking into the W center area it isn't very big and the E10 atari doesn't hurt too much.]
;W[ej];B[dk];W[bi];B[bj];W[ci];B[on];W[lq]C[this is too deep. B is strong to the right and above, so there is no way it can live.]

(;B[kp]C[a bit tight. I would feel like trying to punish W harder for his mistake by capturing on a big scale.]
;W[mo]
(;B[mp]C[... but this move is very bad, when you go out to kill you should stalk your prey from a distance, he can't cut you on the right so there is no need to play from that direction.]

(;B[ij]C[Bad move. Where would have been better? Is the left in serious danger already?

J10 plays from the direction of the strongest stones, L9 and M9 instead of from the weaker G5 and G6 stones. I think the best shape is to play H9 which makes an ogeima from both stones, but G8 is also a possibility to consider.

I don't think the left is in any danger at all.];W[hm];B[gm]
;W[hk]C[these are very good moves by W.];B[hl]C[this is bad, helping to strengthen W.]
;W[il];B[gl];W[ik];B[jj];W[gj];B[dp]C[Helping white?

no, this is not helping W since there is only one option here anyway. it's a little sente endgame which belongs to you, but you don't have to play it yet.]
