I had a quick look...  It seems that you have a pretty good
idea why you are losing already!  You need to count the
territory more frequently.  Not a tally of "I have so many
points and he has so many" but more "This section of the
board is mine, and it's about as bit as that part of his
territory", leading to a rough idea of what is big and what
is small.  Once you have figured that out to an extent, you
will have an idea of what the large points are.  I'll try
and give some examples through the game.

I see that you have this problem.  Try and look at a piece
of territory which is forming, and imagine a realistic
border around it that you can expect to achieve.  Look at
the -open- points that would be left after doing that, and
then compare that territory to another area on the board
that "belongs" to your opponent.  You don't have to count
the points, but figure out things like "my left top corner
is about as big as his center territory" and you can figure
out where the large moves are.

I will try and point out situations where you play a move
for small territory while there is big territory to be
taken.  After that, I suggest you take some positions from
the game, and physically count some areas of the board,
looking at what you could expect to get there, and then
compare them to the final position, and see how far you
mis-estimated.  This exercise should help!

Good point!  I will show you some of those in the game.

This is almost a cross between the chinese opening
(Q18, Q9, Q3) and san-ren-sei (Q18, Q10, Q4).
Both are good, but I think this is slightly worse.
Only the experts can really say!

Could work.  You could try many approach moves in a situation
like this, or else defend your corners.  I marked some obvious
moves, but there are other possibilities in the beginning.]

Quite right!  After R18, you really want to play
Q18.  Also, this move does not cut white
effectively.  Somewhere near Q7 is also good.];W[pf];B[nh]C[> I'm trying to prevent that white group from

This is not really important at the moment.  You
are building a wall that does not enclose much
territory.];W[rg];B[rh];W[qo];B[qm]C[Good pincer!];W[oo];B[np]

Here I would rather press on the attack by playing
somewhere like D18.  It threatens to take the
corner and protects your stone at F17.  Invading
between C14 and C9 is not a good idea at the
moment, as you would create a weak group, and by
chasing it around the board, white would create
excellent influence.];B[fq]C[> Am I spreading myself too thin here?

Maybe so.  G3 looks more natural to me. 

The stones near P5 are still unsettled.  Keeping them out of the corner would be a good strategy.]

A good idea, but it looks a bit hard to pull
off...  You might, however, be able to get
some useful influence by chasing the
group at J6, so that you could invade
white's left side.

> 2) Try to invade somewhere in between C14 and C9

Not really such a great idea, in my opinion...

The strategy was not so bad, but the
implementation was weak! (see later)

I would say something like D18 or M6.  Hard
to say for sure.];B[ff]C[This does not strengthen F17!
Better to play F15 or even better, D18.

This stone lays the foundation for
white's invasion later.];W[ob]C[And this is why you wanted to play
Q18 earlier ;-)  This is a big move by white.];B[nb];W[oc];B[nc]

It's OK, I guess.  Maybe it would be better to try
and make white's group at H4 feel lonely.  Maybe
F5 would be a way to keep white from making
territory in the center.];W[ci];B[ch];W[bi];B[bh];W[dc]C[Your three invasion stones are looking very

Not so bad yet...];W[nm];B[ml]C[Now that doesn't help much to keep the white

one stone lower at N7?];W[rq]C[Big move by white!];B[mm];W[ok]

I don't think that it is necessarily a bad
invasion.  You did, however, make the mistake of
trying too hard to kill it, and letting it connect
to the outside.  You should always keep more
distance from a group you are trying to kill,
then, even if it does live, it will live small.

You should be either cutting him off at the side

further away from his stones.];W[je];B[ke];W[jf];B[if];W[ie]

If you look at your center, you will see that if
white survives, you will lose almost all of it.
I don't think you can be confident of killing
white, so you must make sure of your top side.

What you keep doing is playing too close to the
invasion, and then you get your groups divided,
and in saving them you let white's group keep
moving.];W[jg];B[ji];W[ii];B[jj];W[ih];B[gf];W[he];B[hh];W[hj]

Compare the territory at stake here with the
territory at the top of the board.  Work out what
you might expect to happen if you play H17 now
instead of G9.

Center territory is not as large as edge territory.];W[hk];B[gl]

I don't know about the shape, but I would rather
play F18 here than E18:  Less cutting points.  Two
stones like F17,F18 form a good structure near the
edge.];W[fa];B[ea]C[Now you would prefer to have had a stone

Well, play more games against good opponents, and
send them in for review.

Count territory, whether in the game (roughly) or
after the game (more accurately).

I think it will help you miss less atari's, and
keep you from making mistakes such as losing the
group at E19.  It won't help you with the midgame
full-board strategy, though.
