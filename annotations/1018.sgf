C[JR: I think my main failing in this game was making  bad use of the moyo I gained in the top right.

Also I gave away sente for no reason at times.

My main questions are -   1. How to have used the moyo better.

2. Were there other places I gave away sente without good reason
------------------------------------

John,

I had a look at your game and added comments at several places. I hope that
they are of some help to you. The main mistake black made in the game certainly was to let white get into the moyo in the upper right too easily. Before that, black clearly had a won game. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email me.

;B[oc];W[qo];B[qm];W[oo];B[np];W[rq]C[ug: This is not so good. Better choices for White are M4 or Q8.]

(;B[qq]C[ug: I would prefer to play an extension at Q10 or J3.]
;W[rr];B[no];W[on];B[pk];W[nr]
(;B[nq]C[ug: This doesn't seem to be the optimal move for black (see also the comments for move 19), but I am not sure myself what the best move is here.]
;W[or];B[pp]C[ug: This is bad shape. For one thing, P3 looks better here - it is still bad shape, but takes away a liberty from the two white stones. On the other hand since black apparently cannot avoid making bad shape now, maybe something went wrong earlier.]

;W[ql];B[qk];W[rl];B[rk];W[pl]C[ug: I think white could have tenuki-ed here. Black can be very satisfied now.]
;B[jd];W[cn];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[cb]C[ug: This looks too submissive.]

;B[ci];W[bh];B[dj];W[eh];B[di];W[ed]C[ug: A perfect result for black.]

(;B[jj]C[ug: This should be a won game for black. But the move at K10 may not be the best choice. Although it does look attractive to make such a large moyo, it often makes the game easier if one plays a 'smaller', but more solid move. See the variations for possible choices.]
;W[de];B[bg]C[JR - I didn't need to play this?

ug: That's right.];W[jg]C[ug: Good move - and this shows why K10 - though not a bad move - makes the game more difficult to play for black.]
;B[kf];W[nk];B[nj];W[lj]
(;B[mi];W[lg];B[kg];W[li]
(;B[mk]C[ug: This is a grave mistake, maybe the biggest mistake black made in this game. You must not tenuki from M12/N12 when white is threatening to lay waste to your moyo. Since the white group in the lower right is very stable, capturing the stone at O9 is not a threat at all.

See the variations.];W[mh]C[ug: Ouch!]
(;B[nh];W[ng]
(;B[nl]C[JR: The alternative is much better?

ug: Yes, it is better.Much better - I'm not sure. It seems easy for white now to get settled inside the black moyo.]
;W[oh]
(;B[ne]C[ug: you can't allow white to take this stone, because the white group will be completely settled then]

(;W[me]C[ug: white should take the black stone instead];B[md]
;W[le];B[ld];W[ke]
(;B[jf]C[ug: It will be impossible to kill this white group anyway, so you should simply sacrifice these two black stones - they are not important anymore once the white group is alive. Furthermore (as the game shows) it is not easy to save them without giving up a lot at the top]
