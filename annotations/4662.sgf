C[[eversonyoshi\]: Hi Johan! =D

I read your e-mail, but don't worry, the Fuseki (opening) is the most difficult part of GO. I will try to show you some alternatives, some names and some concepts. But I recommend you to read the articles: "On Your Side" by Charles Matthews in the site GoBase (http://gobase.org/). Charles Matthews is a strong player and has much more experience than me.

  Try to watch pro games too, and observe their Fuseki. Usually we don't understand everything, but something enters in our mind, and you will notice an improvement in your game. And try to see the GTL games too, because they are commented and easy to understand.

  Study and understand a little about Josekis. Per example, study 3-3 joseki and try to use this in your games, after the 3-4, 4-4 and so on. Even if you lose, don't worry, it's normal when you are learning.

   And to finish, pratice go problems as much as you can.

   Well, let's see your game... =D];B[pd];W[dp]
(;B[cd]C[[eversonyoshi\]: See variant.];W[qp]
(;B[cn]LB[pm:Q7][pd:Q16][cd:C16][cn:C6]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Good. C6 will work well with C16 (they will help each other). You choose to make a Kakari (approach move in a corner stone) on the left side. I think that a Kakari against a Hoshi is easier, and you couldn`t do a Kakari in Q7 to work with Q16 (well...  you can, but it`s unusual for me...).

   See the variant to others options.];W[gq]
(;B[dk]LB[bp:B4]C[[eversonyoshi\]: You played for influence... I show the common joseki in the variant.]
;W[ch]LB[op:P4][qf:R14]C[[eversonyoshi\]: This move was early. White could played P4 or R14. Now you can threat to kill this stone while you develop your stones...]

(;B[cf]LB[cf:C14][ch:C12][cd:C16]TR[dk][cn]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I think that you didn't take profit from the situation. C14 pushes C12 towards the marked stones and they became weak.
   When you want to push an opponent stone, it's better to push it against a strong group that have 2 eyes or many liberties like a wall, etc.
    In this case, C16 is a strong stone because it's in the corner... See variant.]
;W[bj]
(;B[bl]LB[bl:B8][qj:R10]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I am in doubt if it's better defend with B8 or play a tenuki in R10 (per example). See variant...]
;W[bg]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Because of the early invasion, White is in troube now...]

(;B[bf]LB[bg:B13][oq:P3]C[[eversonyoshi\]: You are pressuring White, it's good, but I think that there are bigger moves. But I believe that there isn't one right move. We have many choices. Sometimes you will read or hear someone telling "don't do this", but after sometime you will see a pro "doing this"... ^_^

   And I would like to comment about the Kakari in P3, see variant...]
;W[cg];B[ef]C[[eversonyoshi\]: If white doesn't run to center now, he can dead.]
;W[fc]LB[fc:F17]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I don't like F17 because they said: "don't play near strength". Again, I think that White invaded early.]

(;B[dc]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Do you remember when I said: "push your opponent stone against a strong group"? Here we have a good example, see variant.]
;W[ic];B[mc]LB[kc:L17]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I prefer L17 to put more pressure in White.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]LB[mc:N17][nc:O17][pc:Q17]C[I don't think I can kill the white stone so instead I choose where to get influence. Is this the best side to answer?

[eversonyoshi\]: I think so. If you played in Q17, your group would become heavy (making few points). See variant.

Ah, and if you had played in O17 instead of N17, White would live only with Ko.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
(;B[nc]LB[od:P16][nb:O18]C[[eversonyoshi\]: O18 seems dangerous, but it isn't so much... See variant. But your move remove White in P16, that  would be annoying. And it's better to make a solid wall to build influence after this...]
;W[nb]
(;B[rc]LB[ic:J17][fc:F17][pj:Q10][pi:Q11][ph:Q12]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I think that Q12 would be better... maybe even Q11 or Q10, but because of F17 and J17, I believe that you can't do a long extension... See variant...]
;W[rb];B[rd]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Now, you lost sente...]
(;W[sb]C[[eversonyoshi\]: As you said, he made some unnecessary moves... See variant....]
;B[qj]LB[dp:4th][pd:4th][ef:5th][dk:4th][pi:Q11][ph:Q12]TR[mc]
[nc][oc]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Q12 is right point. But because of the Black marked stones, I think that you can go to Q11. 

    And you have 3 stones in the fourth line or highter (against one stone of White). You are playing high (influence) and White is playing low (territory). And many Black stones are surronding White stones. Then, I think that your extension would be better in the fourth line instead of the third line...]
;W[pg]C[[eversonyoshi\]: This was a good move to reduce your influence. But, White didn't fortify the lower side, than you can take profit from the situation.]

(;B[qm]LB[pg:Q13][qm:R7][qj:R10][qp:R4]C[[eversonyoshi\]: It's difficult to deal with Q13 because you have many options, and you have to read many moves ahead to have sure of which choice is better.

   For one side, R7 is good because you strenghten R10 while you threat R4, now you can fight better against Q13. But for other side, you forced White to strenghten the lower side, and it's bad. 

   I tried to kill Q13 in my Go board, and I almost be able, almost.... Maybe a Dan player can kill it. I will show you this in the variant.

   You can just threat Q13 and take profit from it.
 
    Or you could threat R4 and made a whole board strategy, threating many White groups at the same time. But I think that is difficult to have a whole board vision...]
;W[nq]C[[eversonyoshi\]: This Shimari with Ogeima (long horse jump) doesn't protect the corner against an invasion... 
   You can invade it later, but now, I think that you have to make some moves in Sente (threating to kill some White stones) to strenghten yourself, and after this an invasion in the lower right corner would be good...]
;B[bp]LB[pg:Q13]C[[eversonyoshi\]: This move is big, but I think that you have to pressure Q13.]
;W[cr]LB[cq:C3][cr:C2]C[[eversonyoshi\]:  C3 is the right move because C2 let some aji in this corner.]

(;B[oj]LB[oi:P11]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Maybe P11 to put more pressure...]
;W[qi];B[ri]LB[pi:Q11]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I prefer Q11 because it aims the center.]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[rh]
(;B[rj]LB[ri:S11]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Your group became heavy (making few points per stone...). Maybe it would be better to sacrifice S11, see variant...]
;W[rg];B[oi];W[oh];B[ro]C[[eversonyoshi\]: This move is better in the end (Yose), now you have to increase your moyos.]
;W[rp];B[jq]LB[no:O5]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Your invasion is good because the White group on the left has some aji, but I prefer something like O5. Ah, and be careful with your group on the upper right corner, it's becoming weak.]
;W[lq];B[jo];W[lo]
(;B[fq]LB[eq:E3]C[[eversonyoshi\]: I thought in E3 (see variant), but your move is good too.]
;W[fp]

;B[co];W[en];B[dm]LB[fc:F17][ic:J17][km:L7]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Maybe L7 or attack F17 and J17, because now it's difficult to block White there.]
;W[fm];B[jm];W[mm]C[[eversonyoshi\]: Because of this that I don't like to play for influence, because the moyos are easily destroyed. Well, some players know and like to play this way, but to me it's very difficult.]

You have typed done.
lkkk: 54.5 to CarlJung: 63.0

[eversonyoshi\]: Black wins by 8.5 (with 0.5 of Komi).

My final comments... I think that your fuseki is good for a 17k IGS, you made few mistakes that I saw ( I am 8k KGS...). I would like to remember you:

1) Push the opponent stone against your strong group, not weak group.
2) A good way to attack is attacking the base (the place where the attacked group would make 2 eyes).
3) Try to see the moyos when they are starting to showing up, this will help you to attack and defend.
4)Connection is important (but fortunately, you didn't have problem with it).

  The white player is good too, he wasted many moves that he didn't need to play, but he also reduced well your influence. It's good to see your own mistakes, but you have to see your merits too.

   I wish that you can improve and learn what you want. Play some handicap games to gain experience and enjoy a lot playing GO.

   Good Bye! =D])
