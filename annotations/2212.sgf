RE[W+31.50]
TM[1200]

AB[dd][dp][jj][pd][pp]C[5 stones is a fairly big head start. My suggestion when playing with such a big handicap would be to play defensively as a rule, but attack when the defensive move gives away too much. You have to try to keep your lead, because you can always expect to lose some points in the end game.

The most obvious characteristic of handicap games is that White keeps sente, and probably the most powerful technique for Black will be to know when to tenuki. These oportunities can then be used to either make territory or attack (or both, if you're lucky).]
;W[jd]C[Doesn't force a response, but also doesn't really leave itself open to attack.]

(;B[mc]C[A bit thin. Even in an even game, it would probably be better to play a O17, making the corner more secure, yet still being sufficiently close to White that he can't make a base on the top right alone (see variation).]
;W[qo]C[This isn't joseki, but joseki is for pros. I've played this move as an approach before, and I was happy with the result. White may not have know that this was a sub-optimal move, or he may have decided to play away from joseki, which would tend to lead to an even result for both players, and hence maintain your lead.]
;B[qp]C[An adequate response, happily and calmly taking the corner. I'd say that the best response for White here would be to approach again from the other side with O3, which would be a strong attack, while at the same time leaving a lot of potential in the R5 stones, which Black will not be able to kill easily (The best Black could hope for would probably be making some profit globally while attacking R5. For that reason, White would probably let it die, but try to extract all the profit he can while doing so).]
;W[rp]C[A bit low. White certainly isn't mapping out any large territory here.]
;B[rq]C[Correct. Takes the corner while attacking S4.];W[sp]
C[Just makes it worse for himself. Still not making eye shape, and allowing you to secure the corner even further.]
;B[sq]C[The obvious response.]
(;W[ro]C[Awful! Making an empty triangle, not leaving any good follow-up or anything.]

(;B[qq]C[This move is wasted. White had very little potential left in this corner. He certainly couldn't cut, because the cutting stone could be caught in a ladder (see variation). Only after White Q5 would the cut become plausible, but even then, you should be happy to respond calmly with P4 (see variation).

If you wanted to respond locally, the best move would have been Q5 (see variation). This stopped White from being able even to threaten a cut, while at the same time attacking the White group.]
;W[jh]C[Seems a rather ineffectual move by White. He still doesn't have a base at the top (or in the bottom right, for that matter), and he's not really attacking anything. F17 would be a good move for White at the top, but settling his lower right group should take precedence.

This is certainly a good time to make some territory, unless you feel like attacking either group of White stones.]

(;B[ph]C[Pushing towards the lower right White stones, which is good. Although it's probably misplaced. It doesn't really strengthen the top right, because the invasion by White at R17 is a very big move. Also, Q14 could become a viable cut for White after he's developed hist K stones a little more.

Better would probably have been R11, where your Black stone could happily extend in either direction, either making a big moyo or attacking Whites lower right stones (see variation).]
;W[pk]
(;B[nj]C[[Roy\]I'm trying to keep his framework divided.

Nice to see you actually included *some* comments in the SGF.

It's not important right now to separate the two groups. As long at all your stones live on the board, there's no territory to be made by White between R12 and K10. O10 is too thin, and is crying out to be attacked. A better idea would be to defend one of your groups or attack one of Whites. R10, for example, would attack White while staying unconditionally connected to Q12 and developing some territory (see variation).]
;W[oi];B[jp]C[[Roy\] Maybe P10 would have been better

No, P10 would have pushed White towards your thin moyo in the top right. If you wanted to attack P11, P12 or Q11 would be better, to grow and strengthen your territory.

But K4 is a good move.];W[op]C[The strongest way to respond to this move would be Q5. The White S5 group still isn't strong enough to ignore the threat of R6. But that takes fighting spirit, and a defensive move is definately okay.]
;B[oq]C[A good move.];W[pr]C[White is trying too hard too attack here. He's giving you stones.]
;B[qr];W[np]C[White can't cut at Q3, because you would be able to catch his stones with P3, so your P3 stones is connected to the rest. This would be another appropriate time to attack with Q5 (see variation), but again, only if you felt like fighting.]

(;B[or];W[nq];B[po]C[So it turned out okay in the end, with you cutting the two groups apart. None of White's groups look strong now, but your group in the bottom right is.]
;W[om]
(;B[on]C[Trying to cut the O4 stones off, I suppose (a comment here would have been nice). This is the right idea, but it would have been nice to push at R6 in sente first (see variation).]
;W[nn];B[oo]C[P6 and Q5 were unconditionally connected already, so I assume that the point of this play was to weaken the O4 group's connection to White's stones in the lower right.]
;W[qn]
(;B[lp]C[O5 should have been considered, at least (see variation). Moves like O5, which create cutting points at least if they don't actually manage to cut, are usually good.]
;W[nr];B[os]
(;W[dj]C[The cut at O5 would definately work now.]
(;B[dh]MA[cd][cf][dc][df][fc][fd]C[With White stones on both sides of D16, this move should have been much closer to the corner. Any of the marked points would have been good. An extension this long begs for attack in a handicap game. After White D14, D12 would be isolated, and you couldn't be sure of saving it.]
;W[eh]
(;B[bh]C[While there's still such a chasm between D12 and D16, White E12 should be responed to with a defensive move. Black D13 instead of B12 would take territory while strengthening D12, and weakening E12 and D10.]
;W[fe];B[fd];W[gd];B[fc];W[ee]C[White's found some potential territory in the middle, but given you the opportunity to make more secure territory in the top left.]

(;B[ed]C[E16 protects against a push by White, but D15 would do it much better, by securely connecting to B12, D14 stones (see variation).]
;W[cf]C[[Roy\] In retrospect I probably should have played to prevent this cut]
;B[df];W[de];B[dg];W[ch]C[Should be at C16, attacking the Black corner while protecting against the C15 cut.]
;B[cg];W[ci]
(;B[bg]C[C14 was yours for the taking (see variation).];W[ce]
;B[bi];W[bj];B[di];W[cj];B[ei]C[[Roy\]I think the next series of quasi-ladder moves are good for Black.

Yes. White seemed to want to fence you in, and in my opinion tried too hard, leaving himself with excess cutting points and shortage of liberties.]

(;W[fh]C[Both Black groups in the top left quarter of the board are weak. Probably the E16 group is weakest, and should be defended now. A White attack at C17 would be severe (see variation).]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[fi];W[fk]
(;B[gj]C[H10 would be more dynamic, and uncuttable.];W[ij]
(;B[hk]C[The hane at G9 would be more severe.];W[gk];B[hj];W[ik]
;B[hl];W[gl];B[hm];W[gm];B[hn];W[dn]C[[Roy\]  I knew I had to play here or D7 soon but I was overly afraid to stop extending.

That sounds fair.];B[gn]C[[Roy\] A wistful grope at White's new home

And it strengthened your group at the same time.];W[fn];B[hp]
C[Should be arround F4. White F4 would be a severe attack on D4.]
;W[il]C[A wasted move. It achieves nothing.];B[kn]C[L6 strengthens an already strong group, and makes no territory. I can't imagine what you were trying to achieve with it. The top left group is still crying out for attention. It pays to have a good look around the board every so often, just to see if there are any such groups.]
;W[no]C[[Roy\]I probably should have played O5 myself earlier to cut with a good chance to get the group on O2 to Q4.

He finally realised. It had been sitting there all that time and both of you ignored it.]
;B[ii];W[kl];B[lm];W[ll];B[mm];W[lq]C[Should definately be at O7, connecting.]

(;B[kq]C[I think O7 would have killed the White group, but the fighting gets ugly (see variation). And certainly I wouldn't expect you to be able to convince yourself of it. But the possibility is clearly there, and as such, O7 was the best move here.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[ks]
(;B[js]C[Locally, you could have captured the L2 stones. See variation. Again, O7 would kill.]
;W[lr]C[O7 would no longer kill. N1 would save the White group.]
;B[nl]C[Now that the bottom White group is stabilised, you need to determine where the important parts of the board are.

The center White group is weak, so this move, putting pressure on it is one good option.

The lone Black stone in the lower left corner definately needs defending. F4 would be a massive move for either side. For Black, it would make a *lot* of territory. For White, it makes a  strong attack on the Black stone and takes away a lot of Black's territory on the lower side.

The top left group is still weak. Possibly it could even be killed. A move like C16 would make a lot of territory and save the group. A move on the other side like G17 would be sente, so this could be made before C16, but White might try to fight by jumping into C17 instead of responding locally.]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[mi];B[mj];W[lj];B[ji];W[ki]C[The center White group is safe for now.]
;B[ml];W[lk];B[kj];W[jm];B[jn]C[Black did not need to respond here. White K7 wasn't needed to connect White's J9 stones, and it had no follow-up that was painful to Black.]
;W[kg];B[jc]C[This move invites attack, and this is not a good idea against a higher ranked player. To make territory, better options would be L17, R15 (securing the corner), R10 (making territory, helping the corner, threatening the S5 group). Of course, you shouldn't be trying to make territory now. You should rather be saving the top left or the bottom left, the two weakest areas on the board.]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[hc]C[Preparing even more for the attack on the top left. Now death after C17 is almost inevitable.]
;B[ri]C[[Roy\] I'm sure there's a better move here - maybe S12 or C16.  In retrospect S11 is too slow to connect to Q12 to be worth the extra point.

Like I said earlier, the best territory making move around here would be R10.]
;W[ni];B[oj];W[pj];B[pi]C[[Roy\]A reflexive cut which doesn't help except to get closer to connecting Q12 and S11

It's a good cut locally, because it threatens to attack the right side, but as White proves next, these stones are too weak for it to work.]
;W[pf]
(;B[of]C[[Roy\] I was determined not to allow such an incursion.  Hopefully you can point out some better moves in the following sequence.

You couldn't stop it. White had too much to run towards in the middle, and the corner was too thin.]
;W[og]
(;B[pg]C[Black looks pretty poor from here in.];W[qf]
(;B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[qg]C[I don't think the Q12 group can be saved now, but maybe it could.]

(;B[ng]C[The move doesn't achieve anything, needs reinforcement, and White's reponse takes away a potentially valuable liberty from the Q12 group. It was best avoided.]
;W[oh]
(;B[ne];W[mf];B[nf];W[cc]C[[Roy\] big trouble

I can't believe White waited so long. It seems the outstanding feature of this game was both players leaving the really important parts of the board way too long. Unfortunately for you, White wasn't prepared to leave them quite as long.]
