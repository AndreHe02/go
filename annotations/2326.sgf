C[Dear reviewer,

this is a game, where I don't really know what went wrong, but lost anyway. I think it would be most helpful if you could point out the one or two most important things to improve my game.

Thank you.


Well, I had some suggestions.  Hope they were of some help.  In your endgame you drop many points just by not looking which moves are sente and which are gote!!  This can make a big difference with little effort.

Good luck further

David];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[pk];W[nc];B[kc]C[I don't know much about Joseki yet. I felt strong on the right and wanted to prevent white from becoming too strong on the top.

Joseki is also not my forte, but this pincer looks OK.];W[ne]
;B[pf];W[ic];B[ke];W[ng];B[ph];W[lg];B[if]C[You must be careful not to spend too much time saving a weak group.  If you run too far, white will just become strong around a dead group.  Better to leave the group on the board for its influence.]
;W[fc];B[dg]C[A logical way to use the influence of the previous black group.]
;W[ff];B[hh]MA[nc][ne][ng][lg]C[This, on the other hand is not so wise.  You are adding stones to your weak group.  better to extend on the side.  If your idea is to attack the white group around O17 [squares\], be careful, it might be harder to kill than you think.  It has options to threaten to go into the corner, and you will have trouble surrounding it securely.]
;W[jg];B[ig];W[jf]C[So here, white is cutting your surrounding (weak) stones.]
;B[id];W[hc];B[jd];W[fh];B[dj]C[Yes!  It is important not to lose sight of your live stones while trying to save the dead ones.]
;W[ji];B[hj];W[fj];B[dm];W[fq];B[jq];W[qn];B[qo];W[po];B[qp]
;W[pn];B[np]C[This corner went rather well, I think. Is my judgement right?

As far as I can see it looks good for you.  White now must think to the life of his three stones]
;W[rk];B[ri]C[In hindsight, I should have played R10, I believe?

I agree that R10 looks better.];W[qj];B[pi];W[pj];B[oj];W[ok]
;B[nk];W[ol]MA[pk]TR[ng]C[This sequence wasn't a big success for me, I think.

No, the move at Q9 [square\] was the big mistake.  But it is not a complete disaster.  White has a small live group, and now you can put a bit of pressure on white's group near P13 (Triangle).]
;B[nj]TR[ni]C[This move would have been better at O11 (triangle), so as to protect both cutting points.]
;W[li];B[mm]C[To keep white away from the center.];W[pb];B[qc]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[rd];W[od];B[pe];W[le];B[gl]TR[hj]C[To connect and strengthen my claim to the center.

Notice that a knight's move configuration (triangles) is -not- a solid connection!  White will easily cut it off.]

;W[di];B[ci];W[eh];B[ce];W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[be];W[de];B[cg]
;W[hp]C[Good move for him. He is building a nice territory during the following sequence.

Definitely!  Notice that the center territory is hard to take, maybe you should have played under his moves here.]
;B[io];W[ho];B[in];W[ip];B[jp];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir];B[jj]C[Trying to build territory in the center.

Notice how little you get!!];W[kj];B[jk];W[kk];B[kl];W[nn];B[mn]

That makes sense.];W[fp];B[eo];W[dp];B[fk];W[ek];B[gk];W[ej]
;B[dk];W[lc];B[lb];W[mc];B[mb]C[This was a very successful sequence.]
;W[nb];B[he];W[ef];B[gg];W[kf];B[je];W[ii];B[hi]C[So you finally connect here.  You should consider yourself lucky here.]

;W[ni];B[oi];W[oh];B[nf];W[mf];B[of];W[nh];B[jb]C[I should have played this earlier, I guess?]
;W[ib];B[jc]C[Small move here!!];W[hd];B[ge]C[Much better!]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[gc];B[gf]C[Another small move in gote.];W[qi]
;B[qh];W[rj];B[rh];W[ml];B[ll];W[nm];B[fg]TR[ef][eh][fh][ff]
C[This is pointless, white can always connect the bamboo joint (triangles)]
;W[eg];B[gn]C[This move would have been more sensible at H6.]
;W[go];B[ep]C[At last, a sente move.];W[eq];B[mo]C[J1 would be sente, and it is connected to his next move (sente as well!).  A17 would at least have been sente...]
