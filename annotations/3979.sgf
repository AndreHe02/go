C[
hi and thanks for reviewing :D
some things i would like help in is responses to when they
attack or how to defend in the best way right now

Hi

My name is Frank, I will be reviewing your game.  I will add comments prefixed with "[Frank\]".

Game summary:  One of the big things you should focus on is the game on a grander scale instead of just the local battles.  Remember that go is a game of territory.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[pp];W[qe];B[nd]C[is this a good enough move because i think it puts alot
more pressure on white stone than n16 or so but is slower

[Frank\] This is fine.  The thing to note is that this shape, although it is strong in this position, is not yet balanced.  The stone that is needed eventually is going to be around L17.]
;W[ph]C[[Frank\] If you want to attack his shape now, R10 disrupts the shape I mentioned previously.  However, I'd personally take D17 or D16.  It seems to work better with your development on top.]

(;B[pj];W[ql]
(;B[qn]C[was this a good response or should of i tried cutting
though i think he would steal my corner and i wanted it if
this wasnt a good response could you show me a better
one

[Frank\] This becomes a difficult choice for you since R10 was the move.  See previous var (starting at mv 6).  In this case, I might personally prefer to split W here.  See var (starting at mv 8).]
;W[qj];B[jp];W[pi];B[dc];W[cf];B[cn];W[co]C[[Frank\] Just take the kick.]

(;B[dk]TR[dj][cn][dn]C[[Frank\] This sets you up for bad shape.  Inefficient rather.  Ideally, youd like a wall to be extended by its size +1.]

(;B[fp];W[er];B[gr];W[mq]C[i really dont no how to respond here so i try to make him
run into centre while i make big moyo at left but he stays at
the bottom xD

[Frank\] Your best bet for moyo is the bottom right.]

)))
(;B[qi];W[qh];B[nj]C[[Frank\] The next move becomes difficult for W since ideally, R5 is the right extension, but it is too close to a B stone.  So, B must either try to live (should not be too difficult, but will be small and W will be sealed in) or run (in which case, B can chase and form territory).]
