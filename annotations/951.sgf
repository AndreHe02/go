C[shadow (2k*) Black vs keitap (1d*) white
black + resign -- but if not for a big kill in the end it was a very close game.

Review for Black

Tim: I think that you lose this game between about moves 90 and 160. During this time white manages to settle his two weakest groups without suffering any really serious side-effects. Indeed, the white group at the top lives by running into what should have been black's corner. A weak group should be a liability. It is your responsibility to make sure that your opponent suffers if they have a weak group on the board.

So, you are going to attack. The key thing to remember is that you should attack with some definite goal in mind. Actually going all-out for the kill is usually too dangerous. More often it is better to attack to make territory, or attack to build thickness/influence, or attack to get some stones in place so that you can attack the next group, which links up with ideas like leaning an splitting attacks. Always think about what you are trying to achieve whilst attacking, and be flexible whilst making your plans. Don't be afraid to think in big bold terms, and don't get too bogged down in the details. Once you have a plan, it will be easier to find the moves required to implement it.

When was the last time you read "Attack and Defense"? If you have not read it for a while, or if you have never read it, then this might be a good idea to remind yourself of the fundamentals of attacking.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]C[shadow: enclosing this corner seems the best

Tim: Yes. This is the better corner to enclose (think about white approack, black pincer). The only question is which encolsure to make, and that is a matter of personal preference.]
;W[qj]C[Tim: The high approach at Q5 is most normal, but this wedge is possible.]
;B[qo]C[Tim: I think that you can improve on this move. The idea behind white's last move, is that whichever side black appraches from, white can make a solid 2-space extension in the other direction. Therefore, it would be more efficient for you to make a large knights move corner enclosure, which stops white from making a 2-space extension down the side.]
;W[jp]
(;B[cj]C[shadow: I considered J17 but felt I could not allow white to play sanrensei

Tim: Letting white make a san-ren-sei does not automatically lose the game.   I am not sure about J17. There is certainly a big move on the top edge, which might be around J17, or it might be the approach at F17, but I think that the move you play on the left edge is bigger.   Another move that is worth considering is something on the right side. Normally, white will respond to R8 at R13, and R12 at R7, so black can choose how to play out this side. Often black is not sure, so it is correct to leave it for later. However, in this game, R12 is clearly bigger than R8, so black should consider exchanging R12 for R7, and then playing on the left.

However, I don't think this reasoning is valid here, because black R12 is not absolutely sente, white will probably ignore it and make the san-ren-sei instead. See the variation.]
;W[qg]C[Tim: If you understood the previous reasoning, it is clear how big this move is, it is virtually reverse sente.]
;B[ic]C[shadow: this seemed the biggest move on the board.

Tim: Let's look at which other moves could calim to be biggest:

M3 - This looks like a nice move, extending from the shimari, and aiming to follow up with a good invasion around G4. It might, or might not, be better than J17, very hard to say.

C6 - This is probalby smaller that J17

C14 - This feels like the wrong direction, it jsut encourages white to play a move on the top side, which white is happy to do, so I don't like this move.

F17 - This might be possible, but white would probably answer at C13 or 14. Then black needs another move on the top edge, after which white attacks at C8.

Something else near J17 - So the top edge is certainly a big area, good. The question is, which point is best, or, to be more precise, it is the old qusetion of 3rd line or 4th line?   Think about what might happen later. If the next person to play on the top edge is black, then F17 looks best. After that all the black stones are on the 3rd line, and it looks a bit low. Think about a white shoulder-hit at K16. For this reason I would rather play on the 4th line.   Of course, black J16 makes the white approach at G17 more tempting for white, but in exchange you have move like Q14 to build a moyo that starts to spread into the centre of the board. J16 also makes it easier for white to invade around M17, but white does not necessarily want to do this, because you will be able to attach the inviading stones by leaning on the white group on the right side.   So, I think that the 4th line is better, but it is by no means obvious.]
;W[ch];B[cm]C[shadow: I considered C6, but felt that a 3 space extension was not a great idea.  I felt I would have to add another stone to secure my group and that would give white sente

Tim: This is fine. There are 4 white stones and 2 black stones in this general area, so it is wise to be cautious. The 3-space extension is probably playable too, but you would have to know the follow-ups.]
;W[co];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[df]C[shadow: white left the bottom corner unfinished and the top right corner is invadable if I can settle my lower left group (is this correct thinking?)

Tim: It is not just white who left the bottom left unfinished.

Normally, a 2-space extension on the third line is a secure group; but when the opponent has approached closely on both sides, like the way that white has approached the black extension in the bottom left, then we say that the 2-space extension has become "cramped". This is no longer a secure groups, it is a source of some concern because it can easily become a weak group. Your should want to defend by playing a 1-point jump into the middle. In this case E7 (which aims at invading the bottom, E10 does not aim at much at all). By contrast, the white 2-space extension on the right is fine. it has plenty of space on both sides and so white has no worries here.

As you point out, you can't really invade in the top left or at the bottom until you have defended your group, so althougth E7 might look like a slow move, it is actually very big.

Also notice that you would now really like to move your stone at J17 to either J16 of K16 (isn't hind-sight wonderful). If white plays a shoulder hit at K16 then black's territory at the top will end up disappointingly small.]
;B[ql]C[shadow: I felt that the only weak black group on the board was the left group, and making white weak on the right would indirectly help me while setting up opportunities for attack later.

Tim: Perhaps, but the white group on the right is still not cramped, so white is not so worried. White can either jump into the middle, or can probably live easily with S15.

I think that M3 is clearly a bigger move in this area, and as I just said, E7 is probalby also worth considering.]
;W[mq];B[hq]C[shadow: Is this the right point to invade?  I approached the weakest white group without touching it, and hoped that when I settled my group I would not push white into my left side stones too much.

Tim: I think that this is dangerous. Over the whole board, both black and white have two weakish groups each. The problem is that the two black groups are weaker than the two white groups, and the two black groups are close together. White should aim to start a splitting attack, then you would be in trouble.   Just before this move is also a good point to look at the balance of territory. In fact it is very simple: black has the top, white has the bottom, and the left and right sides are opposite too. So the balance of territory was quite close. Your invasion has upset that balance, so now white needs to invade at the top. Since you have two weak gourps it is likely that white will end in sente, and will be able to invade.   Instead of this mutual distruction, did you also consider a constructive approach? say, leaning on the white group on the left with a move like P13 to build up your moyo at the top?]

(;W[iq];B[ir]C[shadow: setting up some forcing moves to settle myself.

Tim: You just said that you had chosen to invade here because it isolated the two (now 3) white stones, and made them into a weak group. Now you are playing contact moves that make both black and white strong. This is contradictory, in case you had not noticed.

But actually, your play here seems right. Since you have to weak groups, you will be happy in you can get one settled quickly. In the game you manage that.

I think that white's last move was wrong. White wants to set up a splitting attack, so he should not play in contact with stones he is attacking. I think what white at K3 would make life more difficult for you. See the variation.]
;W[jr];B[ip]C[shadow: forcing];W[jq];B[eq]C[shadow: more forcing]

(;W[gq]C[shadow: this was a surpise to me so I hope I handled it properly.

Tim: It is a bit unusual. I think that the most obvious move for white is to block at D3 to keep the territory and eyes in the corner. I have shown this in a variation. If black just tries to make eyes as quickly as possible we get the result there. It is difficult to tell exactly how many eyes black has at the end, but my felling is that black won't die easily. Still black is not 100% alive either, so there is still the possibility of a splitting attack. Very difficult. I don't know if the variation is good or bad.

Anyway, this white move is interesting, but you are probably satisfied to live quickly on the edge. When the possition gets difficult, finding a continuation that is good enough and safe is probably better than getting into a mess.]
;B[gr];W[hp];B[hr];W[gp];B[dq]C[shadow: expanding my eye space]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[br];B[ep]C[shadow: I felt I should try to set up some cut points to take advantage later or escape before settling living on the side.

Tim: Yes, good idea, but I don't think that white made the best answer. Have a look at the variations.]

(;W[eo];B[bq]C[shadow: might as well take it, setting up a ko for the corner should I live and white not protect himself properly.

Sure, nothing to lose now.];W[cp];B[cs]C[shadow: I think this gives me plenty of room to live, and J4 still has aji.]

(;W[fr]C[shadow: this seemed to help me live.

Tim: Yes, probably a misread. It is better for white just to capture at B4. That threatens to kill black with this hane at F2. Black will probably defend at F3, so the result is quite like the game, but white still has ko threats against black.]
;B[fq];W[er];B[dr];W[bp];B[es];W[ej]LB[bh:B][bi:B][di:C][ek:D]
[em:A][bn:B]C[shadow: this seems to invite black through, but I couldn't see anything wrong with accepting the invitation.

Tim: Actually, you are wrong. Pushing through at D11 gets black into slightly bad shape.

In order to justify that last statement I looked this shape up in my database of professional games. It found 68 games with this shape. Black answered at A 40 times, with moves like B on the edge about 10 times, at C 9 times. D was next most common, with various other things including tenuki accounting for the rest. C normally gets answered with a move like F12.]
;B[di];W[bk]LB[bj:B][ck:A]C[Tim: This is a good move for white in this shape. I have seen it in books, but interestingly it did not come up in any of the pro games I just scanned. Probably, when this is good for white it is so bad for black that it rarely occurs, but I'm not sure. The two possible answers are A and B. After B there is a standard sequence that I have given in a variation.]

(;W[cg];B[fo]C[shadow: I tried to protect the D7 cut white getting out into the middle as well]
;W[en];B[dn]C[shadow: this looked bad as soon as I played it.

Tim: Yes, no need to give white the forcing move.

shadow: I think white should play E7 next, before covering the cut.

Yes.];W[do];B[em]C[Tim: The pushing fight that follows is really crude play by both players, but virtually forced. I think that white may miss a chance for something a little better though.]

;W[ei];B[ci]C[shadow: this seems like a bad move to me -- removing aji for me on the side

Tim: It is good that you are worrying about this sort of question, but here it is not a big worry, there was not much aji on the side, at most you have lost 1 point of endgame, but you have strengthened your group in the middle which is worth something.]
;W[bi];B[fg]C[shadow: a loose net to capture the white stones or escape seem like the right idea.]

Tim: Yes, so would it have been better to play your last move at G9?]
;W[gg];B[ee];W[ge];B[ef];W[kc]C[shadow: this seemed really bad for white, but I just played slow and steady.

Tim: Yes, it is dangerous to make another weak group. White probably does need to invade at some time because if black takes all of the territory at the top, then that is bigger than the white territory on the left, and black bottom right is bigger than all the other white territory put together, so white is behind. The other idea is for white to attack in the middle, say with something like K13, then invade the top later but this plan is not guaranteed to work either.]

(;B[oe]LB[ih:A]C[shadow: I felt I was out and wanted to secure this top right corner weaking whites left side stones.  Surely one of whites groups would die.  I had 2 weak groups, but white had 4.

Tim: Yes, but if you want one of the white groups to die, why not play A? After a move like that, even if white can hack his way out, or find a way to make two eyes, you will almost certainly end up with overwealming thickness that will let you kill something else.]

;W[ba];B[ca];W[ad];B[aa];W[ia];B[ha]C[shadow: white seemed to waste 3 good ko threats.

;B[mf]C[shadow: this seemed bad to me -- see variation]
(;W[lg];B[jc]C[Tim: This is the wrong way to kill, unless you have read out every variation and are sure that it works. If you are in doubt then it is better to start with P18. That way, even if white lives, at least you have got the big endgame move in sente.]

Tim: That is good if it works, but if it fails, you may just help your opponent to play a good cutting sequence. Since your stones below are strong, and the ones above are weak, it may be better to play nearer the weaker stones, one space higher.]
