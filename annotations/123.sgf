[pk:D][pn:E]TR[ph]C[As far as I know, Black's move is not Joseki. The only three basic choices are A, B and C.
B for instance is quite complicated and will often result in a sacrifice to obtain the corner.
C is a trial at getting installed on the upper side.
However A is the simplest and, I think, the more adapted: Black splits white and keeps pressure on the marked white stone which is far enough from the lower right corner to allow a counter-pincer (around D and and later an extension around E).]
;W[nc];B[md];W[mc]C[This looks a bit like the situation where Black is one intersection closer to the right border. However here black is too high to be able to get easily settled on the border and this forces him to play solidly...]
;B[lc]LB[ld:A][od:B]C[... which is not what he does!
Playing at A instead is safer: it protects agains a cut at B, still threatens to seal in white at M17 and to pincer on the right side.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[ld];B[nf];W[kc];B[pk]C[Black finally gets the pincer but White's group has been made very solid and Black's a bit heavy.]
;W[nh];B[le];W[kd];B[lg]C[good direction.];W[nk];B[pn];W[li]
LB[qp:A]C[This move is a bit slack: White does not put pressure on Black's right side group nor on the upper one.
The lower right corner feels weak...
If white plays around A the corner is reinforced, and thus the Black group on the right side comes under attack. White can hope to build territory on the lower side while attacking and will have plenty of time to play moves like the one he actually played.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[jg]LB[pd:1][oc:2][qc:3]C[Does not seem urgent to me. Black can still threaten to link on the right side or to live in the corner (1,2,3...)]
;W[pp];B[qo]C[Black is happy to stabilize his group.];W[no]
C[I think White wants too much: Black's group is almost alive and this move leaves the side open.]
;B[iq]C[good.];W[kq];B[cj];W[rk]C[White is jealous :)];B[qj]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[pm];B[qm];W[ok]C[White only manages to strenghten Black and builds a wall facing nothing.]
;B[pj]LB[pi:A][on:1][nm:2][nn:3]C[This looks heavy.
If Black is really afraid about White playing atari here, then A connects and threatens to cut or to link up.
However if Black likes to fight he can break whites wall and split white with 1,2,3...]
;W[on]C[White is happy to connect, but still gote (loses initiative).]
;B[rh]C[Not necessary: the upper Black group is already out and this one has some free room underneath.]
;W[ip]LB[fq:A][cn:B]C[White is facing a problem: Black has built a huge framework and White only a wall.
But if White uses his wall to take territory (as in the game) Black should come off ahead...
White should use his wall to attack/invade at A or B for instance.]
;B[hp];W[io];B[ho]C[good: Black is more than happy to play this game: White's wall is too close.]
;W[hn];B[gn];W[hq];B[gq];W[hr];B[gr];W[go];B[gp];W[gm];B[fn]
;W[hm]LB[fm:A]C[Too passive: White is still helping Black to make his territory completely sure. White has no choice but to fight (even if it's already late), at A for instance.]

C[good.
Black's lower left is about the same size as White's center.
Black's right side more or less like white upper right.
But Black still has big prospects in the upper left and middle-left.]
;W[fc]C[As White is behind I think that approaching from the other side is better.]
;B[hd]LB[fe:A]C[Why pincer?
There's nothing to build on the top for Black and it will push White in Black's framework.
A seems a better direction.];W[fe];B[df];W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[bb]
;W[hb];B[ic]LB[fk:A][fg:B]C[small.
The center left is bigger, around A and maybe later B];W[ib]
;B[hf];W[fl];B[dm]C[left side got suddenly smaller :(];W[ji]
;B[hi]C[yes! Black has been reduced on the left, so he has to reduce White's center.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[gh];B[gj]LB[hh:A]C[why not simply connect at A?
even if Black manages to take one white stone here the profit will be small and the risk big...]
;W[dj];B[dk];W[ci];B[bi];W[di];B[cg];W[ek];B[ck];W[hh];B[gl]
;W[fj];B[gk];W[fi];B[ff]C[What is this supposed to do? White's stones can't be captured and Black should now take the big points of the endgame.]
;W[ig];B[if];W[jh];B[je];W[dc];B[cd];W[qd]C[because of 111 Black lost the opportunity to be first in this corner :(]
;B[pd];W[oc];B[qe];W[rd];B[oi];W[oh];B[ni];W[rf]C[small and dangerous.]
;B[re];W[se];B[qc]C[good, Black will make up for his loss of initiative by good endgame.]

If White takes B connects if White splits Black connects at K3 and captures.]

;B[of];W[qr];B[kf];W[ss];B[sq];W[kh];C[Black is ahead about 10 points and even if there were some mistakes on both side in the endgame, this is mainly because white did not attack Black on the right but reinforced him, making a wall and then using it to make (not enough) territory. Black built a large scale framework on the left and showed good defense against White's abusive 3-3 invasion. He was a little jealous and lost 4 stones in the center but managed to compensate this in the endgame.
I think Black could get better by playing simpler Go: in the Josekis for instance, but also when reducing the opponent territory, follow the proverb "the rich man (the player ahead in the game) doesn't look for quarrel (doesn't take risks)".]
