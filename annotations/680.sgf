C[Andre: Hi, this is a real-life game I played at a tournament. Due to time constraints I did not record it to the end. It was quite a close game and there are no spetecular killings here, I guess I'm just looking for the epsilon that would have handed the game to me (ok, difficult, because the endgame is not recorded...).


Commentary by Eitan Aharoni, 4-dan.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[pj];W[nc];B[lc];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me];W[nq]
;B[pn]C[E: Seems to me too complacent, B shoult try to develop the forming moyo. If B pincers again, W is now likely to jump to O5. How about O4 tsuke, or even O5 ? (or Takemiya's move P5).]
;W[jp];B[cf]TR[lc][me]CR[cn][fc]C[E: the value of the M17-N15 formation at the moment is not definite : W has M18 to reduce territory if B tries to build the top, for example F17; or N16 to cut and fight. but later in the game, if this formation becomes stronger, B may wish he has played F17. As the options are still open, W has no urgent move there either.  So I would prefer D6 for now. Another way to look at it is that W would prefer C6 to F17 or C14, if it was her move.]
;W[dj]C[Good.];B[fc]LB[bd:a][cc:b][ch:c][bj:d]C[Giving W the choice here is not too good - obviously W prefers the left side, and B would prefer to build the C14 stone rather than the F17 stone. An alternative would be B B16 immediately, making C17 and C12 miai fir settling. C12 is a little cramped, but if B B16 W C17 B C12, W still needs a move in the corner, so B may get B10 slide.]
;W[fd]C[Good direction.];B[gd];W[fe];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec]
;B[eb];W[ed];B[gb];W[ge]C[E: The reluctance to add a move here is understandable, as B's position is still open from the right. but N5 seems to me a little premature. W's moyo is larger scale than B's now, although a little less secure. I'd probably play C6 or even C3 now. See variation for C6.]

(;B[mo]C[Andre: I thought this one is more important that the upper left...

E: Thinking big is good :) converting it to cash is not always simple though. Also, this kind of play requires stronger nerves. There is a good example of a game in the book 'Beauty and the Beast' where a slightly inferior player goes for a gig-moyos game to up the stakes and wait for a mistake of his opponent.]
;W[hd];B[gc];W[lp]C[E: premature. it is not urgent for you, as  W B17-B16 is not sente against you. play it after C14 has lost all potential in the direction of the mid-left side (as in the previous variation).]

TR[mj][io]C[E: a little too solid. Now would be a good time to see how W responds to B C3 (yosu-miru). If D3, you are settled and G10 is not urgent. If B5, go ahead to the center and leave E2 as an option (big one :).
after B g10, W would probably respond to C3 with d3.  How about N10 as a multi-purpose move ? help the running group, build up the moyo, help defend against an invasion.
keep in mind J5 kikashi.];W[pl]C[Good timimg. If this is successful, W takes the lead.]
;B[ok]C[Good direction.];W[ol];B[nl];W[qj];B[qi];W[qk];B[pi]
;W[on];B[oo];W[om];B[nn];W[qn];B[qo];W[rn];B[ri]C[E: S5 more urgent.]
;W[ro];B[qq]C[Andre : Too slack? But S4 invites White R3...

E: S11 is to blame here :) R3 is ok, W still needs to take gote. B Is still in the game, although a little behind, maybe by komi. building the center will decide the game.]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[rj];B[rc]C[E: the center is much more urgent. When you choose your move, take into account what your opponent would like to do if it were his turn, and where are his sente moves.]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[sb]C[This move needlessly justifies B S17. W should play M18 and connect. B H15 cut is a big option.]
;B[gi]C[Good.];W[fg];B[cq]C[The center is bigger. J5 kikashi, then L5.]
;W[dq];B[bo];W[bp];B[cp];W[gh];B[do]TR[jm]C[Andre: I thought it's weird that White didn't continue in the lower left. I think this capture is very big, no?

E: Big, but K7 bigger. W G12 is not needed - B G12 is not sente. W  needs to reduce the center to win. If, say, W K7 B D5 W  ~L11, W is better. so ignoring C4 is ok in itself, but G12 is too slow. Very solid though.

So, I would say D5 is inconsistent - B goes for small solid points after aiming at a large, ambitious moyo.]
;W[ih]C[This move also defends aganst G15 cut. W looks good.]

C[Andre: Maybe that was not such a great one. White manages to reduce all of the potential Black territory quite well afterwards...

E: hmm, consider K11 instead.];W[nm];B[mm]C[I'd play N8 and let the corner fend for itself.]

;W[mp];B[sr];W[sp];B[rs];W[pm]C[I don't understand why this move is needed...]
;B[po];W[si];B[sh];W[sj];B[rh]C[Andre: Even though I think this is not absolutely necessary I felt obliged to play it...

E: hmm, true, many a game were lost because of neglecting these connections... but I think B is so solid all around that he can afford it, say with N9 and j15.]

;W[rl];B[lk];W[kj];B[kk];W[ji];B[jl];W[ln];B[mi]C[Andre: In the end, White reduced the Black area on the right to about 15 points. As an exchange, I captured two stones at L10 and got a little territory on the upper side. White also got B7, which I thought was quite big. And White K7 gave her more points that I thought it would. Thanks in advance for your comments.

W showed a patient game. B played anbitiously, but went for solid profit when it was time to cash in. Good game though, no big tactical mistakes that keep popping up in amateurs' games (that I could find).  Good strategy practice. Keep up the good work ! good luck.
