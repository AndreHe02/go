AB[dd][pd][dp]C[This is a game I played against the computer. I ended up winning, but it would have been a much different story without 3 stones.
One of my worst areas is joseki and opening game attacks. I start doing well by midgame, but normally ive fallen so far behind at
that point its a real chore to even catch up. Any help you can give me in that area is greatly appreciated.


G : Hi, my commentaries start with this "G".
First of all, I don't think your opening was so bad, apart from one weird move (or non move). Please read the comments without thinking about joseki/opening, I'll make a global comment at the end of the game.]
;W[qq];B[op];W[po];B[oq]C[I doubt this is joseki, but it seemed alright, considering I could either run or make a base depending on white

G : surely not joseki. I'll explain why : if white plays around M3 or M4, your two stones are already under attack. White has other options, see variations. White can also (as in the game) leave the situation, and come back later to attack.]

(;W[cj];B[cm]C[G : black should extend from the P3-P4 stones, which are weak.]
;W[jc];B[cg]C[Seemed like a better idea to push towards the C7 stone. advice?

G : no, it's very good. White did not take the trouble to extend, you can attack. Good move.]
;W[ej]
(;B[eg]C[I jumped out from this side to keep the pressure on and to expand my moyo on the upper left. I probably would've been easier going to E7, but I was worried about getting surrounded.

G : E7 would be quite the same move, no? I don't really see which surrounding you are worried about.  If you mean that you are worried tha white comes at F17 or something... then see variation.
But this move is OK. You could move even faster at F13. It is black who is attacking, so at the moment, nothing to worry about.]
;W[gj]
(;B[gg]C[G : you can go faster, your group is safe, while white's is not.]
;W[ij];B[ig];W[jp];B[fq]C[I thought afterward that this was way too defensive. Should I have done another oogama at G3, or tried to push from the other side with L1?

G : It's meant to be defensive, but at the same time the 3-3 point is still open (with ko). Here the weak group is P3-P4, so you should extend from it. At M4 or M3 for example.]
;W[mq]C[Now I'm on the run, but I wasn't terribly worried, as I had plenty of room to run too

G : there's something else than life/death. In this situation, white can make a lot of territory on the right side if he attacks well,  without even thinking about killing black. Just running away is not good enough for black.This situation is bad. The cause is : not extending from these stones before.]
;B[no]C[G : now you must run away, which is never good. If possible, anticipate.]
;W[lo];B[nn]C[G : O7 is OK and faster.];W[mc]C[G : white is nice, he doesn't play Q7. You should use this pportunity, and play there yourself.]
;B[qg]C[It seemed like a better idea to go down this edge, rather than fight over the small chunk white had ahold of. Shoul I have tried for P18 or similar instead?

G : It's better to worry about your P3 group !];W[pb];B[qc]
C[I also considered attacking again, as white seems stretched a little thin, but white had me by the nose at that point

G : you're not forced to answer each move locally. Just leave him, if he does not want to attack your lower stones, and save them.]
;W[om]C[G : now that white played two moves in sente (so basically, free moves) on the upper side, he can come back to attack black.]
;B[mm];W[mk];B[km];W[im];B[kk]C[At this point I was worried, as I thought he could get me with L10, and then I'd have to try at J6/J8.

G : you should be worried.
O8 is also a spot where black would like to play to get out.]
;W[hq];B[lj]C[G : ok];W[jl];B[kl];W[qi]
(;B[pi]C[I cut over rather than under to get another stone to work it could hook up with my line. was this a bad idea?

G : I think that this move is in a bad direction. White is thin on the lower right, so you should be able to go right in there. See variation, and compare with next move.]
;W[qk]C[G : here white has solidified his right side.];B[ni]
;W[fc]
(;B[ec]C[way too defensive I think, in retrospect. should I have split at H17 instad?

G : it's not really that it is too defensive. Rather, you force white to play F16, which makes good shape with K17]
;W[fd];B[fb];W[gb];B[eb];W[rh];B[rg];W[jn];B[ok]C[This seemed premature, but I saw an opportunity to split off the N9 stone, but I knew I had connected out already.

G : it's only one little stone. Capturing it is smaller than endgame moves such as R18, G2, H18, and many other.]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[qh];B[pg];W[gr];B[fr]C[G : Q8 looks interesting.]
;W[fo]
(;B[eo]C[too defensive? P8 instead?

G : P8 is no good. in this area, Q8 is better.
About this E5 move : it's bad because you force white to answer, for example F6, and white makes territory. You could play as in the variations.]

;W[cq]C[I can never respond properly to 3x3 attacks. whats normally the procedure with these?

G : well you killed it but white could have gotten a ko. A sure way to kill is to play like in the variation.]

;W[fn]
(;B[en]C[G : this move is way too small : worth one point. In comparison, H18 is worth at the very least 10 points (see variation for this move)]
;W[gp];B[fl]C[Can't remember what I was trying to accomplish with this.

G : maybe going in. So.. it's better to play F7 or E8.];W[em]

;B[mp]C[G : L2 works, just like H18. And it's way bigger than this move, which is worth nothing. It's just aji-keshi, as you force white to close his territory. You actually lose points with this.]

All in all, I think I did rather well, but my opening game was still awful. I didn't turtle as bad as I normally do, but the computer was still running rings around me. Any advice you could give me would be appreciated.

Thanks.

G : Lower should have been dead anyway, so it's your win ;-)
Now, about opening, joseki and stuff. I hope you won't find this rude, but the only advice I can give you is to not bother too much with opening, and not at all with joseki. At your level, it is way more important to practice fighting in middle game.
I'll explain a bit why.
Mistakes in opening become visible when fighting. If after the opening, you get a worse position than your opponent, it's more difficult to fight. So once you become better at fighting, you'll be able to tell if your position at the end of the opening was bad. And then try to analyse your opening. But until you're 1dan, opening is not so important. especially at 10kyu or weaker, games are usually decided by fighting.

As for joseki : I absolutely forbid you to study joseki for the moment. It will do you no good.

But overall, I don't agree with you : your opening was ot so bad, except for the lower right corner. But you can think of it as a fighting mistake : you let two stones without support.

Here are the advices I can give you : 
- If possible, do not leave weak groups alone. You'll get chased and it is not good.
- In the endgame, don't answer every opponent's move. Try first asking yourself : Is this move dangerous for me? Do I have a move that is even more dangerous for my opponent?
- I think you tend to consider your groups weaker than what they are, and the opponent's stronger than they actually are. For example, you will protect a "weakness" in your group, while not exploiting a similar (or even bigger) weakness in the opopnent's formation. Maybe I'm wrong. But try to think about it. And if it is the case, try to analyze the opponent's and your groups the same way.]
