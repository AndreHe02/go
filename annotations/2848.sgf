C[Hi, and thanks very much for reviewing my game. I played white and lost by 10.5 points. Black gained an early advantage after move 29 and I was unable to turn the game around.]
;B[dc];W[cp];B[qq];W[pd];B[ce];W[jc]C[E3 may have been bigger.

Corner moves are usually bigger than side moves, but I understand why you want to prevent black from getting this point.  It is a big extension for both sides.  I think either move is playable.]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]C[Now black has a moyo on the bottom, but it doesn't work well with the 3-3 stone at R3.   I would play Q4 next.]

(;W[pn]C[This is not a move I would play.  It will be hard for you to take territory on the right side because the R3 stone is low and strong.  I think this move just forces black to finish his moyo on the bottom.]
;B[op];W[pj]C[This looks like too big an extension from the Q6 stone.  Maybe Q9 would be better.]

(;B[pb]C[Not a common way to enter the framework.

The submarine attack. :-)  Pretend that the opponent invaded at 3-3 and pick which direction you would block, and play to get the same side.  See the 3-3 invasion variations to decide which direction is bigger.]
;W[pc]C[I'm not certain this was the best reply...

It should work out OK. just taking the 3-3 point would work, too.]
;B[qb]C[Since the right side is bigger than the top, I think you should block there.]

(;W[ob]C[I think this is the wrong direction.  If black invaded at 3-3 which way would you block?  That is the side you should defend now.]
;B[rd];W[qe];B[re];W[qg];B[rf];W[qh]C[...but the result seemed adequate.

This is OK, but I think the thickness would work better the other direction.  The K17 stone is low, which is good for territory, not a moyo.]
;B[nn];W[gd];B[pl]C[I didn't want to defend because the right was open at both sides. However, this invasion was severe.

When you have weak stones there are three different plans that you can use to defend them.  You can run out into the center of the board, you can live in place, or you can sacrifice the stones.  In this case, living in place looks difficult with so many black stones around, so you can either run or sacrifice.  Since you have invested so much in the thickness on the Q and R lines, I think this gives you a perfect chance to use it, either by running or sacrifice. R8 (the game move) would lead to a sacrifice, but build up your center, while P7 would escape.  See the variations for possible plays.  Personally, I would sacrifice the stone to extend my area in the center.]

(;W[ql];B[qk];W[pk];B[qm]
(;W[pm]C[I think this is a mistake.  you are just making blacks area bigger while reducing yours. whether you plan to sacrifie the Q6 stones or to escape with them there are better ways to do it.  See the variations.]
;B[ol];W[rl];B[rm];W[rk];B[qo];W[om]C[The empty triangle is bad shape, and it will be a difficult fight to escape now.  better to just threaten to escape with something like O10 and expand your area.]
;B[nl];W[mm]C[I reconsidered trying to push and cut.

This is a huge loss for white.  You have invested a lot of stones and given black territory in return for the thickness on the Q and R lines.  Letting black have a strong position around O8 negates a large part of that thickness.  That is the problem with changing plans like this. You have played two moves (Q7, P7) that are of no use to you, while all of blacks moves are profitable.  Once you played Q7 I think you were commited to the push and cut, whether it works or not.]

;B[lj];W[pr];B[im];W[ke];B[ch]C[This looks like good time to take stock and see where you stand.  Black has about 17 in the upper left, , and maybe 8 in the upper right, around 10 in the bottom center, and maybe 15-20 in the lower right, for a total of 50-55.  You have about 15 in the lower left, maybe 35 in the upper center, and hopefully something on the bottom, for a total of about 50, so the game is very close right now.  The thing that looks urgent to me is the white group at the bottom, which looks VERY weak to me.  if black C12 had been at L2 or R2 I think the game would have been over, but white still has a chance.  I would play R2 followed by L2 to try to make some shape here.  Doing something to strengthen the bottom group is URGENT.]

(;W[cj];B[cl];W[dk]C[Possibly an overplay.];B[dl];W[el];B[em]

(;W[fh]C[Could I have gotten away with D7?

Probably not. See the variation.  Since D7 doesn't work, D9 was probably a mistake.

At this point, I am still worried about the O3 group.  It doesn't really have much eye space and is surrounded.  Even if it lives, black will get so much profit attacking it the game will be over.]

;B[dm];W[qr]C[Not big enough?

See the previous comments.  I think this has been the biggest move for quite a while.]

;B[fr]C[Exchange helped Black.

Yes.  Gives black the monkey jump, and white doesn't get anything.]

(;W[bi];B[hb];W[ag];B[bf]C[Fair trade?

I don't know.  It is OK if black responds here, but what happens if black takes the H19 stone instead?   You will take away maybe 10 points on the left, but I think black can take away 15-20 on the top.

I think the key point in this game was how the invasion at move 29 was handled.  Remeber the three ways to defend your stones (run away, live in place, or sacrifice) and once you have made a plan, stick to it rather than changing plans after you are commited.]

The point difference seem the same, but black has more potential in the game sequence than here.  I wouldn't personally play this way, but I can not prove that it is inferior to the game by more than a point or two.]
