;B[dp]C[This is my first proper game, I learnt the moves in April this year.  As a general comment I found that somehow I lost a very large moyo centred in the bottom LHC which extended to cover a huge area. Much of the rest of the game was just tactical positioning, gaining and losing the odd point here and there.

I feel that my opponent was very under - rated. He has won 4 /4, beating a 17kyu man..but then perhaps just sour grapes on my part]
;W[pd]C[RW> Hello Peter, my name is Ronald Wopereis, aka woepwoep. Currently I am 13k on KGS. I will be glad to review the game. I will precede my comments  with RW>]

;B[qp];W[po];B[ro];W[rn];B[rq];W[so];B[sp]C[I do play Chess and thought that a capture was too good to miss! I am aware that the aim is to amass territory but...

RW> Do not worry. Black should have played S4 instead of T4. So there's no lost move here for white, only the missed chance of gaining profit from black's mistake.]
;W[rp]C[RW> This white move is not bad, it's just not efficient. You have to understand that white is by no means behind in score, so whatever white's moves were, they can't be bad. Not efficient means that there is a shorter route towards winning the game than the current one. Go is about playing efficient.]
;B[qf]C[.. and now another free gift! Perhaps here i should have responded to kakari at r14]
;W[sq]C[RW> yes, playing on the first line , the line of death , is inefficient, unless your opponent does so. In this case, he gets a free move, which is the next move of R16. This is the first of three free moves you give away to black, and that is the reason why black will take the lead further on in the game. A free move is like a white pass, it does not require black to answer.]
;B[qd]
(;W[nd]C[RW> With this move you give away the corner. See var.]
;B[pi];W[qk];B[qj];W[rj]C[In hindsight, i can now already see the winning black moyo beginning to take shape]
;B[jp];W[pj];B[qi]C[RW> white needs two moves S10 and Q10 to attack one black stone R10, while black needs only one defensive move R11. This is the seconds of three free moves white gives to black.]
;W[pk]C[RW> White even needs a third move Q9 to protect O10. These three free moves are like white passes. Black gets to seal off a great deal of territory.]
;B[ri];W[rk];B[pe];W[pc];B[np]C[RW> this is an excellent move for black. He is now in the lead, and should no longer attack, only defend.]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[jc]C[RW> great move for white.];B[cm]C[RW> black responds with an equal great move.]

(;W[cq]C[i was beginning to worry that B was contriolling a lot of sopace, hence the 3,3 invasion, aimed at just getting a couple of eyes, but more importantly, occuping points in 'his' area

RW> in go you should always try to keep the initiative. in this case, white could play s2 first. then black must respond, or lose the entire corner including the r3 group. and after this move, you can still play the 3,3 invasion. See var.]

;B[bn];W[ao];B[aq]C[Could not see the point of a3, just another sacrifice..or a mistake

RW> it is the heart of this shape, so it is only natural to play there.  Also, upon black's next move , either c1 or a6 , white MUST respond with b3 or loose the corner. So it is meant to be two future ko threats.]
;W[ar];B[ni]
(;W[pm]C[RW> this is too timid. white is behind in points, and since all white groups are alive, it is time for attack. first of all, look for weak black groups. See var.]
;B[nm];W[op];B[gf]C[The winning shape is now already virtually in place..but i am 2 stones up :-(]

(;W[je]C[RW> in this case, there is no connection between groups of either size. You are behind in points, so you should play offensive. see var.]

(;W[he]C[i recognized that my upper territory was weak, and though i secured space, it was at the loss of some territory

My estimate was that i was about 35 points down, with no way back]
;C[Result: B+Resign

RW> i think you played a wonderful game. i would not think you are only 30k. well done.

The lessons from this game are :
(1) keep your groups alive and connected where possible. This you do excellent.
(2) avoid playing on the first line, the line of death. This is often worse than passing.  Try to play efficiently.
(3) attack when you are behind. When you are behind in points, forget about lesson number one. Draw imaginary lines between enemy groups, and try to disconnect them. This way you will play "light".
(4) when you attack, try to have friendly groups nearby. The 3-3 invasion may look like a winner, but it helps black to build influence (a huge black wall facing the center). Then you win 10 points and lose the game.

I hope you enjoyed the review as much as i enjoyed reviewing. i think the game has 25k+ strategy in it. Best regards, Ron.]
