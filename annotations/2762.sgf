C[Hello reviewer,

I'm Bill, "zinger" on KGS.  I played black in this game and felt like I had a good game out of the opening.  However, I misplayed the middlegame, particularly (I think) in the way I handled the top right corner and the center attack, including a couple of rather sad reading errors.  Even so the game was close enough that I lost by only 6, and perhaps could have won with a better yose.

I'm looking for ideas on improvements in any area of the game which you think might have helped win it.

Thanks for the help!

Bill

Hi!

An interesting game :) Black got an early advantage, but, as you said, misplayed the attack(s).  May be if you see a chance to attack you should ask yourself the following two questions?!

1. How can I profit from the attack? This should be known beforehand. If you can't kill and can't make profit while attacking, you shouldn't attack at all, or, see 2.

2. How can I prepare the attack? Are there some forcing moves that gives me stronger positions?

And yes, there were some serious reading errors. I recommend to do a lot life and death / tesuji problems; that would stabilize  your game a lot.

Sorry for the late review, & best wishies for your future games!

[co:C][bp:D][cp:B]C[Since the three white stones in the lower right are weak, Black shouldn't attach?! I think  A is better. May be Black can live in the corner with B B, W C, B D, after which White adds a move around there and Black can play at the top (E).]

;W[ce];B[jc];W[mc]LB[ii:A][oi:B]C[Way to hard. White should jump to A or help his centre stones with a move like B.]
;B[me]LB[gc:A][ii:B]C[I can't see the point of this move. How about simply extending to A instead? Attacking in the center first (B) and deciding about the top later looks also interesting.]
