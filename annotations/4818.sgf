C[Hi, thx for reviewing my game, i was playing white.
The result it was W + 11,5, but in the start of the yose the game was very close.

D: Hello, my name is Darek and my EGF rank is 1k. I want to say you played good game which wasn't easy to review for me :)]

(;W[cn]C[I played this move to not let he make moyo on the right side, and i hade this in mind when played f3, but i am not so sure if this is good.

D: Of course it's playable move specially along Korean-style players, but simple jumping to san-san would be not worse (I can't say if better).]
;B[cq];W[ck]TR[eo]C[D: I would play E5 in the name of the proverb: 'If your opponent whilst any joseki chose X looking between X and Y moves, probably Y is the best your reply then''.]
;B[kq];W[fo];B[dn];W[dm]C[D: In such situations where an opponent attacks one group in order to strengthen yourself and attack second one then, you should set attacked group so quckly and honestly as possible. So I prefer more solid move at C7 instead of actually played one.]
;B[co];W[en];B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pm];W[nq];B[mq];W[mp]
C[D: I would simply play at O4 because don't like remained cross-cut prospect at O4 which may be helpful for black in case of your further attack on L3 or R6 group. 
Also black move at O2 is less uncomfortable after white O4 than N4.]
;B[lp];W[qk]C[D: R8 looks for little stronger attack on the black group because of the connection possibility on the second line. Anyway atari at N2 looks more important now instead of playing on the right side.]
;B[np];W[mo];B[oq];W[nr];B[lo];W[mn];B[mr];W[or];B[ok]C[D: Well played sequence, I didn't see better one.]
;W[oo];B[on];W[no];B[ql]
(;W[qh]C[i think that a move around k17 was better

D: The first D5 since it makes strong shape for you and black rather must answer there.]
;B[jd];W[do]C[D: Very well, it's almost sure sente for you, moreover black's connection at D5 instead of your capture would be sente as well because of unpleasant cutting point at E7.]
;B[bo]
(;W[lc];B[jc]
(;W[le];B[qe]
(;W[pe]C[i thought that a move in q14 was better, but then he will play in r17, and try to make a live group, is q14 better? or another move

D: I would be afraid to play Q14, cutting at Q15 is strong.]

(;B[qf];W[qd];B[ph]
(;W[qg]TR[pg]C[D: I prefer Q13 instead of R13.];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[oe]C[D: Painful];W[ng]C[D: I would play solid connection at P13 instead of O13 because peep at P13 can be troublesome.]

(;W[od]C[now i started a exchange, and i dont have sure that it was a good exchange.]
;B[rd]
(;W[pe];B[qc];W[pd];B[qb]
(;W[of]C[give up the corner to connect my weak group, and then, atack the group in the right side when make some moyo. This it was a good exchange?

D: This atari makes white stones strong so can't be bad but lost corner isn't small too.]
;B[pb];W[ne];B[ch]C[D: Black at the moment has more points than white having two very strong but making not many points groups.]
;W[mk]C[now i started my atack.
D: The most important now is to make an invasion around F16.]
;B[rk];W[qj];B[rj];W[rm]C[D: Too aggressive or too early.]

;B[nb];W[lb];B[gf];W[ig];B[hf];W[if];B[fi];W[ij];B[mi]C[here my opponnent started a sequence of overplay's, what changed my moyo into territory.]

;W[li];B[ih];W[hh];B[mh];W[mj]C[this it was very bad. O12 is the right move, eliminating the aji.

D: Yep, but it isn't easy to see, mainly during a game.];B[pi]
C[and this peep show why o12 was better.];W[qi]C[i had to sicrifice this two stones. But for my luck, he missed the other peep at P12

D: P12 doesn't work.]
(;B[gh];W[hi];B[hn];W[oh]C[D: L7 should be played instead of.]

D: I'm not sure.];B[gp]C[This it was not good, and i think that the sequence is more good for black.]
