AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, my name is Jason and I played black in this game.  I wanted to have somone review it because I'm still rather new and this was a very close game.  I know that my mistake at move 197 totally lost the game for me, but even when I went through that sequence on my own I came still came out .5 behind.  I know that I have a problem not finishing what I start and leaving cut points, but I can't help but feel that there is something else I'm missing.  Many many thanks in advance for any insight you could give me.  I'll mark all my comments with  J:

Thanks again];W[dd];B[pp];W[cf];B[jq];W[qf];B[pg]LB[nd:C][pj:A]
[qj:B]C[J:I thought about playing this move at Q14 or Q15 instead, but I wanted something that would keep him small and in the top corner.  Was there a better way to do this?

The idea is correct.  You want to make it hard for white to make a base.  I think a simple move like A or B would have worked.  

Although I'm a bit worried about the top being attacked by a follow up from white at O17 so in reality I might play C first and then something like A or B later.]

;B[dl]LB[pd:F][pg:E][dk:1][el:2][cn:A][qn:D][gq:B][nq:C]C[Let's evaluate the board.  

Ignoring the stone just placed, I'd say white can invade areas A - D with the best invasion at A since there is white support above it.  
Also group F is in big trouble and is almost certainly dead.  

So I'd say protecting here is good, but you can do better and attack white at the same time.  

1 threatens with a follow up move into C12.

2 takes your idea and makes it more effective since a 1 point extension is sill very secure.]
;W[ej];B[om];W[fl]C[This is a good move by white.  There is a wall and white is now pushing into your territory.  This will be big later on.]
;B[ek]C[This might be a pointless move since you won't cut white.

See sequence.]
(;W[fj]C[This was a silly move on white's part.

White should have played F9 (see variation)];B[fk];W[gk];B[gl]
C[J: Here I was attempting to keep him from getting into the bottom area, as you'll see it didn't work out very well, he was able to push very far into the bottom and divide my left and right sides.  Some of the moves in the sequence didn't feel right, but i couldn't think of anything better]

(;B[im]C[J: would this move have been better at H6, or was I right to go for the life of the shape before attacking?

H6 would have worked.  See variation.];W[km];B[fn]C[J: Looking back it seems like H6 is where I should have attacked.  Am I right or would that been even worse?]

I think this was a better move.];W[ms]C[White is making a wall which is good.  It is a very solid wall that is creating a sphere of influence.]

You could play at B using the black group on the side as leverage.  I'll try to illustrate a rough example - it's not worked out with all possibilities (just 2) (See variation)]

(;B[cd]C[J: This is an area I'm really having problems with.  I know that are enough liberties there to mount at least a decent invasion from, but I just don't understand exactly what to do when I'm there, so I end up fumbling around like I'm lost in a dark room.  Usually, this time being no excepting, it ends badly for me.

It involves reading ahead.  Try this site to get good at life and death problems:

With this example you probably want to get a hold of the corner so C18 would have been better.

;B[bq]C[J: As you can see I'm also having problems countering the 3-3 invasion.  Would connecting at E3 been the better move?

I think this move creates many cutting points.  The 3-3 invasion cannot be killed unless white makes a silly move.  I think playing at E1 would have been better.  Then white would have played at B4 and you could play at B5.]

At this point you'd be able to play at either a7 or b4 since both would accomplish the same goal (to save the black b3b5 group.  However white shouldn't have been able to make that snapback move and white should have been dead (see earlier comment)]
