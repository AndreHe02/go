C[Game submitted by Mimulus (black) and reviewed by  "Niall" (6k* igs).

M: Hello.  Thanks, first of all, for your time.  This was a close game i just lost as black.  Any input you have as to how i could have played better will be very appreciated.  The group i lost in the middle of the board and the struggle at the top are areas where i probably especially need enlightening.  Also, in the endgame I seemed to be struggling for sente.  Was I missing many important plays there?

N: See my comments further on. Overall I would say that you played well most of the time, but getting into the centre  fight was unnecessary - you were clearly ahead. ;B[dp]
;W[pd];B[de];W[pp];B[dc];W[jc];B[jp];W[ck];B[ci];W[cn];B[cp]
C[M: is this okay?  maybe f3 or f4 would be more correct?  i thought i could enclose the corner this way and push w out into center.  And i didn't think i had the right set up to play c5.

N: looks fine to me. F3 or F4 make it very easy for W to settle  his stones with B4. C5 would also be possible - hard to say whether  it's better than C4.]
;W[en];B[fq]C[N: While a very useful move, F3 has little attacking value. I would have played something like E10 or D7.]
;W[pj]C[N: Since B's last move didn't attack the W C6 group, W can afford to take time out to make this - very big - play. It also helps those stones by giving them a friend to run out to.]
;B[qn]C[N: playable, but I would prefer O3.];W[qo];B[pn];W[nq]
;B[qk]C[N: I would prefer Q8. Slightly less good claim on territory, but more access to the centre - still thinking about attacking the C6 group later.]
;W[qj];B[nn];W[nj];B[nc];W[nd];B[qc]C[M: i often feel lost when my approaches are attached to.  this seemed safest.  would n16 work?

N: Either is possible. My own inclination would be to play N16 first, ready to dive into the corner if need be (e.g. B N16, W O15, BQ17)]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[od];B[mc];W[md];B[rc];W[rd];B[hc]
C[N: Big, but I think you have to play M17 first.];W[lc];B[mb]
;W[lb];B[ej]C[M: i read and read that corner and it looked like i could leave it and live so i played elsewhere.  dangerous?

N: Well, it looks to me as if the corner can live but you have to let W take the 3 N18 stones in sente ... not a wonderful result. See the variations. That is why  I said that you had to play M17 first. In this position my instinct would be to play T16. If W answers, you've made yourself secure in sente; if not you have a way to reduce his largest territory substantially.]

(;W[bj];B[bi];W[el]C[N: Hard to attack the W stones now - but you have managed to expand your TL territory in sente.]
;B[jj]C[N: apart from the continuing concerns in the TR, a move somewhere central is right, save that you might want to play B5 first. Exactly where is difficult to say. I think my preference would be G5, J15, or N11. But this is playable.]
;W[jn];B[go];W[gm];B[le]C[M: i was worried about w getting too much in the UR so this was where i decided to hit.

N: I don't like it. To me you should cut directly at M16, now that you have the K10 stone. Or maybe N11 or P11 first.]
;W[je];B[kg];W[ig]
(;B[if]C[N: Now SURELY you must cut at M16. The W stones  should live, but in their struggle they'll either strengthen your TL territory or weaken the  W TR group. See the  variation for an example.]

(;W[ie];B[hf];W[he];B[jf];W[ge];B[fc]C[N: W has kindly allowed you to wall off his  centre stone. See the variation for a suggestion how he might have played.]
;W[jl]C[N: That W move doesn't serve much useful purpose. I would much prefer either M16 to settle the situation, or somewhere round G10.]
;B[nh]C[N: Good];W[ph];B[pk]C[N: Difficult to judge here, but I would be inclined to play further out, perhaps first M3 and then N8.]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[nl];B[nm]
(;W[ml]C[N: W missed a chance here (see variation) to take a lot of territory.]
;B[rk];W[rj];B[rn]C[N: Good. Once you've  committed yourself to living on the spot, make sure of it.]
;W[ro];B[oi];W[oj];B[pi];W[qi];B[me];W[of];B[ld]C[N: Finally!]
;W[kd];B[gf];W[gj];B[fk];W[gk];B[fl];W[fm];B[gl]
(;W[ik]C[N: Since W has D10, I  don't see why he doesn't block at H8. See variation.]
;B[hl];W[ij];B[il];W[kl];B[ji];W[ii]C[N: As W I would have played K9.]

(;B[jk]C[M: this seemed to be my big mistake.  wanted to kill those stones too badly, i think.  connecting at k12 and letting white live is what i wish i had done now.  are my three stones doomed no matter what now?

N: Difficult to say. In the variation I give my "preferred" sequence, which as you'll see ends up with B losing the  central stones but taking away a lot of W's upper right area - but there are LOTS of variations. It's the sort of fight I often find myself getting into, and usually regret starting ... :-(]

(;B[ki]C[M: maybe m10 here instead?

(;B[gd]C[M: could i have killed the whole group with g18 here?  I was worried about my groups' safety especially the cut at f14  

N: I think you could. See the variation.];W[gb];B[kc];W[ja]
;B[lq];W[mr];B[lr];W[ln];B[fi]C[N: Good (I don't  understand W M6).]
;W[bp];B[bq];W[bo];B[dm]C[M: f18 was on my conscience but this looked promising  

N: Indeed! But now you  have sente, I would start with the double sente points such as T5. Or if you want to be really agressive, try invading that corner, say at R2.]
