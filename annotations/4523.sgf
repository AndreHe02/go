C[hi~

I played so badly in the opening at the top right : (
How should I play? Black seems to have  too much territories on the right and bottom, after he played 19.
And, how can I prevent that happen?

Moreover, is white 12 be played too early? (Thats what I think after reviewing myself : P ). Or is it a poor move?

Finally, would u mind to tell me which aspects are the weakest for me that I have to improve
first?

Thank you very much for spending time to make this review~
I always think it is a hard work to do : )

djna: comments prefixed like this

Overall I think W did pretty nicely in the late middle game, partly because B yieldded sente at a couple of key moments. There were a couple of crucial reading errors by W, moves 24 and 68. I recommend practicing the various problem books - tesuji and tsume go. The 3-3 invasion in the bottom right is a common pattern worth studying. 

B just made a couple of bad decisions about what he thoiught were forcing moves. Very important to not assume that threats to capture will be answered. First reaction to any move should always be "do I need to answer" so always look to play elsewhere. Also B tended to play a lot of nthird-line moves at the start - perhaps deliberately palying a different style might be a good experiment.

djna: small move - takes little territory and doesn't really make a good framwork - can't complete a large territory with one more move - C3 is more usual]
;W[eq]C[
djna: this is an unusual move, more usual is to play C3, it's big and leave w completely sold

It's not clear to me what happens if B answers at D3 the danger is that W's single stone turns into a large heavy group]

djna: B concedes a lot of territory];W[dq];B[fq];W[cq];B[mq]
C[
djna: talking territory on the third line is comparatively slow, the corner is still invadable
W has a large, stable corner and sente. So I think W is happy]
;W[jc];B[qm]LB[eq:B][qq:A]C[
djna: this does not take the corner R5 is better



Here is where you feel that B has had a better opening. My feeling is that the game is more or less even. 

First the corner can be invaded a A
Second B has many stones on the third line so he has few opportunities for expansion
Third White has sente

The only move by W that I would change is B]

[ol]C[
djna: At first sight this little sequence seems like a decent idea - I assume that the plan was to attack the three black stones above and hence reduce the Black territory

To my surprise B seems to find a very effective, if unusual counter

So with the benefit of foresight, let's look at alternatives.

First note that B is really very strong in the bottom right, lots of stones on the third line, so if  B can get pressure on W he could build a very large territory by attacking: imagine B just chasing W by playing along the marked squares.

Second note that the corner is currently still opn to a 3-3 invasion, but one more move there will give B a solid25 points. Also move *near* the corner, say at  1 or 2 make it *much* harder to live in the corner and if W starts fighting where he played then a B move at 2 could easily happen asa by product.

I see an alternative approach discussed in the variations

If you do decide to play in the viciity of Q9, then A, B or C are more usual. In this case I think C is probably best]

(;B[ok]C[
djna: in general don't play contact moves when you are strong and your opponent is weak

BUT it does seem very hard to find a good answer]
(;W[qi]LB[pj:A]C[
djna: often contact plays are correct. The end result here is not good .

The "obvious" response is A, and I can't see any good W follow up.

It's really important to take time to consider these tricky positions,  W should have at least examined one possible B response if he did, but missed A as a possibility that's OK - we all make reading errors, if no responses were analysed then this is very bad

In general it's possible to spend too much time worrying, but this was a crucial part of the game]
;B[pj];W[ph];B[oh];W[og]C[
djna: now W's position here is in tatters];B[qh];W[of];B[pg]
C[
djna: difficult to image a worse result

it's not just the territory, it's also the thinkness B has gained]
;W[re]LB[dj:A]C[

djna: the big picture now : B has huge thickness towards the centre need to stop a massive moyo developing

Something like A is needed B should ignore this move];B[pe]
;W[od];B[fc]LB[je:C][cf:B][dm:A]C[
djna: Black should play A to start building the moyo, he's happy to conceded the top to W,  his own right is bigger and he always has moves near C to keep it under control

Otherwise just play B any normal division of territory suits Black]
;W[ec]C[
djna: yes. W must attack];B[cc]C[
djna: unusual! Effectively says "oh I wish I'd invaded the corner!"]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[eb]C[
djna: good, B is in trouble here];B[ed]
(;W[db];B[bc];W[bd];B[fb];W[cb];B[fd]LB[ge:A][gf:B]C[

djna: B might do better to play a light move such as A or B being prepared to sacrifice one or two stones for tha sake of making a light group]
;W[df]LB[fc:A][dj:C][qq:B]C[
djna: W is happy, B has just given W territory and a target.

This kind of result is why the original move at A was bad

By my estimate, assuming either a W invasion at A or building a large territory on the side with C W is has now got the game back to even]
;B[ic];W[jd]C[
djna: more solid terrtiory for W];B[id];W[hc]LB[ff:A][dj:B]
C[
djna: very bad move by W - unless he has read out all the alternatives.

The general principle is :

1). Enclose, 2). Placement

We play moves like this once B is enclosed and we want to destroy his eye shape, the only exception is if we gain some tactical benefit such as destroying his shape by playing a key point


A is probably better, if black lives then B becaomes very big]
;B[hb];W[ie];B[hd];W[he]C[

djna: nice idea but unless B needs to answer it's not good]
;B[ge]LB[dj:B][em:A]C[
djna: I don't think this is needed 

A or B possible];W[hg]LB[dj:A]C[
djna: building territory in the centre while one side is open.

How about  A];B[cj]C[

djna: very deep in W's areas of influence];W[dl]LB[ch:A]C[
djna: usually either capping or taking eye space on third line is better, this move doesn't really threaten]
;B[ch]C[
djna: better just to run a away];W[di];B[ci];W[dh];B[dj]LB[dh:A]
[di:B][ej:1]C[
important to have a strategic intention. What was W trying to doby playing A and B, confine Black to the side? Confining groups and making them live small is a good plan

so unless W plays 1 now It makes something of a nonsense of A and B
