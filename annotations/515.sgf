LB[rj:a]C[FS: Better on  a (S10) ?

FHÜ: I prefer S10 in this situation, but I would say this is
more a question of taste.];W[qi];B[po]LB[nk:a]C[FS: "Normal" is a move at a (O9), but I wanted to try something
else

FHÜ: I do not know much bookmoves, but I think O9 is more common
when you have a stone on Q4 or a stronger position on the lower
right side.
Q5 is OK, it leaves the weak point on R8, but black is strong
in this area to fight back.];W[dj]
(;B[dn]C[FS: Also here I wanted to try something else as the low kakari
(C6). Maybe the variation starting with a (F4) is better ?

FHÜ: The problem of both variations is that they gives white
secure territory but the black groups have no base.  If you like to test something try C8 the next time.]
;W[fp];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[bq];B[cl];W[bk];B[fn]LB[el:a]C[FS: Ikken-tobi on a (E8) better ?

FHÜ: ? dont think so];W[ho];B[lq];W[jr]C[FS: Big but gote. Better continue attack on black left group
?

FHÜ: Yes its not urgent, but M3 was also only big.];B[fe]C[FS: I found this a nice move. Reduces white and makes invasion
upper side more difficult.

FHÜ: A very nice point but also not essential.  I think the most important thing is to attack the weak white
group (for example O13) or to protect the weak black group.]
;W[lc]C[FS: Good point of invasion ? What would you suggest as alternative
?

FHÜ: Normally its a good point, but in relation to the weak white
group it looks more like an overplay.  I mean the serious way for white to play is a move like N13.
If black protects at M16, white can invade at R17 or R8.];B[nc]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[ib]C[FS: This can't be the good continuation (seeing the result),
but what is ?

FHÜ: There is also an other way to play. (see variation)]
(;B[kc];W[jb];B[kd];W[hc];B[id];W[gc];B[fd]LB[gd:a]C[FS: Good shape, or better a (G16) ?

FHÜ: OK];W[fb];B[eb];W[gb];B[dc];W[cc];B[kb]C[FS: Here I could suppres my inclination to try killing the white
group.];W[ha];B[cb];W[bc]C[FHÜ: Also this result is alright for black. He gets thickness
in the centre; reduces whites corner and gets secure territory.
The only question is; can black use his thickness?];B[mp]LB[pm:b]
[nk:a]C[FS: Better on a (O9) or b (Q7) ?

FHÜ: This move is really very slow. You have to attack the white
group now (S10 or O10, O9 is ok too) to use the thickness on
the top.];W[qm]C[FS: Seems too deep.


FHÜ: It looks impossible to live with both groups.];B[qn]C[FHÜ: simply P7?]
;W[pm];B[nk];W[nm];B[lm];W[no];B[mo]C[FHÜ: N7 blocks both ways]
;W[oo];B[pp];W[pn];B[qo]C[FHÜ: there is a way to connect with ko starting with P9]

(;W[ml];B[mk]C[FHÜ: L9 looks correct but its difficult. Black should turn the
white group to his thick wall. If white brakes out to the left,
the black group on the left side can come in double.];W[ll]
;B[km];W[mh];B[lj];W[kk];B[lh];W[ni]LB[lg:b][ok:a]C[FS: Aiming at the cut at a (P9), but ends in gote. Better b (M13).]
;B[nl];W[mm];B[mg];W[li];B[ki];W[mi];B[kj];W[jk];B[lg];W[ln]
;B[oh]C[FS: Is there a better way to harras this group ?

FHÜ: I think P13 looks better. Its a difficult live and death
problem, but now white can live with Q10.]
(;W[ph];B[ng];W[pj];B[qk];W[oj];B[ol]TR[pn][pm][qm]MA[lm][km]
C[FS: Gives black the opportunity to cut of the marked white stones
or save the marked black ones.];W[re];B[rd];W[rf]C[FS: no atari !

FHÜ: A philosophical question]
(;B[ck]C[FS: Time to strenghten the last weak black group and win the
game..


FHÜ: Is the white group alive?];W[cj];B[bl];W[bj];B[ek];W[fi]
;B[eg];W[dh]C[FS: Black is about ten points ahead, but thanks to his very poor
endgame, won by just 1 point.

FHÜ: perfect :-)])
