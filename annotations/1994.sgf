(;W[mj]LB[ic:A]C[So now black has 4th line territory and is allowed to make a base for his group on the top  by playing at A, which makes whites wall somewhat ineffective.

It is better for white to attack around A I think.];B[fc]C[My partner says B13 better J17

Indeed];W[ec]C[My partner says W14 better J16 or K16

He's right.
now black can stabilize his top side group.];B[fd];W[df];B[jd]
;W[qc]TR[cj][jp][nq]C[My partner says may be better W18 at Q18,
because invasion to 3-3 makes weak 6-12

Hm, it is difficult to decide.
I would prefer playing elsewhere first.
There are still a lot of big points
if white can invade blacks top group later, white would like to save O17-O15-...
if the black top group gets strong, O17-O15 is not so important any more and white can take the corner ?

I would play on a triangle];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re]
C[May black close white in the corner in sente?

Closing off zhite at s14 is dangerous due to O17-O15
still, s13 is a big more

i added some variations]

this move is a bit strange
black can ignore it locally and play A
or black can make his top group solid territory.];B[he];W[fk]
C[
this move does not work as black can just run into the big gap between D6 and F9]

because white has C7.
But my partner thinks it's not so bad for me :)
Black 25-27-29 is light, and black has E6...

A is better.  extending solidly makes life too and eliminates the cut at c7
I think black is not bad then];W[gp]

connecting at f4 is obligatory

so bad, because white 6-12 are weak,

Still, it is very difficult for black to attack these four white stones.  they are reasonably light, and capturing them all seems imposible.]

;B[nb];W[ld]TR[kg][lh]C[
Perhaps white should first play some more light moves to see what black will do.  
e.g. the triangled points seem good.
it is not easy for black to capture more than part of these stones.]

C[My friend said W90 is mistake, because black
has now cutting N13. W90 was better at M13.
But I didnt see this :(((
I thougt black ten points behind white :(
but my friend see cutting N13...

N13 is not so terrible.  As the variations show, white can give up some stones.]

(;B[cc]C[May be better B91 at B14...
My friend think so (and N13 :))

c17 seems ok.
b14 is ok too];W[bg]C[Ohhh! It is begining of my end :(((]

the variation tries to avoid that];W[bf]
