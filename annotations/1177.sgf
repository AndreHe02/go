C[Dear Reviewer,

This
was a game I played against a stronger opponent (I'm 20k*, he's 17k*) on
IGS.  I think I did quite well, losing only by 5.5 points (he was white,
and had only 0.5 komi, so in a regular 5.5 komi game, I would have lost by
10.5, but still, reasonably close for a game at this level).  However, as
a game that didn't have any major obvious (to me) blunders on either side,
it seems like a good candidate for review.   I'm mostly looking for general
advice on how to improve my style and analysis of my weak points.  My only
specific question is how I could have better used the thickness that I built
at the top of the board early on.  I tried to build a huge moyo, but it didn't
get as much territory as I was hoping.];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp]
;B[oq]C[The wedge is viewed as nessecary to reduce the effectiveness of the black shamari.  One must be careful though of following advise like this blindly.  if you don't know how to correctly follow up the first moves, though correct, are meaningless.  White ignoring it can be to his detriment, but its NOT nessecarily bad.  I think you get a taste of this in this game.]
;W[nd]
(;B[pj]C[Q10 is a great point (I tend toward R10 in forming territory low this mayeb incorrect but its working for me) but you must weigh it against whites O16 follow up move.  I think here letting white get the double pincer attack reduces the effectiveness of the Q16 Q10 combo.  Also depending on how things go could also make white very strong (thick) in the area below Q16 which reduces the effectiveness of the Q10 shimari combo.  I feel playign out the first part of this joseki (see variations) is a good way to stay away from trouble at your level.  The double pincer is a strong attack and I feel it requires a fairly good understanding of joseki to allow this to happen to you so you don't lose too much in the exchange.]
;W[qf];B[oe]C[This group is now fairly weak and your now fighting with group of whites groups.  Your general idea should be to keep them both weak so that your group isn't caught between two stronger white groups.  The weakness here is R17.  Though not really feasible for white to take it at this point (note: it would be if O16 was O17) allowing white to it will allow him to live in the corner.]
;W[qd]
(;B[pc]C[this gives up R17 and white is living here.  Now black is wedged between a weak and a strong white group.  Q17 is too forgiving and is heavy (ie your increasing the value of capturing the black stones for white but not making very much eye space for them).  This is the fight you asked for and you have to fight it or white gains while making you weak, doubly bad.]
;W[qc]C[Very alive here.]
(;B[nc];W[mc]
(;B[nb]C[You need to use whites weaknesses before they are gone (cut at N16).  If this doesn't happen them black will face two strong white groups.  see variation]
;W[ld]C[Here white is doing very well.  He had made big life in what was blacks corner as well as making the beginnings of a loose moyo on the upper side.  Blacks stones are heavy are barely making enough space for an eye.  The reason for this is allowing white to get strong on both sides of blacks corner group by not following through on the attack black called upon himself (ie playing Q10).  By ignoring O16 you invite white in at R14 and so one must be prepared to fight it out so as to gain something.  This is what I mean when I say understand the follow through of your choices.]
;B[me];W[md]C[O16 is important in keeping whites shape strong and blacks weak.  Giving away O16 allows you to make life for sure.  Also white still has the threat of O15.  Beyond any of this I feel that while making white heavy here it also strengthens whites group and does nothing really for blacks group.  So you make white stronger while leaving yourself weak still.  I think you either run away with P13 or if your really into a fight pincer white at k16 or J16]
;B[gc];W[ic]C[Sorry to harp so much but I think this is also bad here.  Whites upper center has basically made life now and black has two weak groups on either side.  White need only play Q12 and black has to scrable to make eyes or run away into the center.  tend to your weak groups before creating more of them.]
;B[ge]C[this is correct.  white needs to make a repair move on both sides now ( C14 or J15), so black get to play one of those.  The settling of the Q16 stones should still weigh very heavily on black.]
;W[fc];B[fd];W[ec];B[le]C[Corner sides center.  This is the general rulle of thumb for how to play.  The reason is the center is very hard to maintain control over from this point in the game.  This move doesn't do much but add value to whites cutting move at O15 and due to this cutting move M15 doesn't help out blacks unsettled corner group.]
;W[kd]C[White gets a repair move for free out of this.  A very raw deal for Black.]
;B[jf]C[Q12 O15 J14 are a few of the weak points in this wall.  C10 looks bigger.  F3 C6 K4  The sides are were the real value is.  The center is deceptively smaller then the edges.  If you don't count the fourth line all around the board at all, the size outside of the 4th line is 207 while the center comes to only 121.  So before trying to make center territory in a major way finish the sides off.  The opening is the time to make preparation to take the center not to actually take it because generally the moves to take it at this point are easily out done anyways.]
;W[gb];B[hc];W[hb];B[id];W[jc]C[white connects saving his trapped group and makes pretty big territory in the process.  Perhaps K14 might have been better at G18 or some such cutting off whites group and forcing it to make life.]
;B[jd]C[The issue here is the cut at H16.  K16 defends against it so from that sense it was nessecary.  if however white gets a very nice point does the correction of K16 seem worth it.  This is part of the balance of the game.]
;W[mb]C["Too small to play this early, right?  After I gave up sente at K16, White just hands it back to me."

Exactly.  This is pointless for white as he is connected and alive.]
;B[fq]C["Time to take a big point.  Was this a good one, or should I have played K4, C10, or something like that?"

A matter of style I think.  Perhaps C6.  The key is what joseki do you want to play so that it works out for you in relation to the rest of your stones.  If white josekis here is that workable for you.  If you play C10 are you fine being pushed up or down depending on what white does?]
;W[eq];B[fp]C[This is hugely wrong for white.  this joseki works if white has a stone at K4 or so, something on the other side to squeeze black against.  Here white helps black take the whole lower side.]
;W[dm]C[this is too far an extension.  the josek is a 3 point extension]

(;B[jp]C["Bottom looks good for Black, although still weak at maybe M3 or M4?"

Its a moyo and you can expect white to invade.  In fact you want him to so you can make some real territory.   This is a double wing formation for black and its a very good place to be.  It is now working very well with your upper side wall.  White must invade or black wins.]
;W[po]C[P5 is a standard invasion here.  This misses the mark.]
;B[qm]C[P7 woudl work better in terms of your plans for the center.  R7 makes white go up into your area.]
;W[pm];B[pl];W[om];B[no];W[qn];B[rm];W[ol];B[ok];W[rn];B[qk]
;W[mm];B[lk]C[Your main objective should be to contain white or let him run away.  Since he woudl run into your center you wnat to contain him.  R 12 is in fact small and is more of an end game move.  In regards to the wedge think in terms of sente.  If you have sente after an exchange you get to play the wedge.  If not then you don't.

"At this point, I was feeling the need for a stone at R12 or Q12 to get some
territory on the right and keep White's R14 group out of my center, but it
looked too small at this stage.  I was also looking for a chance to play
a wedge on the left before White got too strong there."];W[pp]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp]C[Forcing some one to live should always end in gote for the one who is trying to live.  This brings us to the power of cutting groups apart then as groups that are seperated must make life for themselves and each time you get sente.    "White eats a chunk out of my corner, but ends in gote, and I get to play the wedge
I want.  Little did I know that a residual weakness in the corner would allow
some clever endgame moves by White that cost me the corner, and the game."]
;B[ci]C[Due to the weaknesses around this corner I migth attack this corner directly with C9.  (the weaknesses come from D7 being to far of an extension form the corner)    "I decided to play the wedge here.  He has to choose whether to attack from
the weaker side and let me get the usual niken tobi base, or whether to ignore
that policy and attack from the stronger side to deny me the perfect base."]
;W[ck]C[This "closes the door" of whites territory and is in sente so yes it is a good move.

"He gives me the base, and consolidates his corner.  Probably the right move"]
;B[cf]C[Your lower side is your what is winning you the game.  White must invade this or lose.  Even so if white can make the lower left all into territory and he gets R11 he has a good chance.  I would hesitate to call anything but the stuff in the upper right corner of the center black's.  Everything else is a moyo and a loose one at that.

"These stones help my wall get some center territory, though.  Center still looks
good for Black, except that it's open around D7.  I think I was winning at
this point."];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[bf];W[np]C[A blunder for white here.    "Thought about this move for
a while, too.  Ended up deciding I could cut and kill (and I could).  The
problem was that the aji left behind ended up costing the game..."]
;B[op];W[oo];B[mp];W[nq];B[nr];W[nn];B[mo]C[I guess I will see the aji when I get to the end but it doesn't look bad now.  This sequence infact ruins white ability to invade or effectively reduce blacks side territory.]
;W[km]C[This mostly stems from forcing white up into your center rather then pushing onto the side when he invaded so long ago.

"Also,
being able to play O6 in sente let him get into the center and mess up my
moyo."];B[ll];W[lm];B[hl]C[This move is out of step with everything.  This is a shot in the dark.  K 8 or 9 I think are better here.  Stay connected and stay in step with the stones on the upper side.    "Seemed like a good sequence of moves at the time, but I'm sure there was a better way to play"]
;W[hm];B[gm];W[gl];B[gn];W[hk];B[il];W[fl];B[im]C[White is big along the top side and has a nice base on the upper right.  His lower left moyo still have some aji.  think about C3 the invasion is still possible here and could shift the balance of territory.

"Now I've kept the right side group out of the center, but the lower left is creeping
in.  At this point, I was starting to have my doubts about whether I was
winning."];W[dj];B[di];W[ei];B[ej]C[When you cut you need space for the cutting stone to run into or other black stones.  Here you have neither.]
;W[fj];B[eh];W[fi];B[fh]C[Think about the direction your "pushing" white.  J9 would have been more inline.]
;W[hi];B[qh]C[If your trying to make a "bubble" of territory sometimes you have to let the other take territory elsewhere so that you get the bubble you have been building.  P13 would have been far superior in that it makes yoru territory more secure.  However this move works in that white must respond to ensure he lives (black S15 could pretty easily kill white in this shape here)

"I figured now was a good time to play R12.  Maybe P12 or P 13 would have been better, though?"]
;W[rg]C[White fixes.  Black shoudl now definately play P13]
;B[rh]C[There are 8 points for black on the right side.  There are roughly 20 points in the center.  Don't follow whites lead here.  Black needs no correction here, he is alive and connected.  Make territory.]

(;B[qj]C[R10 isn't as dire as it looks (see variation) You might be better served trying to get more in the center as per your original plan or mayeb invading at C3.  T8 I think is unplayable here but you can ignore the whole thing till he tries the cut at R10.

"It looked to me like the cutting point at R10 would cost me the whole group
if I tried to respond at T8, right?  Or did I let him steal a bunch of points
unneccessarily?"];W[sl]C[Think what is your biggest move when you in the end game.  Is it blocking white from extending further on the right side or is it J10 or C3 or C10 or...]
;B[sj];W[jj]C[although you could have made better moves defending your center this is often the case with center territory.  Easily invaded from many direction.  Mean while your bottum center area goes untouched and is now bigger then your center probably ever could have been.

"*sigh* And now the center, which
I thought would be mine, is all but gone.  I guess there really is no territory
in the center."];B[ih];W[hh];B[hg];W[df];B[dg];W[pe];B[od];W[pb]
