C[M:
Hello, my name is Martin and I played this black in this game. Played
offline in Germany in November 2002. Time: 60 min, Overtime: 20 stones
in 5 minutes.

M: White lost on time and on the board at the end,
but the big fight on the upper side let both of us feel strange
afterwards. I added some questions and comments about my intentions,
those lines start with "M:". Thanks in advance.


Hello, I am Tim Hunt, a 3 dan from the UK.

I am a bit worried that I may have been too harsh in this review. I know
that I have been asked to criticise; I hope that I have not gone too
far.

Here are some general comments:

1) It's no good being afraid of moyos.

In some positions you can choose whether to play a moyo game, or some
other sort of game. Then, if you don't like moyos, you can choose to do
something else.

In other positions, making a moyo much better than any other option. There is really no choice.

So, you don't have to like moyo, but you must not be scared of it. When
necessary, you should be able to play a moyo game reasonably well. You
can't possibly expect to get to 1 dan without understanding the basics
of moyos. One of the best ways to gain that understanding is to play
some moyo games. You may loose a few more games now, but in the future
you will end up stronger.

2) You try to estimate the score, which is good.

I cannot believe the number of games I have reviewed for the GTL where
the player appeared never to have even considered the balance of
territory. However, (judging by your comments on moves 27 and 29), you
are thinking about that, which is really good.

I don't agree with your judgement. You think you are winning and I think that you are losing, but don't let that worry you. The more you try to estimate the score during the game, and then go back and review the game afterwards, the better your judgement will get. As your judgement gets better, you will get stronger.

If you want to read books about this, then
the basic book is chapter 1 of "The Endgame" by Ogawa Tomoko and James
Davies, from the Elementary Go Series. It talks about how to evaluate
territory in the endgame. This is obviously the right place to start
because later in the game the territories are more clearly defined. The
next step is "Positional Judgment", by Cho Chikun. This explains about
how to estimate territory much earlier in the game, and then goes on to
talk about how you deal with estimating the value of influence and
difficult things like that. The third book that comes to mind is "Nie
Weiping on Go", by Nie Weiping. It consists of Nie commenting on some
of his own games, and you can see him using the same sort of analysis
that Cho is teaching in Positional Judgment.

3) Don't play 'forcing moves' without thinking.

I've put in a big discussion of this at move 67 and following. A forcing
move is a move that your opponent must answer AND where the the total
effect of your move and the opponent's reply is a gain for you. So far,
it seems that you have only got the first part of that. Now you need to
take it further. Your thought process should go something like this:

     1. Notice that if black plays A, white must answer at B;
     2. Decide whether the exchange of  black A for white B is a gain;
     3. If it is, decide whether you should play this exchange now, or save it for later.

Most of the time, the best option is to save it for later. You seem to be
only doing step 1, and perhaps 2, which is a good start, but now you
need to take it a stage further. An excellent book about forcing moves
is "Beyond Forcing Moves", by Takagi Shoichi. I really like this book,
and it made me a lot stronger at fighting.];B[pd];W[de];B[pp]
;W[dp];B[ck]C[M: I wanted no moyo

This move is OK.

But it is no good being scared of moyos (or of any other thing in go). You
can only control half of what happens on the go board, your opponent
controls the other half.

Of course, it is natural that you like some things more than others. Maybe you don't like moyo games as much as you like games with lots of small territories, but to get strong at go, you have to under stand moyo at least a little bit. The only way to gain that understanding is to play moyo games sometimes.]
;W[ec]
(;B[ch]LB[jc:A][ci:D][pj:B][cn:C][jq:E]C[I
don't like this move. Because you can play either here, or at C, your
stone of the left side is safe for now.

You don't need to worry if white plays D and you answer at C. See the variation.

I
think that playing around A, limiting the influence of the white corner
enclosure, is clearly bigger than your move. Black B would also be
good. I think that E is a little bit smaller than A or B.];W[jd]
C[Now white has a moyo at the top.];B[pj]C[I thought that you didn't like moyo! The san-ren-sei is a moyo strategy.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[nq];B[lq];W[qq]
(;B[pq]LB[qn:A]TR[pj]C[M:
I think you will tell me to block on the other side, but my intention
was to take sente and take secure territory on the left and the bottom
as it happened in the game. I wanted no moyo.

Of course I am going to tell you to block on the other side!

Block on the other side.

At
the end of the joseki you play, white gets a strong stone at A, which
means that the marked black stone is in a really stupid place. Also, at
the end of the joseki, there is no really big move to play, so having
sente is not so important.   Finally, if you block on the correct side,
then black ends up with a really beautiful formation, and the marked
black stone is in exactly the right place. Have a look at the
variation.];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn]
(;B[cn]LB[np:B][jq:A]C[This
is also on the wrong side. Your black group on the left side is strong,
but quite small. At the bottom, you have the chance to build a bigger
area, and if white got a stone at A, then you would worry a little, and
feel inclined answer at B.   Look at the variation for what I think the
right moves are.];W[co]LB[fq:A]C[If I was white, I would not play this white move. I would probably play at A instead.]
;B[dn];W[fp]C[This white move would be better on the 3rd line at F3.]
;B[iq]LB[pb:A][qc:B][rj:C]C[M:
I expected white F3 instead of F4 and was happy. I felt the upper side
looked bigger than it is, and if I can erase white's territory there
I'll win.

I disagree. Sure the white area at the top is just
potential, not territory. It will not all become white territory, but
some of it will become territory, and that is probably enough for white
to win.

Estimating the territory:

Black has about 10
points on the left, and 15 at the bottom. The top right is much small
than it looks. White can exchange A for B in sente, and then play C, so
at most black has about 15 points of territory here at the moment
(although it could grow with future moves).

So that is 40 for black.

White
has 10 in the bottom right, and 15 in the bottom left, and komi, so
that is about 30 points. White only needs to make 10 points at the top.

Perhaps
a clearer way to see it: Black on the left is about the same as white
on the bottom right. White in the bottom left is about the same as
black at the bottom. Which is bigger: white at the top plus komi, or
black in the top right? I prefer white.];W[cq]C[This is quite a
slow move for white.];B[gr]C[M: Since F4 and C3 were bad in my eyes, I
choose to relax and play this move (which was of course much too small
and slow)

You are right, it is too slow. If white had not played
C3, then this move would threaten White's eye-space, and would not be
slow, but since white is completely alive, this move is not good.

M: I wanted  to see what white will do about my lead in territory.

As I said before, I think that white is ahead.];W[ne];B[pb]
;W[ob];B[oc]LB[pa:C][pc:B][qc:A][be:D]C[This
is wrong, which should be clear after white's next two moves. The
correct move for Black is A, which makes strong shape. (B is bad,
because later, white C would be sente).

However, a much better
move would be tenuki. Any move you play around here is basically just
an endgame move (and a gote one at that), and not the biggest thing on
the board. For instance D looks a lot bigger.];W[od];B[pc];W[pe]
;B[qe];W[nr];B[ns]
(;W[di]C[I think that this is not the best technique for white. See the variation.]
;B[ci];W[eg];B[cc]LB[be:A]C[I think that this invasion is a mistake, since it just dies. Sliding to A seems better.]
;W[be]C[M:  I didn't expect this move and tried c15 and leave bad aji in the corner for white.

C15
is a mistake. There is already bad aji in the corner, the black stone
is only just dead. After C15 and the following, black is a lot deader.  Probably the right way to make use of the aji in the corner is to
invade at the top. A black stone around G or H 17 is probably a threat
to live in the top corner (see the variation for some idea of what
happens if Black tries to live in the top corner, and why H or H17
would make it work). N16 and 18 are threats on the right. So if you
invade now, white probably won't be able to trap you. Perhaps attach at
K17 then cross-cut, and you will be able to make a big reduction in
white's territory somehow.]
(;B[ce];W[cd];B[cf];W[dd];B[df];W[ef];B[bc];W[bd]
(;B[ie]LB[ig:A]TR[ne][eg]C[M:
I wasn't satisfied with the result but thought the corner aji would
still be enough to seriously reduce whites upper side.

You are right not to be satisfied, The threat to live in the corner is much smaller, see the variation.

Before
playing a reducing move like this, you need to try to estimate if it is
enough to win. What if white just defends at H17. This is a very
cowardly move, but afterwards, white has 35 at the top. 10 in the
bottom left, 10 in the bottom right, and komi, or about 60. You have 10
on the left (white can monkey-jump) 15 at the bottom and 20 in the top
right (you can capture P18 in sente) so about 45. I think that this
position is very difficult for you.

The other problem is that
your reducing move is very deep. The edge of the white moyo is along
the line between E13 and O15. The usual rule for a reducing move is to
play on, or outside that line. It is very tempting for white to cap at
A, however in this game it is not really necessary.];W[id];B[gc]
;W[fc];B[hd]
(;W[he]LB[ig:A]C[Why does white cut???

black
has one very weak group. Why does white cut off a single stone? Black
can sacrifice it while making the rest of the group stronger. Much
better to attack the whole group. White should probably attack at A.
The cut will probably  still be available later.];B[ge]C[M: I felt that this G15 might be an overplay, but thought White would have a hard time to prove this G15 wrong.

Yes, but you are behind of territory, so you need to try something like this and hope that it works.]
;W[hf];B[gf];W[hc];B[gd];W[gg]C[White really ought to stop and think at this point.

Can white read out a sequence that captures the black stones cleanly? Probably not. I can't

Does
white need to capture the black stones to win the game? Again, probably
not. What if white builds a wall down column H in sente white
threatening to kill black, and then plays around O11 to make a big
territory in the centre? That is probably a way to win.

So going all-out to kill is probably a mistake for white.];B[hg]
;W[if];B[ig]LB[jf:A]C[Now a very important point:

You
have spotted that this move is an atari, and the stones that you are
putting into atari are very important cutting stones, so if you play
atari, white has to answer at A.   OK, so you can play this atari at
any point, white has to answer, and you know exactly what answer you
are going to get.   On the other hand, the only way for white to stop
you playing this atari, is to play some slow gote move. This is not
going to happen in the middle of a fight like this. So, what is even
more important is that you don't to play this atari yet.

Why should you wait? Well, to start with there might be a ko later, and this would be a brilliant ko threat.

Another
reason is that once you have played the atari, your opponent knows
exactly what is going on. If you don't play it yet, your opponent has
to worry about the possibility that you could play it at any time.

Also,
there is not just this atari. You can also play atari at A, which would
be equally forcing. Are you sure that you won't want to play A any time
in the future?

And as for making the opponent worry, if you
don't play the atari, your opponent has to worry about both this move
and A all the time.

Also, after this atari followed by white A,
white is very thick at the top. The chances are that you have actually
helped white here.

So, in summary, a forcing move like this
gives you the right to play on a particular point in sente; nut, more
importantly, it gives you the right to not play the move (and keep it
in reserve) as well.   When you understand this fully, you will find
that you get a lot stronger at fighting.

The book "Beyond Forcing Moves" (one of my favourite Go books) is all about this.]

(;W[jh];B[ej];W[fk];B[ee]
(;W[ed];B[hb];W[ic]C[This
is a mistake by white. White is not going to be able to capture black
from here, so should stop and decide exactly what to give up, rather
than letting black choose.

LB[nj:A]C[Why? This looks small to me.   White should play around A and make a big centre, which probably keeps white head.]
;B[ik]C[M:
that was a very close fight, but having played J9, I think white had
already lost. White was getting short of time, having used over 45 min
until here, while I had only used 30 min.

White was already in overtime, but the game was also as good as over on
the board, I think. Finally that big fight around the F14 group was
decisive, White was depressed after the game and Black felt shaky,
because I think White made a mistake, but couldn't exactly find the
point where that happened.

White was definitely ahead early on
in the game, but went wrong after black invaded the top with G17, etc.
First with the cut at H15, then by going all-out for the kill when it
was not possible, rather than looking to make territory while
attaching, or go for a favourable exchange. Finally, white got into a
mess at the end, what with running out of time, but these things
happen, so that is not important.];B[mp];W[lo];B[mo])
