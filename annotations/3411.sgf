C[Overall:
It seems like you didn't notice that white was doing exchanges. I don't think he realised it but he gave you alot of thickness in some cases. Try to notice it and see how you could have used it to make a gain other than small solid territory.
Notice when you should tenuki.
Avoid making your opponent stronger, especially if he is weak.
Make sure you don't make too many cuts in your position, and always read before playing a hane in a weak position.
And finally, don't try to kill everything, try to gain by attacking. There were several points in the game where you should have stopped attacking and surround a big area.

I hope this helps you.

(;B[ql]C[Personally, I don't like this move for black. It leaves the corner area very thin. Look at the variations.]
;W[qg];B[fq];W[qn]
(;B[ol]C[The usual ways to respond to an invasion like R6 are the jump at P8....(look at variations)]

(;W[qp];B[oo];W[qq];B[pr];W[rl]C[better response to this move besides Q6?]
;B[pn]C[Instead black should probably concentrate on the bottom side, which now has alot of potential with the new wall.
F5 looks good to me. A second approach at C6 would be a standard move locally, but it can possibly destroy black's potential at the bottom.]
;W[qm];B[pm]C[Again black must tenuki here, with this exchange of territory for thickness black must hurry to make a big play at F5.]
;W[hq];B[fo]
(;W[kq];B[dn];W[cn]C[how does black respond to this move?];B[cm]
;W[co];B[dm];W[cq]C[To me this looks alright for black. Black can still attack the white group with moves such as N3, or a cap at L5.
In any case, black can now get nice territory on the left side.]
;B[ho]C[Instead I would make an approach/extension around C14 to get something of the side. Though this can probably be alright too.]
;W[io];B[hp]C[Usually this move is considered bad style, getting your head hit. Also it makes white much much stroner which suddenly threatens the wall on the right.
Instead I would try to avoid playing contact in this area and maybe find a better attacking move, or just tenuki. N3 might also work to threaten the white stones while helping yours.]
;W[ip];B[gq]C[This makes good shape, but right now black has other stuff to do. White's shape is getting stronger, and if white extends to J6 it will be even better. Instead it should be considered to extend to N3 from the new weak group.]
;W[hr];B[ko]C[This is a strange move. White's shape is good enough right now for him not to worry about anything.]
;W[in];B[km]C[Black can't really attack white anymore. This attack only made white stronger.]
;W[nq]C[how should i have handled this group? was L5 a good idea?
I like extending to N3 more, much safer for black. Here b is troubled by the remaining aji at Q4.]

(;B[gg];W[gh];B[gc];W[ei];B[dj]C[Usually, you shouldn't save stones like D11.
Moves like D11 are called 'kikashi' and their purpose is usually to ruin the opponent's shape while forcing a response.
Such stones have already served their purpose and should be abandoned.
White's shape is already heavy, and if black plays tenuki here white would need to play another extra move to actually capture the D11 stone.]
;W[bd]
(;B[hh]C[Here the remaining aji is big, and together with G16 and further cuts it came back to haunt black several times.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[fk];B[dk];W[gi]C[White managed to strengthen himself by using D11's weakness.]
;B[hi];W[hj];B[ij];W[hk]
(;B[hl]C[This move is very bad style.];W[ik];B[jk]C[Black's aji is very bad here. Black concentrates too much on trying to kill. I would be happy to gain a wall in the centre and let white live small, and then it's possible to follow with a move to complete some centre territory.]
;W[hg]
(;B[ii]C[There is no good way to connect here, too much aji. However K11 should be considered.]
