C[Hi, I'm Mikong. IonutTabac is someone who challenged me in IGS. We didn't get to discuss the game, that's why I'm asking help from GTL. I have read a lot about Go, but I have very little experience (I have only played 4 times in IGS so far, and I'm ranked Beginner Class (BC), as you can see). If possible, please also comment on my level because I have no idea. IonutTabac is also BC but he defeated me. Please feel free to comment at any part of the game.

Thank you very much for reviewing this game.

Jeff: Hi, I'll be posting comments in the manner you see here, leaving anything you may have written alone.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[qd];W[dq]TR[dp]C[Jeff: This is a very standard start. Good job. Sometimes beginners are more comfortable with playing both start stones on hoshi (4x4), as I have indicated.]
;B[nc];W[dk]TR[cf][df][cg][dg][cn][dn][co][do]C[I read somewhere about the Chinese fuseki, that's why I tried it here (first time). I don't know if I could use it effectively. From what I read, it was performed by black, and I'm not sure if white can use it.

Jeff: What you have played is the "high chinese fuseki"; it is more influence based. As for white playing it, I'm sure its much less common since it is a lot harder to get away with. Notice how black has that third move for free that he could have played a triangled move.]
;B[pj];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq]
(;W[kq]TR[jp][jq]C[This is the first time I tried the kite joseki. I don't know if I used it correctly.

Jeff: This is good, but keep your eyes on the whole board. Usually a common mistake is to follow a joseki blindly. While it gives an equal exchange locally, there may be a bigger benefit globally. Either triangled spot is stronger in my opinion since you already have some strength in the lower left. But don't take this as fact! See variation.]
;B[fc];W[df]TR[dg]C[Jeff: As a beginner I always played too small. No one will blame you for over-extending. Try experimenting and seeing what you can get away with. Go for more. You'll get a better feeling for what you can and cannot do. No one remembers your first 50 games anyway. Play to the strength of that middle stone.]
;B[jd];W[fe]TR[hc]C[Jeff: Good shape! What happens here is that you induce a move from black which closes the possible invasion later. Although waiting for it, black could have easily played the move you just made. So its a trade off.]
;B[ge];W[fd]C[Jeff: Good shape again!];B[gd];W[ec];B[fb];W[gf]
;B[hf];W[gg];B[if]C[Jeff: This was a good exchange in my opinion.]
;W[hi]C[In the last few and next sequence of moves, am I doing the right way of expanding/protecting my territory? Is it too conservative, or too aggressive? It seems conservative to me but I don't know how to expand safely. I just tried to make moves that didn't stray too far from my stones, like a sold connection here and a keima there, and some diagonals.

Jeff: I agree that crawling along like that is pretty conservative. You would have to to take some losses in order to try to get bigger gains. I feel that you are winning right now, so it isn't bad to play conservative in that situation.]
;B[hh];W[gh];B[ih]
(;W[hg]TR[hf][if][hh][ih]C[Jeff: Here is the first thing that actually stands out that is conceptually a wrong move! Which is really good for your 4th game, trust me. What I mean is that you should ask yourself what purpose is every move serving me? Black's shape is called a bamboo joint, it is uncuttable. You have given up a move to try to cut it. See variation.]
;B[ig];W[ii];B[cm];W[co]C[Jeff: Good.];B[dl];W[el];B[em];W[cl]
;B[dm];W[ck];B[fl];W[ek];B[gn];W[gp];B[in];W[kn];B[li]C[Jeff: Ouch, this is a big move for black.]
;W[hl]C[How do I stop black from making 2 eyes here? I struggled with this problem throughout the game. If possible, if I committed mistakes in the next steps, please also advise how I could recover in those mistakes, or how I could minimize the damage.]
;B[gm];W[gl];B[hm];W[fk];B[fm]C[Jeff: Work up until now, black has nothing.]

(;W[il]C[Jeff: I would change this. Remember the point is not to kill black, but to make sure he does not take territory (and to make sure he does not destroy your territory). But I see what you want to do with it. See variations.]
;B[eo]C[Jeff: Be conscientious of the territory you want on the bottom.]
;W[fo];B[go]
(;W[ep]C[Jeff: Stay strong through this. See variation.];B[hp]

;W[ho];B[io];W[hr];B[ir];W[gr];B[do];W[dp];B[fn];W[fp];B[cn]
;W[bo];B[bn]
(;W[nn]C[Is this move OK? Or should I have placed my stone on P6? I thought P6 was too dangerous because its a 1-point jump from R6 black stone and a keima from Q4 stone. What do you think?

Jeff: This feels better since see variation.];B[pl];W[nl];B[nj]
;W[lk];B[ji];W[jj];B[ki];W[kj]C[Jeff: So now I would sit back and look at the board. You are behind. Time to take some risks, and if they don't work out, resign.]
;B[qg];W[mj];B[mi];W[nk];B[lj];W[mk];B[oj]
(;W[gb]C[I just tried this move to see how black reacts. What are better moves to cut black? I thought to myself, "there are cutting points in black's group, but I don't know how to attack". Btw, are there really cutting points or am I only imagining them?

Jeff: They are not really cutting points since you cannot directly cut them, but you can use them to gain leverage inside black's territory. See variation.]
;B[gc];W[om]C[This move starts my attack to the side. Please advise how I could have pushed him more. I only got so far.]
;B[eb];W[db];B[oo];W[no];B[qr];W[pq];B[qs];W[op];B[po];W[pm]
;B[qm];W[pk]C[At this point, I was expecting black to react with bP9 but as you can see, I guessed wrong. I was thinking bP9-wP8-bR9-wB8. I don't know if these moves will get me anywhere, but I thought to myself, I wanted to see what happens.]

(;B[qk];W[ok];B[qi]C[Did black really need to protect there? As white, I have never thought of attacking him there.

Jeff: I would agree that it is not necessary.];W[pn];B[qo];W[ol]
;B[ql];W[ps];B[or];W[nr];B[js]C[I don't know the proper moves to stop this. I did stop his plan later but I think because black was distracted. I only got lucky.]
;W[jr];B[ks];W[is]C[I wanted to force him to connect with J1, but maybe I could have just played H1.]
;B[hs];W[gs];B[is];W[lr];B[ls];W[ms];B[mq];W[kr];B[mr];W[ip]
C[Black later told me that this move is worth 18 points, and might decide the game. I told him "ok, but I'm not good with counting the other territories", so I wasn't really sure who was winning. It looks to me like black has a very big territory on the upper right, and I was worried if I should have resigned already. Even with these 18 points, I felt like I was losing. And I did.

Jeff: Actually you are winning right now. Very nice.];B[bl]
;W[bk]C[I knew black was trying to make his second eye. But I couldn't read ahead to stop it. I'm thinking maybe wA6 or wA7 but I was worried he'll just destroy my walls.

Jeff: This is the right thing to do. I don't see any way to prevent the second eye. You preserve territory like this though.]
;B[am];W[dn]C[This seems like a useless move. I'm not sure why I did that.]
;B[en];W[ao];B[an]
(;W[mp]C[Is this move useless? I felt that the 2 black stones could still cause some damage if I left them alone.

Jeff: No, black cannot use these stones.];B[jm]TR[il]C[Black is now trying to reduce my territory. Earlier, I thought I could easily stop him from spreading, but looking at the next steps, it looks like he took a significant amount of points. When in the game should I have stopped this?

Jeff: If you look back to the triangled move, I suggested an alternative that would have done most the work for you.]

(;W[km]C[Jeff: Aha! try to think one line away from the situation, and you'll find moves often are better there. See variation.]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[ik];W[hk];B[kl];W[ll];B[kk];W[ij]C[Jeff: Playing my move, you save a point or two. Which is important in such a close game.]
;B[ak];W[aj];B[al];W[bj];B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[cb];B[bq];W[cp]
;B[mf]C[I don't undestand this move of black. Did he protect something I couldn't see? Could I have attacked there?

Jeff: Maybe a high dan player could do something with it, but I don't see any way of playing inside there.]
;W[he]C[I just tried this move to see how he reacts. If he captures the stones, the extra points should cancel out with the territory lost for his extra moves on his territory right? Or could he have passed anyway and I'd have lost points. Is there any way of cutting here?]
;B[id];W[ie];B[je];W[tt];B[hn];W[hp]C[Jeff: Good work. I would have to say that you are 22-20 kyu range. There was really only one or two technical mistakes. The rest is just learning the ebb and flow of playing and choosing where to go next. Try some games where you go for more than you usually would, then slowly work backward to what feels comfortable. It is about learning, and that is how you learn. Don't worry about your rating right now. Learning is important.  Good luck!
