RE[W+R]

C[Dear Reviewer,
Thanks for your review.
I have played Black in this game and lost a small margin (~5 points); In fact I made a severe error at the end and resigned, but I was lost anyway.
I had the impression during the middlegame that I am leading, but apparently I was wrong. I could not sopt any severe mistakes I made, but I guess I made strategic errors related to direction and to overall view of the board. Any comments are welcome.

Thanks! Avi

Basti: There were some strategic mistakes and during the fights black was playing a little too soft.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ed];B[cd];W[qj]C[A: I do not know if playing tenuki here is correct for White]
;B[gc]C[A: I decided to take advantage of White's tenuki and press; This seems to me also working well with Q16]
;W[nq]
(;B[qn]C[A: I guess this is the correct resposne
Basti: I think black could also play a pincer.];W[qf];B[nd]

(;W[ph]C[A: Is not P15 better?
Basti: I would slide into the corner first.]
(;B[df]C[Basti: First of all, black should make white overconventrated.
Locally black should cross under at E17. 
I would rather play in the lower right corner because the black stones don't have much room on the right side.]
;W[ch]C[Basti: A strange move. White is trying to attack a strong black group]
;B[fe]C[A: During the game I thought this is a good move, but now I have doubts. Maybe a play around C10 or D10 is better?
Basti: I think your move is alright but attacking should be possible, too.]
;W[eh]C[Basti: Another strange move because the hole on the left side is much too big.]

(;B[cn]C[A: Better C7?
Basti: This move invites a pincer. White needs at least 2 moves to turn the left side into territory so there is no need to hurry. First I would play in the lower right.]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[ck];B[el]C[Basti: A strange shape. I hope black had a good plan in case white cuts at D7.]
;W[fp];B[en];W[qq]C[A: White invades the 3-3 point; I think Black's responses are forced - did I go wrong here?
Basti: It can't be helped. The problem is that black doesn't have enough room on the right side.]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[nr];B[os];W[ro];B[qp];W[rp]
C[A: Is the R4-S4 exchange good for Black?
Basti: R4 should have been at R5. Now white can cut easily at R5.]
;B[np];W[lq];B[nn]C[A: N4 better, I guess. During the game I thought this is strengthen White, but letting White take N4 is even worse.
Basti: I think so.];W[qo];B[po];W[mp];B[mo];W[lo];B[ln];W[kn]
C[A: In my view, L5 is better for White, is not it?
Basti: L5 is better];B[ko];W[lp];B[jn];W[km];B[jp];W[lm];B[mn]
;W[jr]
(;B[ho]C[A: Now I think pressing at J3 is a must.
Basti: Black could start a fight here.];W[iq]C[A: White immediately takes this key point...]
;B[hp]C[Basti: This move doesn't achieve anything. Black should leave the situation as it is and wait for a chance to play at H3 for example.]
;W[gq]C[Basti: White is happy to defend.];B[ml]C[Basti: The top side is bigger]
;W[be];B[ce]C[A: B16 better? I did not want to leave bad aji at D16, but this let White take the corner
Basti: I think this move is correct.];W[bf];B[kk];W[lc]C[A: Good direction on White's side. I am not sure I found the correct response.
Basti: I think it's alright. you can't allow white to make a 2-space-extension]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[id];W[kd];B[ic]C[Basti: White couldn't have cut here. Black should play at N15.]
;W[mf];B[nf];W[me];B[of];W[mh];B[nh];W[li];B[oi]C[A: O11 better?
Basti: Yes, because there would be no cut at P12.];W[qc];B[qd]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob]
(;B[qg]C[A: Is it the correct attack on the weak White's group? Maybe start with R8? But then White Can play S14, later S12 with good chances to survive?
Basti: I think S6 is sente for black.];W[qh];B[rg];W[rm]C[A: Good point. I did not find an answer.]
;B[nb];W[oc];B[nc];W[bc]C[Basti: The white corner can be killed in a ko now.
I think both sides played quite alright in the endgame.
This is the last comment.]
(;B[bd];W[ad];B[cc];W[bb];B[cb];W[bp];B[qm]C[A: This only strengthened White. R9 maybe? I could find a good follow up.]
;W[rl];B[gh]C[A: Now it seems to me J14 first is much better.]

;W[cg];B[bn];W[bl];B[ii];W[dk];B[ek];W[dg];B[eg];W[fn];B[gn]
;W[do];B[dn];W[ca];B[da];W[ba];B[eb];W[hh];B[hi];W[hg]C[A: At this point I think White has a small lead:
White has ~80 points:
30 - bottom
10 - bottom right
8 - top right
10 - center
15 - left
6.5 - Komi
Black has ~72 points:
20 - top left
48 - center
4 - right

Basically it means the Black's strategy failed.
Rest of the game is yose - I welcome any comments you can give me on this tage as well. Thanks!]
