C[This game was interesting mostly because of an invasion tht we think decided the game.

I leave our comments. Thanks for your help.

[is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Summary:

The final position clearly shows why early invasions are dangerous: Black ended up with more groups and inefficient shapes, especially the G16 group but also Q16 group because of White's cascading attacks.

Black: 

* If you're going to invade deeply, strive to work with defects and weaknesses in the opponent's position. Play probes _before_ you move in, or they will turn into thank-you moves !

* Reach for the center, flee lightly and easily, if making a base locally is uncertain or slow or expensive. Otherwise you're likely never to regain sente before it's too late.

White:

* Seriously consider shutting the enemy in severely when possible. It's likely to be sente and bring big thickness.

* Look for miai to increase efficiency of shapes and moves (see D5 move 14, S12 move 64). Beware of slack and slow moves.]
