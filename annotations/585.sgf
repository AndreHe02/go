white wins by 17.5

Morten,   Personally I think my opening and recognition of big moves are my weak points against player my own strength.  Comments on this and anything else would be greatly appreciated.  I will study all of your comments carefully.
 - David Aue

Hi David,

I've marked my comments with (magic). I will try to answer your questions and raise other points as well. I've put a sort of summary at the end.
--magic];B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[cq]C[(magic)
This is quite unusual by white - it is considered slow by todays standard. It does secure the corner, but is difficult to develop from and doesn't really work well with the other white stone on the hoshi point, which is much more centre/influence oriented.]
;B[ce]LB[nq:a]C[aue: Is shimari a good move this soon?

(magic)
Yes, it's fine. Other possible moves are approaches to the lower right (from either direction), top edge or left edge hoshi points. Approaching the white stone on the 3-3 point is not useful this early in the game.
Personally, I would probably play 'a' - O3];W[ep]LB[fp:a][dn:b]
C[(magic)
This is slow. 'Normal' development from a 3-3 point is F4 or D6 - a/b. Often 3-3 point stones are not extended from until later (if at all). Any of the hoshi points or an approach to the top right would be a better move.]
;B[qn]LB[ck:E][dk:C][cn:A][qn:D][nq:B]C[aue? What is best corner and direction to attack? Or is side move better?

(magic)
 I think that this is fine. It makes a 'double wing' extension from the top right. You could approach from O3 - B instead, it would give a game with smaller moyos and more individual groups - which may or may not suit your style. I think that any plays on the left side are not very useful at present - they will not be sente and will not work well with the 'direction' of your shimari - which is 'aimed at' the top edge.]
;W[nq]C[(magic)
Again, slow. Usual play is one line higher. White has used all 4 stones on the same edge - black is in a much better position.]
;B[qp]LB[rp:a][qq:b][pj:c][pk:d]C[(magic)
It is too early for moves like these. If you want to settle your stone, playing at S4 - A (white answers at R3 - B, black finishes at Q10 -C or Q9 -D) is better . You should avoid contact moves this early in the game.]
;W[qq];B[rp];W[rq];B[pn]LB[po:a]C[(magic)
Q5 -A is much better since it gives eye potential and can later be used to press white down. Even so, Q10 or Q9 is far better.]
;W[qf]C[(magic)
This is reasonable by white - another black move on the right edge and white would struggle to deal with it later.]

(;B[qe]LB[pf:a][nd:b][qj:c]C[(magic)
The normal response to this black move is white Q14 - A, black O16 - B and white stabilises her group with R10 -C. I don't think that is what black should want in this game. The black group in the lower right is quite strong - you could play a pincer instead, developing the right side. See Var on last move.]
;W[nc]LB[pf:a]C[(magic)
This is an overplay. If black plays at Q14 - A, he will have a large and quite secure moyo plus tremendous influence over the centre.]
;B[oc]C[aue: Is this a bad shape?

(magic)
I think I've seen a proverb about it, but I cannot remember what it said. On its own, it doesn't look like a very healthy shape to me, but the white stones around are much worse off.]
;W[qc]LB[oe:a]C[aue: Would better move for white be P15?

(magic)
Hmm. Interesting. White is connected to either of his two stones on the outside (see vars) and should be able to live locally. Black should let her live and construct on the outside.  White play around P15 -A wouldn't really accomplish much, it will be difficult to connect those stones up.]

(;B[oe]LB[ob:a][re:b]C[(magic)
:-)
The shape may be pretty, but it serves no purpose here.White can still connect up with P18-A or S15-B, and black would be left with a mess to sort out.
I know the proverbs says to play on the point of symmetry, but I don't think it applies in this situation.]
;W[qd]C[aue: Bad move for white? perhaps S15?
(magic)
Yes];B[re];W[rd];B[pb];W[pc]C[aue : another bad move for white? he needs to making eye shape to live. R18 better?

(magic)
Even R18 would at best leave him with a 'bulky five' in the corner, which would be dead.]
;B[ob];W[rf];B[se];W[sd]
(;B[rb]C[aue: I can't tell if absolutely dead,  so I made sure. Seems like a wasted move now]
;W[qb]
(;B[qa]C[aue: sems like another wasted move. I don't think W could make life anyway (variation)

(magic)
Agree.];W[sf];B[pe];W[pf]
(;B[me]C[aue: I was keeping him from getting around the corner but perhaps it would have been better to take Q10 or some other big point (variation).

(magic)
Agree.];W[pj]C[(magic)
Now the lower right black group has lost most of its value.]

(;B[qk]C[(magic)
Variation is probably better.];W[qj];B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[nk]
;B[nn];W[rj];B[nh]C[aue: attacking white area and getting center influence and a chance to reach the other group

(magic)
First:
White 44 (S10) really MUST be answered, otherwise the black group can loose its base. It is very costly to ignore this descent.

Apart from that, "attacking white area and getting center influence and a chance to reach the other group" is a noble objective. However, all you are likely to do is to strengthen white, which will make it more difficult for your lower group to do much useful. As it is, the white group is already quite stable, so your attack cannot be very strong. Playing on a big point on the left, top or bottom gives black more. (Although answering at S9 is the only move here)]
;W[oh];B[oi]C[aue: this seems bad in retrospect. should  I have played outside more?]
;W[pi];B[oj]C[aue: dumb move, thought I was cutting..doh];W[ni]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[op]LB[po:a][lp:b][mp:c]C[aue: getting a little wider to keep white down and get to center easily

(magic)
Q5 -A is still the better move in that area. Alternatively, play around M4 -B or N4 - C  and close white in whilst establishing yourself on the bottom.

A contact move like this (unless you have seen some fancy sequence following it) is more likely to strengthen white than anything else.]

(;W[oq];B[np];W[mp]C[(magic)
'Hane at the head of two stones' - makes good sense. Don't try to push from behind or you will find this happening often.]
;B[mo];W[lp];B[lm]LB[rk:a]C[(magic)
Why this move?
What is the direction of play at the moment?
If you consider your black group safe, then leave it and play a big point - any other moves by black here is likely to just strenghten the white groups. The white bottom territory is already getting big.
You should be aware that the weakness at S9 - A makes the black group MUCH less strong than it looks.]
;W[rl]LB[sn:a]C[(magic)
Ah. White could have played at T6 - A and completely removed blacks base on the side. (Threatens to link up with the corner or above - if black blocks one, white plays the other.)]
;B[li]LB[lj:a]C[aue: It seemed like letting him have the side and taking this chunk in the middle in return might be okay.  Should I have secured the side earlier or now?

(magic)
If you're not careful, he will take the side and your group. This move does nothing at all for you - it doesn't attack him and it doesn't strengthen yourself. Whites obvious answer is M10 - A, which would not help back anything.]
;W[nl];B[om];W[oo];B[no];W[po];B[qo];W[rn]C[(magic)
Black has no base left and must look for eyes in the centre. Not very good, considering that 20 moves back this was a group with a large potential for development - and black hasn't gained anything in the exchange since then.]
;B[on]C[aue: not needed I think

(magic)
Not yet.];W[pq];B[lk];W[rk]C[(magic)
Not needed yet. Bigger points elsewhere.];B[ql]C[(magic)
Does not give you an eye.];W[qm];B[pl];W[lo];B[ln]C[aue: this whole sequence seems really poor for black.  I got center influence but nothing much else. What would have been a better approach

(magic)
See earlier comments. In general, you failed to realise the threat of the white descent at S10 and wasted some moves on the outside which had no use (Neither M11, N12 nor P12 seem to fulfil any function at the moment, except for strengthening white around the weak black group.]
;W[hp]C[aue: now white controls the bottom pretty well. Should I have prevented this?  What can I do at this point?

(magic)
Time to look at the overall board.
White: Lower edge around 50 points, right edge group around 15 points - total 65.
Black: Upper left corner 12 points, upper right corner 20 points, right edge no points.  In terms of solid territory, white is very much in the lead. Black can get a good grip on the top (worth more than 30 points) with a play around J16, which would also work well with his influence on the right.   Extending on the left is also big. If black extends here, he is threatening to make an enormous moyo which occupies half the Goban - white will be forced to play inside it and black can profit while chasing white. I would hesitate between D10 and J16.]
;B[og]C[aue: trying to chew on white a little.  probably I should be doing bigger things.

(magic) This is indeed a very small endgame type move..];W[ph]
C[(magic)
White shouldn't even answer - one point is nothing compared to the big points on the board (top and left sides)]
;B[pg];W[of];B[nf];W[qg];B[ng]C[aue: these all seem like very slow moves, especially since I gave up sente

(magic)
Yup. You gained 3 points with 4 moves and lost sente. There are far bigger points. White should not have responded to any of these.]
;W[mm];B[mn]C[(magic)
You should try to see other ways of answering these kind of forcing moves. In this case, e.g. N8 would be better.]
;W[jd]C[aue: white decides to have bigger vision.  This probably would have been a good move for black a while back.  What is best move now to minimize what white can take on top?]
;B[lc]C[(magic)
This move is good - you attack the 'invader', seperate him from the dead stone at O17 (which is further weakened) and solidify your territory - all good things.]
;W[kc];B[mc]LB[lb:a][kb:b][gc:c]C[(magic)
This is bad. It doesn't threaten his group, but kills (again!) a stone which is dead and strengthens the black stones which are already strong enough.   The descent to M18 -A gives you more territory and, above all, is sente (otherwise you can slide underneath and take away the white base), enabling you to follow up (after he answers at L18 -b) at G or H 17 -c. White will be left without a base and has to run out - by chasing white black will gain strength and territory.]
;W[gc]C[aue: white gets nice base and I go very little

(magic)
Indeed, white is now almost completely settled.];B[jf]LB[fe:a]
[dj:b][cl:c][el:d]C[(magic)
Again, this is the wrong direction. Now that the top is temporarily finished (all parties are settled) you should look to the left edge, where the biggest points lie. If you want to press white down, do so from the left (e.g. F15 - A) so that you can later extenmd downwards and make a big moyo.

Personally, I would probably play D10 - B. If he answers at C8 - C I could press him down with E8 - D, which works OK with the black thickness on the right. If white doesn't answer, following up D10 with C7 is pleasant.

However, it will be very difficult for black to catch up now.]
;W[ec]C[(magic)
White misses the big points as well.];B[ed];W[fc];B[ee]C[(magic)
Why?];W[ch];B[cj]C[(magic)  Good. You are strong above, so pincer.]
;W[eh]C[aue: should I have made a base at this point.]
(;B[gf]LB[ej:a]C[aue: or was keeping his groups apart better?

(magic)
Normally, you should follow him out with E10 - A. He cannot connect his two groups with a single move yet anyway.]
;W[ej];B[cm]C[aue: making a base];W[cl]C[(magic)
Overplay. This should not work.];B[dl];W[bk];B[bj];W[dk];B[ck]
;W[bl];B[dj]C[(magic)
You know he will connect, so why play this move? All you do is loose a potential liberty. The important stones to capture are the three around B8.

The vital point of the white shape, if you want to cut/attack, is D11. If white protects atD12, you push and cut at E11 or vice versa.]
;W[ek];B[el];W[dm];B[bm];W[cn];B[em]C[(magic)
Again, this move is quite pointless.];W[dn];B[ak];W[di]C[(magic)
White takes the vital point.];B[hm]LB[fi:a][ei:b][fh:c][bg:d]
C[aue: seemed like a big move.  what would be better?

(magic)
'There is no territory in the centre'. It is a big move maybe in that it almost connects the three weak black stones to the black group across the board, but it doesn't attack white, take any territory or build influence.   What black should try to do is to attack the white group (which has a too small base and no eyes), in order to create some influence which goes well with the stones around, preferably with the intention to invade the bottom edge later. But it's not easy at this stage to come up with something really strong. Maybe a kikashi (forcing move) at F11 - A answered by E11 - B and followed by F12 - C would start something. Or a simple move at B13-D will remove any base white has.]
;W[df]C[(magic)

C[aue: i probably shouldn't have let him get tihs eye.];B[gd]
;W[hd];B[ff];W[fg];B[fi];W[ei];B[fh]C[(magic)
'Headbutting' into another stone is very seldom good.];W[gg]
;B[hg];W[gh];B[hi]C[(magic)
White can capture the black stones with atari at G11 and geta at G9.]
;W[fj];B[gi];W[gj]
(;B[hh]C[aue: should have thrown in at E13 first?

(magic)
In this case it makes no difference.];W[eg]C[(magic)
Ok, so white has one eye. It seems that white cannot connect up somewhere, so white has to make anoither eye somewhere. The only place possible at the moment is at  F9 - so you should play at G8 to stop this.]
;B[hk];W[fl]
(;B[fm]LB[gk:a]C[aue: this may be the move that screwes up the capture?

(magic)
Not necessarily.];W[gl];B[gk];W[hj]
(;B[ij]C[(magic)

;W[fk];B[ik]C[(magic)

;W[fn];B[al];W[hn];B[im];W[en];B[cl];W[go]C[aue: this escape cost me the game

(magic)
Let's take a step back.   As I noted earlier, the game was already very difficult for black to win. You mustn't forget that, while chasing him, you have made territory on the left side and in the centre. It is natural/normal (must be expected) that if you have a large moyo, the opponent will come into it. You should not expect to kill his group each time. A much more fruitful (and less risky) choice is to build strength around him to attack with or to cash in territory with. In this case, you did so (although not optimally). If it had been slightly different, you would have been able to use your outside force to invade or attack his lower edge - that would have made a huge difference to the game.

However, after the white group settled at the top and the right now is divided, the game becomes aven harder for black. Count again:
White: Lower around 60 points, right edge around 15,top around 10, sum 85 points. Black left (top & side) 20, right top 25, centre 20, sum 65. Black must catch up 20 points somewhere. Main places of interest are the lower left and the top edge.]
;B[bh]C[aue: I'm pretty sure I need to do this now to save lower stones

(magic)
You have a second eye if you play at B6 as well, but this is not a bad move. Staying connected is always good.]
;W[ge]
(;B[fe]C[aue: seems like I had to give up stone to connect

White wins by 17.5

I normally like to put in a summary with major mistakes/things to improve, but I found that hard in this game. However, some things stand out.
- Play the big points. In this game, there were some very big points left  (top and left edges) until quite late. Building influence is nice, but when there are still 30-points plus moves left to play, they are worth looking at. In the opening, both players are trying to build a bases for their groups. If a group fails to make a base, then chase it, that's fine. But once a group has settled, there is normally no point in hassling it locally until much later. Play elsewhere.
- Direction of play. This is difficult and nothing I can say will make you go Aaah - Yes! Every player at any level struggles with it. Bad examples in this game was the black response to the white approach in the upper right, and blacks rather useless movves wuring the fight where he lost the left side. A good example was the black response to the white approach to the upper left.
- Understanding sente plays. Several instances black did not respond to white sente plays, or had big sente plays himself which he failed to see.   In general, both players made no huge mistakes and seemed to play reasonably.  Black had by far the better opening, but was unable to draw profit from this later, and let white install herself too easily inside his moyo.
With a bit more practice, you will (both) see your rating improve quickly.

For fun, here's my favorite moves of the game:
White 18: Shame white didn't see the possibilities.
Black 89: Excellent idea - but no follow-up :-(
Black 99: Excellent idea - but no follow-up :-(

Worst moves of the game:
Black 91: Might have lost the game.
White 4: Put white at a huge disadvantage for the entire opening.

I hope that this review has been useful. I have not necessarily commented on all your variations, but sometimes I've added small notes to them. If you have any further comments, don't hesitate to contact me.

Best of luck.

This is the 'monkey jump', which is worth lots of points in sente. I've shown one of the possible follow-ups. In general, the monkey jump can be played when your stone is one line lower than the opponent's, whether or not his stones are next to your (such as here) or a line away. The best answer varies with the local situation.

BTW, in this case, the white stone on the 3-3 point makes the sequence gote for black, if black goes for the maximum points.]

(This black is necessary to avoid white pushing and cutting).

Variations on this may be whites best alternative - she has installed herself in what was a black moyo and the stone at R14 still has considerable aji will enable white to take achunk out of the corner and/or reduce the black side moyo later.]
