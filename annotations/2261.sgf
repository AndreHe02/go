C[Hi,

   I am going to be asking questions in the game where ever I was unsure about my moves, I'll label some of the options I was thinking about.  Please let me know which should I choose.  Or if my thinking is wrong.  And if you have a better suggestion for a move I played please let me know ^_^.

You win so it is a little hard to find a lot of room for improvement in your game. I did make some comments to give you something to think about. Black makes several big mistakes leading to the result. Both players show evidence of sound strategy.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dq];W[dd];B[jd];W[do]C[I played that, because I didn't want black to enclose the corner.

This seems good.];B[eo];W[en];B[dp];W[fo];B[ep];W[dn]LB[co:A]
C[

This is a firm connection, but A would be more aggressive in attacking the corner.]
;B[dj];W[dg]LB[ck:B][fl:C][gm:A]C[I played that, fellowing the rule push the stone towards your thickness.  But I was worried about D6 stones too, so I was thinking of ... A, B and C also.  Please let me know which is better.

I like the game move.];B[cg];W[cf];B[ch]C[From 18 to 27, I don't know what I was doing :(.  I was worried about the D6 stones -_- so I mucked up good :(.]
;W[cj]LB[cl:A][ck:B]C[i was thinking he will attack from above -_-
but i was wrong....

A would have helped your D6 stones while constaining b's. B would be a little more risky and, as you can see, the game move is not good.]
;B[ck];W[ci];B[di];W[dh];B[bj];W[bi];B[ai];W[bk]C[
It would have been better to sacrifice the dead stone(s) while they were 1 or 2 instead of 3.]
;B[bh];W[bo];B[bp];W[bq]LB[cp:A][ap:B]C[

You are hoping that b will play A so you can play B. Try to look for his strongest move.]
;B[ap];W[cp];B[cq];W[ao]LB[co:A]C[
If you going to play anywhere near here, play at A to connect. The game move is just another weak stone after b captures forcing you to add one more stone to protect it. A is gote, but the game move loses a stone, a point or 2 of territory, and it is gote.]
;B[co];W[cn];B[cp];W[bm]C[If a better seqence is possible for life on the side please let me know ^_^

See previous comments];B[bl];W[fp];B[fq];W[gq]LB[gm:A][gn:B]
C[Instead of this I should have connected at F6 right?

Yes, a black play on F6 divides you into 2 weak groups. Some kind of connection is called for. A or B might be best.]
;B[fn];W[fr];B[eq];W[el];B[br];W[hp];B[er];W[nq]LB[gm:A][hm:B]
C[Too far from the left side?

The real issue here is your 2 weak groups. If you played closer, it would help one of them, but I think a move like A or B is need ed to capture the cutting stone. The game move is an attacking move, but you need a defensive one.]

;B[pr];W[ro];B[qp];W[rp];B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[nr];B[sq];W[ps]
;B[os];W[or]C[That senquence black played was a bit strange, so I just played which worked best to my point of view.

You did well here. b should have played at the 3-3 point when it was clear that you had him closed in.]
;B[qf];W[nc];B[qc];W[qd]TR[jd]C[Is blocking at Q17 better?

I didn't block that way b/c I though i was close to O17 that way.

I don't know. Q17 is more defensive. Normally I would prefer the game move, but the triangle stone cramps w's position, so I am not sure.]
;B[pc];W[od];B[rc];W[rd];B[ob];W[rb]C[I though that was the virtual point in that shape .. but i forgot i need a stone at O18.]

;B[oh];W[qi];B[pf];W[oj];B[og];W[jq]LB[dn:1][hp:2][nc:3][lo:A]
[og:B]C[

A whole board evaluation: w is ahead in territory. b has 2 groups with some weakness (A and B), w has three groups with some weakness (1,2,3). The game strngthens one of w's groups and attacks one of b's so it is pretty good. I still like capturing the cutting stone at F6]
;B[jp];W[ip];B[kq];W[jo];B[kp];W[jr];B[lm];W[cl];B[ak];W[dl]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[md]C[

w strengthens 2 of his groups, so b attacks the third which is logical.]
;W[ne];B[oe]
(;W[nf]LB[kb:A];B[lc];W[of];B[pe];W[rh];B[mg];W[sg];B[rf];W[sf]
;B[fc];W[dc];B[fd]C[
w manages to save his group in the upper right, but b uses the attack to build strength to take territory at the top.  The territory is not that big because of the monkey jump potential and w gets the corner.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[je];B[ie]LB[jl:A]C[I was trying to get a small wall going o.o
to help me attack the stones at M8 ...

You are not going to get real thickness this way. You are playing too close to b's strength. This is good as a reducing sequence. A move at A would attack the b stones driving them into the center while mapping out territory for you.]
;W[he];B[if];W[hf];B[ig];W[lf]C[
These stones all look dead to me.]
(;B[mf]LB[lg:A]C[
b should just play at A and take all of the w stones.];W[le]
;B[me];W[kg];B[ke];W[ki];B[jf]C[But i relized i was going to get the wall on the wrong side, so I gave up on four stones at H14
and started comming down the center];W[jk]LB[ff:A]C[
At first I thought you should play A to save your stones. I thought that the center w stones should be able to run either to the right or the bottom.
The later course of the game shows that this is not as easy as I thought so the game move may be the best decision.]

LB[hk:A][hl:B][gk:C][gl:D]C[Too passive?
i though i needed it b/c of F6

Yes, I think you should capture on a large scale at say A-D]
;B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[pq]LB[kl:A]C[I don't think i needed that just yet ... better to attack at M9?
and fix my weakness there?

I would play in the other direction at A to capture the b stone and put the matter to rest.]
;B[no];W[mp];B[mo];W[nm];B[ml];W[pm];B[mm];W[am];B[lk];W[lj]
;B[kl]C[
Now b has 2 eyes so he is back in the game. sort of.]

;W[gj];B[gi];W[fj];B[ek];W[ej];B[ei];W[ik];B[fi]LB[dk:A]C[
b  needed to play A. Then he would be saving 3 stones and ruining some w's territory.]
;W[dk]C[from here it's pretty much over ... and i made a mistake on monkey jump.  So p.lease if you can let me know of better moves for any move i played ^_^ thanks :)]
