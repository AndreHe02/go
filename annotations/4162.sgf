AB[pd][dp]C[hello reviewer!
thank you for looking through my game
please review for black];W[dd]C[hello reviewer
thanks for reviewing(for black)

i added some comments about the game to help you understand my view of it
i am yahiko (14k kgs)-though i think i am a bit stronger
my opponent is rambam(12k kgs)

please enjoy our game:)

Though I have tried to review for the entire game, after White lost his first group, the game was virtually over. At that point it was just a mindless slaughter: an obviously upset opponent desperately struggling with his own emotions versus someone with great confidence in their own victory. Such a match is not balanced. :) So only about the first fifty moves of this game will be interesting, but I guess it might be worth it because the opening is pretty solid. But next time, submit a game where you still think hard for each move but still manage to lose by 1-10 points. :) Those might be painful to you if you hate to lose, but you stand to learn most from them, and they are the most interesting to actually review for reviewers.

Because now I do not really have any general comments for you. I cannot say much about your strengths and weaknesses overall during the game because you played consistently better than your opponent so this makes it very hard for me as a reviewer. But I think that you might be a little too territorial... Maybe in more normal games you settle for firm territory instead of attacking on a large scale? Are worried about your corner territories and start to play endgame moves early? I do not know, I can only guess, so do not shoot me for it if I am wrong. But if that is the case, then try studying / playing the three star opening as practice to make you realize the power and value of outward influence, and how much it can really benefit you to make your opponent be the one to first invade in a game. :) If you like to go through pro games, check out games where Takemiya Masaki takes Black and wins. :)

Good luck.

Here I might pincer with A or play peaceful with B. This is because I am aiming to play moves that work well with my two star point stones. The joseki starting with C emphasizes the corner territory, which, I think, is not the way you want to play in handicap games -- even with small handicap such as this. Because let's say both players play territorially, then probably it will boil down to an "win at yose, win the game" type of thing, and then naturally the stronger player will win, as it is pretty rare for Black to be better at the endgame than White in a handicap game.

Well, "there are no rules for kyus," but still...]
(;B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[np];B[qn];W[jp]LB[fc:B][hq:A]C[---
To be honest I do not know which one is better, A or B. Sorry. A, preventing the approach move is OK in my eyes. But also realize that you can't really hope to get an attack on this White group on the bottom yet, so A would only be to prevent the approach move. I would probably play B, but that is personal intuition and I can't defend it.]
;B[hq];W[nc]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[
---
Of the two, I think A is better, because it keeps a good balance with the low stones on the bottom.]
;B[qf]TR[qn]C[---
Now this side looks low and flat = uninteresting.];W[jd];B[cf]
;W[fd]TR[jd]LB[bd:a][dj:b]C[---
I would just play B and White would probably have to invade san-san, which is something I dearly welcome in handicap games.

A removes all future potential in the upper corner for Black and giving White a move at 3-3 is considered good for White when he has a stone around where the marked stone is, I think.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[cn]LB[co:A][bp:B]TR[ci]C[while reviewing it myself i decided that my new variation would have been much better

what do you think about the opening so far?

---
I think the move you played is fine. I don't think Black has lost any of his two-stone advantage yet.

Here, of the two moves, I actually like B better, because it calmly takes territory and keeps White weak Had the marked stone been one line lower, I would have played A.]

(;B[bp];W[ck]LB[pj:a][en:b][ho:c][ek:d]C[---

I think both A B and D might be bigger than C. C pressures K4 slightly and maybe secures a little territory. B and D attacks the new White group very severely and he will have to run.]

(;B[ho];W[fp]
(;B[fq]C[--

Defensive, territorial, "small-minded"... This is the kind of moves White is hoping for in handicap games.]
;W[eq];B[ep];W[gq]C[would you please show me an alternative way of playing my next moves that is reasonable

---
The way you played in the game is best. :) Always take the outside when White has weak groups nearby.]

This is excellent result for black even if White lives! The thickness on the outside is worth a gazillion more points than the 2-3 points White would get. :) Just appreciate how miserable the marked stones look now.]

It's not "settled", it's "dead as a doornail" and it's time to resign ;)]

(;W[hp];B[ip];W[io];B[hp];W[hn]LB[gn:A][in:B][jo:C]C[---
If your plan is to play A anyway, it's better to just omit forcing with B first. C looks a big interesting too.]

You don't need to "fight" this ko.];W[gm];B[en];W[do];B[co]
;W[om]LB[ld:C][ej:B][pl:A]C[---
I would play A. This looks like it takes territory in sente. Given your style up to now, I would expect B, which I think is a more risk-free way of playing than C, even though it's kinda small.

Another point here is: you are way ahead. Way way ahead, and you have to have realized this even if you do not count, so you should've just played constructive, peaceful moves. Invasions and reduction is for when you are BEHIND.]

(;B[ld]C[i was not sure where to play at this stage of the game
probably it was a weak move. please comment on this

;B[kc];W[kd];B[mc];W[lb];B[md];W[mb];B[nd]C[---
You're lucky White let you have the outside, so now your invasion was partly justified...]
;W[qc]LB[pk:A][pl:B]C[---
I'd probably be happy to let White have the corner to play a move like A or B, but your move is bit too.]

(;B[nb]C[i like this cut];W[kb];B[oc];W[ql]LB[ej:D][pj:B][qj:C]
[pl:A]C[---
Big. This is what the move at A tried to avoid. Now your wall isn't as effective. As White I would probably have played something even lighter though.

As you are winning by a wide margin, I'd just play B C or D.]
;B[kk]C[i wanted to go into whites area

---
This is a very greedy and domineering way of playing. ;) You are winning by some fifty points and are still not satisfied.

But I'd say it's a little too aimless... You can't really use this stone as a "base" to jump into White's area. He will ignore it, build influence, and then come back to attack your entire group later. (See later variation for quick example.)]

;B[bf];W[be];B[ef];W[de]LB[ff:A][bh:B]C[---
Of A and B, A is much bigger.]
(;B[bh];W[fg];B[ae]C[---
Before playing moves like this, check what move number you're up to. If it's about this size or less and the move counter is below 150, just forget it. And if it's gote... wait until move 200, at least.

(These aren't actual instructions, but what I'm trying to say is: wait! :)]

Indeed. But really, at this point you might as well close your eyes and just click at random for the ten next moves... You'd still win.]

[sh][qi][qj][qk][ol][pl][ql][rl][om][qm]C[its dead isnt it?
---
Yes, it was dead a couple of moves ago. White dies in gote. This is definitely not KGS 12k play.

Some people get too upset to play properly when things do not go their way. They play in pure frustration, which makes them lose at least five stones, only worsening the game and the negative emotions they feel. I feel sorry for White at this point. I know that letting go of one's ego in go is a hard thing to do.]

i think my opponent got impatient and made some mistakes
but i really tried hard not to respond blindly but to make good moves.thats why i decided to let the game be reviewed.

probably my opponent was either a bit weaker than his rank says or i am stronger-however i enjoyed this game,particularly the opening

if you could also give a comment on the whole game it would be very nice

The territorial exhance in the corner made up a 20-25 point difference maybe, but it is important to remember that White's corner has no development potential. It has no future. From here Black can play moves like A and B, so Black's moyo has a future.]
