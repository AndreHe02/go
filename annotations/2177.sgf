Hi,
During most of the game, b played steadily and solidly and got some very good chances for attack when w left weak stones inside b's sphere of influence, but  let them off the hook too easily. I have tried to mark some crucial moments  where following some simple principles could have given a better result. 
I have included some variations to show what could have happened, but there might have been better ones, so take same just as examples of what could have happened.

Since you asked for some general coments, I would give you the following advices:

1 Don't invade too early. In the game you got your first problems bc you started un unclear invasion during the fuseki  while there were still good points for some speedy development.

2. Don't permit you oponent's weak stones to settle themselves too easily within your sphere of influence

3. Don't touch what you want to attack


A very good book I could recommend is "Attack and defense" published by Ishi Press. It covers all the main principles of attacking and the use of thickness. If you haven't read it yet, this could help you a lot.]
;W[pd];B[dp];W[pq];B[po];W[mp]CR[np]C[Jos:  O4 is a well known joseki, N4 is not listed in the Ishida  Joseki Dictionary and I can't remember seeing it, so it might be freelancing]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[op]TR[kq][or]C[White P4 doesnt look like joseki, or does it? I regretted that I didnt choose R14 as my next move instead of R9, since after white P4 instead of P2 I could easily make a base in sente wih S2.


Jos: P4 looks certainly strange since it leaves 2 obvious weaknesses at the marked spots. W will have to invest at least one mor move in order to stabilize this formation.P2 should have been played.]

(;B[qk]C[Jos: The extension, that you regretted, IMHO is still the right joice.If w leaves her group with a weaknes, there is no reason for you to do the same. Personally  I prefer the tighter extension at R8, but the general idea should be correct.
If b plays at R14 instead, w will propably split the black stones and there is no garantee that b gets to play S2 in sente. chances are, that w gets to play  S2 first and the b stones come under attack.]
;W[iq];B[gq]TR[nc][jd][ce]C[jos: I can't really say wether G2 is a bad move but I would argue as follows:
- for an extension from the hoshi, G2 is to narrow
- for a shimari, it is to lose

developing the left or upper border at the marked spots seems more attractive to me.]
;W[cj];B[kq]TR[cf][ch]C[I wonder whether this invasion was not a little bit too early


Jos: right. While L3 is a perfect place to start an attack, it is way too early - a common mistake of Kyu-players and believe me, I know what I am talking about:) You will hardly ever see a Pro invading so early.
Why not just grap one of the big points like the marked spot
 and leave w to worry about her weaknesses. Even if she gets to play another stone to protect her group, it means tha b will get sente to play another big point. Chances are that an invasion turns out bad for the invader and this will influence the development of the game.]
;W[jo]TR[jp]C[Jos: K4 would be a standart reply, the idea beeing to prevent b fom linking up to the G3-stone.]

(;B[or]TR[ko]CR[gq][kq]C[Things are beginning to get complicated ...


Jos: Since b has started the action, he should have some plan about what he wants to achieve.At first glance, there are 2 possibilities: splitting the w stones at L5 or trying to link the marked stones. P2 looks like b is trying to get a small life inside the w formation. 

I have tried to give some variations which I do not claim to be necessarily the best ones, but as you can see,  it is not clear that the result is allways good for b. One more reason why L3 was too early]
;W[oq]C[Jos; I don't see any reason not to answer at Q2. At the very least, it is better shape.]

(;B[nr]TR[kq]C[Jos:  Maybe here would have been a chance to settle the situation by cutting at Q2. I don't see a way for w to save the R2 stone so b will get the corner and doesn't have to worry about the R3 group any more ( after a w invasion later at R7 e.g.) while still keeping the aji of the marked stone for later use or getting sente bc w decides to add another stone in order to erase that aji)]
;W[pr];B[mq];W[lp];B[kp];W[ko]
(;B[ip]C[Would J2 have been bettter?

Jos: J2 will lead to some nasty fighting -see variations- with chances for both sides. But since b suffered a loss in the game any way, it might have been an alternative.]
;W[jp]
(;B[jq]LB[ir:A]C[
jos : A could be tried here, but the result don't loojk convincing for b, either]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[lr];B[hq];W[lq];B[hr];W[io];B[hp]LB[rr:A][rs:B]
TR[qm]C[I wasnt quite satisfied ooks like the white stones have better shape and a more efficient. Also white has got sente ... Is this result to be regarded as a big loss for black or only a minor?

Jos: Let's see: In the beginning of b's attack, w had a weakness at L3 which now has gone, w can start counting territory around O2 and has maintained thickness towards the center. Furthernore the w weakness at Q2 is covered and b lost a big endgame sente at S2 and now even has to worry about a w invasion at R7 since b  A can now be answered with w B. 

In contrast, b got 4 points of territory by capturing 2 w stones and still has to add one more move at C4 to at least get the corner territory

so yes,  while not necessarily game deciding, w is  better off in this situation.]
;W[cp];B[co]C[Jos: good !!]
(;W[dq];B[bp]
(;W[cq];B[bq];W[do];B[ep];W[br];B[cn];W[ar]TR[er]C[Jos: b misses a chance here. After E2 w can't live in the corner and has to run. B should be able to get advabtage in development.]

(;B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[cs];W[bs];B[es];W[cr]C[This development I thought was good for black since the loss of territory seemed sufficiently compensated by outer influence.]

(;B[fm]LB[co:B][cp:A]SQ[nn]CR[ch]C[This move was supposed to prevent the black stones to the left from being cut of as well as to eliminate the value of the white wall. But it adds to the overconcentration of the black stones and I wonder whether something like D9 or C14 would have been better.


Jos: IMHO it was the right decision to take the outside influence and concede w some small life in the corner by answering A with B. But F7 seems too slow and also overconcentrated. If you are worried about w's influence, there is a nice move at O6 : it covers the weakness at R7, threatens a cut M5 and a b extension around R14 really starts to look hot.

b has to try to make some use of his thickness. i would play around C12 in order to develop the ul corner and deny the w C10 stone a base an the left side. With a weak group on the left side, it won't be easy for w to pull out D5]
;W[ce]LB[cf:A][cg:B]C[jos: I would have choosen A or B. But C15 seems possible]

(;B[dh]LB[cg:A][dg:C][ch:B][dh:D]TR[ed][fd][fm]C[Weird move I guess. I was very much in doubt what to do here. Probably splitting at C13 would have been better?


jos:  Actually, it is quite hard to effectively invade the w group There are many possibilities starting from A to D, but somehow w always seems to be able to handle the situation ( see some var. for b 59)
The normal joseki would be at E16 or F16.];W[bh]
(;B[cd];W[de];B[fd]C[Jos: I really think the development on the left side is too peacefull  and w gets away too easily. 

Let's see:
1. b started by giving up his corner territory in the ll corner in order to get influence on the left side, thus making the w C10 stone feel lonely and weak

2. b invested 2 more stones at F7 andD12 

3. b permitted w  to easily settle the group on the left side that started out as a weak group. At this moment the 2 b stones at D12 and F7 and the b influence have almost completely lost their meaning, so w got the ll corner in exchange for nothing, this feels unsatisfactory for b.


If you have influence, try to use it by pushing some weak stones of your opponent against it. So you can develop on the other side while keeping up the pressure on the weak stones
If there are no weak stones, try to expand the potential for territory in front of the thickness

if there are neither weak stones to push nor territory, then the influence loses its meaning and is wasted]
;W[ej];B[nc]LB[jc:A][nc:B][qf:D][nn:C]C[This I tenuki I was quite satisfied with. Wrongly?

Since the situation on the left side is settled for the time being, it is surely right for b to go for the remaining big points. My choices would be one of the points A-D. Hard to say which one is the best, might be a matter of personal taste, but I still like the idea of C.]
;W[jc];B[qf]C[Jos: nice!];W[qc]C[I guess white should have played P15 here. The later positive development for black was perhaps more due to white's mistake here than black's good moves.

You are right. R17 is looking for a quick life but it inevitably will concede outside influence to b. The last thing w should want in this situation is letting b build up a moyo on the right  and letting the K17 stone become weak.]
;B[oe];W[qh]CR[nc][qc][pd][oe][qf]C[Jos: the formation of the marked stones is well known and the w corner should be allive, but it is not an easy life. Here is a chance to question R12. See variation]

(;B[ph]LB[hc:A]C[Jos: the problem of Q12 is that it violates the principle of     " don't touch what you want to attack"

W has left a barly living group in the corner and 2 weak stones on the sides. What b needs now is an attacking plan. In the last variation b starts by attacking the corner
( which is allive anyway) w can' help but struggle for a small life while helping b to strengthen himself. 
This way the w K12 stone will almost automatically get swallowed and there are follow-up moves like A to get more profit from attacking K17 
This kind of strategy could be called a "leaning attack". You lean on one group of your oponent anhd get ready to attack the others. 

But now b forces w to defend the stone that could have been his prey.]
;W[qg]
(;B[pf]C[Probably Q14 and letting white live easily on the side while make thickness on the outside would have been much better.

Jos: Chances are that the w corner is dead if w doesn't answer since the push at Q15 in the variation is essential. If w lives in the corner and gets away with the daring R12 stone, something is going wrong for b.]
;W[pi];B[ok];W[pg];B[og];W[oh]C[The w corner is propably dead now. See variations
Of course it is impossible for us Kyu-players to read out the whole problem, but keep in mind for the future that just having a stone on 3-3 doesn't mean that a group is unconditionally allive.]

(;B[ng];W[hc];B[ff]LB[gb:A][bd:B][be:C]CR[hc][jc]C[Jos: F14 doesn't accomplish much. The 2 marked stones now have a small base on the upper side and still a lot of breathing space. It will not be easy to attack them efficently
But there is a dangerous cut that b should prevent first

I'd play either at A to attack the base of the w stones or at B/ to at least keep the corner]
;W[dd]
(;B[ec];W[cc]
(;B[bd]C[jos: extending the stone in atari is often good, but here it may have been better to get a secure hold for the D17 group in the corner by giving a counter atari at C18.]
;W[bc];B[bg];W[cg]
(;B[bf]C[I originally planned to play B11 instead. It most likely would have been much better.

Hard to see what b can achieve here. The variation with B11 looks even better for w.]

(;B[nh]C[Jos : in the ur quarter, w has 3 groups that still don't have 2 sure eyes while b has only 1 group to worry about.

While O12 surely is a thick move, it forces w to fix her shape.. I still think it would have been better to start with attacking the corner, gather some strength and then to set up some kind of splitting attack.]
;W[ni];B[oj]C[Bad kikashi I guess. I should probably have played N11 and launched an atack on the upper white stones. But I was beginning to get nervous about the black stones in the left corner ...

Your guess is right. P10 is one of those aji keshi moves, we kyu players just can't resist to play as early as possible.
I think it is because of the satisfaction of at least once forcing your opponent to answer where you want him to answer.]
;W[oi];B[pb]C[Jos: ah!!!];W[qb];B[jf]C[Jos: but now b tries to attack everything at once, propably the reason why w finally got away]

;W[ra];B[kb];W[mc];B[ib]C[Jos: since L18 allready prevents w from getting 2 eyes at the side, b should start to further block the escape routes. Of course the upcoming variation was hard to see.]
