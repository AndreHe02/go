Reviewer - I am looking for any comments that would be helpful to my play in general.

I am fairly new to the game, having only played for about 3 weeks on 9x9s, this being my 3rd 19x19 game. I assume I am rated around 30k-28k due to just starting out, but do not know exact Kyu due to lack of 19x19 games played..

Although I did win by a large margin, I also made many mistakes, so pointers on the mistakes I made would be great. If you do have time though, general comments on my gameplay throughout the game would be wonderful, as I have been studying the game, as a whole, daily, and would love real world advice to put with the book knowledge I have gained. Anything is appreciated, and I thank you for your time.

Thank you,

LB[dd:D][pj:B][fq:C][oq:A]C[Carey: White's J7 is completely non-threatening.  There is no need to respond to it.

Generally most moves are made on the 3rd or 4th line in the beginning.  At this point, I would recommend any of the moves marked to this one.

A makes a shape known as a shimari, which is a very strong shape.

B will give you more influence on the right side

C will start an attack on white's stones

D will take a large corner, E15 was a bad move to begin with.  See variation]

(;W[in];B[dj];W[kg];B[kf]LB[dg:A][cn:B]TR[jf][lf]C[Carey: Again, white is making very non-threatening, spread out moves, I would be more included to follow up on that lone stone you have deep inside his framework.  A or B are ideal

Generally, a move like L14 is bad.  Connecting to an enemy stone is asking for trouble.  Next is white's turn and she can play K14 or M14 and already be ahead in the liberty rate.  

Liberties are the number of empty spaces surrounding a group of stones]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[kj]SQ[jg];B[oj]C[Carey: 5th line is probably too far.  Allows room for white to possibly live underneath it.  Q10 or R10 are better]
;W[ie];B[id];W[hd];B[hc];W[gd];B[gc];W[fc];B[fb];W[ec];B[eb]
;W[db];B[da];W[ca];B[ea]TR[gb]C[Carey: incorrect move, white's move at G18 can kill the 4 stones now

Generally, it's best to leave moves on the first line until the end of the game.  There are much larger moves out there.]
;W[cb]C[Carey: White missed it];B[gb];W[dd];B[dg];W[eg];B[eh]
;W[fh]
(;B[ef]C[Carey: I think F13 would have been better, see variation]
;W[fg];B[df];W[ei];B[dh];W[ej];B[ek];W[fk]
(;B[dl]LB[el:A]C[Carey: No reason for black not to play A here.  Now white can play A with Atari

Atari is when a group of stones have only one liberty left]
;W[el];B[dk]C[See variation];W[cf];B[ce];W[bf];B[bg];W[be];B[bd]
LB[cg:A]C[Carey: Black should just play A];W[cd];B[de];W[bc]

;B[bn];W[bo];B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[ag];B[ah];W[ad];B[af]LB[qd:C]
[qj:B][gq:D][oq:A]C[Carey: Small move for black, save it for later.  White can still invade the top right corner, as well as the right side.  Any of these marked moves would be better.]

;W[cq];B[dr];W[cr];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds];W[fp];B[fq];W[jm];B[ln]
LB[kn:A]C[Carey: Same deal as before.  Black is leaving a spot for white to put him into atari.  Black shoudl have simply played A]
;W[kn];B[jo];W[ko];B[lp];W[kp];B[kq];W[km];B[iq];W[lr];B[lq]
LB[lo:A]C[Carey: a response at A would have been better.  White's play at M2 was completely unwarranted, and has no chance of living]
;W[lo];B[mo];W[mn];B[lm];W[no];B[mm];W[nn];B[mp];W[nm]
(;B[ml]LB[mk:A]C[Carey: play at A would have been preferable for black, see variations]
;W[nk];B[nl];W[ok];B[ol];W[pk];B[op];W[lk];B[om]LB[pl:A]C[White is going to have an impossible time living with those stones anyway, Black should have played at A, surround them on a larger scale]
;W[pm];B[on];W[gq];B[hq]LB[gr:A]C[Carey: Black A was the only correct move.  H3 should only be used if the invading white stones puts black in atari, but they don't in this case, so white G3 is just a suicide stone.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[oo]C[Carey The bottom left requires immediate attention by both sides.  White F2 can kill the black group, and black F2 can save it.]
;B[po];W[kr];B[jr];W[mr];B[nr];W[nq];B[np]C[Carey: P2 would have been preferable for black]
;W[or];B[pr];W[ll];B[pn];W[qm];B[qh];W[mk];B[nn]C[Carey: Completely uncessary for black.  To make a group live, you don't *have* to get two eyes, you just have to make sure you have enough room for it.  There is no place in that formation that white can invade to make that space less than two eyes.]
;W[nh];B[oh];W[ng];B[nf];W[mf];B[me]TR[nf]C[Black should be trying to stop white on a much larger scale.  Close contact like this is the worst way to stop a pushing opponent.]
;W[ne];B[of];W[le];B[md];W[ld];B[lf];W[mg];B[lc];W[lg];B[og]
C[Carey: well played by black];W[ni];B[oi];W[nj];B[pl];W[pj]
;B[qj]C[Carey: again, avoid contact plays like this.  It's like banging your head (your single stone) into a wall (white's strong collection of stones).]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[qi]C[Carey: white should of S10, then atari with S8]
;B[rj];W[ql];B[pi];W[ri];B[si];W[rl];B[rh];W[sk];B[sj]C[Carey: uncessesary.  white can't play there herself or she'll put herself in atari.]
;W[sl];B[rn]
(;W[qn];B[os]C[Carey: white's bottom group already has very little, if no chance of living.  see variations]

;W[kd];B[jc];W[kc];B[kb];W[lb];B[kf]C[Carey: No purpose to this move.  Eyespace only matters when it's the only eye.]

(;W[ke]C[Carey: White really should have played O16 here and capture 4 stones.  See variation]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[nd];W[oe];B[pe]C[Carey: P16 would have been better for black, still captures white in a ladder and relieves the pressure on the N16 group.]

;W[qa];B[rd];W[rc];B[sc];W[sb];B[ra];W[sd];B[se];W[sc];B[qd]
;W[sf];B[re];W[rg];B[rb]C[Carey: Unneeded move, black lost a point

Every time you place a stone in your own territory, it's a point lost.  This is because you are filling in a space that would otherwise be empty, and worth points.  

Of course every time your opponent places a stone in your territory, it's an extra point, because of the capture.  So if you choose not to repond to your opponent in your own territory, each time you ignore him, you gain a point.]
;W[sa];B[rb];W[ra];B[rb]C[Carey: There was really no need to go through with that, both players should have read ahead and realized white was already dead because white had only one eye]
;W[sn];B[so]C[Carey: Bad move for black, white can S5, see variation.]
