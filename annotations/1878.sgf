RE[W+55.5]

C[hello and thanks for sharing your knowledge in advance... Usually i play 9x9 games but i read in a review that 19x19 games are much different in stragtegy than 9x9 games so i would have to switch some day. So i recently started to play 19x19 games. I think i have problems usually in the center area of the board. I'd be glad if you could point those out...

Hello, first of all some fundamental things (mostly for the future):

Concerning the game you send in:

Sending in games, that you have lost and  better relatively close, are better than games that you have won. If you have won a game there is not much one can say about your faults. It is better to comment on a lost game because there is more to comment on and your weaknesses are clearer to see (for the commentator and for you, too)
    
I don't know if your game was played under time-pressure. It is better to send in games where you have enough time to think. Making an error under time-pressure can turn the outcome of a game. 

Now some things concerning your style of play:

You played generally quite good for an igs-26k and please be not angry that I didn't state this more often. I wanted to point out what I think was not good, in order to help you become stronger.  I'm now a 11k and on igs still a 16k or so since I didn't play there for quite a while, and I don't know everything, too and make enough errors myself;) So I hope my comments can help you. The "weaknesses" I found in your game, are, first of all, that you have a really territorial style; this is not generally a weakness but you didn't know how to handle the opponent's central influence. This is surely due to your inexperience with 19x19 games and I sometimes pointed out where I would play with my justification for these moves. But this was not the reason for losing your game as your opponent didn't know what to make with his influence, too.  
You played really agressive a made some attacking moves that were not too good. I commented on them, too.
You will see that you were though ahead for a long time but that your staying agressive and not playing safe lost the game. When you are ahead you should always not play too agressive. You should play safe. It is the opponent who should try out some agressive things which could turn out dangerous for himself in order to catch up. You shouldn't take big risks when you lead.  

I liked reviewing you game your game and hope that I could give you some hints that help you!]
;B[qp];W[pc];B[dd];W[dp]C[Up to now, there is nothing for me to say about your game. I have a comment on the next move.]
;B[ei]LB[dj:A][cj:B][oq:C][qj:D][qe:E]C[The marked move is on the fifth line and leaves the left side open for White. Moves like a or b are more often seen and make it harder for White. You have surely heard about the difference of a stone on the third line which stresses territory and a stone on the fourth line aiming at getting influence. A stone on the fifth line is stressing influence, too, but has less territorial effect. A move at c is in my opinion a very big point making the lower right corner quite safe and aiming at either d or e. After the marked move which White needs not answer directly and immediately, White has the initiative and can play at e (or c) or where he wants to play.]
;W[qe];B[pf]LB[oq:A][jc:B][dn:C][cn:D]TR[pc][qe]C[i'm going to lose that corner later in the game so i think there is a better move...

At this stage of the game this is not a very good move. This corner can under normal circumstances not be snatched away from White and this very close move forces White to
strengthen his own position. After a further White move it will be even harder for Black to get a good result in the upper right. Black should play somewhere else and watch how the whole position develops; attacking now takes away chances of getting a good attack later when you see from side it is better to attack from. In Go, attacks are often started from a little distance and the objects which are attacked are mostly weak groups which have to run for their life while attacking gives the side which is attacking a good result, even if the weak group manages to live. This attacking move is really near to the object which should be attacked.  The problem is that such near play can get your own stone into trouble, too, and that it is very easy for White to answer. Moreover White has in the upper right a very solid formation. Black should in my opinion either play at a, making a bit of territory but losing the initiative again or play either at b, c or d. The marked White stones have power to the left and a white move at b would be very good for White and also for Black since it is an extension from the upper left starpoint . A move at c or d would almost definitively force White to answer. Here you can also see the difference between an approach on the third line aiming at territory and an approach on the fourth line which is seeking influence.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[od];B[ne];W[oq];B[pq]LB[jq:A][po:B][op:C][np:D]
[mq:E][pn:F][qm:G]C[This move is normally played when you already have some helping forces somewhere around a. Possible answers I would play here are b, threatening to press down at d later, or c. Both stress the right side. A pincer would also be good here, preventing White from building up something strong on the lower side. F and g are silent responses.]
;W[op];B[oo]LB[po:A][pn:B][no:C]TR[qp]C[I find this move quite dangerous. Attacking moves are almost never contact plays. This move actually invites White to play at c. The knights-move-relation between the marked stones is really not safe here. A or b are surely safer.]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[ps];B[qs];W[nr];B[mq]TR[oo][qp]C[This attacking move is also very near. The connection of the marked stones is still not safe. There is a proverb saying that one should make oneself strong before attacking.]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[mr]TR[lq][mq]LB[lr:A]C[The shape formed by the three marked stones is generally looked upon as bad shape. The reason for this is that this shape has less liberties than other ones. There can be made more powerful shapes with three stones.]
;W[kq];B[kr];W[jq];B[jr]TR[kr][mr][mq][lq]C[Crawling along the second line is generally not seen as good for Black. With every move along the second line, Black makes one point of territory, while White builds up a kind of wall. However, in 9x9-games this is not really bad, as a wall is not definitively giving a good exchange. However, in this situation the marked black stones should live, so this move is not so bad.]

(;W[iq];B[ir];W[np];B[ns]SQ[hr]LB[ls:A][or:B]C[would it do me any good to push on h2 anymore???

H2 would not be so good. The hane at H3 or G3 would be better. However, all this crawling along brings White quite a powerful formation. Black needs not worry anymore about the life of his lower center group anymore: A and b are miai for life.]
;W[nq];B[ms]C[This move was not necessary. There is nothing to be afraid of.]
;W[ko];B[gq];W[dm];B[cn];W[dn];B[cm];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[cq]
;W[cp];B[bn];W[fp];B[fq];W[gp];B[eq];W[ep];B[hp];W[hq];B[hr]
;W[hn]LB[dl:A][jc:B][pj:C][pk:D][cl:E][ck:F]TR[cm][cn][bn][bo]
C[I would find the hane at a a good and important play here. There is a proverb saying "hane at the head of two". This is surely not bad here. Black has made some territory on the lower side in exchange for a superb white position aiming at the center. Now there should be something done to weaken the influence of this formation. Something like b or something on the right side like c or d would also be not too bad, but think of the difference between black a and white e or f which is attacking the marked stones. Therefore I find this point really primary. After Black a the cutting point at e is defended and Black need not worry about it, as the variation shows.]

(;B[gl]C[This stone seems to me like a stranded stone somewhere in White's sphere of influence. White can easily set up an attack on this stone. Something I would play as White here is shown in the variation.]

(;W[km];B[cl]TR[gl]C[This invites White to make some extra power and weaken the marked stone. A hane would still have been possible, although the marked stone would be weakened.]
;W[dl];B[ck];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[fb]LB[df:A][cf:B][cg:C]C[A, b or c would be better here, I think]
;W[ic];B[gc];W[gd];B[hc];W[hd];B[ib];W[jc];B[id]LB[ld:A][pj:B]
[fj:C]TR[gl]C[i think k18 was better...

k18 would give White a wall in the upper side, too. Up to now Black has stressed territory and seems to be ahead, But White could make use of his influence. Black should try to make some influence himself. I would play at a, or b which is a very important point. Black could also use the fact that White did not do really much against the marked stone with something like c. White wouldn't have it too easy in the centre.]

(;W[ej];B[di];W[ek];B[el];W[fl];B[fm];W[em];B[fl]TR[dg][dh]
[eh][fh][gh][fi][fj][ej][ek]LB[qf:A]C[Now take a look at the whole board. Black has territory on the left, on the upper side and on the lower side, and prospects of a great territory on the lower side. Where is White's territory? Ther is almost none! White has some definitive territory in the upper right and now hardly any chances to turn the center in enough territory for him to win. This game should be over now. Black should soon play at a, and leave the  decision to White. White can either make some kind of invasion on the right side, losing his possibilities in the center. If White tries to make something out of his center, Black should just take calmly the right side, getting more than a good exchange for the center. This would never be enough for White to win.]
;W[ch];B[bg];W[bh];B[bf];W[cj];B[dj];W[bj];B[bi];W[ce];B[cd]
;W[be];B[ae];W[mf];B[me]LB[of:A]C[i'm starting to lose the game with this move. what was the better alternative?

After this move White can cut at a and cause a lot of trouble. I think it would be better to sacrifice these five stones and play somewhere else.]
;W[lg];B[kg]LB[kh:A][pj:B][jk:C]C[This move provokes white a. In my opinion, b or c would be quite nice here.]
;W[kh];B[nf]LB[of:A]C[O13 maybe??

The played stone forms an empty-triangle-shape again. But O13 seems no too good to me either, as it doesn't make much against a white play at a. Perhaps simply connecting at a is good, but it forms an empty-triangle-shape, too.]
;W[ng];B[lf];W[mg];B[og];W[oh];B[ph];W[nh];B[li]LB[lh:A][mi:B]
[pi:C][ke:D]TR[jf][kf][kg][lf][le][ld][md][me][ne][oe][nf][og]
[pf][ph]CR[of]MA[ng][pe]C[This move is again a little too deep. On the one hand it is a kind of unlucky forcing move, threatenening to cut at a. However White need not connect at a but can play at b preventing the cut. In order to cut Black would then have to play a further stone. This is not what a forcing move should be. A forcing move should force the opponent to make one move which has almost no effect, and play yourself a stone which can be left as it stands: The opponent made no better move, so you can even give up this stone if you like. But the stone is there and can help you later.  A move like c would be not bad here, because the marked group is not really safe yet. The circled point is no eye, because of the eye-stealing realtion of the two squared stones: After a White play at d, Black has to "close" this eye.]

(;W[lh];B[mi]TR[li]LB[pi:A][jk:B]C[Now, Black makes his own stones heavy. The marked stones can not easily be connected to other black forces. A play like A or b would be not bad here. You would threaten to connect this stone and White should react. The right side is important.]
;W[oi];B[pi];W[qf];B[pg]LB[qg:A][ke:B]C[You see that a play at a would create a bad position for Black (after White b).]
;W[qg];B[qh];W[rh];B[ri];W[sh];B[jj]TR[li][mi]LB[ij:A][si:B]
[pj:C][pk:D][jk:E]C[This stone invites White to play at a. The creation of the marked group is not too good. Black gives White a good aim to attack. These stones will have a hard time and while White chases this group he will make quite a lot of territory. Black would use this group and sacrifice it, threatening to connect it to the outside and making white's center smaller with c, d or e, enlarging his own territory. I would vote for c, giving your own weak group room to breathe and putting some pressure on your opponents weak group.]
;W[ij];B[kj];W[ik];B[il];W[jk];B[kl];W[jl]TR[il]MA[mi][li][kj]
[jj][kl]LB[pj:A]C[Black need not necessarily rescue the marked stone. This changes the result by about two points. Black should better look at the marked stones which are in immediate danger of being captured. I don't think, they can be rescued,but they can be used, for example with the play at a, which I still like. White kills the stones which are already almost dead, takes a little territory, and Black takes much mor territory simply by threatening to rescue them and wins the game.]
;B[hl];W[jm]MA[mi][li][kj][jj][kl]LB[pj:A][ok:B][nm:C]C[i dont even get this one... how can i stop it??

The marked stones seem to be really lost now. Something like a,b or c would not rescue them, but make white's territory smaller.]
;B[kk];W[mk];B[oj];W[nj];B[ni];W[mj];B[ll];W[ml];B[lm];W[mm]
;B[ln];W[mn];B[om];W[ok]C[Now the situation is not so good for Black anymore, but Black still would have the advantage.]

(;B[pj]TR[oj]MA[ni][mi][li][kj][jj][kk][kl][ll][lm][ln]LB[qk:A]
C[Instead of rescuing the marked stone, Black could play at a and live (-> Variation to the move before). With the loss of this group Black loses the game; this group consists later of almost 25 stones. They are:

-captives of White
-territory for White (after taken out)

So they "count double" (as every dead stone does). That makes a total difference of about 50 points. As Black defends on the "dead side of the group" there is still the possibility for White to go further down, and you see that the game would have been in your favor.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[ql];B[pl];W[pm];B[ol];W[pn];B[qm]C[i saw O9 when i was going over game. i have to be more careful :))

O9 would have been good, but White could have prevented it by simply not playing 192.]
