*This is one of my game from the Xiong Yupei cup. I'm a 13k. I wanted to learned particularly what i did wrong in my fuseki and the 2 fights at move 49 and 109. At move 49, he made a invasion and move 109, i try to kill his group but i think i did not respond correctly. Please enlighten me and spot my weakness. Tell me what i need to brush up on too. Thanks in advance.]

C[[Malweth\]: This move seems slow and inconsistent with the original plan of the fuseki. White is matching her moyo versus Black's.

This move regards the lower left corner only. Black's moyo is getting too big, so now seems like the right time to invade... otherwise any invasion/reduction will become too small.]
;B[qo]C[[Malweth\]: Now an invasion in the Lower right is impossible. Black understood White's mistake and countered correctly.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[ne]LB[oo:A][np:B][kn:C][jq:D]C[[Malweth\]: A reduction of Black's moyo is still possible in the Lower Right. Possible points for reduction are lettered.

One of these moves would be best timed now, and the winner will likely be decided by the fighting that occurs.]
;B[ng];W[fo];B[hp];W[hn]C[[Malweth\]: This plan is interesting, but a bit loose. There are many places Black can take advantage of white's position.

This is also showing a total lack of regard for the lower left corner, which means the C6 stone is misplaced.]
;B[md];W[nd];B[me];W[mf];B[nf]
(;W[lf]C[[Malweth\]: This fight seems unreasonable and unnecessary for White. See the variation.]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[lb];W[nb];B[kc];W[jc]
(;B[ke];W[kd];B[kf];W[le];B[jn]C[[Malweth\]: Black's moyo is huge now... a reduction will be hard.]
;W[il]C[[Malweth\]: This is actually a fairly small move at this point... White's moyo is loose and fairly small. Black has the right idea when he enters the UL corner, (though approaching the corner may have been best.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[bd];W[be]
;B[bc];W[ce];B[dh]C[*Here is the invasion. I was thinking should i block from the top or make him run for life. In the end,i played c17, thinking of taking profit first while attacking. But it failed horribly.

[Malweth\]: Black doesn't really have a lot to worry about. You have to push him toward the white wall, but that means he will try to escape toward the lower right. It's hard with the aji at L14 good for Black!]
;W[ci];B[ej]
(;W[ek]C[[Malweth\]: If you want to try killing D12, E11 is the only move, but the ladder must be checked! See variation...]
;B[di];W[ck];B[fj];W[fh];B[ei];W[lh]C[[Malweth\]: Instead of this, attacking further might work better. It's usually a good idea to play away from fighting, but the moves must be sente!

Think about White H11.];B[fk];W[el];B[ij]C[[Malweth\]: Black is alive now... and White has nearly zero territory.]

C[XC [13k\]: Galatia's got it];W[kl];B[hl];W[hm];B[if];W[gi]
C[[Malweth\]: Think about moves like this before you play them. What's the most obvious answer? Does the obvious answer work for W or for B?]
;B[fi];W[mq]C[[Malweth\]: It may be past time for an invasion, but what else can you do?]
;B[kq]C[B's best move was probably the cap...];W[mo];B[np];W[mp]
;B[on]C[[Malweth\]: The cap wouldn't work now... too easy for W to connect. The invasion was a success.]
;W[mm];B[kg]
(;W[ni]C[[Malweth\]: This is still too small... another invasion is necessary I think.

Q12 looks interesting - it's at the vital point of the shape (table shape).]
;B[pi];W[oh];B[ph];W[og];B[lg];W[mg];B[mh];W[ld];B[pg]C[[Malweth\]: B could definitely have connected at P14 instead...]
;W[of];B[pb]C[[Malweth\]: This move is big... the corner was VERY important for both sides.

O11 was small in comparison.];W[dr];B[ch];W[gs];B[er];W[es]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr];B[hr];W[hs];B[is]C[Here i took around 7 minutes reading out all the possible variations. I figured out playing at G2 and letting black cut me at F1, i still can connect out at L2. And i also might had a chance of killing the F3 group. That is what i thought when i played G2. Is there anything i miss out here?

[Malweth\]: It looks good to me. Black is open underneath, so W stands a chance. If W is this far behind, taking a chance is a requirement!]

;B[jr]C[Silentguy [11k\]: if he stay like this];W[jq]C[Silentguy [11k\]: till the end

*A ko here. I failed to get enough back for this ko and i think i made me lost my game. Is there a way i can avoid this ko or how should i actually should play the ko?

[Malweth\]: Playing correctly at E4 would have limited the severity of the ko to some degree, otherwise the only thing you could do was eliminate it before B had a chance to play it.]
;B[aq];W[ar];B[jr];W[pc]
(;B[ks];W[qc]C[[Malweth\]: You gain a lot for the ko here... it was a mistake for B to take the ko.]
;B[qd]MA[pa][pb][qa][qb][ra][rb][sa][sb][oa][ob]C[[Malweth\]: probably about 10-12 points... 

10 + 8 (if black blocked at R17 - see variation) is an 18 point move!

Compare this to the 12-15 points Black gained in capture.];W[rd]
;B[re];W[rc];B[nq]C[*Here i was dejected. I counted that i was still behind by around 12 and my yose is very bad.
