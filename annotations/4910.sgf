C[Game commented by NM at the request of W.];B[pc];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[qe];W[cj];B[qo]C[NM: I would prefer somewhere round K16 here, to take value from the shimari. But this is doubtless playable.]
;W[jq];B[jc];W[qj]C[I've read that it's good to play in the center like this.

NM: It has the advantage that you can make a 2-space extension in either direction. There are other possibilities here, such as L10, but this is pretty good..]
;B[lp];W[lr]C[NM: I don't like this; it's going for territory too soon. It does also help the stability of the K3 stone, but still I would prefer something like K5, R7 or O10. We're still sketching out large areas, and this is too small. Also if B replies, say at N3, you really have no more attacks against his corner, so you're losing flexibililty.]
;B[mq]C[OK, he did reply, so it works out reasonably for W.]
;W[qg];B[ql]C[NM: And now we see the drawback of the M2/N3 exchange. Without that, B would have a nice attacking point at P5.]
;W[oj]C[I decided to extend on this side because I felt that there would be little chance to invade or reduce in the bottom right corner versus the top right at some later point in the game.

NM: Absolutely. The result of M2/N3];B[cn];W[dn]C[I tried to follow what I thought was a typical joseki, since I didn't feel so confident about my strength on the lower side here.

NM; My own inclination would be either C4, to block the corner off totally, or F4 in the classic ximple joseki, but I'm sure this is playable. What you're doing is offering B life on the side in return for territory and power in the centre.]
;B[cm]C[NM: B refuses the offer of easy life on the side.];W[dm]
C[NM: You should play C5 here. It's lovely shape, and since B really has to play somewhere round D7, it gives you a big corner.]
;B[co]C[NM: where W should have played.];W[do]C[simple, but it's difficult for W to get enough value from his wall.]
;B[cq];W[cp]C[NM: I would just have descended to D3.];B[bp]
;W[dq];B[cr];W[dr]C[Big, and more or less necessary to get territory in the G3 area, but gote, and therefore too slow at this stage.]
;B[cf];W[fc]C[Didn't want to lose my corner.

NM: Playable here. Also possible: C15 to make B heavy, followed by F17; C16; C12.]
;B[ci];W[cl];B[bl];W[dk]C[NM: Strong, but you're bot under attack. I don't see any reason not to make the obvious play of B9, which is sente.]
;B[bk];W[bj];B[bi];W[ak];B[al];W[aj];B[ai]C[NM: Here B should play C9, which is much nastier for W.]
;W[ck];B[bn];W[jn]C[I think I felt like I could use the wall I just made to give myself a little more potential territory on the bottom side, as well as possibly open up the center in my favor.

NM: Yes, it looks attractive. But using a wall simply to make territory is not good. Having said that, with the BR B stones as strong as they are, it's hard to see how to use your wall for anything else.

Also, before doing this, C15 or B15 look attractive, and more or less sente.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[je];W[hc]C[NM: Not desirable, but probably necessary.

A rough count now puts B ahead.
B: BL 8, BR 23, TL 8, TR at least 16:55+
W: maybe 30 in BL, 14 in TL, 6 on R, komi 6: 56.
But B has much better prospects, for example N16 gives B at least 14 more, and W's R group is still attackable.]
;B[ei]C[NM: bigger than it looks, because it removes all possibility of attacking the B group.]
;W[jj]C[NM: Not a bad move, but smaller than it looks, because it doesn't turn anything into territory. For example, a B stone on G8 could still link to one side or the other. I think here I would either play P8 or start some trouble at Q18.]
;B[mn]C[NM: another 15 or so points of B territory! Still I would have played at M7 to keep open more attacking possibilities.]
;W[om]C[NM: good, but I think too deep, since it can be cut behind at P8.]
;B[of]C[NM: I don't like this. It's undoubtedly big in area, but the attack isn't very effective now that W has P7; and it leaves weaknesses behind. Having said that, it does have the benefit of leaving lots of agi round the P7 stone to be exploited later.]
;W[lf]C[NM: Bad! W makes to territory behind this, and the net effect is only to firm up B territory and leave W with a nearly isolated stone. If W wants to attack there, I think N15 would be better. Another possibility is to start off by attaching at Q18, keeping open the possibility of living in the corner.]
;B[le]C[NM: Unnecessarily agressive here: N16 would just quietly turn the TR into territory.]
;W[me];B[mf]C[NM: B is so strong locally he can do this, but the problem is that it will end up reinforcing W, which W wants.]
;W[ke];B[ld];W[mg];B[nf];W[kg];B[kd]C[NM: I would play P12 first. Or maybe now cut at P8.]
;W[kf]C[NM: Terrible! W should abandon that stone, which has served its purpose. It's nto as if he's going to make territory behind it. P12 would resolve all W's weaknesses; R7 would be interesting; P3, threatening to link up above or below, would make big inroads into B's corner; even B17  or G10 are quite big.]
;B[fk];W[fj];B[el]
(;W[dl]C[NM: Onve he's played F10, W has to answer E8 with E10: full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes. Then B has to extract a weak group, and even if he manages (which looks difficult, see variation) W can use attacks on that group to gain both territory and power.]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[gj];W[fi];B[gl];W[fm];B[ig];W[hh];B[ih]C[NM: G11 would be better, since that's where the real argument is.]

;W[gg];B[hg];W[ii];B[hm];W[go];B[jm];W[im]C[NM: Not good. L6 or L7 better.]

;B[nm];W[nl];B[nn];W[nk]C[NM: Idea is nice, but W can cut at L6.]

;B[gm];W[kn]C[NM: Whew!];B[fe]C[NM: I think W can simply reply at G15, but the line you take is certainly more entertaining.]

(;B[ah]C[And the mistake.

NM: well, that was obviously a mistake. But  think W is still ahead if B doesn't play it - see variation.]
;W[di];B[ci];W[bi]C[At this point he resigned.

So, I think part of the problem I have with counting is that I really get into the game, or into a specific fight, and I really can't tell whether or not I'm ahead.  

NM: LIke most of us. If you have time, you have to discipline yourself to pause and make at least a rough count.

When I make a big capture like in the center, I simply assume that I will win, but I failed to notice that b had more territory than me.  

NM: Actually, he didn't. But a classic way to win in the endgame is to let your opponent reduce his own liberties...

Is there a trick to remembering or counting?

NM: No trick, just do it!])
