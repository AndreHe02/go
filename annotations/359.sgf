RE[W+Resign]

C[dear reviewer: 

i think, the game was mine all the time. but then i had to make two liberties for the big m12 group...and i failed!!! can you please show me, how to safe live in this kind of position. after this game i have the feeling, that i don앖 know ANYTHING about making a group alive and NOTHING about go!!

thanks for all your comments, 

greetings,  Duumvir];B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[jq];W[oc]C[Of course you can answer as you  did, but from now on you have to  keep in mind the big potential and  influence W can get by playing  somewhere around Q10. BTW, this would be a good  extension for you too (double-wing!).]

;W[rn];B[qo];W[md];B[ld];W[mo];B[oo]C[why? to attack make a capping play  at N7 or a splitting attack around K6]
;W[ml];B[pg]C[It압 quite late to invade here,  perhaps you should have done it  earlier. Then you could have invaded  on the 3rd line threatening to connect   to your lower right corner. Now you must run into the center and  you can앖 avoid to heavily weaken  your upper side group what almost  certainly leads to the death of one of  your groups. I would prefer to only reduce white압  territory here by M15 (at the same  time strengthening the B upper side  group) and attack white압 weak  groups on the lower and left edge.]

 ok you fought to connect those  groups and succeeded :-) there is only one eye on the upper  edge and none in the center but  perhaps you can make one eye on  the right edge.]

(;B[of]MA[oi]C[You worked it out correctly, play X  and your 4 th variation to make your  second eye.]

 there is no way to make two eyes  and no chance to attack one of W압  surrrounding groups  - at least I don앖 see any :-)]

What you can learn from this game  is strengthen your weak groups early  and attack in a way that you profit  even if the opponent lives. The involved live and death  problems you worked out on your  own, so you see this is first of all a  question of reading and experience. 

I hope this comment is useful to you. Feel free to ask if you have further  questions!]
