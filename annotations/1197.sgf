C[I have a firewall so I had to content myself playing go with go softwares like smartgo.

Before
my weakness was I didn't know how to invade the opponents territory. Or
I don't know when to invade or to defend my territory.   Just when I
thought my territory was secured, the opponent invades and my territory
is lost. This really pissed me off.   So I started praticing life and
death problems.I think I improved somewhat. I hope so.

So my purpose for this review is I want to what's my rating. I hope you can help.

Thanks.

pajaro: Hi. It's nice that you have interest of playing go, however you can. 'll mark my comments with pajaro:]
;B[gc];W[df]C[pajaro:
As this is a 9x9 game, I think this is not very usual, because you must
play rather for territory. But remember that you are playing a
computer! It isn't supposed to be playing well.]
(;B[fe]C[pajaro: This is not good. Third move, and already tryin to attack. First, go to the corners.]
;W[gf]C[pajaro: Too high. White is trying to attack you. Again, it should go to a corner.]
;B[ff]C[pajaro: Good. As this is a fight, splitting your opponent can't be bad.]
;W[fc];B[fd];W[ge];B[ec]C[pajaro: I guess this is good. White is still splitted and black is connected.]
;W[hd];B[gg]C[pajaro: Reducing the opponent's space...];W[cd]
C[pajaro:
Another example of bad play by white. The right group is being
attacked, and plays tennuki. Black must take his chance.];B[hg]
C[pajaro: Yeah! Reduce his space. You are also making territory at the bottom.]
;W[eh]C[pajaro:
White is already dead, so it's right to play elsewhere. With this move,
he aims at cutting you, while makes a lot of territory.];B[fh]
;W[eg];B[dd]C[pajaro: black needs to be careful. White could cut.]

(;W[cc];B[ce]C[pajaro: This is unreasonable. White should cut you, and your alone stone would have a hard time for... dying?]

(;W[be]C[pajaro: Bad, very bad. White should cut.];B[cf];W[de]
C[pajaro: This comes late. Black can now fight.];B[cg];W[hc]

;B[di];W[ag];B[af];W[bd];B[dg];W[ae];B[ee]C[pajaro:
This last sequence has been very bad play, I can't point any special
mistake. Just see that white was dead.]

pajaro:
well, you won. But rememeber -again- that you were playing against a
computer. Although I think sometimes this can be good for a begginer,
you shouldn't rely on learning very much from it. For the same reason,
I can't estimate a rank for you. You should play on a 19x919 board and
against humans to know. Also, send games for review where you lost.]
