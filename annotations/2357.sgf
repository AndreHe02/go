;B[dp]C[I (white) made lots of mistakes; black made lots of mistakes (especially later).

Where was I doing intelligent things and where was I just lucky?

Please help me see my own mistakes so that I don't get used to opponents playing stupidly.]

I think D is too high.];B[dj];W[qj]C[Not sure that this is the best placement of pincer, but since black's made a claim to the left side, I figured I should give some attention to his lone stone in the upper right corner.]

Not needed. He cannot connect underneath. Even if he plays t11 himself, you can block him at T10]
;B[sg];W[qb]C[not going to be able to prevent eye formation by black at this point, I think.

Should I have played inside black's territory in an attempt to reduce it?

A also gives possibility to move into centre. You can't stop this (don't know the word) snake(?) :-)

Time for w to take some points. 
By entering B space e.g. 1-2-3. I favor 1 because it gives the possibility to make a base on either side.

B is strong on most sides.];B[lf];W[lg];B[jd];W[jg];B[jp];W[ie]

1 would have given you a stronger base which gives you some points.]

You gave away a lot of the side.];W[ef]LB[gc:1]TR[ed][ce][ge]
C[not sure about this shape.  looks kinda inefficient.

yes. G15 too high. It gives space to enter. 
Playing at 1 is stronger. but now your stones are more or less connected.
