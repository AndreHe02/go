C[This is one of the better games I've played. Usually I know where I went wrong, but the game seemed very even, and I couldn't see any big mistakes. I won by half a point in the end, although white was playing with .5 komi.

I played black in this game.

rika:
Hi, I'm Chun-Kit, currently 4k IGS and 3k in Germany.
Even you won that game by 0.5 points, personally I like to play with the usual komi against stronger player. That will boost up your rating if you win that one.
There are some tactical things which you must keep an eye on it but nothing dramatically (since the game was very even).
I have added some variations without any comments.];B[pd];W[cp]

blunder by white, it makes too easy for black to settle a secure group. normal reply was wB3]
;B[dq];W[eo];B[fp];W[bq];B[br];W[bp]
(;B[ce]C[rika:
fine... white ends in gote in the lower left so playing elsewhere is the right choice.
how to deal with the upper left. There are 2 choices (3-3, 3-4) where 3-4 is the common one.
3-5 (your play) is possible.
(see one var for a loose invasion)
(see vars for 3-4, remark: there are too many possibilities)]

(;W[cd]C[rika:
helping black so bad (var for easy play)];B[bd];W[cc]
(;B[ch]C[rika:
difficult to say if this is the proper play]
(;W[bc]C[I tried to reduce what white might get on the left and settle these stones as quickly as I could

rika:
first stable your group (ie. eye shapes) then you can think about reducing (but that is middle-/end game stage)]
;B[ae]C[rika:
strange shape, better bB14]
(;W[cj];B[eh];W[ej];B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[cl];B[jp]C[rika:
but you did fine job... there are too many white stones in the lower left for just 20 points thus overconcentrated.]
;W[nq]C[rika:
not good by white. approach from the side where there are no opponents stones (i.e. wR6)]

(;B[lq]TR[jp]C[rika:
this is unnecessary. you have already a pincer stone at bK4 so make your opponent's group heavy and attack it. (see var)]

rika:
see var for reason];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn]
(;B[nn]C[I think I'm a bit overconcentrated here, should I have played o6?

rika:
you played o6... common continuation is bP7 or tenuki
(good spot for tenuki: bK17)];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]
;B[pj]C[rika:
continuation at the right side isn't important (group at the upper right is safe by itself). invade at the top has bigger priority in my eyes]
;W[hd];B[de]C[in retrospect, this move is a bit small, but I didn't like the thought of W d15, B C14

rika:
yea... that's why bA15 was strange I mentioned before];W[qk]
;B[qj];W[rk];B[rj]C[rika:
I don't think blocking bS10 is big. I like bG6 (moyo expansion) maybe bO15]
;W[pk]
(;B[gm]C[I thought this was a big move, black seems ahead now

rika:
it is big, but you cannot ignore wQ9. There is a difference between wP10 or bP9 (hane at the head of 3 stones)]

ignoring the upper left is risky. The following sequence could be used for possible ko threats]

little bit optimistic in my eyes];W[ne];B[md];W[mc];B[nd];W[oc]

(;B[fo]C[rika:
that stones was necessary because the okeima (F4-G7) has many weaknesses. the small keima (F4-G6) was enough at that time

further more, you cannot ignore white last play];W[jm];B[ml]

[sp][sq][sr][ss]C[rika:
as I mentioned in the beginning there are no obvious mistakes just a matter of style. Why the game is still even? 
- fixing shape (e.g. bB14, bF5) gave sente to the opponent.
- missing some big yose play (bA17, bQ19)
- dangerous tenuki play (after wP10, wE15)
