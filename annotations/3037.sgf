C[*X*: Hello again.  As usual, my comments are prefixed with *X* to distinguish them from yours.

To others reading this review, note that this is the second review I have done for abennun, so there may be references to comments made in the other game.  The previous review is also available through GTL.

You played a good opening this time, and I'm pleased to see that you took my advice.  You made a few strategic errors, but really the only reason you lost this game is poor killing technique.

I suggest trying "The Shape Game."  One person takes Black and starts the game with one-space jumps all around the first line.  White then plays (usually at tengen) and play continues, following the regular rules of Go.  However, instead of territory being the issue, White needs simply to live to win: create one living group anywhere on the board.  Black has to kill everything.  Sounds difficult, but between two strong-ish players, the game is more-or-less fair.  See the variation for the initial set-up and some example moves.]

(;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[ep];B[pj]C[*X*: White has a very influence-oriented opening, so you will find it more difficult than usual to establish a large moyo.  Nonetheless, I don't see anything wrong with san-ren-sei.  You have to expect a lot of fighting, though, since both players have their eyes on the center.]
;W[co]C[*X*: This is a very influence-oriented shimari.  The corner is still easy to invade.  Splitting the left side is now urgent for Black.]

(;B[fc]C[*X*: You're approaching from the open side, which is good.  Better than C14, anyway.  However, I would prefer the wedge play at C11.  Right now, you have a moyo and your opponent doesn't, so it is to your advantage to keep it that way.

There is only one pro occurence on gobase.org of san-ren-sei vs. White's formation on the left, and C11 was the move Black played.  See the variation for how play continued.]
;W[cf]C[*X*: This is a bad move for White, playing low, solid moves in the direction of his power.  A pincer would have been better.]
;B[fe]C[*X*: Interesting, in that it's large-scale, and reduces White's left side.  It does, however, allow White to split at L17, and doesn't carry any attacking threat behind it, since C14 is so solid.  K16 would have been the normal move, to establish a giant L-shaped moyo.]
;W[nc]C[*X*: White made the same mistake you did, approaching when a wedge would have been correct.  Now you get to pincer, making F15 look quite good.]

(;B[lc]C[Since I have the F17-F15 stones, I though pincering is the right idea.

*X*: Right.  If White invades the corner, you get a good result.  You could also try the two-space high pincer, since it also invites a corner invasion (see var.).  Nothing wrong with this, though.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[me];W[rc];B[hq]C[*X*: I'm glad you ignored S17.  Don't want to let White sneak endgame moves into the middlegame.

However, I feel this is a bit wishy-washy.  It's neither close enough nor far enough from the corner, in my opinion.  I'd say you should hold back to K4... you don't want to provoke White to make the corner into solid territory.]
;W[nq]C[*X*: Same mistake again, for White.  You get to pincer and extend from H3 at the same time.  He should have pincered you instead, around L4, or else defended the corner with F3 and force you to jump back.]
;B[lq]C[Here I was less sure about pincering, but I think the sequence gave Black good result.

*X*: Yes, pincering is good.  If White invades the corner again, you'll have a huge moyo.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rq];B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[ro]C[White reduces the Black moyo, but I am satisfied as Black since I keep him very low and strengthen my right side.

*X*: The thing is that your right side is now open at both corners, so you can't expect much territory there.  Instead, you're now looking to get an enormous center.]
;B[rp];W[sp];B[qm]C[*X*: If you wanted to defend your territory, R6 is better.  You could also invade the lower left, since White didn't defend it, or play a move somewhere around G11 to aim for a big center while reducing White's prospects on the left.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl];B[rk]C[May be R9 is safer.

*X*: Definitely.  Hane down to the second line is rarely a good idea.  The cut is usually dangerous.]
;W[sk]C[*X*: This, however, is a bad move, that removes the danger of R9 if you answer.  You could also ignore it, since Q10 prevents White from getting any higher.  Remember that with S16 open, you don't have any territory on the right anyway.]
;B[rj];W[re];B[rd];W[sd];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[lj]C[*X*: Now don't you kind of wish you hadn't answered all of White's moves on the right?    A stone around G10 would be nice right about now.  Nonetheless, this invasion is too deep for White, and you should be able to make good profit while chasing it.]

(;B[dj]C[I though that before handling the invador, I should complete the wall on the left side. It gave territory to White, but at last the wall was complete.

*X*: No.  Attacking invasions is always urgent, and usually your number one priority.  K10 is what I would have played.  See variation.]
;W[ck]
(;B[dm]C[*X*: You have to follow up on D10.  Press once with D9, then attack M10.  Alternately, you could just attack immediately.  Your attack is so severe that White won't have time to do anything on the left, so you can always come back later.]
;W[dk];B[ej];W[ek];B[fj];W[fm]C[*X*: This sequence is no good for you.  F7 helps M10, and your three stones are facing the wrong way.  You've given White a lot of territory and haven't helped your attacking prospects at all.]
;B[gl]C[*X*: Good, if White answers, but she shouldn't.  By making a light move in the center, she'll make it harder for you to kill her.]
;W[en]C[*X*: White answers, so you're good.  It isn't easy to kill M10, but should be possible.]
;B[hn]TR[gc][hc][ic][jc][kc][fd][md][nd][pe][ff][fg][fh][qh]
[fi][qi][fk][gm][ho][po][hp][iq][jq][kq]C[*X*: No.  Too far.  I know they say you should attack at a distance, but here you're going to extremes.  White has too much room to maneuver. 

A good thing to remind yourself is that you don't need everything to win, just more territory than your opponent.  Even if White closes the bottom left, she only has about 60 points of territory, total, and nowhere to make any more.  Add in komi, you get just under 70.  If you aim for 75 or 80 points, you should have an easy game.  Here, assuming you're aiming for the area surrounded with triangles, you're trying to get over 110 points.

Ordinarily, you want to develop on as large a scale as possible, but that's because you aren't planning on killing an invasion, just using it to turn half your moyo into territory while attacking.  Here, you've let White get all four corners and a big chunk of the left side, so you're going to have to kill to win.  In that kind of situation, you want to kill on juuuuust large enough a scale to win.  Trying to get too much gives the opponent better chances to survive and leave you with nothing.]
;W[jj]C[OK, now the time to handle the invador.
At this point I was sure White cannot live - so either I was wrong, or I did not attack effectively.

*X*: White should probably still die, but there are lots of ways to go wrong.  Here, there is more space for White to manuever above, and a big hole to escape through between F15 and F10, so that's the direction you want to attack from.]
;B[kk]C[May be I should have started from the other side, like K13?

*X*: If you expect White to answer the peep, then yes.  But in these cases, White won't answer, because she doesn't need to connect her stones.  She doesn't want to live with all of them - that's impossible - just some of them.]
;W[mi]C[*X*: Lighter than playing L10, but still too heavy.  As White, I would try something like J12.]

(;B[kj]C[*X*: Oh, god, no.  This is exactly what White wants you to do.  L11 makes a potential eye around M11 and if you cut, it gets even worse.]
;W[ki];B[lh]C[*X*: Well, I'm glad you didn't cut at K11.  However, if you were going to play here, why didn't you just play here?  Why push in at L10?]
;W[li]C[*X*: White has given you a chance by making herself heavy like this.  Now you really should be able to kill.]

(;B[ji]C[*X*: ARGH.  When you need to kill everything, don't cut.  Cuts just let the opponent sacrifice half to save the rest.

Maybe it's still possible for you to kill after this, but it isn't easy.  I would call this the game-losing move.]
;W[jh];B[ii];W[kh];B[lg];W[ih];B[hi];W[je]C[This was the first time I started to fill he slips through my fingers...

*X*: Yes.  It still looks quite possible to kill, but no longer a sure thing.  The big problem was the forcing moves he got at K12 and J12 because of your cut.]
;B[jc];W[id];B[gg]C[This allow White to make sabaki and live, but letting White play here is not good either...]
;W[ic]C[*X*: You don't need to answer this.]
(;B[jb];W[gd];B[fd];W[gc]
(;B[fb]C[*X*: No.  You don't need to play here, and J14 is still a good move.]
;W[hf]C[*X*: Now it's probably hopeless.  There may still be a way to kill White, but I don't see it.  If one exists, it will involve tesuji - natural moves won't work anymore.]
;B[kg];W[jg];B[hg];W[gf];B[ff];W[kf]C[...and here I trying to force it too much, and the whole position collapses...

Thanks a lot for your help!

*X*: Yes, the game is over now.  Anyway, I'm pleased to see that you took my advice.  Your opening was much stronger this time.  Things to learn from this game:

1) Don't defend against intrustions into "territory" that's open on both sides.  If it was open on both sides, it wasn't territory to begin with.  There's little profit to be made, so it's better to take sente.  (It's okay to press him down a few times, as long as he's going to answer, but make sure not to end in gote)

2) Most importantly, attacking a moyo invasion is always extremely urgent, usually #1 priority.

3) If you're going to try to build thickness, make sure it faces a useful direction.  Notice than D10-E10-F10 face the strong-ish White stones in the upper left, whereas you should have tried to get that wall to face the center.

4) Try not to put all your eggs in one basket.  Making one huge territory will usually force the opponent into an unreasonable invasion, which you then have to kill to win.  It's easy to go wrong in that situation.  However, it was hard to avoid, this game, since your opponent sort of forced you to take a huge middle.  Nonetheless, maybe if you had held back a little bit, he would have reduced more shallowly, allowing you a small but easy victory.

5) If you do get forced into a "kill or lose" situation where you have lots of thickness nearby, your only concern should be to prevent your opponent from making good shape.  Blocking escape routes is secondary, and usually only worth doing when he can connect on the next move.  Cutting him is to be avoided, especially if it will give him some forcing moves - if you're trying to kill everything, you only want to cut if both sides have one eye apiece, so letting him connect would give him one group with two eyes.]
