C[Sarge: Hi metellius, ill try and help the best i can!];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[co]C[Sarge: I would probably have responded in the lower left corner first after this move. His attack comes in close (not a good thing for him), and you should punish him for it.]

(;W[qf];B[cp]C[Sarge: See how that one move made all the difference? Now hes grabbing the corner and d4 is weak.]
;W[dq];B[cq]
(;W[lc]C[metellius: I want to break in before it's too late.

Sarge: Since you already have r14 in place, I would have gone for the pincer. This move is a little too far off to be an effective pincer. If you wanted to invade the area, the fuseki would be closer to the star point, although the pincer would probably be more effective at building up your influence there.]
;B[md];W[jc]C[Sarge: This move is a little too slow, which gets this group in trouble later. If you are going to extend here, I would make at least a 2 point jump.]
;B[hc]C[Sarge: Now you have to run]
(;W[ke]C[metellius: Is this a good move?

Sarge: At this position, this isnt a bad move. It successfully get the k17 group out into the middle. It also puts pressure on the n16 group.]

;B[rg]C[Sarge: You need to make a bigger move if you want to reinforce the lower right.]

(;W[pi]C[Sarge: Bad move, makes an empty triangle and does nothing for you.]
;B[oc]C[Sarge: O18 group looks pretty dead now. By leaving that group in the corner alone, you lost the corner and the group.]

Sarge: Overall, your play is pretty good. Your main problem seems to be deciding when to play close and strong and when to play farther out, lighter quicker plays. Ive tried to point these places out. Also, every once in a while you make a move that doesnt really do anything. Before making every move, quickly consider what exactly it is going to accomplish, and make sure it actually does what you want it to. Besides that, good job not loosing your cool after the o16  l16 group fight didnt work out. You successfully gained control of the rest of the board.]
