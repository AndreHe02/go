AB[jj][dd][pp][dp][pd]C[Hello, my name is Ryan and I'm playing black in this game.  Thanks in advance for reviewing this for me.

---
Hello, I'm DooMeeR, and I'll be commenting your game. My comments will be preceeded by a "---".

Overall, your main mistakes were caused by some weaknesses you left behind before. Sometimes, your opponent punished you directly because you left an easy atari. Sometimes your choices were limited because you had urgent moves (weaknesses to fix).

Before you make a move, try to ask yourself: does this move leave exploitable weaknesses? If so, is it worth the extra territory I might gain, compared to a stronger move?

Another thing to consider: if you see a white group that will need to fight hard to survive, but can't be killed easily, don't try to kill it at all cost. Instead, put pressure on it while building territory or influence. White will make very few points while trying to save his group, but you will secure a lot more.

I hope I answered most of your questions :)]PL[W];W[cf];B[cd]
C[Is a move like this alright?  Perhaps a move at F17 would be better?

---
I don't know if F17 is better, but it is more common. Here, you protect yourself against a 3-3 invasion, making territory. The price to pay is that your development is slower, which is not necessarily bad.]
;W[cn];B[cl];W[cq]SQ[cl]TR[cf]MA[cj]C[---
Another move for white could be C10, which allows him to counter-pincer your stone at C8 while making use of his stone at C14.]
;B[cp];W[dq]
(;B[dn]C[---
This looks over-aggressive (see variation).];W[bp];B[bo]LB[co:a]
TR[cn]C[---
This creates a weakness at "a" that white will exploit after his play at B3 (or A3, in this game), thanks to its stone at C6.]
;W[aq]
(;B[bn]C[---
Now is time to fill the weekness you created (see variation).]

(;W[cm]
(;B[bm]C[---
You can't really capture white stones. Instead, you should push it to the left while building influence on the right (see variation).]
;W[dm];B[em]SQ[en]MA[dl][co]C[I wasn't sure what I was doing here.  This was a good ladder for white from the beginning, but I was unsure where to play.

---
Actually, this is not a ladder, because white still has 2 liberties after your play (D8 and C5). So white can already play atary at E6 it he wants to, and you can't capture his group immediatly.

For this to be a ladder, you need an extra stone at C5.];W[dl]
;B[dk];W[el];B[fl];W[ek];B[fn]C[I had decided that the ladder had gone far enough and tried to bail out of it.]
;W[ck]C[I figure this is the price I pay for making a bad ladder.]
;B[bl]TR[cl]LB[co:a]C[---
You shouldn't try to save the stone at C8, because your whole group is in danger if white plays at C5.]
;W[dj];B[bk];W[bj];B[co];W[eq]C[---
By trying to rescue your stone at C8, you made very few points on the left, while white has reinforced his stone at C14 and was able to take a big point at E3.]
;B[ep];W[fq];B[gp];W[gq];B[hq];W[hr];B[iq]C[Overall I'm not fond of my situation in the lower left.  I've given up the corner and he has good poition on the left as well.

---
Yes, but it is hard to recover from a wrong "ladder" :)];W[nq]
;B[lq];W[qq];B[pq]TR[cl][lq]LB[fp:a]C[Perhaps a play at R4 instead would be better?  Or somewhere else?  I'm not sure I should be trying to pincer someone who is much stronger than me.

---
Your first pincer at C8 was a bit aggressive. It made the game more complicated, which is good for white in a handicap game.

However, your pincer at M3 isn't that bad, because you still have weaknesses on the left ("a" for instance).

Your play at Q3 should make influence on the left, which would work nicely with the influence you already have. It should be very hard for white to prevent you from making territory in the lower part of the board.]
;W[qp];B[qo]SQ[po]TR[nq]C[---
This is too aggressive, because of the white stone at O3, and will create weaknesses. A play at Q5 is probably better.]

(;W[ro];B[pn]C[I'm unsure why I played here.  I figure I should have just continued up with R6.

---
Yes.];W[qn];B[oo]MA[po]C[---
You should just connect at Q5 if you want to defend against white's atari.]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[ql];B[pl]
(;W[rp]C[---
I'm not sure why white plays this move.];B[qk];W[rk];B[qj];W[pr]
;B[or];W[qs];B[oq];W[np]
(;B[nr]C[---
You should try to attack the two white stones on a larger scale. White's play was a bit optimistic, but now you allow his to run to the center.]
;W[mo];B[lo]C[I don't really like the sequence from moves 63-80.  I seem to have "secured" a nice bit of territory towards the center, but I've allowed him to surround my pieces on the right side.]

;B[li];W[nj];B[oj]MA[pk]C[Now, seeing that I'm surrounded I have to focus on saving myself.

---
Actually, your position is not that bad. You surround white as much as he surrounds you, and his position is a little overconcentrated. You have plenty of options to live (connect to the bottom, to the top right, or make eyes somehow), while white doesn't.

You can put pressure on white's group while making yours live and / or making territory.

This tsuke will be exploited by white (82-84). He will force you to protect against the cut at Q9 while making your stone at P10 look useless; so you could directly play at Q9. Or, you could extend Q14 with a move around Q13. If white tries to cut and succeeds, you'll always have the option of connecting at the bottom.]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[oi];B[pi];W[mi]
(;B[pj]TR[oj]C[---
Your stone at P10 isn't worth being rescued. A play at Q13 should be better, or even P12 (see variation).]
;W[lh];B[nk]TR[lh][mi][lj][nj][oi]C[---
The only purpose of this move, I guess, would be to reduce the space available for white to make eyes. But because of the marked stones, he doesn't need this space: he can run.]
;W[nl]SQ[ki]TR[ok]C[For the same reasons, white doesn't need to protect his stone at P9.

He could take the ponnuki at L11.];B[ol];W[mk];B[nm];W[ok];B[oh]
;W[ni];B[nk];W[ml];B[nn];W[no];B[ki]C[---
White is even more overconcentrated and didn't take the ponnuki (which would have helped him a lot, with a strong position at the top).]
;W[nh]C[---
White helps you build territory on the upper-right.];B[ng]C[---
A play at P13 would create less weakness.];W[mg];B[nf];W[kh]
;B[jh];W[mf];B[me]MA[pg]C[I think I might be trying too hard to "capture" instead of making territory.

---
Actually, you are making territory while white fights to live. You leave some weakness behind, though. A play at Q13 is probably better.]
;W[ne]C[---
Now white will try to make use of your weakness around P12.]
;B[og];W[le];B[md];W[kf];B[ld];W[jg];B[ke];W[lf];B[jd]TR[ke]
[jh][ki][li][jj][kk][kl]C[Is this too weak of a play? Perhaps I should extend out to J16 or H16?  Or even K15?

---
At this point, you have several weeknesses. All your marked stones are weak. This is why the atari at L15 wasn't so good in the first place. So, yes, a play at K15 would be stronger. You'll have to think about defending the other weeknesses, too.]
;W[je]MA[kd]C[It just invites a ko situation like this it seems.  It doesn't look to be on that would be to my advantage to lose either.

---
Well, you can just connect at L16.];B[kd]C[So I immediately fill in.

---
Good choice, I think.]
(;W[ih];B[ji];W[if];B[ie];W[jf];B[he];W[hf];B[gf]MA[ge][qc]
C[Now I think I've overstepped my bounds and have gotten too aggressive.

---
Indeed, a play at G15 would have been much stronger, with almost no option for white to invade in spite of your high position. He still has the invasion at R17 though.]

This move doesn't look necessary. See if you can use it to defend against the 3-3 invasion instead (see variation).]
