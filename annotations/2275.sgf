C[
To Reviewer:
Hello. Thanks for taking the time to go over my game! There are certain times when one feels so frustrated playing this game...and this was one of them. I really do hope you can shed some enlightenment on me.]

C[It is my first time to comment  a game in English.

I usually edit sgf documents with multigo, a very good soft, and free. You can visit http://www.ruijiang.com/multigo and download it.

W S4 should play at S5. Then  B S6 will not be sente.];B[rn]
;W[ro];B[qn];W[qo];B[mp]C[I felt that I had come out fine here...mainly because of his shape and because I had sente.

I think B's shape is not bad, and B down side nearly turned into territory. So B is leading now.]
;W[nc]C[So I approach (hopefully) from the right direction of play.

It is the right direction to kakari from the wider side.];B[pc]
;W[kc]C["All right," I thought, "this gives me an opportunity to build up strength and attack with R14 later."

Good idea!];B[cf]
(;W[ch]C[Wrong idea? I wasn't expecting the double approach. I was expecting the corner invasion...and then I would play the following joseki.

The following joseki is not suitable under this situation, because W L17 is at a low place. W B15 is a considerable choice, since upper side is not important when W played O17 and L17.]

(;B[fc];W[ee];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[dg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]
;B[ic];W[ke]C[This step is a little loose. As W left side is thick, B F17 and J17 will be danger if W played K16.]
;B[ie];W[kg];B[fb];W[ea];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[hd];B[id];W[qf]
C[I felt that I had the strength that I needed to initiate the attack.

W 52 is a vital point. But it's better for W to play J12 firstly. Then B upper side need to strenghen, and W's weakness in D14 will be alleviated.]
;B[qe];W[of];B[qh];W[qg];B[lc];W[ld];B[mc]C[B 57 and 59 overplayed.]

(;W[md];B[mb];W[nb];B[la]C[and now....Life and death. The absolute worst part of my game. I've bought a book to try and help remedy that, but I'm progressing slowly at it.

Those difficult problems maybe do no help to you now. It is importantl to be familiar with the shapes of basical life and death.]
;W[rc]C[I take a random shot at what looks right, since I don't know this shape.

It's so difficult. But I don't think B corner will be killed. W can attack at S12 or R11 firstly. If W can play at S13 or S14, the problem of B corner will be easier.]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[rd];W[qa]C[I had a feeling this wouldn't work...but I tried it anyway.

W has no chance to kill B corner.];B[rb];W[qc];B[qb];W[pa];B[ra]
;W[na];B[pb];W[ma];B[lb];W[oa];B[sc];W[qj]C[I wanted to somehow punish black for his bad shape at R7.]
;B[qk];W[rj];B[pj];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[oh]C[W get nothing from attack. So B R7 is not bad shape.]

(;W[dh]C[No move that I can see makes me content with this situation. D12 was bad.

I was fast to react because I had seen a similar shape in my tesuji book. Of course...it was different in the book.

I think E11 is suitable for such shape.];B[ck];W[bj]C[Bad move! C10 is OK, then B9 and D9 is miai.]
;B[bk];W[ek]C[W group is thin. So W 116 should play at D10.]
