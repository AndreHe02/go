C[Xris: Hi, this is the first game I have played on the Korean Dashn Server, and I was completely overwhelmed by their fighting. I have no clue (so far) what went wrong. A review about direction of play would be very helpful. Also I have a few specific questions which I will pose during the game.

Regards
Chris

Hi, My name is Johanna Tuominen, I'm finnish 7k, KGS 6k. I'm occasionally playing in Dashn too, so your story is pretty familiar to me. There's a good page in senseis library about the Dashn style. You may wanna read it:
http://senseis.xmp.net/?DashnStyle

Throughout the game it seemed that you were a bit confused about the moves the opponent made. By playing with people who has different styles help for this problem. For instance playing in dash.

One big mistake happened in upper right corner. Otherwise I tryed to give you some variations about the correct direction. Hope this is helpful.

Enjoy the Game of Go];B[pp];W[cd];B[pd];W[dq];B[do]LB[cj:C]
[dj:D][ck:A][dk:B][fp:E]TR[cd]C[JT: Here the pincer that you played is generally a good idea. However in this case the C7 stone ends up doing nothing. Maybe a wider pincer for instance A-D would be better. These four points would support the C16 stone if black black plays eg. E16 or you have a chance to make shimari in the upper left corner. 
And at the same time A-D pincer puts some pressure for the black D5 stone.

I give some Joseki variations from C and D

Maybe one variation would be to play in E.
I give one  possible continuation from E]
(;W[cm];B[bp]LB[cp:A][gq:B]C[JT:The marked black move is somewhat problematic since it takes away the base from the corner. It leads to a situation where white should have sente in order to have good result from both sides.

Noticeable about the playing style in dashn is that the black stone in B4 is not part of Joseki. This kind of playing is very common there. So you should not be confused.

I could come up with two variations either keep the corner with the expense of C7 stone or come out from the corner and trying to make benefit from the C7 stone in the upper left side and corner.

I give some variations from A and B]
(;W[gp]LB[fp:A][gq:B]C[JT: In the game, the marked stone will end up weakening the C7 stone. Since you have to defend your lower right corner /side which makes black stronger.

For fourth line extension this is bit too long but playble, usually it would be in A. If you wanna make this longer one the 3rd line would be more appropriate B.]
;B[fo];W[fp]LB[fq:A]C[In this case the F3 instead F4. It still gives opportunity to attack your pincer stone but the black wall is not so tight.]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[cn]LB[dm:A][en:B]SQ[cm]C[Xris: Here du I have to respond to the tsuke?

JT: Yes, since in the game black had a so called "double attack" move. When you played the E17 black played C11 which takes the optimal extension from the shimari away and at the same time attacked the marked stone. 

I give variations for A, the B might also be worth considering. The B point is sente since it threads to cut black.]

(;W[ec];B[ci];W[cg];B[dk];W[nq];B[kq]C[JT: Here by attacking (next move) to the corner you let black L3 stone settle too easily.]

(;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[hr];W[gr];B[hq];W[br];B[bq];W[cq];B[ar]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[hp];B[ip]
(;W[pl]TR[pi][qi][pj][qj]C[Xris: I tried to make the ideal 3 point extension bad for B.

JT: Playing this close to the black to stones is not a good idea. If you wanna take the benefit of black ideal extension of , you can play something to the area marked.

So if we take one move back I give you some variations.];B[qm]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[ph];B[ol];W[ok];B[nl];W[nd]TR[ph][ok][pl][ql]
C[Xris: I wasnt sure if this is the correct direction I am attacking from...

JT: Idea is good. But you must be carefull that these marked stones do not weaken too much.]
;B[of];W[nh];B[og];W[oh];B[qf]LB[rg:A]TR[ic][jc][id][jd]C[JT: The marked stone allows for black the R10 move, which cuts whites base off.
So you should answer I give one possible variation in A.

The corner is still open so you should not worry too much about the O16 stone plus if black attacks you can still get pretty nice extension on the upper side (marked).

The group in the right side remained weak and caused a lot of troubles for you during the game since black was able to put a pressure towards it.]

(;W[kc];B[qj]C[Xris: This stone looked killable to me but after some reading it didnt look so promising for me anymore...

JT: At this point the marked black stone has connection either to the lower group or to the upper right corner.
So whites base is gone.];W[pj];B[qh];W[qc];B[pc]C[JT:At this point the Q18 is also playable.]

(;W[qb];B[pb];W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[pe]LB[qd:A]C[Xris: I dont know if this 3-3 could work, but at least I wanted to give it a shot. Unfortunately I helped him build that wall, whitch which he could attack me. So I know my invasion were thank you moves.

JT: This 3-3 point should work. In the worst case it would end to ko for life. The mistake is the whites next move to S17. In this situation white next move should be in A.]

(;W[le];B[ld];W[kd];B[ke]C[JT: The atari in L14 should be played in K15. Playing it to the L14 let black easily connect to the wall and your weak group remains weak.]

(;W[kf];B[je]
(;W[lk]LB[mk:A]TR[nl][ol]C[JT: The M9 stone is too far away from the P9 stone because of the black two marked stones. A would be better.]

;B[lg];W[kg];B[md];W[mg];B[le];W[ei];B[ej];W[hk]C[JT: At this stage the H9 is ending up workin fine. You get some points in the center and at the same time secured the the right side group. However, if the group would be stronger then maybe white could play  G9.]

C[JT: in general]
(;W[lo]TR[rp]SQ[ip][hq][kq][hr][kr]C[JT: Instead the M5 stone pushing from S4 would be bigger and sente. The M5 is not cutting black marked stones apart  because blak can either connect or make the second eye using the weakness of M2 stone.]

LB[gq:B][cr:A]TR[ch]C[JT: The next move H15 end up in gote for you. Because of the J13 stone the potential for points in that area for both players is gone. For instance C12 is a sente and then there are more urgent and bigger gote moves like in the lower left corner A & B.]

;W[pn];B[qn];W[qi]C[Xris: Here I made a fatal reading mistake, since I was runnign out of time, by not protecting the bottom group. But both of us didnt see it until later in yose. Once he kills i make another mistake not seeing a snapback, so then I resigned.]
;B[ri];W[pi];B[rl];W[nk];B[nj];W[ni];B[ml];W[ih];B[hh];W[ch]
;B[bi];W[go];B[fn];W[ks];B[js];W[ls]C[Xris:  Ok here he finally exploited my weakness and
I resigned. But even if my bottom group was alive, I believe B is ahead by nearly 10 points. So rather general hints of mistakes in this rather violent game would be very nice.

Thank you for reviewing.
