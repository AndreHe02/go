C[*X*: Hi, I'm Alex Weldon, a 2d from Canada.  My comments will be preceeded by *X* (for "Xopods," my KGS username) to distinguish them from yours.

The most obvious comment is that you need to pay more attention to your reading (this is advice that is much more easily given than followed, mind you... I should take my own advice, in fact).  Aside from that, I see three things you need to work on:

1) You are not very consistent in your strategy.  You chose the Kobayashi fuseki, implying that you intend to take territory on the bottom side, then you end up taking none there.  You need to make a plan and stick with it (this does not mean being inflexible, mind you... inflexibility is bad).

2) You play a lot of aji keshi.  Don't play moves just because they're sente.  If you don't see how the move benefits you, don't make it.  You'll have more options later or, at the very least, a ko threat.

3) You need to work on your positional judgement; at a few points, you badly underestimate the importance of a group, or an area of the board.  You seem to like to make trades, but to do that, you have to be able to estimate the worth of what's being traded.

Hello, I am black in this game, and allthough I made some bad mistakes and lost with 20-something points I think the game is relatively representative of what I can do at the moment, which means I could really use some pointers on what I do ok and what I do badly.

Thank you very much for taking the time to do this! :)];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]C[*X*: I've been experimenting with this fuseki myself a bit lately.  Keep in mind that the purpose of this fuseki is to force W to approach the lower right, then choose a joseki that will let you complete a large territory on the lower side.]
;W[po];B[oo]C[*X*: Good.];W[on];B[op];W[pn]C[*X*: This is not joseki... but how should you punish it?]
;B[qj]C[I was considering N5 here, but thought Id see how he played after R10

---

*X*: This is okay, in my opinion, but don't forget your original purpose, which was to make territory on the lower side!  Here you're trying to drive W out to the center, and strengthen the lower side as you chase him.]
;W[mo]C[*X*: This is bad.  You can and should punish.];B[nn]
C[Wanted to cut to see if either of his groups could become a target

---

*X*: What do you mean, "cut to see if..."?  You say that a few times... "I wanted to see..." Don't just speculate, PLAN.  Of course one or both of his groups will become a target.

Anyway, this is fine as long as you're confident of keeping the lower right.  Despite what you say later, losing the lower right corner now is failure for Black.

Another option here is N3.  Some might say that's too submissive, but I don't feel it is.  It would make it hard for W to make shape locally, and take a rather large amount of territory for B.]
;W[no];B[nm];W[qq]C[*X*: An obvious move.  This is another reason N3 would have been good... then B could R2 without fear.]
;B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[rr]C[*X*: I feel this is bad shape.  I like N3 better.  See variation.  Note, however, that this move is playable if you see a way to make the lower right alive when W attacks with O3 because S2 prevents W from making a base in the corner.  HOWEVER, if you have to give up R2 and S2, then W gets a base anyway, and you get a significantly worse result than if you let him make a base and defend your stones with N3!]
;W[nq]C[*X*: The only move.]
(;B[oq]C[*X*: Ugh.  This is horrible.  P2 is the only move.  See variations.]
;W[pl];B[oj];W[or];B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[pr];B[lp];W[rq]C[I thought this trade was ok, pretty small corner for what I see as center influence

*X*: You could have done much better, and W's corner is not all that tiny.]
;B[ps]C[Just to see

*X*: Do not play moves "just to see."  I can't stress this enough.  This is aji keshi.]
;W[nr];B[lr]C[*X*: Wasted move.  W can ignore this.  I was going to say it's just simple counting of liberties, but there's one critical move W must not overlook.  See variation.]

(;W[sr]C[*X*: You should bolth be ashamed of yourselves.];B[jd]
C[How is this really? I was thinking it might work with the right side stones to make some sort of framework

*X*: Fine, though you have to expect that W will R17 immediately.]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[*X*: In response to the later question, yes, this is the right direction.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]
C[Was that the right direction to push his stones? I did it beacuse I thought i had more potention of making territory on the right saide]
;W[nl];B[ln];W[ml];B[om]C[Now i started a sequence i had misread..

*X*: *sigh*];W[ol];B[pm];W[qm];B[ql]C[Very smart. This is the first pretty big mistake

*X*: Huge mistake.];W[mn]C[I usually get mad after makin mistakes like this, but thought id fight a bit without giving up for this, it wasnt really that big, but far from what I had wanted. :)

*X*: It's almost 15 points of territory and a bit of influence, so it's a big mistake.  Black has a tough game now.

Let's count.  W has about 26 in the lower right, 10 in the top right, and let's call it 15 in the top left and lower left though they aren't decided yet.  That makes 51.

Best guess for Black on the lower side is about 15 points.  On the right, Black has something like 25.

Even though White has no komi, because of the rank difference, it's already a 10 point lead for W.  Notice also that Black's territories are not secure yet, and White's are, except for the lower and upper left, for which I gave a conservative estimate.  W's lead is probably greater than 10, whereas you had the lead before this mistake.]
;B[fc];W[cf]
(;B[dq]C[*X*: Bad.  Considering that M5 will be forcing, Black has some thickness around here.  A contact move is not the right idea.  I would slide and jump (see variation).]
;W[cq];B[ep]C[*X*: No.];W[dr];B[do]C[*X*: No.];W[eq];B[cp]C[*X*: Once you're going down this road, this move is okay, but this whole sequence is wrong.]
;W[dq];B[fp]C[Didnt know wether i wanted to connect there or C5 to attack and try to build left side.

*X*: This is horrible, because it's inconsistent.  If you wanted to build your lower side territory, you should have done the slide and jump.  The only reason for playing this sequence is to connect at C5 and take the left side.  Anything else is just an out-and-out loss for B, compared to other options.

However, C5 would be bad here too, as the left side was small to begin with, since W had two low positions there already.  Therefore, this whole sequence was terrible for B.

I'm going to count the score again in a couple moves, so you can see how bad this was.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[co]C[*X*: Let's count again.  B has sente, as last time, so we can just compare this directly to the score before.  Nothing has changed except an exchange of F17 for C14 in the top left (which we will consider even) and the sequence in the lower left.  So all we need to do is compare the size of territories there now.

G1 is much bigger sente than F1, so we assume W will get G1/H2/H1/J1/F1/J2 in sente in the endgame.  B therefore has... maybe 18 points on the lower side, optimistically.  So 3 points more than the 15 we estimated before (and we were being optimistic then, too... though now at least the territory is more solid).  In the lower left, W had 10 points before, now about 19, so 9 points more, and also more solid than it was before.  The sequence you chose therefore lost Black 6 points.  You are now 16+ behind.]
;B[dj];W[dn];B[lm];W[mm];B[fm]C[Now im trying to get some lower side/center

*X*: That's about all you can do.  Maybe G7 instead of F7, though...]
;W[fn]C[*X*: This is why G7 would have been better.  It's too early for W to do this, though.]
;B[en]C[*X*: G6 was the only move.];W[eo];B[gn]C[*X*: You love these counter-ataris, don't you?  Remember that a ponnuki is worth 20 points.]
;W[em];B[fl]C[Once again being bold.. Bold or stupid, i should have f5 right?

*X*: G5, not F5.  But then D10 comes under attack.  Either way, the sequence you played up to here is another huge loss, and this move loses you everything you had on the bottom side.

The game is now hopeless.  I'll count again in a few moves.]
;W[go];B[fo];W[gq];B[en];W[gp];B[fn];W[hr]C[Second mistake, but i thought i could live with this too..

*X*: Let's count and see if you can really "live with this."

Black now has zero points on the lower side.  His group in the middle is more heavy  and overconcentrated than thick, so we can't count any points for it.

W capturing G2 gets him another 5 points or so.  So, B has gone from 18 to 0, and W is +5.  So you've lost another 23 points.  That puts W's lead at close to 40 points, and W is solid everywhere, so there's no chance for you to shake things up.

Realistically, it's time to resign now; otherwise, you're just counting on your opponent to blunder, which is rude.]
;B[cc]C[*X*: If there's to be any hope, it's in making a large territory on the right and in the center.  Try M11, and maybe you'll trick W into reducing too deeply, and you can attack.  Then, if you kill something, you're back in the game.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[bb]C[*X*: C18 is better.  This move is for when C14 is at C13, because then B can extend as far as B14.  Here you have to B15 anyway, so B18 is simply a couple points worse in terms of endgame.]
;W[da];B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[ce];B[cd]C[*X*: No.  B14 first.]
;W[ee];B[hc]C[*X*: What are you trying to accomplish?  There is no territory to be made here, and F17 is light and doesn't need defending.]
;W[bf];B[bd]C[I did this mostly to see if i could get an attack on his group now, but never got around to it. This turned out ok for me didnt it?

*X*: Corner invasion was okay, though you could have had a bit more, in the ways I said.  H17 is the bad move.  After you've invaded the corner in sente, you should M11.]
;W[nj]C[*X*: W is being too nice.  This helps you build your territory.  N10 would be enough for W to guarantee a win, pretty much.]

;B[hi];W[gi];B[gh];W[hj];B[ii];W[ij]
(;B[kg]C[Once again trying things i knew would be risky after these mistakes, felt i had to try

*X*: It's not risky, it's pointless.  What are you trying to get? At best you're taking another 5 points of territory, but in that case, L14 would be better.

I guess you mean it's risky in that you're leaving the stones around H11 open for attack.  But if you defend them, you could try to counter-attack the W stones if W ignores you.  See variation.]
;W[lg];B[lf];W[hh];B[ih];W[fh];B[gg];W[fg];B[gf]C[*X*: W could have done worse to you, I'm sure.  You should be very happy about this.  W gets about 6 or 7 points by capturing the two stones, and you now have 12 points around here, so you gained 5.  Furthermore, L13 was a bad move, and W has made it look like a good move.  Definitely a principle at work there... if your opponents' stones are out of place to begin with, don't play in a way that leaves them in a good spot.]
;W[mb]C[*X*: Guess we're in endgame.  Time to count again.  W has played badly, so B has caught up a bit.

W now has about 29 in the lower right, including the capture at N10.  W has about 25 in the lower left.  W has about 12 in the upper left, and 11 in the upper right.  Plus 7 captures, that makes 84 points.

B has 5 in the upper left, none on the bottom, maybe 20 in the center (including upper and lower halves), and say 36 on the right, if he manages to exchange S8 for S7.  So, 61.  B has caught up 17 or so, but W has a 23 point lead going into endgame.  Definitely resignable.]
;B[lb];W[lo];B[ko];W[jm];B[gk]C[*X*: You're both overlooking S8 for B or R9 for W... that's the largest area of the board, at around 8 points sente, or something like 15 points gote for whoever gets there first.]

C[Now j6 or something instead of that one?

*X*: Yes, J6 is the only move.  W captures something no matter what, now.]
;W[hm];B[in];W[hl]C[*X*: You make several mistakes here.];B[hp]
C[*X*: This is the first mistake.  H3 is clearly better... you should definitely know that at 3k.]
;W[hq]
(;B[hn]C[*X*: This is the second.  D7 is much better.  Then you have one eye for sure, and making a second eye on the left or connecting at H6 become miai.  D7 takes some points in addition to living... H6 is just connection on a dame point.]

;W[cm];B[ck]C[And again i misread, letting him cut off that group. It might not have been the decider, but at least it would have been closer if i hadnt let him have that group, and after the previous two mistakes i made i would have been happy with a semi-close game.. :)

Thank you very much once again for taking the time to review this game for me! :)

*X*: I think your biggest problem is just a careless attitude... you started off with a fuseki that was intended to make territory on the bottom side and you ended up taking four... FOUR!!! points of territory there.

There are a lot of balances you have to strike in Go... one of them is balancing flexibility with planning.  Most kyu players are at one end of the spectrum, feeling like they must make territory every place they have a stone.  You're at the other end, setting something up in one area, then abandoning it and thinking "well, I can live with that, I'll get something somewhere else."  Exchanges are fine, but in the end you have to make territory *somewhere*.  You ended up being very lucky that W gave you more on top than you really should have had.  The whole central top region probably should have ended up dame, in which case you would have lost this game by more than 40.

Anyway, I hope my comments were helpful, but aside from one or two places where you played a bad sequence, you lost this game on silly blunders that you already know are mistakes.  I guess you just have to pay more attention, but I know that's sometimes hard.  I do the same thing all the time.]
