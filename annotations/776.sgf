I am very grateful for any comments, but especially interested in local tactics. I used to be an aggressive player with lots of push-and-cuts, and usually came out ahead from these local fights. But for some months now, I really suffer.

And since I cannot find good sequences to treaten and hit the opponent, I also cannot find good sente moves. Even worse, I start to feel my groups are always weak and subject of attacks, whereas an attack on a similar opposing group - although also feels weak - usually turns out unreasonable. =;)

Hi! My name is Aaron. I'm 8k*
This is my first review I hope it helps.

I personally am not very good at 
remembering specific tactics.  Instead I
try to play moves that make sense and
are consistent with the strategy that has
been determined within the first several 
moves of the game. This has helped me
move from your rank to my present rank.

In this game, I think both players made
a few moves that actually forced their 
opponent to make they move they wanted
to make in the first place.  In this case, it
is better not to move at all.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp]C[Another idea here is to play 3-3 or 3-4 at
c16.  

Black has already declared that its going
to play a moyo game with both hoshi pts,
so you can elect to do the opposite with
3-3 or 3-4.

Of course there is nothing wrong with your
play.];W[dd]
;B[jq];W[cn]C[Fine];B[cl]C[If you dislike the idea of your opponent
getting a large moyo there are a couple
ideas in the variations.  As a consequence
of a smaller framework, however, black
is closer to having definite territory.

I don't think there is anything unusual about
jumping into the corner.]
(;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[bn];B[em]C[One advantage of this joseki is that it
is your turn and you can determine the
direction of play.

I cannot say for sure, but I think k16 is
too slow at this point, and you should 
start reducing black's framework.

];W[jd]LB[qn:a][nq:b][jo:c]C[I cannot say for sure, but I think k16 is
too slow at this point, and you should 
start reducing black's framework.

I would be more inclined to play a move
at one of the marked points before black
gets the chance to play q10 or k10 that
was played in the game.];B[jj]C[This move would usually be at q10 I think, 
but still I do not like trading this for k16.];W[mp]C[W: This also doesn't seem right, I just wanted to experiment.

Experimenting is great :)  I can't make 
a judgement on this move.]
;B[oq];W[mn];B[pn];W[jo]C[This move seems very natural at this point.
];B[nm]LB[hp:a]C[I think black begins to be a bit too 
aggressive here, I think I would prefer a move at 'a'.];W[ho];B[mm]C[W: I feel I was lucky with a lot of slow black moves.

Yes i think k3 is getting very lonely and
blacks original moyo strategy is getting
turned upside down.];W[gq];B[mr];W[dn]C[I think this move is played in the wrong 
direction.  Perhaps you were trying to capture the 3 black stones...

In order to settle your stones in the middle
you should be pressing out toward your
own stronger stones.  This move ends up
pushing black closer to your weaker stones.

;B[en];W[eo];B[fo];W[ep];B[fq];W[fr];B[er];W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[eq];W[hp]C[Unfortunately these moves only hurt
you rather that settling your group.];B[hr]LB[qf:a][cf:b]C[For black, I think there are bigger moves
to be had at a or b perhaps.]
;W[gr];B[ir];W[lq];B[lr];W[kq];B[kr];W[jp];B[mq];W[iq];B[jr]C[W: I guess black should not answer here.

I think by now you will be able to live, and 
there are bigger points for black.
];W[ln];B[lo]C[This is a "thank you" move.

I think black is aiming at a killing move,
however it is far too early to do so,
this move only forces you to make the shape
you wanted anyway.
]
;W[mo];B[hq];W[fp];B[gm];W[im];B[ip];W[kl];B[lk];W[ik];B[gk];W[kk];B[kj]LB[qh:a]C[W: Now the white group feels more or less safe, and black looks thin at K10, M9, O7. This is typically a position where I feel I cannot make the reasonable profit.

Black is not really so thin, but not so thick
either.  I think in this position i would be likely to play something like 'a' to
offset blacks influence on the right.]
;W[pj]C[W: Probably not the right way to treaten or start an attack? Better to cut at M10 or push at J10?

I really think q10 is too close to black's
sphere of influence.];B[ll];W[lm];B[pg]TR[ll][lm]C[W: Another weak B stone I cannot handle.


I think this is an excellent move by black,
prepared by trading the triangled stones.
Now his attack is stronger compared to
playing q13 right away.

Please compare this board position to
the variation.

As it turns out, however, you made a 
decent living on the bottom :)]
(;W[ql];B[qi];W[qj];B[qh];W[rn];B[rp];W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[qq];W[ro]C[W: Ugly shape for white?

I don't think you have a choice at the moment.];B[rq];W[ol]AB[pg]CR[pg][qh][qi]C[After this you might like to put pressure
on the marked black stones while
taking profit on the top, as it turns out
however, you dont get a chance to do this.]
;B[co];W[bo];B[cr]C[This is another consequence of that tragic
e5 :/];W[br];B[bs];W[ar];B[ap];W[bl];B[bk];W[bm]C[W: When I played this I saw instantly that A8 would be correct. Now I think the second eye is in danger. This is the kind of thing I rarely see for an opposing group. :)];B[cj]C[W: I think I was lucky black didn't want to risk a few stones for an attack with e.g. A8. Even with the cut at C9 I don't see how white could live.

The outcome of black a8 very much depends
on how both of you played it :), in any case,
a8 is a must now.

];W[al]
;B[df];W[cd]C[I think this move is better played at
f16 straight away, then if black playes f14
you are free to 'pursue other interests' 
on the board.];B[ff];W[fd]MA[cd][dd][jd]C[To me, it seems your four marked stones,
while closing off some territory, are
not working efficiently.];B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf]
;B[qf];W[nf];B[ld];W[kf];B[jc]C[W: A typical keima-attach move that never works for me, but always for the opponents. ;)

I know the feeling :)

Actually I think you came out of this pretty
well, you closed off the upper left corner and
made a nice solid territory on the top right.];W[ic];B[id];W[kd];B[hc];W[ib];B[hd];W[jb];B[kc]
;W[lc];B[hb];W[fb];B[if];W[ge];B[hf];W[gf];B[gg];W[hg];B[gh]C[W: Now H13 could be fatal, but again I cannot see a good way to use it.

I don't think that cut is going anywhere.
Now black is just a bit more solid on the
left side.

];W[nj];B[ih];W[jg]C[I am not sure what the purpose of this move
was.  There is absolutely no chance that black will not connect, so you were perhaps
aiming at keeping m16 under wraps or
something else?

If keeping m16 under control was your aim
I think something like l12 is better.]
;B[ig];W[bf]C[Big move at this point i think];B[cf];W[bg];B[ch];W[lj];B[le];W[lf];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[nc]C[Now everything is pretty much settled.

This game ended up being rather
peaceful, and in the end, you ended
up winning.  I think you could try to
think a bit more at exactly why you are
doing a certain move, even if that move
happens to be tactically wrong.  

Good luck!
