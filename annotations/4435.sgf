C[Hi this a game with a friiend of mine he need a tutor or teacher please if u have any spare time please go to his Kgs account and leave a message and say the pass word (Brian nowe as sent me to teach u says u need a teacher?)he will be delighted plus i want to get some credit my friend is Deeptuna here thank you .

Hi, my name is Fagner Fernandes. I'm the reviewer of this game.

First of all, i would like to apolozige for the delay in reviewing this game.

I'll do my best in order to help your to improve your go, so let's begin.]

(;B[qd];W[cd];B[pq];W[dp]LB[ec:A][oc:B][qo:C][cp:1][cq:3][dq:2]
C[i wanted to play D3 there i wanted to know that also secures corners right and i have made a i dont what i can call it but would they be the best moves

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, don't worry to much about the best move all the time. Just remember that first you have to play on vital points.

I think would be a good idea to play in the marked points.
Komuku (3-4) is used when you'll do it a shimari (a keima, or knight's move, is movement relative to other stone).

A, B e C are shimari points. They secure the corners of goban.

Anyway, your choice wa good. Let's see what your opponent will do next.]

(;B[ec]C[this attach is  scary to me because i dont know how to counter tell me what is the best move here

Well, if he want to fight so early in a game, just hit him hard.]

(;W[dc]C[was this it ?

It's possible but I think isn't the best choice.];B[ed]
(;W[de]C[I think the previuos move it wasn't bad, but this one...]
;B[dd]LB[db:3][cc:1][ce:2]C[i alreaduy know what u gonna say to many cutting points right yes i understand that it just  that when i play it a different mind of state not logical 0_o ya

Well, don't worry. Usually we make mistakes. The difference is that higher dans don't make all the time just like us.

And i'm glad that you saw many cutting points there. To clarify them I'll marked them up.]

(;W[ce]CR[cd][de]LB[cc:A]C[In go, there some shapes that are considered bad.

Empty triangle is one of them.

Usually he doesn't protect anything. And you forget it to protect your vital cutting point. "Why vital" you can ask?

It's because 'A' guards the door of your corner. Let's continue.]
;B[cc]C[And he attacked your weakness...];W[db]LB[da:2][cb:1]
[eb:3]C[Instead just respond without thinking, try to take a deep breath and see if it's worthy to play in some place.

If you start a fight for survival, try to count how many liberties your stones have.

Your 2 stones have 3 liberties where 2 of them where shared with black stones.]
;B[cb]LB[da:1][eb:2]C[Now your group have 2, and his group have 3.]
;W[bc]
(;B[bb]C[He responded not quite right here.];W[ad];B[oc]C[You see how sly he was?

He avoided you to attack his shimari.];W[dj]C[was this the best pull out in that situation or it not a pull out

Well, I think was a very conservative move. He have done a big mess in your corner.

Your move your good, a little far, but in this moment wasn't the best option.]
;B[cq]C[Well, your opponent is hungry for territory!!!

He attacked you in the weakness of hoshi.

But remember you can exchange territory for influence for a better profity.]

(;W[cp]C[he attacks be a lot he is to agresive how can i counter

When you are attacked in hoshi, you have to seal his path to sides. This way he can take only the corner instead a piece of your side too.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er]
(;W[fr];B[fq];W[fp];B[ep];W[eo];B[eq];W[gr]C[Ugh... Not good at all.]
;B[gp]C[wanted to do a bamboo joint but he didnt let me

Of course. He isn't naive enough to let you do it bamboo joint.

Don't count with the opponent's good will. Make your moves correctly and he won't avoid in time.]
;W[fo];B[gq]SQ[fr][gr]C[Here I would forget these stones. You have a big moyo (potential territory in the side.

It's time to conquer some territory.]
(;W[iq];B[hr];W[hq];B[hs]C[briannowe [30k\]: getting hard

Yeah. Time to you give up and look for something more profitable.]
;W[ir];B[fs];W[ho];B[qo]
(;W[oo]C[was this good

No. You're letting him get all territory.];B[pn]C[Take a look on the previous variation.]
;W[on];B[qj];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[qr];W[pr];B[qq];W[or];B[jd]
C[Hmm... You make a interesting moyo on the bottom.];W[jj]C[when i played it always leads to center so i play tengen for center influence

Ok. But your options to steal territory are running low.]
(;B[jf]C[this is a killer isnt it

Well... Not quite. It's a good move but not the decisive one. he would explore your weakness in lower left corner.]
;W[ni];B[ph];W[og]TR[jb][rb][ri][rp]SQ[dh][dm][do][go][bp][lp]
C[he asall the triangle and my territory is un stable what can i do

Sorry, but i didn't get this one. Let's see if later I can get it.

But i understood that your territory is unstable. You can expand him if your have no idea where to attack.

Lemme put some stones and you'll see how much territory you can get.]

(;B[oh]C[briannowe [30k\]: i won other game];W[nh]C[the rest i would let you review it because u will see my mistakes and also um there is something in the beginnig please tell me great advice]
