C[
Dear reviewer, thanks in advance for looking at my game. I have looked at the game and wrote some comments on my moves.

The ranking system of KGS has put me on 2k, but I haven't played a lot of games with that acocunt, my strenght is probably more around 3-4 kyu.

Michal];B[pc]C[klass [2k\]: hi];W[dp]C[ignus [2k\]: hi, enjoy]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[qe]TR[pc]LB[cn:C][df:A][fq:B]C[
Wasn't this the wrong direction for white to approach? In the game this stones seemed to only to reduce me a bit, and not really make strenght for attacking.

BB: No, this isn't a problem. It's a way for White to stop you getting a huge framework. In a sense, he has to do something other than just playing White A, Black B, White C. And because White's move as played approaches a stone one the 3-4 point, it is arguably as big as the marked stone, in the sense that they are currently sharing the corner.]
;B[qg];W[oe];B[nd]C[
I found this to work nicely with the fact that i had q4, r13, and f17. The white stones seem lonely in the upper right.

BB: I agree. I don't know the joseki, but the strategy is sound.]

(;W[pg]C[
Should white have played q12 here? Quickly setting like this makes him only a small group, and helps me a lot.

BB: Yes, W should play q12. See variation.];B[ph];W[og]
(;B[cf]C[
I tenukied because I didn't feel that the cut at r12 was an immediate threat.

BB: I think the cut is worth playing for White. I think B r14 might be worthwhile. See var.]
;W[ee];B[cc]C[BB: Now might be an appropriate time to cut on the right. See var.]

(;W[cd];B[dc]
(;W[ec]C[BB: See var.];B[eb];W[ed]C[
COvering at e16 seemed an unnneccesary move by white - and it gave her the empty triangle shape. So I was happy.

BB: E16 is necessary. It's e17 in the first place that is unnecessary.]
;B[gb];W[ci];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[bf];B[fp]C[
I approached high to prevent the attach&extend joseki (after b f4, white f4) which would build white's right side.

BB: I wouldn't worry about the attach and extend joseki. It would make W strong, but in the process you would also get strong, and this would make good use of q4.]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[eq]
(;B[cn]C[
I tenukied after g3 - I didn't want white to get a move around here, and it seems that the cut g4 wouldn't do much for her.

BB: See the variation. It ends with W having a low position, and so is not to be worried about.]

(;W[cl]C[BB: I would *definitely* have cut here as White. See variation. Also, c8 is low, and makes c6 easy to sacrifice.]
;B[gp]C[
I think i should move with c6 first - perhaps to b4?

BB: No. c6 can't easily be dealt with, and b4/c3 exchange might end up being aji keshi.]
;W[bp]C[BB: This makes c6 very effective. It is still not captured, and it has already done good work.]

(;B[ge]C[
This seemed to reduce the white moyo, and build my own.];W[lc]
C[BB: I actually think this is a good invasion. There is a wekness in Black on both sides, room to extend along the top (j17), and to escape upwards. In light of this evident hole in the Black position at the top, g15 may have been premature. See variation for previous move.]
;B[kd];W[qh]C[
This white tenuki seems a bit premature - m16 is big I think.

BB: This is premature. I think White's pretty stable here.]

(;B[ld]C[BB: I'd prefer l17 - it makes territory around j17, and the move played leaves White too much aji for making m17 alive. To put it another way, the influence this move gives you facing the centre is not important, because there are no weak groups.]
;W[dm]SQ[mq][np][nq][pn][qi][qn]C[BB: Small. White should try any of the marked moves. r11 is the biggest, in my opinion.]
;B[qi];W[rh];B[ri];W[rg]
(;B[pi]C[BB: I'd prefer p10.];W[qq]C[
Given my walls at g3 and r11, I was happy with this invasion.

BB: White should invade here. o3/o4 would be my choice.]
(;B[pq]C[BB: This is correct. Clock on the wider space.];W[qp]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq]C[
Although the wall at r11 does loose its effectiveness now. Should I have blocked from the other side?

BB: Yes, one wall was going to lose effectiveness, but you now have a brilliant position on the bottom. And the influence on the right still has potential. Imagine if White tries to stop you getting territory at the bottom...]

(;W[gm]C[
I wanted that point :\]

BB: It's a hard choice - there are two moyos. I think this is actually a good point, but Black may be able to cut it of by threatening to save c6 (or vise-versa).]
;B[im]C[
Passive, but I couldn't find anything better.

BB: No, it's not passive. You're threatening to make a *massive* territory at the bottom. Your potential on the bottom is more than White's potential on the left.]

(;W[qc]C[BB: Big, but see variation.];B[hn]C[
This seemed to be large to me - was white's tenuki a mistake?

BB: Yes.]
(;W[pb]C[BB: See variation.];B[ob];W[oc];B[nc];W[pd]C[
So he got a few points in gote.. I was happy with this.

BB: This is bad for White. You made profit too. m17 is completely dead now.]
;B[fg]SQ[ff][gg]C[
Reduction of white's moyo, and aiming to use c14 somehow.

B: "somehow" isn't enough. This is too far. Try one of the marked points instead, where you can stay connected while reducing.]
;W[ff];B[gf]
(;W[eg]C[
Should white have cut here at g13?

BB: Yes. There is a proverb "if you push, you must cut". It's true. If you're not going to cut, you just shouldn't push.]
;B[fh]
(;W[ni]C[
Perhaps I should have played here, instead of f12...

B: Perhaps, but not if White was going to play here. White needs a big reduction, clearly. This is a small reduction, and lets you have too much. See variations on this and the next move.]

(;B[nh];W[me]C[BB: What is this? W should play p12!];B[oh];W[md]

(;B[ne]C[BB: n17 seems to work too.];W[mf];B[mc];W[lb]C[BB: l17 is a better try.]
;B[kc];W[nb];B[mb];W[oa];B[la]C[BB: l18 gives W less aji.];W[ik]
;B[nf];W[hh]C[
Now it seems my center won't be big anymore.

BB: You don't need the centre. You have the bottom, which is huge.]
;B[hl]C[BB: These are thin moves. Better to connect at g13.]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[gj];B[gl];W[fj];B[gg];W[mi]C[BB: This is like passing.]
;B[jh]C[BB: You should close off the bottom. m8, perhaps. In fact, what does this move achieve?]
;W[kk]C[BB: This achieves something.];B[ll]
(;W[lk]C[BB: See variation.];B[ml];W[kl];B[km];W[mg];B[hj]C[
Obviously bad - i was more or less panicking to capture the center white stones somehow.]
;W[ii];B[dn];W[el]C[ignus [2k\]: hi, sorry
ignus [2k\]: connection problem];B[fm];W[ei]C[BB: k14 or so is where you both should be playing now.]

I figured white was leading now, so I had to try desperate measures.

BB: Then you should start by cutting at n12... see variation.

BB: This is basically the last place it's worth commenting, because starting here you're overplaying. In the variation I think you can capture four stones either at j14, n13, or o9. But maybe not. Let's have a look at the score now. I will mark the points that I consider definite territory, which can only be lost if the owner chooses to tenuki when attacked.]

[sr][ss]C[Counting:
Black top left 30, right 6, bottom 42 = 78.
White top right 21, bottom right 6, bottom left 12, left 25 = 64.

Black is ahead.

But perhaps you don't actually want to count. Let's look at this another way (next move).]
;B[jk]C[Counting, the simpler way.

Black's bottom territory is approximately equals to White's top right added to White's left side. You can basically see this by guaging the size of the territories visually.

White's bottom right is approximately equals to Black's top left (up to the e18 stone.

The question is then "which is bigger, Black's top centre, or White's bottom left?"

It's a close thing, perhaps you're a few points ahead.

But you've got sente.

So you don't need to overplay.];W[jl];B[mk];W[mj];B[ji];W[il]
;B[lj];W[mh];B[ng];W[jg];B[kg];W[kh]C[
But of course I had too many weaknesses there for it to work...]

;B[dg];W[ef];B[bg]C[
Here I played some ugly hamete :( Bad style..];W[ce];B[df];W[ch]
;B[cg];W[bh]C[
And I resigned. I think something went wrong with my replies to white's reducing/invading moves in the center.

Also, perhaps I resigned a bit too early. White's lead isn't that big, and if I wouldn't have played the overplays in the center which led to the capture of a few of my stones, I would perhaps still be leading..

Anyway i'm looking forward to your comments :\]

ignus [2k\]: thank you
klass [2k\]: thx

BB: If I had to offer one piece of advice, it would be to count before you start overplaying. I have no problem with overplay, but only when you are sure you are losing. Let me explain precisely my strategy for this situation, ans I seriously suggest you do this.

1. You get the feeling you are losing, or you may be losing.
2. Visually compare territories to determine if you are winning or losing. If it's not obvious, either just keep playing reasonably, or actually count.
3. Only when you realise you are losing does your strategy need to change.
4. Ask yourself this *exact* question: "what do I have to do to win?" You need to find the answer that is most achievable. If there is absolutely no hope, then you resign.
5. Say to yourself "I'm either going to achieve this and be back in the game, or I'm going to fail and resign."
6. Do what ever you have to do to achieve this goal even if it involves overplay (which it often does).
7. If you succeed, you're back in the game, if not go back to 4 (which may mean resigning if there is no hope).

In this game, the answer to question 4 (at the point you started overplaying at move 144) should have been "capture four stones in the centre." But in actualy fact, you should have stopped at step 3, and kept playing reasonably, using your sente to best possible effect.]
