C[Thanks in advance for the review... this game was played by myself and one of my friends on IGS, so we'd like a review for both sides. I don't have too many questions, but we'd like you to share your opinion on any of the moves in this game.

**********

Hi,

sorry that reviewing took a little longer. I was just awfully busy and didn't manage to get it finished earlier.

Well then, thanks for submitting the game and giving me the chance to review it and learn from it. I greatly enjoyed doing the review, and I hope you'll like my work.
Still, please take everything I say with a grain of salt - I'm only some weakish 1-kyu/1-Dan myself, so everything I say will possibly sound quite stupid to a stronger player.

I reviewed for both sides (as always, this is much easier to do than a one-sided review) and preceded my comments with "fey:".
Be sure not to miss the variations I show along the way. At the end of the .sgf file, you'll find a brief summary.

A thing I'd like to particulary emphasise about this game is that my comments may often sound quite harsh, scolding, whatever. Please excuse that.
It is due to my poor English that I can't express my criticism in a more polite way. I don't want to insult you or you moves, everything is meant as honest and constructive thoughts that may improve your game.
Plus, I like to say things straight (maybe this is German bluntness ;) ). So please don't take that personally.

Well, if you have any further questions about the review, don't share my opinion at a certain point or just want to send some feedback on the review in general, feel free to send me an e-mail.

Ok, let's start. :)

(;B[dc]TR[fc]C[fey: This seems a bit strange to me. 
The joseki you choose here is normally applied when Black is clearly outnumbered and at a local disadvantage and has to make a stable group as soon as possible. It's a joseki that settles the position quickly and ends with White having sente and most of the corner territory.
But here Black isn't that hardly pressed. Ok, the marked stone is pincered by K16, but it is a light, flexible stone, full of resources. *You don't need to settle it yet*!
The way you play here is too heavy, too fixed, it decides things too early.
Check the vars for some alternatives.];W[cc]
(;B[ed]TR[cb]C[fey: Usually, this is played at C18, to get at least a bit of the corner and a secure base. See the var. for the normal sequence.]
;W[cd];B[db];W[cb]C[fey: This move seems small to me. White should rather play an extension down the left side.]
;B[ic]TR[jd]C[fey: Eww. Please ban moves like this from your game!
This J17 is a so-called "shoulder hit from below" and rarely a good move. It should be reserved for situations when Black absolutely needs to live by all means, but that isn't the case here. Why did Black choose the D17 attachment? What was you plan?
If you play like that, I'd assume that you try to isolate the marked stone and attack it.
The execution of this plan might have led to a local disadvantage in the upper left corner, but it's still a game and you can get a good attack going.

But what you are doing with J17 is simply the oppposite: You strengthen his stone, you help him to settle it and you make it harder for yourself to attack it.]
;W[jc]TR[jd]SQ[ic]C[fey: This is the logical and feasible answer. Now look at the formation of black and white stones that has been created: One Black stone is clutched against a strong pillar of white stones. If Black doesn't respond now, white can clamp at H17 or hane at J18 or J16. He has no trouble making a comfortable position for his stones.
Black, on the other side, is only left with a useless, redundant and weak stone that doesn't aid his group the least bit.

Sorry, I might be picking on that too much, I don't want to sound too hard. But you must understand that moves like J17 are simply, outright bad in nearly every situation.]
;B[id]C[fey: So you have to come back. But again the shape favors White.
Did you ever read Kageyama's "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go"? This great book has a whole chapter about the "struggle to get ahead". 
In this case, both the black and the white two-stone-group are trying to get ahead of each other, to be the first to reach the center and get rid of the worries of a weak group.
And because White has sente, it's easy for him to turn the position in his favor.]

(;W[nc]C[fey: Not a good move. White has to hane at J15. (var.)]

(;B[oc]TR[id][ic][fc][ed][dc][db]SQ[nc][jd][jc]C[fey: This move helps White more than Black.
Maybe we have to look at the whole upper side again to get the right idea here.

There's White's upper left corner. It's not important right now. It's there, and it's stable.

Then there's Black's marked group. Status? Well, I'd say it looks pretty much alive. White has almost no chance to attack it unless he gets three moves in a row.

Next there's White's marked group. Here things look differently. This group is thin, it has no secure base and no definite eye space yet. *This* is the important fact. 

White created a weak and attackble group by playing O17. Black should take advantage of that.

But what Black does is again the opposite. P17 helps White to form a strong and secure shape by extending to O16. Of course, White's group could work more efficiently, but we have to accept that. In any case, Black's propective attack is gone completely.

So what should Black do instead? See the vars for some of my thoughts.]
;W[nd]C[fey: The natural response. Suddenly, White's group is not as weak as it was before and Black is left with gote (you have to answer on Q14) and aji in the corner (R17).

I can only emphasise again that you shouldn't play moves like P17 lightheartedly. Try to picture the resulting pattern before you play them, and decide *who* benefits more from your kosumi attachment: you or your opponent.
Actually the P17 joseki is most commonly used in high handicap games, when Black already has a stone on the K16 star point. There the aim of the kosumi attachment is to deny White access to the corner and create a weak group to attack.
This goal can't be achieved here, so I wouldn't advise P17 here.]
;B[pf];W[ie]C[fey: Good move! A vital point. Just imagine Black playing here - that'd be a huge difference.]

(;B[ib]TR[ie]C[fey: I'm doubtful whether this is a good move. 
What did you try to achieve with it?

Were you trying to attack White, to take his base?
This is quite a futile plan, because White already got to play the J15 hane and doesn't depend on eyespace on the egde of the board anymore because he has lots of space for development in the center.

Or did you want to defend your own group around F17?
Again, this is unnecessary.
Firstly, your group is almost certainly alive even without this move. The shape you built around F17 is far too stable to die.
The second thing is, *if* you still feel uneasy and want to defend, you should choose a more active way to do so.
See the var. for a different idea.

This move is only move number 23, and for this early stage of the middle game, it is too low and to passive.]
;W[jb]C[fey: Likewise, this move is not interesting for White. It's too small to answer here, and if he wants to protect his group, he should rather do so by moving further to the center.]
;B[he]C[fey: Okay. A black mistake and a white one sum up to zero. ;)]
;W[if]
(;B[ee]C[fey: Again, this is overly cautious.
E15 is *not* an important move, it helps to make a group 'alive' that already has plenty eye space.
I think that you should continue at H14.];W[cf]C[fey: You just forced White to take more territory on the left side - unfortunately, Black didn't gain anything in this exchange, the E15 contributes nothing to your position, it neither makes points nor does it secure a weak group.]
;B[de]C[fey: Hey. What's that? 
Looks like a time-saving move. What was the time limit for this game?

Really, please don't play moves like this. It's really a totally inferior exchange for Black.
This move is crude and looses aji, ko threats and on top of that *doesn't help Black at all*.

Honestly, I can't understand what you were trying to achieve here. This move brings you no benefit.

Again, this group is safe! You don't have to continue here. Just take a big point somewhere else.
I can promise you that if you get rid of this overly frightened attitude that only produces bad moves, you'll have climbed an important step on the way to become stronger. Really.]
;W[ce];B[df]TR[eh][dg][eg]C[fey: Another bad move.

It's bad from point of shape: An empty triangle.

It's bad because you are behind in the 'struggle to get ahead'. If you want to continue in this direction, try one of the marked moves instead. They'll put you ahead in this struggle.

It's bad because it unnecessarily forces White to take territory.

It's bad because it *doesn't help Black at all*.

Maybe this is the worst move of the whole game. Please try not to play moves like this again.

Something I notice is that you play a lot of moves that help only your opponent and gain yourself close to nothing.
So maybe it might help you to carefully consider this before playing each move:

*Is this move necessary?
*Does this move improve my position?
*If it does, does it also improve my opponent's position?
*If it does, can I find a way to weaken him and improve my position at the same time?]
;W[dg]C[fey: Now White starts building territory on the fourth line. It's painful for Black to permit this hane.]

(;B[hf]TR[eg]C[fey: You should exchange the marked point for White D12 now to press him down on the left side.

(var.)];W[ig];B[ff]C[fey: Not necessary!

Your group is alive. It's obvious.
If you want to hane at E13, just do it. It needs no preparatory move.
If you want to go out in the center, play H13 instead.

But my advice would be to play tenuki in any case. ;-)];W[qn]
C[fey: A matter of taste maybe, but approaching form the other side seems like a more patient way to me that uses White's own prospects in a better way.

At this early point of the game, we can already state that White is leading.

His stones are full of potential and there are even prospects for a huge moyo.
Black, on the other hand, just built some sphere of influence on the right side which can't be called territory. His stones on the upper side (around F17) have no strategical value and basically shut themselves in.

Why did White take such an early lead?
It's because Black played too many moves that were too shy and only helped White, and maybe it's also because Black lost a bit track of the whole board and only thought locally.
Try to establish the idea of tenuki more firmly in your play.
Be doubful. Be brave (not daring).
Take your chances, and don't create them for your opponent.]
;B[qo]C[fey: The kosumi attachment again. You seem to like this move. :)
I think it's quite a good way to answer White's kakari here, because now you have a stone at Q10 and White will have to care for a weak group as he is unable to make a true base on the right edge.]
;W[pn];B[np];W[qj]
(;B[qk]C[fey: White tries for sabaki.
Anyone trying to achieve sabaki hopes for complications, for crosscuts, hanes, kos, things like that.

In view of that, maybe Black tries a bit too hard here and thereby falls right into White's plans.
Perhaps the var. is also an option worth considering.];W[pk]
TR[qn][pn]C[fey: Nice move. White treats his marked stones lightly - good.]
;B[qi];W[ql];B[rk];W[oj];B[pi];W[rl];B[pl];W[ok]LB[ok:2][pl:1]
C[fey: The marked exchange didn't help Black.];B[sk]C[fey: Possible. Normally, you'd simply capture, though...]
;W[ro]TR[qq][oq]SQ[pl][nn]C[fey: This move is aji-keshi. This way, White loses the aji of R3 or P3 later.
S5 is not necessary for the safety of White's group and not big from point of territory.
White should rather play something like O6 to definitely capture the marked Black stone and connect his two groups.]
;B[rp];W[po]C[fey: More aji-keshi. If you leave this exchange unplayed, you can try for trouble with the R3 peep later.]
;B[qp];W[mo];B[rn]TR[cq][fq][eg][cn]C[fey: Capturing this stone is neither important nor big now. Look at the whole board!
There are plenty of nice and big points to be played, I marked some of them.]
;W[rm]C[fey: The same applies to this move. Way too small!]
;B[sn]C[fey: You two guys are fighting about peanuts here...
I think you should really shift your attention to the important strategic points on the board. :)]
;W[no];B[mp];W[lp];B[lq]
(;W[kp]C[fey: White can hane at L4 to apply even more pressure to Black, who should feel very unease getting pressed down so low here while White build a powerful wall on the outside.

(var.)];B[kq];W[jq];B[ck];W[cm]C[fey: Good direction. This move also helps your corner, which starts looking dangerously big.]
;B[ch];W[cg]
(;B[bh]C[fey: I don't really like this move. It's so low again, begging for life on the second line feels just too painful. Can't Black try something more positive here?
(var.)];W[dh];B[bm];W[bl]
(;B[bn]C[fey: This looks like overplay. I guess Black has to be contend with the crosscut and atari here. (var.)]
;W[cl];B[bk];W[dk]C[fey: Yes! This move shows whole-board vision. Black should have taken the chance to prevent this huge center moyo.]
;B[al];W[bp];B[bg];W[cn]C[fey: Good, you are consequently following this line. The moyo looks more and more like territory.]
;B[bo];W[co];B[dj];W[ej];B[di];W[ei]C[fey: A huge success for White! I'd count him way ahead now.]
;B[ci];W[fh]
(;B[bj]TR[ai]C[Was this move neccessary?

fey: I don't think so. The two marked points look like miai to secure two eyes.
I added some variations with White attempting to kill Black - I didn't find a move that works.]
;W[ao];B[am]LB[kf:(?)]TR[mh][nh][gh]C[fey: This feels a little small - It's only about 7 points gote.
It's far more important to limit White's moyo as much as possible. And even though you lived in the center of his territory later, I think that you were simply lucky. Actually it's way too late for an invasion now, so Black should at least seek to reduce the moyo from the outside with the marked moves.]
;W[nh]C[fey: White completes his moyo. The game looks hopeless for Black now.]
;B[ad];W[ae];B[be];W[bd];B[af];W[ac];B[ae];W[bf];B[ag];W[bb]
TR[kr][jr]C[fey: Too small. *If* you want to play here, D19 is better, but actually this, too, is to small.
To my mind, on of the biggest endgame moves now is K2 for Black or L2 for White, because it's not only a big move in itself but also includes further endgame moves, e.g. the hane-and-connection. It may add up to more than ten points, so it's fairly big.]
;B[nf]C[fey: Also a good move, one of the last holes in White's huge territory.]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[lf];B[me];W[le];B[md];W[sl];B[rj]C[fey: If you had simply captured here on move 51, this wouldn't have been sente for White. ;)]
;W[ld];B[mc]C[fey: Ok, Black gained a little here, but obviously White is still leading.]
;W[lc];B[nb]C[fey: Why not M19?];W[kr]C[fey: As I said above, a very big move. Biggest now, I'd say.]
;B[lr];W[jr];B[pm]C[fey: Futile.];W[om];B[so]
(;W[ol]C[fey: Actually this move isnt't even necessary, but as the saying goes, "a rich man doesn't pick fights"...
(var.)];B[sm]C[fey: This move is worth zero points. ;)];W[qm]
;B[jk]C[fey: Well now, this is really a HUGE overplay. If somebody played this against me, I'd feel a bit insulted. This K9 is stating: Heh, stupid, well, I know, you're strong all around but I also know that you're gonna make a mistake and let me live."
Normally, most go players consider this kind of move quite impolite.

But well, let's see how White could have actually prevented you from living here.]
;W[il];B[ik];W[hk]C[fey: Don't try too hard. Hanes are often creating complications and cuts. Stay calm. Extending to H8 kills Black in a cooler way.]
;B[jl];W[im];B[jm];W[in];B[ml];W[ij];B[jj];W[ii];B[mj];W[li]
;B[ln];W[lk];B[lj];W[mk];B[nk];W[nj];B[kk];W[nl]TR[ll]C[fey: White should rather play at the marked point to deny Black an eye there.]
;B[ll];W[mi];B[km]
(;W[kj]TR[mm]C[fey: Ok, I'd say this is the final mistake. N7 still kills Black.
(var.)];B[mm]C[fey: Even though Black really was extremly lucky here, he's still behind on territory.
This shows how far ahead White actually was.];W[ls]C[fey: Very big sente move.]

**********

I think the lesson to learn from this game is mainly that whole-board vision is extremely important. Both of you seemed to loose a bit track of this during the middle game, but White eventually managed to get an idea of the important plan that decided the game and built this giant moyo.
I feel that Black was running behind, trying to prevent the worst everywhere, trying to build a small living group in White's huge spheres of influence at least.
That's because Black played lots of slow moves that were not necessary and overly cautious. 
You have to have confidence in the strength of your groups, and maybe you also have to be a bit more daring and gamble if you are not absolutely sure.
In any case, White seemed to be in possession of sente for most of the time, and I think that also tells in the game result.

If you like reading books, I'd strongly advocate Kageyama's "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go". This book will make you stronger, I'm absolutely sure of that.
Life-and-dead problems might also prove useful if you want to get rid of that uncertain and overly cautious attitude in defending your groups.
Oh, and maybe just read some book about Takemiya's go style (e.g. "Master of Go", I think that was what it was called...not sure, though). They'll teach you a lot about  stategy and whole-board thinking.

I hope that there were some pointers of the review that you found useful, and I repeat my apologies for the rather blunt comments.

I wish you many successful games in the future.
