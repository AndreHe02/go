C[ericlavine: There was a big fight in this game, starting with a white invasion on move 56 and ending on move 146 with the death of my cutting group. This was a close fight, but in the end I got nothing. I am mostly interested in ideas for how to kill the white group, but ideas for other ways to benefit from white's weak group are also welcome.

ericlavine: In a second big fight (moves 149-172) I captured a large corner and almost killed a large white group.  Although this fight turned out well for me, I am still interested in suggestions.

ericlavine: I think that I came out ahead in the opening, but opening play is my weakness in most games. I am interested in any suggestions about the first 45 moves. In particular, I don't think that I responded well to white 24, an unexpected joseki variation.

ericlavine: Thank you for reviewing this game.

Az: My pleasure, I hope my comments prove helpful];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[cp];W[qc];B[iq];W[pf]C[Az: I don't like this move for white very much, since if white wants to build a corner moyo facing towards the upper left, there are better ways to do this than the 3-3 point.]
;B[jc];W[lc]C[Az: This is the wrong sid for white. White should try to push you towards his "thickness". This is the second fuseki mistake for white]
;B[gc];W[ec]LB[je:a][ge:b][df:c]C[Az: Now comes the first questionable move of the game by black. Black should reinforce around 'a' rather than make a double approach (which opens the possiblity that this will become a weak group). This may feel slow, but as long as you are strong you can reduce the white moyo easily; if you have weak stones that area could suddenly become terroritory for white.

'a' is better than 'b' since it allows for expansion into the right side, and it is further from 'c' (which you can expect white will play next). Being close to 'c' feels claustrophic. After the 'b'-'c' exchange your stone is almost entirely defensive, after a 'a'-'c' exchange you can reduce the right (and move out into the center more effectively).

Sorry if this is beating a dead horse, this is the kind of mistake I see 1-5 kyu player make a lot.]
;B[cf];W[df]LB[je:a][dg:b][ce:c][ef:d][de:e]C[Az: This is what black didn't want to have happen, especially before black 'a'. 'b' is the correct response for making good shape here. It's possible black was worried about the sequence B 'b'- W 'e', but the corner is small and white would be over concentrated (E17 is too close in that variation for one thing).]
;B[ce];W[cd]LB[de:a][ee:b][dg:c][ef:d][ci:e][ch:f]C[Az: Black should at least push at 'a' before falling back with W 'b' - B 'e'. Playing 'f' directly is passive and gives black rather flat shape.]
;B[ch];W[dg];B[ci]LB[ck:a]C[Az: Black is secure now, but the result is not very good (compared to what it could have been at least). One sign that black doesn't have very good shape is that in the future a move around 'a' would pose a fairly serious threat to the group. Of course, white isn't going to be playing 'a' any time soon, but the point is, after investing 4 stones here, black is still rather shaky.]
;W[qn];B[ql]TR[qc][pf]LB[pl:a][pk:b]C[Az: This is playable, but one can't help but feel that this helps white make the best of the two marked stones when the counter attack comes. If you want to pincer, one idea would be to choose a high pincer such as 'a' or 'b' instead so it is less vulnerable to counter attack. The other reason this may not be favorable is that in many joseki (including the one in game), this leads to black taking profit while white gets thick, which fits nicely with white's strategy of large scale influence.]
;W[on];B[np];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl]C[I have not seen this move before. It worked surprisingly well.]
;B[pj]C[This seemed like the only move, but the r10 cut sealed my group tightly.]
;W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[oj];B[pi];W[qm];B[rk]LB[rl:a][sj:b]
C[Az: White should exchange 'a' for 'b' in sente];W[oi]TR[pf]
MA[ok][pm]C[Az: White gets some thickness out of this, but it's really nothing to write home about. White has two cutting points and the Q14 stone is being underminded. I think this is fine for black]

(;B[qg]LB[qf:a][pg:b][rf:c]C[ericlavine: The idea of this move is to make life in sente by threatening to escape.

Az: The problem with this move, at least as I see it, is that it pushes against white. Whether white responds with 'a' or 'b', this helps white get stronger. I don't know if it's the best move, but if I were black I would consider 'c' here since it finishes settling black while taking away white terroritory, and you don't make white stronger in any meaningful way]
;W[oh]LB[qf:a][io:b][qp:c]C[Az: This is slow. 'a' is all but a moral imperitive now. 'a' would be big for white and it would also be big for you both for making terroritory and weakening white. 'a' isn't quite white sente, but it's close, which makes it big for both sides.

If black is going to tenuki, 'b' is the vital point since it builds up both sides. The corner is small, if white invades he will get a small life in gote, this is not urgent at this stage of the game. 'b' has big implications for the left and creates a potentially big moyo - 'c' is a yose move]
;B[qp];W[pg];B[qf];W[qe];B[ep]LB[io:a][lp:b][dn:c]C[Az: This is big, but 'a' is still bigger. After 'a' 'b' would make the entire lower right into solid profit. If B 'a', W E4, after 'c' white will be forced to live small while black takes a lot of profit on the left]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[de]LB[lb:a][je:b][ke:c][le:d]C[Az: Another extremely slow move by white. White is asking to loose playing like this.

However, black should not ignore just because it is slow. The two stones at the top have been weak for quite some time now, as of this move reinforcment is urgent.

If black is going to jump, better to stay solidly connected than make a move that creates cutting points. The tesuji at 'a' would be excellent now, since white is forced to choose between helping you settle and allowing you to reduce his influence. If black is going to move out, 'b' is the correct move. 'c' just creates cutting points for black to worry about. The aim of 'c' is no doubt to further reduce white, but if B 'b', W 'd', white is already getting the short end of the proverbial stick and black doesn't need to add more risk.]

(;B[le]LB[kd:a][ke:b][jd:c][je:d]C[Az: *blink* This doesn't make any sense. This is begging to cut cut. The only way this can make sense is if black is trying to sacrafice the stones on the top with a sequence like 'a'-'d'. Otherwise this creates a liability as one weak group becomes two weak groups, right next to thickness no less. Before now black has been very comfortably winning, but this throws the game into chaos.]
;W[kd];B[mc];W[lb];B[md];W[ke];B[ie];W[lf]TR[mc][md][le]C[Az: Black is much worse off now than before. The 3 stones are all but dead, and the remaining weak group to the left now looks much thinner.]
;B[dl];W[io];B[kq];W[co]LB[do:a][cn:b][bp:c]TR[dl]C[Az: Black can respond with B 'a', W 'b', B 'c'. The marked stone is perfectly placed after that to cut off any escape]

;B[fq];W[in]LB[jl:a][kn:b]MA[lq][mq][jq][op][rq][sq]C[Az: So far the attack is going fine for black, but 'a' is the next move. Black is not trying to kill (let's be realistic here), rather black is trying to reduce the center in sente and firm up the bottom. The boundary of blacks profit on the bottom is fairly clear already, there isn't any way to significantly expand this, so attacking with 'b' doesn't make sense.

For the most part black has outplayed white this game, but this is a major mistake in direction]
;B[kn]LB[jm:a][im:b]C[Az: W 'a' next, not 'b'];W[im];B[kl]LB[ik:a]
C[Az: W should jump to 'a' to save a little self respect. W is not playing well here]
;W[il];B[kj]MA[ok][pm]C[Az: Remember how in the beginning I said white isn't really very thick because of the cutting points? Black can't cut yet, but now the weakness earlier own is starting to make itself known]
;W[lk];B[kk];W[hk];B[gk];W[hj]LB[hi:a]C[Az: Again, 'a'. What is it with this guy? (Sorry for editorializing)]
;B[nl]C[Az: Bad! Black should not peep at a cutting point, especially one that black would like to later exploit if black can get another stone nearby. This helps white make shape and doesn't ultimately take any profit for black]
;W[nk];B[nn];W[lm];B[km];W[mm];B[nm];W[mk];B[fb];W[eb]LB[ge:a]
[ig:b]C[Az: All black has to do to win is keep the stones on the top alive. 'a' would be a good defensive move to keep the game simple and consolidate black's lead. 'b' would be another option]
;B[bm];W[cm];B[cl];W[bn];B[bl];W[hb]LB[hc:a]C[Az: 'a' is blacks best answer, since although white can connect under, he makes black thick]
;B[fc];W[jb];B[ff];W[fh];B[ic];W[ib];B[hg];W[hc];B[gi]C[Az: Good move for attacking and defending at the same time]

;W[gj];B[fi];W[fj];B[ei];W[eh]LB[lg:a][li:b][kf:c][mf:d][jf:e]
C[Az: How about 'a'? If W 'b', B 'c'-'e' makes an eye for you. It's worth pointing out that if black could get some eyespace black could win the semeai against the white group. Earlier on black should have defended the top group at a number of occasions to avoid a crisis like this]

;B[me];W[if]LB[jg:a][hf:b]C[Az: 'a' is correct since it gives black lots of liberties to win the face. 'b' is a mistake that should have cost black the game.]

(;B[hf];W[jg];B[je];W[jf];B[hd]LB[ge:a][fe:b][jd:c]C[Az: White should have played 'a' next. If B 'b', W 'c' and black dies. Black cannot get two eyes out of this shape since each of the two potential eyes is gote]
;W[fd];B[jd]LB[ge:a]C[Az: W needs to show a little backbone and play 'a' next, that would kill black.]
;W[gd];B[ge];W[fe];B[mb];W[kb];B[pd]C[This seems like an overplay, but it works marvelously. Too bad the j12 group isn't connected anymore.

Az: This doesn't inherently look like an overplay, white has a weak point here. What's important is that black should have never allowed these stones to become seperated]

(;W[pe];B[qd]LB[rd:a]C[Az: White should play 'a' next, white survives fine.]

(;W[lj];B[rd];W[re];B[oe]C[ericlavine: Better to play p16. I played like this to squeeze some extra points out of the move, but this shape hurts me later when white is able to play p14 in sente.]

Even if white can live with 'a' (it's a little more messy than your variations suggest, but I agree it's iffy), 'a' would still be bad for white.
