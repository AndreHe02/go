No, J17 looks good.  If you play at "A", it is hard to find a follow-up when White approaches C16.  Also, you cannot use the C12 stone to dig into the C7 area to split White since White is strong there.]

That is the wrong idea.  Your J17 group is now weak because of the strength of the D17 group, so using a weak group to attack White's upper right stones (which he could easily escape lightly with) is bad.]

You played well, but in the middle game you were inconsistent, sometimes passive, sometimes overaggressive.  Your reading level seemed okay, so I would recommend going over some pro games to see how they play out middle games and do some tsumego to keep up the reading.  

Hope I helped =).
