C[Hi,
this game is from a tournament in germany, i played as a 1k. I was white in this game.]

;B[nq];W[kp]C[Is this pincer ok in this position?];B[no];W[pn]
;B[iq]C[Sebastian: i haven't seen this move before. For my next move, my plan was to play first on the right and then make some kind of sabaki with my L4-stone.
Christian: I haven't seen this move either. You should be able to settle your L4 while making some territory on the right.]
;W[oq];B[nr]
(;W[nm]C[Christian: This allows black to link up by playing L2, and it is not quite clear how many points O7 is worth. I would rather play the peep at N4 first, which protects against L2 while making shape.]
;B[lo]C[Sebastian: now i must get out with this stone , and the way i did it was not very good. can you tell me a better way?
Christian: A nice move which also protects against the peep at N4.]
;W[ip];B[jq]
(;W[hq]C[Christian: My feeling is that white must play at L3 and fight.]

;B[ee];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[fe];W[gd];B[ge];W[hc]C[Sebastian: i played here instead of H16 because i wanted to threaten his K16-group.
Christian: You must pull off something special now, although I can't see it yet :-)]
;B[ch]C[Christian: Black is asking for trouble. Black should play at H15.]

;W[pb];B[ne];W[hl];B[qh]C[Sebastian: i think this invasion is not very good, because i get a target to attack. In the following, i have an attack on three black groups, but it failed in the end. If you see any moves, which are more severe etc. please write down.
Christian: I agree. Blacks top left group is not definitely alive yet, and it looks as if black is trying to give you another chance.]

(;W[ph];B[qi];W[qg]C[Christian: I haven't seen this move before. I understand you don't want to give black a base locally, but the variation to white 58 looks more natural.]
