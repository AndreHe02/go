C[Reviewee:  My name is Martin, i played black and lost. Played offline in Germany in Nov 2002. Although i had a bad feeling about the game (my opponent beeing a stone stronger) all the time, i felt later on that i lost because my opponent was better, but that i had my chances and missed in strategy on the right side. I felt I attacked firmly all the time and kept the initiative, but missed the point to take territorial advantage of my attacks.  Im really looking forward for hints which may help me to slowly approach becoming a 1k.

Thank you in advance.

Hi Martin, wow, what a fighting game!  After I had looked through game and added a lot of comments, I showed the beginning of your game to Hideki, a strong Japanes 6d who recently joint our Go Club. He had quite a few interesting additional remarks that I missed. --Arend]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[qq];B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[hc]
(;B[fe]C[M: i considered  this an unusual but agressive move, that is often bad but here i didn't want my opponent to confirm me to the corner. When i played d18 i knew white might attack at h17, but i wanted to see if he really would do so and then try to fight back.

A: I'd be happy to take the corner here. The influence white gets after the usual joseki is nullified by your hoshi stones in the adjacent corner. Also you get a nice ladder break, see the variation.]
;W[kc]LB[cc:A][hc:B][fe:C]C[A: I think white should play at a (C17) here. Then black doesn't get a base, and A is always very big in this position. The game move would be more suitable if W6 (B) had been on the 3rd line at C.  Hideki: "After White A, the exchange white B - Black C is very good for white. White C is not the direction in which white wants to develop."]
;B[cc];W[cd]MA[dd][cd][df]LB[ci:A]C[A: White's marked stones look a little awkward now. If W6 had been on the third line, white could just play A now.
Hideki: "This move is very big. White should play here."];B[ch]
C[M: this C12 feelt like an overplay for me, but i wanted to see if white can handle it, since he is a stone stronger than me.

A: I think this is the best move. Black almost has two eyes, and you can always strengthen yourself with kikashis against the white stones at the top. White doesn't have a base yet.]

(;W[dj]LB[eg:A]C[A: Now this is an overplay! White should just play kosumi at A.]

(;B[dg]LB[eg:A]C[A: You should shut white in. See variations.]
;W[ef]LB[ff:A]C[A: Probably A (F14) is better. (Hideki agreed.)]
;B[cf];W[bc];B[ce]LB[bb:A]C[Hideki: "This is a very bad exchange:...
(A: Black should play A.)];W[ed];B[fd]MA[ce][fe]C[Hideki: "...now black is peeping a bamboo joint from two sides (the marked stones). C15 is almost of no use here ." (A: C15 does not make a difference in eye shape for either side.)]
;W[gb];B[bb];W[dc];B[cb];W[bd];B[fb]
(;W[eg]LB[ff:A]C[Hideki: "This is the wrong choice. White A is better."]
;B[eh];W[fh];B[ei]C[A: (Now the white stone at D10 is badly hurt.)]
;W[gf]LB[gg:A][he:B]C[Hideki says the solid shape at "A" is a better here. The game move leaves two cuts, on the left of the played move and at the top. After White "A", a 2nd move at B would shut black in cleanly.]
;B[hd];W[id];B[he];W[ge]C[Hideki: "This is a bit early."];B[gd]
;W[gg]C[A: Now it becomes apparent the white should better have played here immediately instead of W32.]
;B[ff]C[Hideki: "This is also a bit early..."];W[fg]LB[fi:A]
[gi:B][hh:C][gj:D][hj:E][hi:F]C["...now turning at works not as good anymore."
(A: For example after Black A - White  B, the peep at C isn't effective anymore.
Another example is that after Black A - White B - Black D, white can now play
white E - Black F - White C, as the capture of B isn't so interesting for black.
This is really a big difference, I overlooked this.)];B[mc]
LB[if:A]C[A: I had thought should keep running with A. Your big dragon at the top doesn't have 2 eyes yet, and white's group at the top left has none at all. Instead, you try to attack the group at the top, which  a) is light
b) does have eye space.
But Hideki thinks both A and the game move are alright.];W[jf]

(;B[ab]MA[mc]LB[ke:A][je:B][jd:C]C[M: i wasn't satified that white got out of trouble with k14 and this bad feeling hold on to the end of the game

A: This bad feeling is somewhat right! Having to play A18 in response to such a big move as K14 means you have lost the battle. K14 has a some weaknesses (Hideki: A is better.),
but they are not easy to exploit. I tried B (see variations).

Hideki: "Black A18 is calm, and black can aim at cutting later. But, one could try to save this move." He suggests C.]
;W[dl]LB[bj:A]C[A: White can only afford this because the big dragon in the top left isn't so weak anymore.
It is still risky, though, and white is still suffering from his overplay W14 at D10.   Hideki: "This should better be at A. White should try to keep the black group above weak, and if black gets A, he has two eyes."

(This is the last comment by Hideki.)];B[fj];W[ig];B[ie];W[jd]
LB[je:A]C[A: White should play A. The cuts still don't do anything.]
;B[je];W[ke];B[kf]LB[dn:A]C[A: Just A looks also possible.]
;W[le];B[kg];W[ii];B[cn];W[dn]LB[fl:A]C[A: White must play lightly here. I suggest A.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[do];W[bg];B[bh]C[M: since i cannot attack the white d16 group with reason i thought it doesn't hurt so much giving c14c15 away. i feared white might go crazy and leave me with probably only one eye with a sequence like w E11, b E12, w B10, but he didn't

A: This is good. If you answer at C13, all your shape is spoiled.]
;W[cg]LB[gm:A]C[A: White should happy to have gained half an yes in the top left, and conclude that his other group needs more attention now. A looks right.   The white group is very heavy and a welcome target for attacks. Both players missed the importance of this group in the sequel.]
;B[dh]C[i though];W[bf];B[ag];W[ae];B[bj];W[gm];B[pp]C[M: i got a lot of profit on the left side, i felt my chances growed and if i can make something against R3 i can win.
A: Well you have to be aware that white can still invade in the lower left corner as it happened in the game. But I agree that your position is better.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[or];B[qo]LB[mp:A]C[A: I would play the usual joseki move A here. Don't forget white has a weak group at D7!]
;W[mg];B[pk];W[qf];B[qd];W[oc]C[M: i always tend to overrate the large knight move q16 n17, but still didn't expect it was so easy for white to exploit that weakness.
A: Yes. Basically a stone at L17 is enough to make it a comfortable invasion.]
;B[od];W[nc];B[nd];W[mb]
(;B[pg]LB[md:A]C[A: You shoul really try to get a black stone at A in sente here. It does make a difference to your shape. But it unfortunately, it does not seem to be sente, so your choice seems right.]
;W[pf]
(;B[og]LB[of:A]C[A: You must hane immediately. Much better shape.]
;W[of];B[nf];W[ng];B[me]LB[md:A][mf:B]C[A: Now imagine you had a stone at A. You could play B instead! A huge difference.]
;W[qg]C[A: This is very bad shape for Black.];B[pi];W[mf];B[ne]

(;W[rj]C[M: i felt that white should have played first r12 and then jump to S10 or S9, but it was sgood enough.
A: I think it's worse than that for black. See variation.];B[qh]
LB[re:A]C[A: Hey! You don't attack for the sake of attacking! This and B97 give you very bad shape.
You should live in the corner now with A. Let white take the territory. You still have the D7 group to attack after you get thick on the right side.]
;W[rh];B[ri];W[si];B[qi];W[rl]C[A: You have gained nothing.]
;B[rg];W[sh];B[re];W[rf];B[pb]C[M: i felt that was the last chance to make the R16 group alive]
;W[pl];B[qk]LB[ol:A]C[A: Better hane at P8. P8 is aiming at destroying eye shape, but white is far too strong to get killed. P8 instead tries to find help for the weak black group by trying to connect to the three black stones below.]
;W[ql];B[rk];W[sk];B[nk];W[ol];B[ni];W[lh];B[ml]C[A: One to the right is better shape.]
;W[nl];B[lk]LB[mj:A]C[A: Better the solid connection. The peep at A is a bit annoying.]
;W[nn]C[M: now it seemed i had to sacrifice my Q5 group, which really wasn't my intension when i started attacking the R14 stone.

A: That is because of B85, which got you into bad shape, and B95/97 and B107, which all blindly attacked the white group instead of patiently trying to do s.th. useful with your attack.

As for the situation now, I think you should_give up your Q5 stones immdiately.]

;B[fo]C[A: I don't think these two stones help black much. The peep might have been more useful from the other side, ....]
;W[fm]C[...and now white's shape is stronger locally than black's. To make territory at the bottom
the direct move at G3 instead of B137 would have been better.]

;B[pc];W[nb];B[lc];W[lb];B[rb];W[ko]C[M: i didn't count but felt that white wasn't so much ahead like i feared
A: Given that white can still invade, he is probably ahead. But he should do that now!]
;B[ki];W[kh];B[jk]LB[ck:A]MA[lk]C[A: Now should be the right time to cure your weaknesses on the left. But I am not sure whether this move is necessary. If it is, than that's because of the bad shape you built with  B117 (the marked stone).]
;W[bk];B[ck];W[cl];B[bl];W[bm];B[ak];W[co];B[bn];W[bo];B[am]
;W[cq]C[M: ouch , that hurted much. I never saw that my lower left corner would ever be in danger. Since my d5 stones where so weak i couldn"t try insane moves like B2 or C2 or something but had to protect at D3]

(;B[cp]C[A: Aji keshi. Better directly at D3. This leads to a 1000-year ko if I did not miss anything.]
;W[bp];B[dq];W[cr]
(;B[br]C[M: i made a last try, but of course white found the answer. too bad i didn"t have a stone at e2 or f2 so that i could try A2

A: Hmmmm. I probably could write a novel on this habit. But I'll try to make it short:
DON't ever do that again! You don't play a move because your opponent might not find the right answer. I promise, you'll gain half a stone in strength easily if you avoid such foolish "Let's see whether my opponent finds the answer"-moves. If you always try to make the move that is right, not the one that is good enough for your opponent, then you can be sure to play at the best of your abilities. (Because usually your opponent is good enough for the move you make :-) )

To qoute from Sensei's Library:"Play out tactics where you can't see how your opponent can stop you, for if he does it means he really is the better player ..." -- the unknown librarian

Compare the result in the game with the one in the variation. It's 10 pts!

(I think I would not even play this move in a 9 stone handicap game.)]
;W[bs];B[ao];W[ar];B[ap];W[bq]C[M: subsequent moves omitted, white made an expensive mistake in the endgame on the upper side and played passive and secure (he was already in byoyomi) but that didn"t help me and white clearly won with around 20 points inkl. Komi.]
