AB[pd][dp][dd];W[pq];B[qo];W[qp];B[qm];W[qf];B[nd]LB[qi:a]C[This stone should be played at 'a' instead.  Then it serves two functions.  It expands and strengthens your two stones on the right side and it attacks the white stone by taking away it's space for an extension along the side.  Moves that do two things at once are better than single purpose moves.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[pb];W[rc];B[qb]C[This move is *very* small.  It does nothing to attack white -- he is open to the right side, so cannot be killed.    By wasting a move this way, you essentially give up one of your handicap stones.]
;W[qe];B[jp]C[good.];W[fc];B[dc];W[cf]C[white is attacking you from both sides.  But white is *very weak* on both sides, so you have nothing to fear.]
;B[ce];W[ci]TR[fc][nd][oc][pb][pd]LB[ic:a]C[White is still weak on the left side, pressed up against your stones.  Additionally, white's marked stone on top is very weak.  A move around 'a' would be an attack plus an extension from your corner in the top right.  Very powerful.]
;B[cm];W[co];B[cp];W[cn];B[ck]LB[dm:a]C[Just extending up at 'a' here gives white a lot less room to make trouble.   I watch Dan level players play, and almost invariably, when one player bumps into a single stone the way white did to you here, extending up to 'a' is the right answer.]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[bm];B[bl];W[cl];B[cg];W[cm];B[df]C[Ok, this is a decent trade.  You get a big corner, white gets the left side.]
;W[dk]TR[dc][dd][df][cg][ce]LB[ic:a]C[Now black has sente.  Your wall on the top left is really strong.  It radiates influence across the top.  This is important:  A wall like this needs an extension.  You MUST play a move around 'a' to take advantage of that strength.]

(;B[bf]C[This move, unfortunately, was completely unnessesary.  See variation.  This is your second wasted move.]
;W[el];B[gq];W[eq];B[bi];W[bj];B[cj];W[bh];B[di];W[ai];B[dj]
;W[bk];B[ch];W[jd]C[Now your wall is even more huge, and white takes away the extension.  This move is very large.  Even so, with such strength you must attack.  When you have a big wall, use it to attack.]
;B[kc]LB[hc:a][hd:b]C[This is too submissive.  Try moving at 'a' or 'b', split his stones and see what happens.  something good is likely to come of it since you are very strong in both top corners.]

[hg:d]C[white threatens to capture these two stones.  When you are threatened with a capture, always look to see if the stones are important.  These black stones don't do anything, so maybe the move you would use to save them can be better used somewhere else.  Some ideas are marked.]

A completely wasted move.];W[ne];B[oe];W[of]TR[qd][pd][oe][od]
[nd][oc]C[this group only has two liberties now, plus there are cutting points.  Very dangerous.]
;B[nj]LB[ob:a][mb:b]C[In fact, white can kill it right now by moving first at 'a' and then 'b'.  Be very careful with groups with cutting points and few liberties.  When this group dies, your whole top group dies.]
;W[nh];B[jj]TR[hd][id][jd][kd][ld][md][ne][of]C[This was a very good move.  It takes so much value away from white's wall at the top, and is far enough away to be hard for white to attack effectively.  Excellent.]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[kj];B[kk];W[ji];B[ig];W[ho];B[fn]C[I like this move, but it is dangerous.  White is threatening to cut at the red dot.  You *must* keep close track of this huge weakness because your two remaining groups (after the cut) are both without two eyes.  Cutting points are dangerous.]
;W[gl];B[hm]C[good.];W[ij]TR[ho]LB[jl:a]C[this black stone isn't important.  Let it go, and play 'a'.  Then you have taken control of the marked white stone and made some profit too.  Once your groups are strong, you can attack the lower right corner.]
;B[jk];W[hl];B[il]LB[im:a]C[I think I would have played at 'a' here so that you wouldn't have a cutting point at 'a'.  Too many cutting points is a recipe for trouble.]

LB[nb:a]C[Game is basically over now.  Territories roughly marked out.  Assume black defends at 'a'

Black roughly 50
White roughly 85 to 90

Obviously there is room for variation in the final score, but there is little chance for black to increase his territory.

Overall, watch the cutting points.  Keep track of them closely.  Don't let them accumulate or your opponent will find some way to use them.]
