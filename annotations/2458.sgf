C[Hello dear reviewer

I am black in this game
I won but i think i was quite lucky because my fuseki seems awful to me.
I'd like you comment the major mistakes i made in the beginning and what should i do to improve my fuseki in this type of game.

Thanks a lot.

LoP: I tried to answer your questions but keep in mind that most of the time i'm just guessing about the game myself so my answers are likely to be wrong Treat them as hints but not as the absolute truth.

Game Summary: 
I think you did came out of fuseki with a little disadvantage. The main reason for this was your extension against a low white position with M17 leaving the left side open in exchange.

In the middle game you had a nice attack going on a heavy white group  after the sequence in the bottom left corner. But the attack lost it's power when you where not able to give up a kikashi stone that has already served it's purpose.

In the endgame you were finally able to turn the game around with a nice tactical sequence. It doesn't really matter if you read that out before or if it was just a lucky coincidence. You had the better intuition in that situation which made you win the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[cn];W[fq];B[dj]C[I often play this opening in this situation. Sometimes i get good results. Do you think there are better ideas ?


LoP: Standard fuseki, often referred to as 'Kobayashi's Formation'.]
;W[ed]
(;B[ec]C[LoP: Usually a Pincer is played here.];W[fc];B[dc]
;W[fd];B[cf];W[jc]C[LoP: Black has a reasonable formation on the left side but overall black's way of playing in the top left feels a little passive.]
;B[op];W[oq]
(;B[nq];W[pq]
(;B[np];W[qn];B[jq];W[bo]C[i didn't know how to answer to this, so i played elsewhere. Is there a known weak point in this white formation (B5, D4, F3) ? Was the joseki on the right bottom corner a bad choice for me ?

LoP: You can either try to close off the territory on the left side or you can try to play something more flexible like E6 which goes for center influence and aims to enclose white in the corner.]

(;B[lc]C[LoP: Playing tenuki leaves a weakness at C8. Generally the left side is pretty open now so C12 is also a bigger issue than before.

I think M17 is not a good move. It is an extension against a low and stable white position while black is still thin (o17). It doesn't have a big effect on white (after black H17 white can still play H16 to stableize his group temporarily).
Anyway white is not willing to approach you at O17 since his K17 stone is low, which means that an extension there is not interesting. This makes O17 uninteresting for both sides.]

(;W[qf]
(;B[pf]C[my aim here is to build strength on the outside, but it turned to be a very weak formation. Any advice ?

LoP: I don't like this move very much. Even if white follows the standard joseki white will have a reasonable result.
It's hard to find a good answer for black in this position, for me this indicates that M17 is misplaced.]

(;W[nc]
(;B[ld]C[i wanted to keep pressure on K17.

LoP: This looks ugly, somehow m16 feels heavy. The main problem in this position is that R17 is still open for white which makes it easy for him to handle O17 lightly. So maybe it's possible to make white heavy with P17 first.]
;W[qc]C[LoP: As expected];B[pc]C[maybe this move was a mistake because i'm overconcentrated and it is easy for white to settle himself on the border... but maybe the mistake was before.

LoP: Yes I think here you don't really have a choice, either you block on q17 or r16, both options will yield an unsatisfying result for black. Now it becomes clear that M16 is unefficient.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[qg];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[kb];B[lb]
C[LoP: White demonstrates that he knows how to handle O17, By forcing you to defend your capture all the time he can make nice profit. O17 is not even captured completly yet. O17 can still jump to the center if white really needs it.]
;W[cl]C[LoP: White is exploiting blacks thiness now.];B[dl]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[cj];B[ci];W[bi];B[ch];W[cm];B[dm];W[dn]C[LoP: This was really big for white.]
;B[do];W[en];B[co];W[eo];B[cp];W[bn]C[i was really unhappy of the result!]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[ep];W[fp];B[bp];W[cr];B[dr];W[er];B[br]C[LoP: Well done. At least you could also take something in exchange for your loss on the left side.]
;W[bh];B[eh]C[was it really necessary ?

LoP: It's definitly not bad to protect this cutting point. Even if it doesn't help you to build something immediatly it is nice to have a thick shape standing there that you don't have to worry about. Being strong there will help you if you want to invade at H17. And it helps if you plan to attack the white group at the bottom.]

(;W[ho]C[LoP: Strange move];B[jo]C[LoP: Good move];W[pj];B[gn]
C[LoP: Interesting move];W[go];B[im]C[LoP: Good move];W[hn]

(;B[gm]C[LoP: I think G6 should be treated as kikashi. You have to give it away. Even if that means that white can live but you will be able to enclose white.]
;W[hm];B[em]C[LoP: This is move is a logical consequence of of the try to save the kikashi stone. It's bad shape and doesn't accomplish something except saving a worthless stone.]
;W[gl];B[fm]C[LoP: Poor black.];W[il]TR[em][fm][gm]C[white won again.... :/

LoP: True, this result is should make black cry. 3 wasted moves since white lives anyway. The stone at j7 became worthless too.

All this just because black was not willing to throw away his shape destroying kikashi stone.]
;B[hc]C[LoP: black has to do something now this is a good start. Black is strong around.
The other weak point in whites shape is r8 but since white ist so strong at j8 now it's maybe not so good to start an invasion there.]

LoP: Don't think so too.]
(;B[kg]C[trying to build something...

at this point of the game i feel in a bad position.

LoP: It seems impossible to build somthing around here. At least this move makes it impossible for white to pull out o17. Take Big endgame moves instead.]
