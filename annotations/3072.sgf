C[Randy: Hello, first thank you for reviewing my game.  This game is played at www.itsyourturn.com, so sometimes the thinking time can be very long.  Although the result is resign (me), I put a lot of efforts on this game so I want to know what's wrong with me.

--
Hi, I am a Finnish 2 dan and since your opponent (B) is IGS 1 dan I do not have much to critice his or your game but I will give my opinions which are not absolute truths. 
 
Enjoy!];B[qc]C[Randy: It's the first time I met the first 3-3 move of Black.  Probably he wants a whole new opening.

--
3-3 has a suprise effect in the opening because it is not very popular.]
;W[qp];B[dp];W[dd];B[op];W[lp];B[pm];W[oo];B[no];W[pp]C[I prefer p6. 
This is interesting move, but ...];B[on];W[oq];B[po];W[nq]C[.. lets analyze this result.

B has played 5 stones and white 6 and it is
B's sente. White has a nice corner with appr. 16 points. 

But because B's sente right side is becaming a moyo so I think this is slightly better for B.]

(;B[ro]C[Randy: I think S5 is a slow move for black, he should extend somewhere around R12 ?

--
Yes, I think its slow too. I prefer O16 and moyo instead S5.

S5 prevents W S7 so it is not bad. Maybe this is a question of style.]

(;W[qh]C[Randy: Opponent's good position is my good position, I took R12 so I can have either R15 or R9.

--
Yes, but what about Q16 instead?
Variations follows.]
(;B[rp]C[Randy: This is really annoying --- I think it's a slow move again.

--
Yes, this is a small move.
See variation.]
(;W[rq]C[Randy: If black played R3, my corner is totally gone, so I played S3.  But later I think S3 is small now (maybe big in the end game), so I regret very much.  Maybe I should play F3, D10 or K16 ?  F3 looks better.

--
Instead S3 you should play R15.
See variation.];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd]
(;W[cc]C[See variation.];B[ci]C[Randy: This Joseki looks beter for Black ...  Maybe I should played C15 instead of F17 when he played C14 ?

--
I think this is correct. It may look like B has "more", but note that your upper left group is strong.]
;W[cn]C[Randy: I decided to invade the lower left corner.  F3 is not so bad for White, but if Black stopped me at E3, W-F4, B-C6, then I still need one move for my lower territory but black is really strong on left, am I right ?  That's why I choose C6.  Do you have any suggestion here ?

--
I prefer R15 :). You have ignored your R12 stone but so has luckily your opponent too. 

If you want to play in lower left area, I think f3 is slightly better. C6 looks little bit like invasion.]

(;B[fq]C[See variation.];W[bp];B[cq];W[hq]C[Randy: H3 is a greedy move I guess.  If I played C9 or B9, and W-J3 will make my lower right territory very small, which I don't like.  But this is my mistake I think ...

--
Yes, I think you are paying too much attention for territory.]
;B[cl]C[Randy: Black attacks me of course :(  Regret again ...]
;W[bq];B[br];W[cp];B[dq];W[do];B[fo];W[dl]C[This is possible. E7 is an other possibility.]
;B[dk]
(;W[fn]C[Randy: I don't know if D8-F6 is correct, but I try to get out of here.

--
Hmm... Instead F6 E8 maybe better.];B[dm];W[eo]C[Randy: I played this to threaten F5 stone.  But now I think this is probably a mistake.  If I played E6 then my group is much stronger.

--
Yes.];B[fp];W[gn];B[hp];W[iq];B[ho];W[ar];B[bs]C[It is hard to find a move for W.]

(;W[cm]C[Bad exchange.];B[el];W[em]C[Randy: If I played B8, White can get 2 eyes in GOTE, but black cut at E6 and he is very strong at center.  So I decided to play E7 first.  Maybe this also proved that E5 is a bad move.

--
E7 is a must. If you let B to surround you then B's power is too good.]
;B[qf]C[Randy: Suddenly he ignored lower left (which I think White is strong enough).  R14 is a good move I guess ?  Because even I play R9, White is still difficult inside the strong black's forces.

--
That's true.];W[qk];B[rr]C[Randy: strange end game move ... I don't see any big advantage he can get here, I should ignore and played somewhere on top, like L17 I guess ?

--
Not L17, urgent moves first. Defending your corner is normal.]
;W[sq]C[Randy : I regreted so much, I just can't stand the desire of getting this corner.  Now I think I should take L17 anyway.  What's your suggestion ?

--
Defending your corner is correct in my opinion, but not with T3. R3 is better. Reason is that with W R3 
W has a good forcing move at S7. Now W S7 is a gote. (This happened in a game also).]
;B[og]C[Randy : o-oh, my group is in danger.

--
Yes it is. :)];W[rm]C[Randy: threaten to cut at R5, and also extend for a living.

--
Yes, but wouldn't it be nice to play this in sente?
So W R3 instead of T3.];B[qo];W[qq]C[Randy: Again, I think I am over-concentrated in this corner...

--
Third line is also called the line of territory. So, you have secure territory there and it's not bad.]
;B[qi]C[Weard move to me.];W[ri];B[rh];W[qj]C[Good!];B[qg];W[ph]
C[I think B only helped you. :)];B[nd]C[Randy: This is a very conservative move.  If I played black, probably I took K17.  But anyway he got a very strong and big territory in that corner.

--
I think O16 is a good move. K17 instead looks weard to me.]
;W[jc];B[ef];W[fe]C[Randy: Is F15 necessary now ?  Where is the bigger move ?  B17, H6, O11, or N18 ?

--
W's F6 group is weak, so reinforcing it with G8 would be important. But I think your move is good because you can not let B to attack your group.]
;B[ff];W[mc]C[Hmm... 
G15 better I think.];B[nc];W[md]C[N18 maybe better.];B[je];W[in]
C[Randy: I also gain enough in the top.  Now I am thinking to settle down the lower left part (which is the only unstable group in this board).  For black, if White played G2 first, then black also has only one eye.  So I am thinking to give him some pressures instead of running out only.  So I decided to play J6 instead of H6.

--
I think you are not strong enough to play this move. I prefer G8 or J7.]
;B[hn];W[hm];B[jp];W[jq];B[jn];W[io]C[Bad exchange.];B[ip];W[jo]
;B[ko];W[im];B[kp];W[kq];B[fm]C[Randy: o-oh, I didn't think about this break.  Again proved E5 is a bad move :(

--
:) Yes, but so is J6 too.];W[en];B[gm];W[hk];B[gj];W[gk];B[fk]
C[Randy: H9 and G9, threaten to connect and try to make eye.]
;W[bl]C[Randy: Then I should consider live-and-death here.

--
Yes.];B[bk];W[am];B[he]C[Randy: he threaten to break me at H17, but I can't but play tenuki here because now I have another weak group in center to worry about :(

--
You cannot let B to play H17 bacause then you would have two weak groups more.]
;W[kn]
(;B[lo];W[jm]C[Randy: Black connected his group for safety, so I get good shape here.  This group doesn't have 2 eyes yet, but I think it's easy to get 2 eyes or at least connect to the right white group.

--
After a capture your center group is much stronger.
B is playing peacefully because it might be possible to run away with K6.]

(;B[ic]C[Randy: This move surprised me.  I only think about H17, which I can play J16 to connect or cut K15 stone.  But now, my N17 group looks very weak.

--
H17 is possible.
See variation.];W[id];B[hd];W[jd];B[gc];W[ib];B[hc];W[bc]C[Randy: Both my groups are in danger here :( So I need B17 to save the corner first.

--
Yes.];B[ie];W[kb]C[Randy: Black played very safely.   I got no chance to break him.  So I need to think about live-and-death again.  L18 looks necessary (sigh...).]
;B[hj];W[ij];B[ii];W[jj];B[ji]C[Randy: he played several sente to extend his territory easily.  Now I am 15-20 points behind him I think.  I think I need to get some territory around M8.

--
B is leading a lot. I think it is very very hard for W to win this game.]
;W[mn];B[mp];W[lj]C[You can't ignore B N4.]
(;B[ok]C[Randy: This is a good end game move I think.  He threaten to reduce both White groups.

-- 
What about B N3?];W[rg]C[Randy: If I don't play S13, black took S13 and this White group is in danger.

--
W S13 is a good end game move.];B[rf];W[sh];B[fb]C[Randy: Terrible.  If I can get G18, probably I still have a little bit chance.  But he took this big move to secure his win.

--
Yes.];W[eb]C[Randy: My mistake.  I think if he cut me at E17, I can cut him at G18 finally and fight for a chance.  But I am wrong.  So I resigned here.  Again thank you for reviewing my game.

--
See possible follow ups.];B[ec]C[Seems very hard for W. B played very peacefully and he didn't make any weak groups. That's why I think he won. 

Try to take more care of your groups (urgent points first) and you will get better results. Its like magic. :)
