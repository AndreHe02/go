C[black: Hi, in this game we did a lot of mistakes, but the "clear mistakes" are not the matter (those are for the psiquiatric), what really interest me are some tactical and strategic situations that i didn´t (and don´t) know how to manage, all those are quoted but of course you are free to coment whatever you want, thanks in advance and sorry me for such a long introducción
no2k: You played bothe very reasonable. There were some slight mistakes. But your over all playing is very good. I made some suggestions, where i would have played in an other way, but please leave in mind that i am not much stronger than you both.]

;B[cf];W[ch];B[ef]LB[qf:A][ip:B]C[no2k: Since black had played 2 secure moves (A and B) this seems right to me. The alternative invading the corner gives white too much influence.]
;W[fd];B[di]
(;W[cj]C[no2k: This is the first unreasonable move. The normal move is at A (see var).]
;B[dh]C[no2k: Better to cut at once.];W[dj];B[ci]C[no2k: Correct]
;W[qk];B[qm];W[qh];B[ob]LB[pb:A]C[black: I thought that p18 was not the ordinary way to play, but it seems me a good move anyway
no2k: In some circumstances this is really the ordinary way, especially when black wants to secure the corner territory. In this case, the normal move at A would have been better. The difference here is that black does not only want to secure territory, but to attack the white stone. With the move at A black threatens to invade, and white has to defend, so black regains sente.]
;W[oc];B[pc]LB[pb:A]C[no2k: Instead consider the move at A. It may be useful too.]
;W[nb];B[cq]LB[nq:A]C[black: I didn´t defend p18 to keep sente and i use it to invade with c3, good my two decisions?
no2k: The first is good. This single stone does not count much. (But remember, that you had not to give up a stone, if you had played at A at node 23.) The invasion is reasonable, but i would prefer to play around A. a move there will create a double wing formation, witch cannot be easily reduced.]

(;W[cp]C[no2k: I think this is the wrong direction. The black corner territory count too much. Consider something like the variation.]
;B[dq];W[nq]C[no2k: This invasion is more difficult, since it is not backed up by white's strength on the left.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[or]LB[lq:A]C[black: p2 secure the corner and it is also something like and attack, but i´m not too sure (and you must now that i´m a very conservative player)
no2k: First of all count your stones. There 3 of yours in the corner and two white stones, invading. So black is stronger here. Use this strength to attack the white stones. Play at A for examble. If white invades the corner you will kill the 2 white stones surely.]
;W[nr]LB[jq:A][jp:B][kq:C]C[no2k: This is a severe mistake. Black defended his corner, so white can stabilize the invading stones. For a 2 stones wall play a 3 stone jump at A or B. In this special situation where there is already a black stone nearby white can hold back to A.]
;B[lq]C[no2k: Very good. Now white has no base.];W[lp];B[kp]
;W[kq]LB[ip:A]C[black: I honestly must say that i consider myself unable to read all the secuences, so I chose the I believed easiest and safest (I don´t use duplicated board)
no2k: This is a good behaviour. This white move works well, when there is no black stone at A. So it can be used to get a little bit of shape.]
;B[jq]
(;W[ko]C[no2k: Better to play at A first. This gives an extra move to create shape for the white group. (sse var)]
;B[kr];W[mp];B[cc]LB[ld:A][dl:B][cd:C][om:D]C[black: how this? how now?
no2k: First of all because you cannot attack the white group strongly, it is very good to play the other big points first. But this invasion seems very dangerous. (see var) A easy invasion is around A or B. An alternative to the invasion is the contact move at C. But i would prefer a move like D. I will try to explain that. White has 2 weak groups, at he bottom and on the left. I would try to keep thos groups separated, and try to attack one.]

(;W[dc];B[cd];W[qo]C[
black: from up to now i think that r7 is deed, that i will be able to live in the corner or get away and my true aim is to make a wall to cut the ladder from m5]

;B[lo]C[
black: but it doesn´t work, what i should do? attack from the left to make moho, from the right to go to centre?, are white killable?]

;W[ll];B[ml];W[nm];B[kl];W[lk];B[kk];W[mk]C[
black: now that i had already made a big white territory in the right :-( I had to save the horribly heavy center group, but i thought i was able to do it killing the two white stones, now i think it was a mistake, what i should do? push to  the left? go up? what?]
;B[in];W[jn];B[km];W[jm];B[io];W[im];B[gm]C[
black: black stubbornly keep thinking in killing white and is happy with it´s new influence in the left]
;W[kj];B[jk];W[ik];B[jj];W[ij];B[ji]C[
black: black starts to think that the game, that he thought was on his side, is becoming white]
;W[gl];B[hm]C[
black: h8 make me thick (i think) but from up to now i starting to think in some kind of snap back]
;W[hl];B[fl];W[fk];B[ek];W[el];B[fm];W[ej];B[gk]C[
black: I thought i should play e7 and so on, but i´m cheating with the snap back, i am not proud of it, i don´t like to play looking a mistake in my opponent, but i thought the game was going white (my no-skill and my no-calm make me unable to any kind of countint)]
;W[fj];B[ii];W[hi]C[
black: and black was shamingly happy, but now i see that was not and entire snap back, but in anycase the consecuences would be very bad for white]

C[
 jorgeant 13k*: aich, you are alive
 suprafox 13k*: just barely...  whew.];B[gi]LB[hd:A][ld:B][nh:C]
C[black: I saw that white only had one eye, so ... but every time i start a ladder i fail, now i suppose i should go to the centre, from the right? or invade the upper moho  as i did latter?
no2k: First of all it is important to count. Then you can decide what to do. Black has roughly 10 points in every corner, and 30 points at the bottom. White has nearly 30 oints on the right side, and potential 25 points at the top. The the territories are quite close. But this helps that white has only to reduce the moyos in sente to get an easy win.The main points for erasing are A, B and C i think.]
;W[gh];B[fi];W[ei];B[eh];W[fh];B[jc]C[black: center or invasion? how? i think white was not too good here, i don´t know what would happen in other case
no2k: I think that is a reasonable move. Black will get strong on one side, using this to attack.]
;W[ic];B[id];W[kc];B[hc]LB[jb:A]C[no2k: First extand to the side at A. This gives an extra move.]
;W[jb];B[hb]LB[ib:A][hb:B][gb:C]C[no2k: Play at A, forcing white to connect. A ko would be a disaster for white. If white attacks the stone at A at B you get a sente move at C.]
;W[hd]LB[ge:A][hd:B][ff:C]C[no2k: That is wrong. Playing at A is sufficient. If black connects white can play at C, connecting his stones too. It is difficult then to rescue the black stones.]
;B[gd];W[ie];B[ge];W[fe];B[ff];W[gf];B[hf];W[gg];B[he];W[if]
;B[fc]C[black: key point, fortunately black ...
no2k: CorrectWhite had to play this move instead of the last move. But even the ko is horrible.]
;W[hg];B[id];W[eg];B[ed]C[black: here i knew that i sacrificed some black stones, i also suspected that was not necessary, but i was so anxious ...
no2k: Correct. But you gained a lot here. This is an easy win now.]
;W[dg];B[df]LB[of:A]C[no2k: Unnecessary. Better at A at once.]
;W[of]C[black: white make me a lot of pain with it, my only chance was then invading from the centre, but i was not very succesfull ...
no2k: But you must not fear anything. You have 10 points each in the upper and lower right, and nearly 30 points each at the bottom and in the upper left. White has 15 points on the left. So he has to make 60 points with his moyo.]
;B[kg]LB[jg:A][kh:B][pg:C]C[no2k: That can be cut. Play at A or B from the center, and then at C.]
;W[kh];B[jh];W[jg]C[black: be ready for the next two movement, don´t laught too much!]
;B[ki];W[lh]C[jorgeant 13k*: shit, i was deed :-)
jorgeant 13k*: how bad we are ...
suprafox 13k*: yes, i agree.  not a very clean game.
no2k: Sit on your fingers if playing (That's an idea from chess :-) )]
