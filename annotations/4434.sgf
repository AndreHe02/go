C[
I got behind in the fuseki during this game. I was hope you could give me some tips

[EV\] Reviewer comments will be marked like this.  This was a solid game by both players, with some interesting moves and no big mistakes.  Of course I do have some comments ....]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[op];B[dd];W[cf];B[fc];W[dj];B[lp];W[on]
;B[qn];W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[rr];W[ip]C[[EV\] This move looks good to me, although in professional games K3 is much more common.]
;B[ln];W[ol];B[in];W[qm];B[ro];W[rm]C[I feel a little behind

[EV\] This last move seems a bit awkward.  It does not threaten the B corner at all, and it leaves a weakness at Q7.  A move at Q6 would be more solid, leaving a follow-up sente atari at S6 to fix the shape.  If B crawls along the second line at S7 to prevent this, W would be happy to stay ahead playing above at R8.  You could also regard the R7-S5 exchange as a useful kikashi and switch elsewhere.  Even if B later captures R7, it slows his development on the right and serves its purpose as a sacrifice.]
;B[hp];W[hq];B[ho];W[gq]C[did theses exchanges do me any good?]
;B[qg];W[nc]C[Is this the best apporch to the top

[EV\] This move looks good, but you must be prepared to sacrifice this stone and take the corner if B plays a severe pincer.  N17 and Q17 are also possible.  A pro might be able to tell you which of these alternatives is best.]
;B[pc];W[kc];B[ic];W[ne];B[ml]C[[EV\] Interesting move -- helps the J6-M6 connection and takes aim at the Q7 weakness.  Invading somewhere on the left would be bigger, but not necessarily better.]
;W[qi];B[og];W[ke]C[[EV\] This move may be a little slow.  Getting the first move around C6 is very big.  Since you already played O15, the top group is reasonably safe without this move.]
;B[bo]C[[EV\] Good timing.  Of course lots of other invasion points are possible here, and it is hard to say which is best.]

(;W[cn]C[[EV\] I don't like this W strategy.  Giving up the corner territory is large, and the thickness W gets in compensation will be mostly nullified by the B stones at H5 and J6.  If B had a serious weakness around K6, it might be possible to build thickness and then cut, but the center B group looks pretty resilient.]

(;B[co]C[[EV\] Pushing like this is generally bad style, unless you definitely intend to cut and fight.  If you have to first live in the corner, letting W protect the cut, then it is better not to push in the first place.]
;W[do];B[cq];W[dq]
(;B[cr]C[[EV\] B could probably play B6 in sente before this, making the corner much more secure.]
;W[bn];B[dn]C[[EV\] B is leading on territory, so picking a fight where W is stronger seems dangerous and unnecessary.  I would prefer to just live in the corner (D2) and let W worry about the cut.]
;W[dm]C[[EV\] Just extending to C8 seems simpler.  This atari helps B more than W.]

;B[ck];W[bk];B[cj];W[ci];B[bj];W[bi];B[el];W[fm];B[gm];W[fl]
;B[ek];W[aj];B[gj]C[[EV\] Too loose.  F10 is better.  W can escape with the F8 group, but then B should have time to live in the corner.]

(;W[fk];B[ej];W[fj];B[ei];W[fi];B[eh];W[hl]C[[EV\] Very nice move, creating aji below (which W unfortunately never manages to use).]
;B[fp];W[fq];B[ef]
(;W[hi]C[this sequence didn't work out as well as planned. What could have been better? Was L15 too slow?

[EV\] See previous notes and variations.  I think the B cut was an overplay, but W did not punish it.

[EV\] Note that the lower left corner is still not settled.  W can easily kill it with another move, but B can live if he plays first (exercise for the reader).]
;B[be];W[bf];B[nq];W[np];B[mq];W[ee]C[[EV\] This move removes aji and helps B.]
;B[de];W[df];B[ff]C[[EV\] This looks like the last chance for W to attack the center -- see variation.  I don't know how this turns out, but it is worth a try.]

;W[ir];B[jq];W[jr];B[pm];W[pn];B[pl];W[pk];B[ql];W[qk];B[rl]
;W[rk]C[this was such a big weakness, was there a better way to handle it?]
;B[sm];W[om];B[rn];W[qe]C[this was too early for this to work, i should already have a stone at P11

[EV\] Suppose you defend the P9 cut, B defends this corner, you kill the lower left corner, and B defends the upper left corner.  If you count, you will find B is far ahead.  So W can either resign or try something here.]
;B[pe];W[qf];B[pg];W[pf]C[[EV\] Same comment as C5 -- dont push unless you can cut.  Losing a liberty here could easily be fatal, depending on the continuation.]
;B[of];W[rg];B[rh];W[rf];B[qh];W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[oe];W[oi]
C[[EV\] W has no time for this -- live in the corner first.  If B cuts, give up the Q9 stones, or even give up the P8 stones and try to kill the entire B upper left group.  Desperate times call for desperate measures.]
;B[ra];W[qc];B[ob]C[white is dead...

[EV\] Not quite -- T13 threatens to live or connect underneath (ko).  Still, W really has no chance to win anymore.  No more comments.]
