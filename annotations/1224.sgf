C[X: Dear reviewer,

This is a game I played on IGS, 17k* vs. 17k*.  I played Black and lost by a half point.  No doubt there were many times I could have played better, but I think I did the worst in the endgame, since I was winning for most of the game.

The reason I chose this game for review is mostly because of one noteworthy feature: at the end of the game, I had a single group, and White had no less than SIX distinct groups, more than I've ever seen at the end of a game before. Usually the player who stays connected wins, but that didn't happen here.
Fascinating.

Anyway, I've put tons of comments into the game myself, prefixed with an "X:".
Any advice you can offer is, of course, appreciated.];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq]C[X: My usual fuseki for Black.];W[qj]
C[X: Suddenly at 17k*, my opponents have suddenly started knowing that they are supposed to play a wedge here.  Worth mentioning that this is a good thing to do vs. black's opening, for weaker players reading this review.

C: As far as I know, this is standard for white in this case.]
;B[de]C[X: I have a tendancy to prevent shimaris by playing this point.
Maybe I should play one point lower, at C15 instead?
Playing here could be a bad habit I learned from my computer program.

C: It's too complicated to say which is better.
There is nothing wrong with this move I think. Just matter of taste,whether C15 or D15.]
;W[cg]C[X: Wasn't expecting the pincer, since he doesn't have any other stones very close by... D4 is far away, and Q16 helps me out.

C: Just white has fighting spirit. I took time and had a look at joseki book.(36 Basic Joseki,ever heard of it?) Joseki moves for black are shown in variations.]

(;B[cd]C[X: Keep him separated before jumping out?  I don't know any pincer josekis...

C: It's right idea. Seems to be joseki move. Play at C17 instead gives black more space.
But to play lightly like this makes oportunity of atacking on both sides, depending on white's response. Actualy book doesn't prove that C16 is joseki move. Instead, C17 is one of possibility.]
;W[fd];B[cc]C[X: He doesn't defend the corner, so I decide to take advantage of that.]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[eb]
(;B[ef]C[X: I didn't want to get closed in.  Is this the best way to get out?  Didn't want to play contact or a shoulder hit, because both his groups seem weaker than mine right now.

C: Good idea, not to stay closed in corner. But I would like to play some sharper move to attack strong white group and than to make a pincer against that lonely white stone. As well it is big move to play C19 first. But maybe white will not respond, since he has enough space and strength in this case.]
;W[dj]C[C: Apparently failure for black. Black has divided white and deprived him from the corner, but, what a surprise, both white's groups look very safe. Now, even if still possible, its harder to launch some attack in order to make territory for black.]

(;B[kc]C[X: Perhaps this move is a little vague?
I was trying to make an extension from my hoshi stone and put a little pressure on his UL group, but perhaps I'm a bit too far from both to be effective.

C: Right idea. But this kind of move would be much more effective, if that sequence in corner wouldn't have been played yet.]
;W[ba]C[X: Bad move for White, I suspect.  More like an endgame move, since I still have plenty of room to run and/or make eyes, so he's not really threatening
much.

C: This is key point concerning the life of whites group. And you have responded, so made it actually whites sente.]
;B[eh];W[di];B[dh]C[X: This is probably aji keshi.  Don't know
why I played it.

C: Seems you are right.];W[ch];B[hc]C[X: He didn't answer L17, so he let me get this move.  I felt great about this... it is, in fact, a good move, isn't it?

C: The problem is that he didn't have to answer H17, so he could take some other big point for exchange. Since his corner is alive 100% after B19...]
;W[gc];B[hb]C[X: He lives small, I have a nice moyo starting on top.]
;W[qm]C[X:
Another White move I find questionable.  He still had miai for making a base... and if he absolutely wanted to make one, he should have gone upwards, to stop me from getting a double-wing formation, right?

C:
Seems you are right. If black pushes from down and white gets to play, say, R14, black would have to protect the corner.]
;B[qg]C[X: If he wants me to get double a win , I'll be more than happy to make one.]
;W[qc]C[X: Of course.  I fully expected the san-san invasion.

C: It seems for me that both players have made many mistakes during next sequence, which I'll try to point out.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]
(;W[pb];B[ob]
(;W[rd];B[qb];W[rb]
(;B[qa]C[C: Usualy, this black's move is nnot good. It gives white better shape in corner, some extra points. Because white S19 is sente. Normally, black shall capture one white stone imediately. In most cases its better to capture stones as soon as possible.]
;W[ra];B[pa]C[X: Black says thank you for living small and giving me a big wall for my moyo.

C: Yes, white has made some unnecesary moves.]
(;W[sc]C[C: Not necessary, because white is alive already. White lost sente.]
;B[hf]C[X:
Loosely connecting my not-quite-alive group to my alive one, sealing his group in, and expanding my moyo in the process. Triple-purpose, so good... but maybe something like K4 or an invasion around C7 would have been bigger, though.

C: Not bad idea, but I think, some move on lower side would be better. For two reasons:

1) Big point for both.
2) Are you 100% sure that H14 stone makes connection of black groups?

It would be an excellent move, if only it threatens life of white group in upper-left. Lets see what happen, if white doesn't respond there.]

(;W[ph]C[C: So white thinks he lives. Maybe it's good time to try whether he can do it really and than to respond his Q12.]
;B[pg];W[oh];B[ng];W[og];B[of];W[nh];B[mg];W[hd];B[id];W[he]
;B[ie];W[gf];B[gg];W[ff];B[fg];W[fe]
(;B[ig]C[X: I think that whole series of moves was terrible for White. My top side is HUGE, and now pretty much immune to invasion.  Something needs to be done about his lower left, and the bottom side is still fair game for anyone. Still, I think I'm clearly winning at this point

C: But black lost initiative, got some points on upper side, but not much enough to compensate for whites getting big point on lower side. As well, now white has no really weak groups. Black would better omit connection at J13, hoping that his upper left group will survive somehow, and take initiative in lower side. To black's connection alone: this kaketsugi is shape making move, but leaves option of kikshi, which white may use later. Since black has enough eye space, solid connection would be better in this case. Or, contrary, some more wider connection. For some black weaknesses, see var.]

(;W[jq]
(;B[hq]C[X: Obviously, I needed to invade somewhere, but I'm not sure this was the best place.

C:Should be more near to white's stone at D4. Since white is strong there, you should come more close to corner, I think. Another interesting idea is to attack whites stone at K3 from other side and this would be the best I think.]
;W[mq]
(;B[eq]C[X: This is probably bad. Maybe F3 or E2 instead.  Shoulder hit just induces him to close the corner.  Again, not sure what I was thinking.

C: As this, it was very bad outcome for black!];W[dq];B[ep]
;W[eo]
(;B[cm]C[X: Now or never...

C: It's usually bad to have two weak groups to take care of.]

(;W[cl]C[X: Black says thank you, again.  White ignores the proverb about attacking from a distance and playing contact only as a defense.]
;B[dl]C[C: Yes, white lets black live too easily.];W[ck];B[dn]
;W[do];B[fl]
(;W[en];B[em];W[cn];B[dm];W[bm]C[X: Obvious overplay by White.]

(;B[fp];W[er]
(;B[gq];W[fr];B[go]C[C: This is gote for black and it seems his group is not yet connected completely. No eyes as well, so what was good of this sequence?]
;W[jo]
(;B[io]C[X: A mistake, I'm sure...];W[jn];B[hl]C[C: Not necessary to strenghten already very
strong position. Better to go to cancel a little white moyo!]
;W[oo]C[X: And that's why.  My
lower right is closed in, and he's actually looking like he might take some territory in the lower right centre, except for defects at O4 and Q6.]

C[X: Might as well go for some center territory of my own.]
;W[li]
(;B[kg]C[X: I thought closing off my big top territory would be enough to win at this point, but I guess I let him get too big on the right.

C: This just closes your territory. There is some move, which adds to black territory while reducing white's. So it is bigger move.]
;W[ji]C[C: If he gets to your territory, get into his!]
(;B[ki]C[X: Mistake.  Every time I think I can achieve a positive result by cutting ikken tobi, I'm wrong.  Must resist the urge in future.]
;W[kj];B[kh];W[jk]C[X: This is the problem. For some reason, I was expecting him to respond passively at M10 and let me play K10.]
;B[ik];W[ml];B[bf];W[bg]C[C: Good attempt, but you have to think some other big moves as well. Not to loose sente is very important anytime during a game.]

(;B[cf]C[C: No worry here for black!];W[kl]
(;B[km];W[ll]C[C: If you respond every move automaticaly, you cannot win! white has made his moyo to be 100% territory!]
