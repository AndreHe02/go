C[z: Hello and thanks for looking at this game.

j: Thanks for the opportunity to comment your game. Bear in mind that only a high ranking pro can know the truth about go. My comments are only valuable to stimulate your own thinking.

;B[nq]C[B7: instead consider Q4 since developing the right side is more important, in conjunction with your two star stones, than developing on the bottom.]
;W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[jq];W[gq]C[W12: this puts some pressure on your bottom group but also seems slow. Since Black can handle his weakness at M3, Black cannot bear to make an exact defense, say at L4, this early; so should take the biggest point. (In other words, the M3 invasion in not really urgent right now.)]
;B[cn]TR[gq][dp]C[B13: are the two marked white stones strong or weak? They seem stronger than weaker to me; so, why approach them close with C6? I think D10 makes  more sense, building your own while limiting your opponent. Or dive right into the C3 invasion if you must (but its really too early for that).]
;W[bp];B[ck];W[lq]
(;B[lp]C[B17: Instead you may try L4, more severe looking; but it does not work. Do you read why? See variation.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[jr];B[ir]C[z:
Bad, right? Gote and W almost secures the big corner. Maybe W should be forced
to connect at the second line but I didn't see a sente sequence and that
would also strengthen the corner. How should B play?

j: The good news is you absolutely secured your bottom group. The bad news is, like you say, white profits on the bottom IN SENTE! This is white's compensation for you taking up the position C6-C9.
Your alternative is to just to connect and take sente.];W[iq]
;B[jp];W[hr];B[kr];W[is];B[lr];W[jc]
(;B[lc]C[B29: can try other direction to build something on the left? See variation]
;W[gc]
(;B[df]C[B31: seems slack because white can now settle easily. Your M17 put max pressure on white stone at expense of being thinner in the upper right corner. So must follow up with pressure. E17 keep pressure and help corner.]
;W[db];B[cb]C[B33: seems like an overplay or a clever move? Hard to know but ...]

(;W[cc]C[W34: White can choose peace over war and draw back. See variation.]
;B[dc];W[bb];B[cd]
(;W[bc]C[W38: greedy. White should take off which also help maintain his connection.]
;B[eb];W[ca];B[fc];W[be];B[bf]C[B43: the two white stones on top are urgent now; black must punish them to get compensation for white's upper left corner. Should be G16.]
;W[qf]C[W44: this is a big point over an urgent point error; white needs to help his upper two stones.]
;B[qh]C[B45: this means the right side is the most important. Is it?]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nb];B[le]
C[B55: slack. N16 keeps white separated.];W[lb];B[kb];W[kc]
;B[mb];W[mc];B[la]C[This is a heavy ko! You got enough ko material??]
;W[ld];B[nc];W[lb];B[cq];W[cp]C[W66: oh no. N19 is way bigger. Since white got the ponnuki share at j2, C3 is only point, not life and death.]
;B[lc];W[rf];B[md]C[B69: of course!];W[se];B[kd]C[B71: did you take off an important stone? I don't think so. Better at Q14 for honest shape. White must live in gote in the corner somehow. Then all the w stones on the upper side seem like toast.]
;W[hd];B[hf];W[fd];B[gb];W[hb];B[ge]C[z: Didn't see the threat to connect.

OK, of course E19 threaten white in corner instead of G15. Your just needed some preparation.]
;W[ga];B[ea];W[fb];B[ec];W[fa];B[da];W[bd]
(;B[cf]C[B85: Try to kill white with A15? Doesn't seem to work. See variation.]
;W[ae];B[cb];W[ba];B[id]C[B89: how about J17 nose tesuji?];W[ic]
;B[jd];W[gd];B[ia];W[ib];B[ja];W[ha];B[ob]C[B97: Q14 bigger ... seal off center in sente?]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[pg];B[pi];W[nh];B[oi];W[mg];B[nf];W[oh];B[ql]
;W[rm]C[W108: his center stones are urgent so no time for this move.]
;B[mj];W[li];B[lj];W[ho]C[W112: wow. How can w tenuki?];B[mi]
C[z: Not the right idea I think.];W[lg];B[mh];W[ng];B[lh];W[on]
C[w118: yet another tenuki. Does w have a death wish?];B[pm]
;W[pn];B[ra];W[rb];B[qa];W[of]
(;B[rh]C[B125: P15 instead? See variation.];W[ne];B[mf];W[oe]
;B[pe];W[oc]C[W130: nice move to survive.];B[nd];W[pb];B[na]
;W[pa];B[sd];W[sc];B[pf];W[qg]
(;B[sa]C[z:
B should just shut W in and let him live freely? Then, how should B play
to get the most out of his moyo, and how could W reduce it? Could you suggest
some sample variations?

Ok, see one variation where black does L13 instead.];W[jg];B[kh]
;W[lf];B[me];W[if];B[hg]C[B145: this is natural, but can you gamble with J12 instead?]
;W[ih];B[hi];W[ii];B[hj];W[ij];B[hk];W[jk];B[jl]C[z:
I think B would want to build the left side, and this close play doesn't
look good in itself, but it felt after bH7 or bG7 W have an easy connection
and the pressure is gone. I was also worried the right side is not strong
enough to push W there.

Seems ok.];W[kl];B[kk]C[z: Oversight.];W[kj];B[lk];W[il];B[jm]
