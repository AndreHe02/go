C[forfun (ff) - Thanks for an enjoyable game to analyze.

Things got off to an unsual start.  Fighting spirit was shown by both sides but I thought neither Black nor White was thinking too hard about about the proper direction of play in the early going.  Black was pushed into a low position at the top but then White missed an opportunity and Black somewhat recovered in the upper right.  After living in all four corners the Go proverb says Black can resign.  Black seemed to feel the same way in this game but I think that at the key point Black did not take time to correctly estimate the score and assess the possibilities.  Instead Black invaded dangerously deeply in White's area of influence.  This is not an unusual occurance for any of us.  Yet it is a pity when it leads to overplays that quickly lose what is still a reasonable game.]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[jd];B[lc]C[ff - The normal idea here would be for Black to close the upper right corner with a play at P17 or O17.  To prevent this, White almost always approaches the upper righ corner instead of splitting the upper side.  The splitting play is normal only when the Black stone at R16 here is at Q16 instead.]
;W[od]
(;B[oc]C[Wasn't sure about P17 but it seemed to work out fine.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[nd]C[ff - White has strengthened the upper side stones while Black has strengthened the corner.  This is not a reasonable exchange for Black because the corner started out relatively strong while the White stones were relatively weak.]

(;B[hc]C[kk - Black has to think of splitting the White stones.  If M17 is just to reduce a White position it is an endgame play.  See the variation.  In any case, if Black is not going to put M17 in motion, the usual play at R14 is very urgent.  A White attachment at R15 will work perfectly with the White stone at Q4.]
;W[hd];B[jc]C[ff - This type of play, asking White to play into J17, only leaves Black with weak points.  Probably G16 instead.]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[id];B[jb];W[ld]C[White could also have played G17 here.  If Black jumped to M15, White is now strong enough to be interested in fighting it out.]
;B[gc]C[kk - Black has been pressed flat all along the top and should be very unsatisfied at this point.]

(;W[fe]C[kk - Black gets lucky as this is clearly in the wrong direction.  White should have played R15.  This is the wrong direction because anything that Black might play in this directio would be overconcentrated with the Black shimari in the corner.]
;B[pe]C[ff - A good play that goes a long way toward fixing what has happened up to now.]
;W[of]C[ff - White is so strong at the top that this play should probably have been at P13 instead.  It would make it difficult for Black to get ahead on the side.]

(;B[pf]C[ff - Black pushes from behind.  White has no threat here because of the stone on R16.  Black should naturally jump out instead and be ahead on the right side.]
;W[og];B[ph]C[I felt good about this result.  Should I?

ff - This is the right idea on the right side. Overall the position is still questionable because Black took such a hit on the upper side.]
;W[ni]
(;B[cn]C[ff - I think that Black should continue on the right side by jumping again to Q10.  The Black stone at C15 is low so the left is not that urgent.  If White manages to play Q10, the effect of the White stones at the top can become very large.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[cp];B[cl]C[ff - This is a very tight play that normally aims at F8 after White connects.]
;W[fp];B[nq]C[I think O3 was the wrong idea, maybe around L3?  I wasn't sure what the best way to deal with white's presence in the center.

ff - I agree that L3 would be a better idea here.  You should have expected the pincer and had a way to deal with it.  Black has taken territory in various places and has no weak stones.  At this point the idea should be to spoil White's potential territories without coming under too strong an attack.]
;W[lq]
(;B[qq]C[This must be wrong.

ff - This is not wrong exactly - assuming that Black chose it after reading out the joseki that follows and assessed the chances in the position that results.  It does not appear that Black did that :-)]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nr];B[qn];W[pn];B[qm]

(;W[ol]C[Now the game seemed suddenly difficult.  I think O3 was very bad, but perhaps the situation was more difficult than I realized even before that.

ff - Whether the game is difficult or not depends on a very important question.  What is the score?  The trouble for most of us is that in situations like this the opponent's potential always seems so big while our own always seems so limited :-)

See the questions in the variations.

This is the key point of the game.  I do not think that Black is behind at this point.  The game is open.  However, by trying too hard Black gets into trouble.  If Black had been able to reasonably assess the game at this point, I think one of the alternatives to a deep invasion would have given better winning chances.]

(;B[jj]C[ff - This play must come under attack.  White can not allow it to escape without a fight as it reduces both the center and the bottom at one blow.  It should only be played if:
1. Black will be behind with a more conservative approach, and
2. Black has read out how to escape.];W[hj];B[hk];W[ik]C[ff - Usually White wants to hane on the outside at G9.  The trouble with cutting Black is that normally Black has the choice of which side to live on.  Here White is strong everywhere so the basic idea should be to contain all of Black inside and either capture it all or make territory all around it while forcing it to live small.]
;B[ij];W[hl];B[hi];W[gk]C[ff - Unfortunately White's ponuki shape faces Black's strong stones on the left side.  The effectiveness is limited.  On the other hand, White is very close to walling off almost seventy points of territory along th bottom and Black's ability to make territory on the left side has become much more limited than before.]
;B[ih];W[gi];B[gh];W[fh]
(;B[gg]C[ff - There is no reason for Black to avoid playing F11 here.  See the variation.  Black is almost alive in the center.  However, if life is all that Black achieves here, there is a danger that he will lose on territory.

Although Black died here in the end, the stones are almost alive.  However, White has limited the impact of Black's invasion successfully.  The commentary ends here.  I have added a few variations later to illustrate other possibilities (some of which fail also).]

(;B[fl]C[ff - The first question is what can White expect to make along the bottom after Black F8?  This is the fundamental follow up from Black's shape in the lower left.  Here it hits right on the border between Black and White.  It can not be cut by White.  In addition, there is the threat to surround a large area on the left side with a play around E14 next.  A play in that direction threatens to erase White's center while building up the left side so it is a major threat.]

(;B[pm];W[om];B[pj]C[ff - The second question is how much does Black make on the left side if it is blocked off like this?  White can not break in.  The side is worth about 40 points.  This is gote.  Also if White plays first around R9 to break in that is also gote.  As a result, neither Black nor White should play there right away.  But if Black divides up the left side and center in sente, these plays on the right would finish off the major questions on the board and the rest would be yose.  Forty points is the same as the territory White has on the first three lines of the bottom (from A3 to P3).]

(;B[lo]C[ff - Black may want to play something more conservative like this.  It is a flexible play that aims at settling the Black stones without getting into a fight.]
;W[jq];B[nm]C[ff - White's play at K3 aims to play N4 and cut Black.  Black plays O7 and is satisfied that the K3 stone is low.  Black nows can continue at K5 later.  Meanwhile the O7 stone threatens a play at Q8 next and the R3 point is still open.  Black is nearly settled.]

(;B[lp];W[kp];B[mp];W[kq];B[om];W[pn];B[lm]C[ff - Something like this may be more reasonable.  White makes about 30 points on the bottom left but Black's stones can still slide into the bottom right, can block on the right side and can limit the center.]
