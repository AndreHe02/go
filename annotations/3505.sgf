Hallo
Nice game to review. Strategically you made some mistakes by sometimes trying too hard to kill the stones of your opponent. You will see my remarks. And concerning tactics, you really lost the game in the endgame. Try to improve your reading, or to stay focused at the end of the game.

(;W[ce]C[$ what od u think of this white move and of black continuation

F: This is possible, I think];B[cg]C[F: This is fine, I  think. Pincer + extension from C6]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[dd];B[ec];W[bc];B[gd];W[bb]
(;B[jc]C[F: This might be joseki (I don't know), but if it is, it's a wrong choice. White is stable in the corner and can use his strength there to attack C13 (and C6) So instead o K17, you should reinforce your left side. See variation]
;W[oc]C[F: Wrong direction. Left side is more important];B[pc]
;W[od];B[pf];W[lc];B[le]C[F: This is too agressive. . You should first of all defend your left side. Then there is the left lower corner, which is much bigger. 
Locally M15 is the wrong point to attack, because black is left with a hole on L16]
;W[of];B[pg];W[kd];B[ne]C[F: Not so good because of white next move]
;W[jd]
(;B[ic]C[F: It would be more consistent to push through with P15. See variation]
;W[oe];B[mc];W[mb]
(;B[md]C[F: If you play N17, you should be wanting to cut white. See variation. This way, N17 is bad because it reinforced white and brought you nothing.]
;W[lb]C[F: O18 is better];B[mg];W[og];B[mi]C[F: Safe but Q12 is big]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[qh];B[qe]C[F: The fact that you have to come back here to defend, means your cut at P12 wasn't good]

(;W[pj]C[$ see variation];B[oi];W[rg]C[F: But this might be an overplay. Running away with K16 is more important at the moment]
;B[jf]C[F: Good, attacking and inducing the defence of your corner]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[rc];W[pd]
(;B[re]C[$ is it necessary for life ? I thought so if not it ismistake
F: I'm not a tsume go  expert, but this seems necessary to me. See variations]
;W[nc];B[na];W[kb]C[F: ???];B[jb];W[id]C[F: Better immediately J15]

I thought i had chase white enough
F: This is better, see your variation];W[ge];B[fd];W[fe];B[eg]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[ee]C[F: By chasing white, you made some nice influcence to the centre.]

(;B[nq]LB[fq:a][jq:b][qn:c]C[$ what is right here ? After playing i thought A was best. 
F: A would be better, but there is a move which is still better. See variation]
;W[pn];B[fq];W[cl];B[eo]C[F: Good];W[ci];B[cq]C[$ right here ? corner is big for black now
F: B4 is better I think. Now white may be able to cut of san-san and live in one or another way]

F: I'm not sure if this is good for white, but since he is behind, he has to try something]
;B[je]C[F: In this case, a move at L14, filling a white liberty, is better]
