Black: Endymion (me) 13k
White: vscuturi 8k

(NOTE:  You may say "well, if he's five stones stronger than you and you only had two handicaps, then OF COURSE you lost" ... however, i'm just 13k on KGS.  I've beaten 2 dans with 9 stones before and beaten 10 kyus in even games.  [real life, that is\])]

MA[rn]C[PJK: This is not good move! You help WHITE to make good shaps. S6 will be better move.]
;W[rn];B[pk]MA[nc]C[PJK: Now, this move is too slow. WHITE group is very strong. You mast develop your top-right ex. O17.]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[kc];B[og];W[qd];B[qc];W[pe];B[od]C[PJK: I prefer Q17.]
;W[qh];B[pi];W[ne];B[me]C[PJK: Corrner is big S16];W[nf];B[mc]
MA[rd]C[PJK: not necessary, stil S16];W[ld];B[md];W[rd];B[ln]
MA[rc][hq]C[PJK: wrong direction. You don't:
- create moyo,
- develop your position,
- make territory
ex. S18, H3];W[qj];B[qi];W[ri];B[pg]C[PJK: its only help WHITE]
;W[qg];B[pj];W[rj];B[hq]C[PJK: good !!];W[ho];B[fp];W[cq];B[dq]
MA[cp]TR[fp][hq]C[PJK: C4 ! Your stones (F4, H3) place in good position.]

MA[ip][sn]C[PJK: B10 is too low. This move take few point of territorium, but You have very good attack and make big territorial profit ex. J4]
;W[fo];B[eo];W[gp];B[gq];W[hp];B[he]SQ[ho][hp][gp][fo][jp]C[PJK: Still You have attack to WHITE group.]

;W[hb];B[fb];W[fd];B[ee]C[this is the first real big mistake that i'm -aware- of ... I realize now that E17 would have been much more productive than E15.]

;W[fr]C[This sequence ( 93 - 103 ) is a little ... insane.  I somewhat wonder if reading all that out is even -possible-.  Obviously, it was a big mistake on my part since I saw absolutely no way for white F2 to live.]
;B[es]MA[ds]C[PJK: Why  (black) D1 - white C2 and balck F3!]
;W[iq];B[ir]C[maybe i should have connected at F3 or something here, since my loss is due greatly to losing basically all my stones on the left side of the board.]
;W[fq];B[ep];W[hr];B[ip];W[gr];B[iq];W[eq];B[hs]C[PJK: Its O point move.]

;W[lk];B[nk];W[ll];B[pl]C[Now ... this is probably my stupidest move!  Granted i'm already losing by 20 or so points but here I just killed my own group.  I know NOW that I probably should have captured at P10 for any chance of living ... phooey.]
;W[oj]C[and here I resigned.

PJK: You have good game! You must play strong shapes and attack, develop your position.]
