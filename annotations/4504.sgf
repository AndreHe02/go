C[reid: This is a bit slow for white.  If we consider the relative strengths of the three stones versus the one stone in the upper left, it seems like the upper left is weaker than the lower left.  But white has played closer to the stronger stones - a violation of the proverb "play away from strength".  The lower left corner is in no danger, it is not surrounded, and it has miai for life - no need to rush to defend it.

Better for white to attack the upper right corner, I think.  White A, black B and white C looks reasonable.  Then white can wait to see what develops.  If black then invades around D or E, a white pincer will help build up the left side naturally.]
;B[qk]LB[mc:B][nc:A]C[reid: The Chinese (low or high) opening is generally used when aiming for a moyo game.  Here, the lower left joseki has already been played.  Black has played two stones on the second line, and the white stone at J4 is light.  That makes it difficult to know if a moyo strategy will work or not.  Perhaps black should play a simple territory game by taking A or B (which would be natural directions for white).

That said, black is still OK because white C10 is still less valuable than black R9.  Black can afford to be a bit slack.]
;W[nc]C[reid: better late than never...];B[kd]LB[jd:B][pf:A]
[mp:C]C[reid: This is not really the right move for making the low Chinese formation work.  Perhaps something like black A, white B, then black C to grow the moyo while attacking on a large scale?  Black's moyo is bigger than white's.]
;W[qf]LB[qi:A]C[reid: good point for white.  Because white still has room to extend to A, this is possible, and it's the side where black wanted to build his moyo.]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[qc];B[oc];W[qd];B[nb]C[reid: Black is now strong in the wrong direction (and in gote).  the white corner is stable.  Changing the black corner into a white corner is a huge territorial blow.  Perhaps the game is even again?]
;W[po]C[What are the possible responses here?

reid: lots.  too many to go over in this format.  what black did (R5) is one way.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[nn]LB[pm:B][mn:C][pn:A]C[reid: white A or B would clearly be wrong in this position (black already has R9).  But perhaps white should play even lighter with C?]
;B[qh];W[rg]LB[re:A][pg:B]C[reid: White needs to stop black's tesuji at A (which works because of the black stone at O15).  The normal move for white in this shape is B to keep access to the corner.  S13 looks like white is trying to attack the black R12/R9 stones.  But the white stones around R6 are far too weak to think about a real attack.  White should play B.]
;B[oh]LB[og:B][pg:A]C[I guess a move at o4 would have been better here?

reid: It's not easy to attack those white stones.  White probably doesn't even need to respond to black O4.

But I think black A or B would have done a better job of sealing white into the corner.]
;W[np];B[nq]LB[gc:B][de:C][gf:D][nr:A]C[reid: "when you touch me, you help me".  This contact move helps the weak white stones get stronger.  If black wants to play this direction, sliding to A is better.

Perhaps black could put his strong O16 formation to good use with black B, white C, black D.  It's difficult for white to reduce the large moyo effectively while the O6 stones are still weak.  That's why it's important to not help white make them stronger.]
;W[mq];B[op];W[no]LB[nr:A]C[reid: if black had played A instead of P4, it still looks like sente, but black defends agains the white atari at A.  But better to have simply started with A instead of O3.]
;B[de];W[fd]LB[gc:B][ic:A]C[By playing here, white will need to play another move around A.  White can do pretty much the same job with just one move at B instead.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch]C[reid: Now we see that white C10 is in the wrong place.  It really needed to be at least at C11.  Black's invasion at D15 is too easy.]
;W[ek];B[iq]LB[hc:A]C[reid: If black had played O2 instead of P4, this move would not be necessary.  In any case, black C2 is probably bigger (it's worth about 15 points).  black A is also very big.]
;W[nr];B[oq];W[kp]LB[ic:A][cr:B]C[reid: but white defends, so black J3 turns out to be sente.

White should ignore the threat to J4 (it's too small, and black has played 4 moves close to it) and instead take A or B.]
;B[rn];W[qm];B[rm];W[ql];B[rl];W[bi];B[eh];W[ic];B[id]C[reid: this move helps to strengthen white.

After White J17, we are already into the endgame.  There are no strategic situations left.  Black seems to be ahead territorially, and white still has a slightly thin group in the center/lower-left, so black should win this game.]
;W[jb];B[mc]LB[gc:D][hc:B][gd:C][hd:A][fe:E]C[reid: this is not as big as it looks: black has already played 6 moves in this area, so capturing the one (or two) stones has gotten pretty expensive.  Better would be for black to seal white in with the sequence starting at A.  White defends his small space on the side, but black gets more value from the outside thickness.  If white wants to save O17 by connecting at N17, black N15 increases his outside influence and white still needs another move.]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[pk];B[pj];W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[lk]LB[lj:A]C[Is this move alright or should I have let white build territory below in return for territory above?

reid: To answer that question, you need to consider which potential area is bigger: the white area near O9, or the black area near O15.  It looks like the black area should be bigger, so I think black should build his area rather than reduce white's area.  Black A looks better.]
;W[mj]C[reid: natural for white.];B[lj];W[mi];B[he];W[gd];B[li]
;W[mh];B[fk]LB[kg:A]C[Bad move? Which move would you prefer here?

reid: yes, this is trouble.  the black E12 stones are not completely stable yet, and this allows white to split E9 from the e12 group and stir up some trouble.

Better for black to keep things simple: A is the natural continuation.]

C[I think white could have played tougher here. The result may not be that good for white, but I guess it is all right?

reid: black is not really gaining anything with this whole fight.  White has a numerical superiority of stones and black is not strong nearby, so black can't expect much.  Any gain black makes here is eliminated by the increased threat to the three M10 stones.

Better to simply take a big yose (A or B) than to try to make a fight where you are at a disadvantage..]

(;B[eo];W[co];B[fn];W[bn];B[bh]C[reid: big yose, but now the three M10 stones can be attacked.]
;W[lh];B[io];W[jo]LB[jn:A]C[reid: if white wants to attack the three M10 stones, he needs to keep them split from their friends.  white A gets out ahead - K5 pushes from behind.]
;B[in];W[jn];B[im];W[hp]LB[pb:B][cr:A]C[reid: not very big.  A (C2) and B (Q18) are bigger.]

reid: The final margin is pretty close.  Because both sides played some slow moves, this game entered the yose quite early.  Yose games are difficult because you're juggling many small trade-offs.

Black seemed to be ahead in the middle game, but he chose a couple of fights that didn't work out very well (M9 and around E7 in particular) which allowed white to pull ahead in the yose.

I think black should concentrate on making sure all his stones are working together during the fuseki and middle-game, and not focus too strongly on territory too early.  And in the yose, make sure you get to the big yose points instead of losing senty on smaller moves.

Good luck, play strong - reid])
