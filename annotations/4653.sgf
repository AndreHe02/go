C[vernon: I played black in this game on IGS. yuubokumin played W.

Hi -
My name is Slava Kozin aka zloy, and I will review this game using Cgoban.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[cp]C[vernon: I prefer the 3-4 point, but I started with one 4-4.]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[gp];W[dn];B[kq]LB[jp:A][kp:B]C[A or B could be better]
;W[nq];B[ko]C[vernon: I decided that L3 had been a bit too far, so instead of playing Q or R10, I strengthened the bottom and started a small moya.

It is too early to start building a moyo there, especially a small one. Many big points have not been occupaied yet. Q10, R10, K17, or C10 are better at this moment.]
;W[qf]
(;B[pi]C[vernon: I had been fearing a big W right side moya, so the R14 approach gave me the opportunity to break up the right while attacking.

You push white in your corner - if you like to fight then have to solve a lot of problems: goproblems.com]
;W[of];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc]C[vernon: W is trying to make his own base, but he helps give me a live group.

Yes, but you could have got much many points in that corner. Now  it is just a live group. You forced white to attack there.]
;W[ri]
(;B[pl]LB[rc:D][ed:A][jd:B][cj:C]C[vernon: this is probably invalid, but I wanted some sort of group sense. I also wanted to keep the aji around S13, for future fights.

It is not a good move at this point. You  still have more important points. Q11 can alwaus escape in the middle of the board.]
;W[ic];B[ec];W[lc];B[dj]C[vernon: By driving J17 into a live group, I get an ideal extension.

Q16 group is not alive yet - have to be careful there];W[rc]
;B[rb]C[vernon: But W makes the most of the situation, by making me live as small as possible, and then jumping into the extension.]

(;W[nb];B[ob];W[mb];B[pb];W[dg]
(;B[cm]C[vernon: I decide to try to threaten the lower left, then squeeze D13 between two live groups.

Lower left is alive. C7 does not a threat for D13.];W[cn]
(;B[fj]C[You do not have to run right now - it is pushing white D13 to the same.]
;W[bi]
(;B[ch];W[cl];B[ck];W[dl]C[vernon: This didn't go as planned. I had thought I would keep C7, but I did not.]

(;B[gc]TR[dg][ch][bi][dj][fj][ck][cl][dl]C[I would try to do something around the marked stones at first. These groups are not settle for both sides.]
;W[cg];B[bh];W[ff]
(;B[he]LB[bf:B][jj:D][fn:A][qn:C];W[hg]
(;B[gg]C[vernon: I decide to try to cut and fight. Although it works to a degree, W gets the corner for the upper left side. Was there a way to kill? I did not find it.

Since C12 is not alive - it is hard to tell right now who will die. I would let it go]

C[vernon: At least with this move, the two groups surrounding the corner are alive. A very dicey situation.]

(;W[dc]LB[dc:A][fd:B]C[vernon: see variation for another way to save W.]

(;B[ed];W[hh]
(;B[fl];W[bm];B[bk];W[kh];B[rh];W[qh];B[rj]C[vernon: I go for an attempted shape move here. It works to give me the lower right side. The aji around S13 pays off, IMHO.]

[he][hf][jf]C[It is a nice shape, but it does not make a lot of difference there for black right now. Black reduced white territories, but did not built almost any. I would say white right now is about 20 points ahead. Only center left - black can tryto build moyo at the bottom.]

(;B[gk];W[hj];B[hk]C[vernon: I try to profit by squeezing the G12 group.]
;W[ek];B[ej];W[ik];B[ij];W[ii]
(;B[il]LB[jj:B][il:A][fn:1]TR[hg][gh][hh][kh][ii][gj][hj]C[vernon: I debated between trying to kill G12 and trying to build a wall around K4. I opted for the wall. See variation.

Your moyo still could be attacked at 1,and it is very hard to kill white shape.]
;W[jj]
(;B[jl]C[vernon: perhaps this could have been at F6.

Yes.];W[fo];B[go];W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[gm];W[lp]
(;B[lq]C[vernon: I felt his group was weak enough to poke instead of defending. It would get too big otherwise.]

C[vernon: probably a weak move that wastes a turn. I am feeling less confident right now.

Yes. This move does  not make any difference - it is pushing white in your territory.]
;W[mm];B[lr];W[mr];B[iq]TR[kq][lq][lr]C[vernon: I thought it was just too risky to leave tempting cuts around.

Bad shape. Try not to build this kind of shapes.];W[kl]C[vernon: W now goes on a spree with sente for about 20 moves.]

;B[sb];W[sd];B[lm];W[ml];B[tt];W[tt]C[vernon: With a 6.5 komi, W wins by 9.5.

White made a couple of mistakes - could be worse for black

Summary: 

1. It is good to reduce the territories of your opponents, but you have to get something before that. You will win if you get more points than your opponents. When you reduced territories of your opponent - you did not get any points, your opponent still got some.   
2. If you like to fight and kill opponents group - you have to learn count and solve problems - goproblems.com will help you.
3. Learn to count the points and act accordingly
4. Learn good and bad shapes - will help for p 2.

Thanks and Good Luck!])
