C[Kyo: Hi !
 
Kyo: I am Kyoshinai, playing Black, 11k on kgs.

Kyo: I thank you for reviewing my game, and hope you'll find it interesting.

Kyo: I do not have any relevent point I'm interested on, except from Black's yose (I'm always told my yose is quite poor). However, I would like to know if I could have avoided - or at least reduced - the center invasion in the late middle game.

Kyo: Please point out anything you feel relevant concerning White's play too.

Kyo: Thank you for your time, and have fun :)];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd]
;W[dp];B[ic];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj];B[cn];W[fp];B[dj]C[Olaf: until now its a normal fuseki]
;W[kd]C[Olaf: in the chinese fuseki it is somewhat important not to allow black the corner enclosuer at E16, so that move better should be there.]
;B[je]C[Olaf: not bad, but perhaps it would be more easy to take the important point at E16.]
;W[ke]
(;B[jf]C[Kyo: Here I feel I should have played the hane at L14. White will still escape, but pursuing him Black can make a stronger wall on the left.

Olaf: Here i feel your move quite correct. It is much more stable than the hane at L14.  Another idea would be to jump to K14.]

(;B[kh];W[lh];B[li]C[Olaf: you get a lot of cutting points this way. A hane is not allways a good move. You have to get something from the attack.]

(;B[if]C[Kyo: I hesitated on whether to defend or not, and on where. I chose J14 because I felt that if white managed to live, the L12 group would have a good shape to bring influence downwards.]

;W[ge];B[fc];W[ed];B[gh]C[Kyo: Here I did not see that the G17 group was in danger. Should have connected at E18, and then I could have go on with chasing the white group to the center

Olaf: you are right. attacking is much more easy with strong groups around. E18 is necessary now.]
;W[eb]
(;B[fb]C[Olaf: very dangerous. you have to worry for eyes allready. H18 seems to be the most simple way to establish a base.]
;W[hb]C[Kyo: Here I think I should either have thretened to cut or tried escaping]

Olaf: its difficult to decide where to play now. You have around 45 points on the left and 8 points in the upper right corner. White has about 40 points on the top and right, 10 points in the lower left and 5 points in the lower right. I think the most important area now is the botton. White too stands high on the 4th line there, so its not easy to encircle a large center area in any case, so i would decide to play low too. I would play at H3, but can hardly say which is better.]
