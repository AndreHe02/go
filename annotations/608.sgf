AB[dd][pd][pp][dp]C[lieten: I am Black and I felt like I was losing control of the game early on, maybe because of some slow moves? I know I played badly on the right side and the lower side, but I am not exactly sure which moves were the bad ones.]
;W[fp];B[cn];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[cr];W[kq]C[this L3 w stone is too far.  Should be K3.  But how to punish it, that is the question !   I suggest you ask a stronger player (I'm 3k* nngs ) and let me know what they say !]
;B[ci]C[lieten: Too low? Maybe the fourth line is better?



Yes, I like 4th line better but I'm not sure this is the area to play in .

Perhaps O3 which makes profit while threatening to exploit w's too-long extension at L3.]
;W[cc]C[
Check out var 2 .  Seems to give a nice flow for b.]
(;B[cd]C[lieten: Maybe this was the wrong side to block on...

Maybe.  see var 2 in previous move.];W[bd];B[be];W[dc];B[bc]
C[lieten: Should this be at E16 or E17 instead?     I think B17 ok.  w should have played D17 BEFORE B16 .]
;W[bb];B[ad];W[fc]
(;W[eb];B[ed];W[fd]C[lieten: it looked like White had some many holes in his position, but I didn't know what to do about it.]
;B[fb]C[lieten: Maybe I should just hane at F15.];W[da]C[variation 2 seems to work for black, and w still isn't alive in corner.]

(;B[fe];W[hc];B[hd];W[gc];B[ge]C[lieten: Was this too slow?

see var 2 several moves ago];W[ei]C[lieten: I guess the black stone was definitely too low]
;B[ej]C[lieten: should I have made a keima around D9 instead?

yes D9 might be better than contacting a weak stone.];W[dj]
;B[di];W[dk];B[fj];W[eh];B[en]C[lieten: I was trying to expand my territory and block the direct link at the same time, but it wasn't too successful.]
;W[fm];B[el]C[lieten: should I have cut the other one? I was trying to reinforce my weak group from a distance.

How about pushing at F6 instead of E8 ?  That way, you look to attack entire group, rather than split it in two.]
;W[bj];B[cg]C[lieten: Should I have just blocked at B11 instead? I was worrying about my connection...


At first level, it's a reading problem.  Can w capture C11 if b omits C13 ?  if not, then maybe play elsewhere.]
;W[cm]C[my first thought for b here is to play D7 instead of b7.

Keep w congested as much as possible...];B[bm];W[dm];B[em];W[dn]
;B[co];W[bl]C[Since var 2 looks fightable by b, I'd suggest that, in order to keep w group from getting 2 eyes so easily.]

(;B[eo]C[lieten: Maybe I should have just blocked at B6?];W[bn]
;B[bo];W[am];B[gh]C[this G12 not so big.  How about O3 or Q10, after which if w attempts to save the E12 stones, b can look forward to making profit while attacking them.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd];W[rd]C[lieten: occasionally I have heard that this is a bad move, but what is wrong with this?

not sure.];B[qc];W[kc];B[rc]C[lieten: I was trying to take away the eye space of White's group, but maybe I should just block with something like N17?

S17 looks ok.  w took some profit at L17 and you took some at S17.]
;W[mb]C[w just took some more profit with N18.  where will b get some profit too ?  I'd suggest by attacking the R14 group.    Maybe start with S15 which makes b stronger and w weaker.]
;B[nb]C[b is just answering w.  w making profit, b standing still...]
;W[mc];B[nc];W[re]C[now b really better get busy and attack...]
;B[oh]C[might be ok if b can make profit in lower right by attacking upper right.]
;W[mf];B[md]C[lieten: should I just extend with my two stones on the side?]
;W[pj]C[lieten: Wasn't sure what to do about this one.];B[pg]
;W[oe]C[the time to cut is now.  how about M15.];B[mh]C[this move seems to push w in the direction he wants to go anyway.]
;W[ke];B[lf]C[lieten: still trying to cut...

hard to cut since you played N12 instead of M15.];W[lg];B[mg]
;W[ng];B[nh];W[le];B[lh];W[kf];B[pm];W[nj];B[lj];W[ml]C[maybe var 2 would give b a better attack on the N8 w stones.]

(;B[lp]C[lieten: should this just be at N3? I was trying to keep the pressure on the white group.

It's too bad that w gets to play K5 in sente which protects w's problem of L3 being too long an extension.]
;W[jo];B[ln];W[kl];B[jm];W[lk];B[lm]C[lieten: I guess this was a bad move...]
;W[kj];B[jh]C[this makes it too easy for w, since w can capture the M10 stone.  How about K11 instead of K12 ?]
;W[li];B[nk]C[lieten: I think this was a bad move. Maybe I should have played a peep at P9 instead? or just leave it alone and protect the weak group?]
;W[ok];B[nl];W[ol];B[nm];W[mk];B[ki];W[om];B[nn]C[not good to let w through here, but once you've decided to, it's bigger to play Q6 and give up the 3 stones.]
;W[pn]C[see how much more w gets here than if  b had given up the 3 stones]
;B[qm];W[qn];B[rk];W[qk];B[rn];W[ro];B[rj];W[rm];B[rl];W[sn]
;B[ql];W[on]C[when b first attacked w on right side, b's ideas was to make territory there, but now b neither captured the group or made territory.  If you have a plan that gains you either A or B, make sure you get one of them.]
;B[qq]C[lieten: I was now worried about living in the corner.]
;W[op]C[given b's complications, looks like just answering this w p4 with b p3 might be best.]
;B[lq]C[this looks dangerous for b.  what if w had ignored it and played as in var 2]

(;W[kr];B[lr];W[pr];B[qr]C[
var 2 doesn't look good for b either.]
(;W[pq];B[oo];W[po];B[qp];W[no];B[oq];W[nq];B[or];W[nr]C[lieten: now I was in trouble.]
;B[ps];W[rp];B[rq];W[km]C[lieten: I couldn't read this as well as I had liked, but I don't think I could escape after this...


But even if you do escape, the fact that you have to escape might mean you lose the game.]
;B[ns]C[lieten: so I did the last desperate thing I could think of: a ko.



In general, I think b needs to concentrate on making his positions strong before attacking, and then attack resolutely when the time is right.]
;W[ms];B[mr];W[os];B[jp];W[kp];B[ns];W[mn];B[mm]C[lieten: maybe I should just sacrifice these four stones for the ko (since I ended up losing them anyway), but I thought I had enough local threats to break out.]
;W[os];B[ko]C[lieten: should this have been at L6, one point higher?]
;W[kn];B[ns];W[lo];B[mo];W[os];B[ks];W[ko];B[ns];W[kh];B[ls]
