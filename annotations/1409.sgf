C[[exswoo\]
(10k)-Hi.  I'll try my best to point out any mistakes you make.  I haven't
been playing much for the past month though :D];B[dp];W[pp]
;B[dd];W[pc]C[Just standard opening here.];B[cj];W[fc]C[He played defensively with C10, so I wanted to respond aggresively and see how it turned out.]
;B[jq];W[qj]LB[db:A][ic:B][cf:C]C[He attacked with K3, so I dfended with R10

-K3 can not be considered an attack.  It's a major point to be sure, but none of your stones are in any danger because of it.

I
would concentrate more on the fact that black chose to ignore your move at
F-17 and make a follow up move at either A , B or C];B[jc];W[jb]
LB[db:A][hc:B]C[I was afraid of F17 getting cut, so I decided to go under him.

-Cut?
 in what way?  F17 is a lone stone so it can be pincered , but it can't be
cut.  In either case K18 is just a panic move.  A or B will allow white to
develop with ease and you're not putting any pressure on the black stone
(K17) at all.  This is definitely a bad move on your part.]
;B[gc]C[He responded by applying pressure to my F17, which I countered with G18 ( I really wanted to connect)]
;W[gb];B[hc]C[Here, he threatened to cut me off, so again I tried to connect]
;W[hb]LB[db:A]C[The
2nd line is called the "groveling line" or the line of defeat.  You're barely
making any profit here while black is getting a very strong base.

You
have to remember that not every stone is worth saving.  You should've ignored
black's move and either tenuki or play something like A.];B[fd]
C[I realized E16 would do my no good (he would counter with E17) so I decided to keep pushing right]
;W[ic];B[id];W[ib]C[he threatened and I connected];B[ec]C[again, he threatend and I connect]
;W[fb]C[-This is a losing go game right here...

There is a lot of bad aji (potential) on black's part, but here he's leading by a huge margin.]
;B[ea]LB[eb:A][jd:B]C[I
didn't want him getting inside, and playing E18 would cause him to play D18
and I would be stuck there, so I figured the extra liberty couldn't hurt,
so I played F19

-A first line move like this is worthless.  White
can easily cut at A and the black stone loses it's meaning.  Black should
instead fix up his weakness at A before white plays it.];W[fa]
;B[eb]
(;W[kc]C[You helped black here by playing  atari from this direction.

Instead...];B[jd];W[mc]LB[md:A][nd:B]C[Two point leap here, didn't want him cutting me off

-You
want to extend up higher, to A or B];B[ld]C[When he played here, I realized
I could either play M17 and block him off, O17 to keep going (then respond
later with M18) or try to cut him off with L16, so I chose L16]
;W[kd];B[lc]C[he
responded and I thought I would rather lose two pieces and gain the upper
right than have him keep pushing me right until I ran into Q17]
;W[lb];B[ke];W[md];B[kb];W[ka];B[kc];W[nb]C[Then
I realized, if he played N18, he would take M18 and possibly L19 or at least
cut me off, so I decided to play defensively that turn

-Black's lead is now humongous.  You barely made 10 points after all these plays while he can make 50+ easy.]
;B[me];W[ne];B[oe];W[nf];B[le];W[nh]C[I cut him and decided to keep moving down]
;B[od];W[nd]C[after he played P16, though, I had to play O16]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[ma]C[Saw his push and responded];W[mb];B[of]
;W[og];B[pg];W[ph];B[qg]LB[qe:A]C[Fortuantely
since I had taken a jump earlier, I had an okay defense there and was able
to push him right

-This is a very poor series of plays by black here.  If white plays A, his entire position crumbles...and most likely dies.]

(;W[qh];B[rh];W[ri];B[sh];W[si];B[rg];W[qd]C[then I wanted to make sure he didn't kill me in top right

-How?  Your stones are already connection at Q-18];B[qe]C[-Black plays the vital point and lives.]
;W[rc]C[Why not a firm connection at S-16?];B[pd];W[qb];B[rd]
;W[qc];B[re];W[lo]C[after
that, I figured I had it defended decently enough for still pretty early
in the game and went on the offensive again (a large part of the board was
still empty space).  I thought I would let him have bottom and take bottom
right, right side, part of middle and maybe able to pull a victory.]
;B[sc]C[He wanted to keep fooling around with top, so I let him.]
;W[nq]C[Knights
Jump to protect lower right];B[rb]C[at this piont, I realize I couldn't let
him keep going, so I was forced to play up there

-Why not?  It's only for a handful of points and there are much bigger points elsewhere.]
;W[ra];B[sb]C[threatened him and went back to lower right];W[pm]
;B[pa]C[again, I saw the cut attempt and connected];W[pb];B[sd]
;W[oa]C[I wasn't sure if he could still pull something off up there, so I wanted to split his two stones apart

-un needed.  Black is dead as it is.];B[sa]C[again, I had to play R19 here

-You don't have to answer every atari in Go.  Doing so is a sure way to lose.  Besides, if you read this out...]

(;W[qa];B[lp]C[then he attacked lower right];W[lr]C[responded by sliding under him]
;B[qf]C[He
connected, but I figured that even if I had taken Q14 before this, there
was still O17 and if I had played O17, he would have connected, so I didn't
feel like i lost out on this move

-He had 2 eyes anyway.  He just wasted a move.

I
took a look at the rest of the game and it shows a misunderstanding of the
fundamental strategy of the game so I'll just note some general things on
the last move :)];W[kq]C[so I tried cutting him off here];B[kp]
C[but failed];W[jr]C[So I slid under him again, in hopes of minimizing his territory in lower left]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[hr]C[but he wisely cut me off];W[hs];B[lq];W[mq]
;B[kr]C[I was an idiot and completly missed this];W[ks];B[kq]
C[so I threatened and he responded, at the same time I saved my three stones to the left]
;W[mp]C[I didn't want him cutting into lower right, so I played here]
;B[gs]C[he threatened, I responded];W[is];B[js]C[losing my three stones like a moron, and kept acting like a moron]
;W[mn];B[mr];W[nr];B[ls];W[ns]C[here I just cut my moron loses and tried my best to keep playing]
;B[ko];W[kn]C[tigers claw (or mouth or whatever) so that I could cut him and keep going left]
;B[jn]C[but he stopped me with that, so I went up instead];W[km]
;B[no]C[but then he threatened me here, so I had to connect]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[nk]C[I
wanted to trap him in my corner and make sure those stones were dead (as
well as connecting my top white and bottom white)];B[nl];W[ol]
C[again, I wanted to cut him off here from going right];B[nm]
C[he
connected];W[ml]C[I thought this would play decently, so I capped him off
so he couldn't (easily) go left Although in retrospect I guess he could have
played N9, but then his stones would be dead (my other goal)]
;B[om];W[pk]C[Formed triangle defense to make sure he didn't eat those three stones]
;B[pn];W[qm]C[I played defensively here, hoping Q4 would stop him from making two-eyes]
;B[qn];W[oo]C[This, I would say, was my smartest move in the whole game. I expected a connection at P6, but he surpised me with]
;B[po]C[this];W[np]C[so I countered by closing his bottom off and forming a tiger's claw]
;B[on]C[forcing
him to connect, but I played R4];W[qp]C[and his pieces were dead, if I didn't,
he would have played R4 and I would be in some serious trouble]
;B[op];W[pq]C[so he took my peice, and I cut him off again]
;B[oq];W[or]C[and
his pieces were dead];B[oo];W[rn];B[mg]C[He attacked my thing there, and
fearing the extinction of my top whites, I connected (a good move by him
so now I was less likely to go left, I figure)];W[ng];B[mf]
;W[mh]C[But
I had my mind set on destroying his territory.  right now, he was hurting
from losing all those pieces in the lower right, and I thought I had a good
chance of winning, but when I relaxed, he was able to come back.]
;B[lh];W[li];B[kh]C[he pushed me down one];W[jm]C[so I decided: I would rather do this]
;B[hn];W[in]C[he jumped, so I played here, forcing him to connect]
;B[jo];W[hm]C[then played a claw];B[io];W[ho]C[and was a moron (again)]
;B[im];W[gn]C[but
decided if I played here, he would have to connect, and once he did, I would
play G8, let him have the lower piece, and then play J8, forming a triangle
defense against further leftward aggression];B[in];W[gl];B[go]
;W[il];B[fm]C[but he attacked here, forcing a connect];W[gm]
;B[fn]C[and cut me off even further];W[fl]C[but I still had an advantage]
;B[ik]C[till
here.  Personally, I didn't forsee this, so I played K8 to make sure he didn't,
forcing me to play H8 and losing any hope of a connection];W[jl]
;B[jj]C[He
countered with this, and I thought he was going for a triangle defense, so
I played L12 (also to extend that stone)];W[ki];B[ji]C[he answered by
forming a wall];W[kk]C[but I still saw weaknesses and didn't want him cutting
in and possibly (unlikely) saving that group in lower right]
;B[kj];W[lj];B[jk]C[he countered and I played a triangle];W[hk]
C[playing here, I thought, I could stop his westward advance, and further my own defense by creating an eye]
;B[lk]C[but he played here, and forced me to play L8];W[kl]
;B[mi]C[he
played here, trying to trick me to set up a ladder, I suppose and allowing
him to destroy that group of three (or just trying to cut that group of three
from the group in the upper right)];W[mj]C[so I countered here, killing both stones]
;B[fk]C[so he tried to stop westward expansion];W[hj]C[so
I went north, and to try to possibly get that group of five killed (although
I found the possibility highly unlikely, but at least it added pressure I
think)];B[hi]C[He played here, and for survival I went left again (right would have been deadly)]
;W[gj];B[fj];W[gi];B[hh]C[it
seemed like he was trying to set up some kind of ladder at first, which I
didn't mind since my pieces were secure, but he was really forming a defense
in that upper pocket (I realized this later)];W[ij]C[I thought playing this might put a little more pressure on him, forcing him to connect, which he did]
;B[ii];W[gh]C[so
I went north more];B[fg];W[gd]C[then, I thought I had an idea, but it was
just stupidity in the end, I played here, so he would play H16, but somewhere
along the way, I forgot why, and lost a piece in the exchange]
;B[hd];W[ge];B[gf];W[ed]C[again pure stupidity];B[ee];W[gg]
C[so I went north more (I had two openings on the left, so I knew I could pull it out there somehow)]
;B[he]C[then he finished off the death of those two stones]
;W[fh]C[so
I went west];B[eg]C[he followed];W[eh];B[el]C[I wish I had seen that before
he had played it, it would have been pretty deadly I think, but oh well]
;W[dh];B[gk]C[he tried killing my gropu of five so I connected]
;W[hl];B[dg];W[ch]C[kept wenting left];B[cg];W[bg];B[bf]C[cut him off and formed the wall]
;W[ag];B[af];W[bi]C[played here to protect my two stones and to add pressure on lower left]
;B[ej]C[he tried cutting me off];W[bj]C[but I didn't want to be cut off]
;B[bk]C[He wanted to force me into submission, but my instinct said not to, so I played C9]
;W[ck];B[cl]C[then
I was like oh no, stupid instinct, but then I said: Hey, I can still pull
this off, and make him lose quite a bit];W[dk];B[bl]C[He took a really
long time thinking here cause he realized it too, that if he hadn't played
that, he would have lost lower left];W[dj]C[so I settled for the stones
above me];B[ek]C[but I realized that one was dead, so I decided maybe I could
try going down again];W[dl];B[dm]C[but he stopped me];W[ci]
C[I was in danger (one liberty left), so he forced me to take that stone]
;B[hg]C[he
formalized his defense];W[hp]C[I had fancy of setting up some elaborate death
trap where he would be forced to take something, but he countered very well,
and all I ended up doing was taking those three stones in the upper right
(he had to think for a while during this part)];B[gp];W[fo]
C[I played
this, so this is where it was determined what he would lose.  If he had played
E5, I would have taken F6, capturing that set of two or taking lower left
(either would have been fine) but he played F4, so I had to go west, make
him connect that long chain and was able to take those top three, but he
set up a defense in the meantime];B[fp];W[eo];B[en];W[do];B[co]
;W[cm];B[dn];W[bm];B[bn];W[al];B[am]C[he threatened me, forcing me to take that set of three (not that I minded lol)]
;W[ak];B[an];W[bl]C[we
formalized our defenses here (I may or may not have had to play B8, but I
didn't want to risk losing something I worked so hard for)]
;B[cn];W[ms]C[Now we were just bickering for the last few points]
;B[lr]C[Then,
I had this awesome plan.  I thought, wow I will play F14, forcing him to
play F15, then I will play C14, then he will have to choose between losing
the four below or the two on the left (I was thinking taking E14 and forcing
him to lose the four, but I totally forgot about how F15 would force me to
play forward and lose everything, so that was some bad playing on my part]
;W[ff];B[fe];W[cf];B[ce];W[tt]C[I passed];B[ei]C[but he wanted to keep going]
;W[di]C[so I connected, pretty much forcing him to connect]
;B[em];W[tt]C[I passed];B[nc]C[he played that point];TW[ga]

passed, game over.  If I remember the score correctly it was 97.5 to 105

do these comments, although I GREATLY appreciate taking your time to review
my game, and I hope my comments have helped this process.  I might have been
able to squeeze out a few more points in lower left by forming double eyes,
but I wasn't sure, so I didn't want to risk it.

Thank you,

-You  managed to make back most of your losses near the end but that was mainly due to poor playing on Black's part.

In
order to make your way upwards towards the higher levels, you need to be
able to realize what are reasonable moves and what aren't, and what moves
need to be answered and which don't.

You did horribly on the top left
mainly due to trying to save all your stones and not thinking about how many
points you're actually making.  

Take your time in reading out sequences and learning how to punish bad moves by your opponent.  

It
would probably be a good idea to read a go book like the Lessons in the Fundamentals
of Go as well, since it can cover more ground than I can possibly cover in
this review.

Good luck!])
