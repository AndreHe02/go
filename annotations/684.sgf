C[Rex: Thank you very much for taking the  time to review my game. I played white in  this game, and am 18k on IGS. Aside from  the 3 questions I have asked, could you  comment on 3 other parts of the game  where I could have played better. Thank  you again.

bink: My impression is: Your opening is rather good (compared to other players of
your strength). You got weaknesses in the middlegame and the endgame.
So I didnt give so many comments on the opening.
If you learn to play good form (like avoinding empty triangles), and to avoid  making unnecessary moves, your strength will increase a lot. In this game you got
a big lead early on. In the middle game you did not play the right move to defend  your lead. That allowed black to get close again. In the endgame black could even  have won the game. But black made a lot of very small moves just to feel safer.  This helped you to win at the end.]

;B[pe];W[pf];B[oe]C[bink: Your next move (P14) is not so good. After his best response  (O15) you gain little but you are pushing your oponent along the 5th line.  So you are giving him a lot of territory. I would play F15 here. If black plays  there, he is getting a nice moyo on the upper side. F15 is also threatening the  black stone on F17.]
;W[of];B[ne];W[jq]C[Rex: I believe the standard thinking is that  this should have been on K4, since this is a  high game. Is this correct?
bink: Yes K4 looks better. But the difference is not so big in my eyes and might also be a matter of taste.]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[cd];W[ce];B[bd];W[bc];B[ed];W[de];B[cb];W[db]
;B[ec];W[bb];B[eb];W[ca]C[bink: very good result for white. Black played rather bad.]
;B[nq];W[dj];B[nf];W[oh];B[ff]C[bink: Very good move! Now I think the game is about equal.]
;W[jf]C[Rex: I wanted to reduce the possible black  territory, but I'm not so sure if this was the  right timing. Was it too early?
bink: I think K5 now is much more urgent. With your reducing move you are  not reducing blacks moyo very much. In addition your stone is very weak now.  Black should probably play F12 now and put your stone under much pressure.  While you struggle to escape or live with your stone, black should build influence
to destroy your framework at the left later on.

bink: Here you should strengthen your own framework.
But the question: "Is it better to invade or to work on the own framework" is a
very advanced question with no easy answers.];B[gq];W[eq];B[jp]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[hq]C[bink: Blacks only move is J2 now.];B[io]
;W[hp];B[kq];W[jr];B[kp];W[ho]C[bink: Very good move. What is black going to do against your left side?  If you get the left side, the game is over.]

C[bink: This is not good. Look at the form!  Locally M12 is better. Look at the stones P14/O13/P12. They mean:
If black would play on N13, you get the perfect move N12 (good form).  These 3 stones already control the N-row. There is no need to play a further  stone on the N-row.  Globally this is the wrong area anyway. You force black to make the good move M13, which weakens your weak 3 stones even further.
Your weak three stones look like a burden  for you. You cannot develop your left side (with a nice move like E12)  as this would weaken your three stones.
I guess instead of N13 I would play K12.];B[lg];W[mf];B[me]
;W[jh];B[li];W[re];B[rd];W[gg];B[fg];W[gf];B[ge]C[bink: wrong direction: black should go towards the center (G12) hoping to be able  to destroy parts of your right side.]
;W[he]C[bink: Wrong direction again. G12 is better. Dont worry about the J16/K16 stones.  You can sacrifice them, if black wants them.]
;B[gh];W[hg]C[bink: I see. You want to get eye space, and live with your weak stones.  In general this is not such a good idea. Black will get strong on the outside.
H13 is bad form (empty triangle). H12 is better. (just check out that after  72 H12 neither the black atari at H14 nor the one at H13 is good for black).
Your white group is still in big trouble. A skillfull black player could exploit this dramtically.]

;B[om];W[hm]C[bink: G7 would leave less bad aji behind.];B[hn]
;W[gn];B[gm];W[fm];B[gl];W[fl];B[gk];W[il];B[ll]C[bink: Black should attack your weak central group. That group could easily die.
I would play black K10];W[jj];B[ik];W[jk];B[jl];W[ij];B[hk]
;W[kl];B[jm];W[lk];B[km];W[lj];B[le]C[bink: Bad move! This is like passing.]
;W[ml]C[bink: This area is not so interesting. A strong black player would ignore your move and attack the left side. After you saved your central group you should do something about your left side.]
;B[lm];W[mm];B[mn];W[ei]C[bink: Now you do something for the left side. But F9 would have been the right move.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[cn];W[do];B[ap];W[bq];B[bk];W[bn]
;B[bm];W[ao];B[dk];W[cj];B[fn];W[go];B[fk]C[bink: Here black did fight rather good.
 Now black has chances to win the game again.
The reason: You left the weakness at F9, and black exploited it skillfully.]
;W[dm];B[el];W[em];B[ck];W[bj];B[cm]C[bink: Now the endgame starts. Your next move (D6) is bad. That move is not necessary
to defend yourself. Before you do such a move, ask yourself:  "If I play somewhere else, how could black attack?" You will see: any arttack can be answerd by D6, exept if black plays D6. Then E6 would safe everything.  Resumee: Your move D6 is 1 point in reverse sente. There are far bigger moves
(e.g. S8).
If you learn to avoid moves like D6 you will be several stones stronger.]
;W[dn];B[dl]C[bink: I think black could have won the game by playing S9 now.]
;W[ql];B[rl];W[rk];B[rm];W[nm];B[nn];W[mj]C[bink: Bad form again! You seem to like empty triangles. Why not play N11?
That gives you more points. (Even better is M12)];B[mh];W[kd]
;B[ld];W[nh];B[nc]C[Rex: Why did B play here? Do you know? I  don't see any way for W to  take advantage  of this position?
bink: No. WHite cannot take advantage. Black probably played there for  psychological reasons. If you look at blacks positions:  Everywhere there are very firm  walls and firm connections. It seems black wants to feel 100% safe everywhere.]
;W[ej]C[bink: Now there are only small endgame moves left. End of the comment.]
