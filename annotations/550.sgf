;B[pd];W[dc];B[oq];W[qp]C[ pacoruiz 16k*: nice to meet you]
;B[dp]C[p: I prefer to take another corner rather than to close one.
That's ok];W[pq];B[op];W[qn];B[jq]LB[kp:A]C[This stone is too far away from the stones at P3 and P4.
A proverb says : extend 3 spaces from a 2 stone wall.
A stone at A would be better.];W[gp];B[fq]LB[dn:A]C[This stone is not good.
It asks white to seperate you.
Something like A is better.];W[gq];B[ce]C[p: Maybe I should have played this before]
;W[fd];B[dg];W[cd];B[dl];W[gn];B[jc]C[p:I prefer to gain territory in the side rather to fight with J-5. I think 19 is bigger]
;W[hc];B[je];W[cp];B[cq]LB[co:A]C[Better at A.
let white have a small life in the corner an get the left side egde.]
;W[co];B[bq];W[do];B[ep];W[eo]C[This way black gets a small life in the corner and problems at the left edge.]
;B[qj];W[qc]C[p: not good now
The invasion is ok];B[qd]LB[pc:A]TR[jc][je]C[Wrong direction.
If b playes at A now he gets a large framework together with the marked stones.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]
;W[fp];B[fr];W[dj]C[now the trouble comes up];B[fl];W[fj];B[hl]
;W[ch];B[fg];W[cg];B[ee]C[p: trying to make eye shape and to take more chance to scape]
;W[ed]C[p: bad I think. He should have stop my scape];B[cf]
;W[ck];B[ei];W[ej]LB[cl:A]C[black should keep white seperated here by playing at A.
This way just black has trouble.];B[in]C[p:trying to make a moyo]
;W[cl];B[hj];W[ph]LB[oj:A]C[This invasion looks very deep.
Black has got many stones around it.
A stone at A now would be large trouble for W.];B[qh];W[pj]
;B[ql]LB[pi:A][pg:B]C[Better at A or B to protect some cuts.]
;W[qi];B[ri]C[p:mistake];W[pi]LB[rh:A][rj:B]C[Now black should protect one of the cuts at A or B]
;B[qk];W[rh];B[rj];W[qg]TR[ql][qk][qj][rj][ri]C[This way white easily gets a good shape, and the marked stones
are seperated and get week.];B[ol];W[nk];B[nl];W[mj];B[og]LB[on:A]
C[wrong direction.
The white group is almost alive.
If Black plays at A he gets a framework at the lower side and
the white stones at the lower right side might get in trouble.
This also helps blacks stones at the right side];W[nh];B[ng]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[lg];B[lf];W[li];B[kl]LB[on:A]C[still A is better]
;W[on];B[mo];W[oo];B[no];W[pr];B[or];W[gr];B[eq];W[io];B[jo]
;W[jn];B[ip];W[ho];B[im];W[ml];B[nm]C[p:s-7?
S7 is ok.
But it does not help to live there.
This problem comes from earlier mistakes.];W[mm];B[nn];W[ln]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[kp];W[jp];B[kq];W[hg]C[Now black's stones are scattered on the board.
they all have to live on there own.];B[jh]C[p: sente, because he must save 108]
;W[he];B[gi];W[gg];B[gh];W[ff];B[eh];W[ef];B[df];W[fi]C[p:f12 and cut.]
;B[fh];W[ii];B[ij];W[ji];B[jj];W[kj];B[kk];W[gk];B[hk];W[gl]
;B[ci]C[p: to stole a liberty and meke and eye with 13 and 53]
;W[bi];B[bg];W[bh];B[be];W[bd]C[p: a-13 better];B[af]TR[fl]
[dl]C[p:two eyes. uf

Well, there are two eyes now, but black does just have very few territory.
White got enough points for this e.g. the marked stones.
But there was no good way for black to get out of this after the groups
were seperated.
White is now far ahead and  cannot lose this game.];W[bp];B[dr]

No, you lost because your played stones on the board which did not work together.
If you lock at the board now, you do have 5 groups of stones. (not counted the ones
that are dead)
White just has got 3 groups. This makes it much easier to play.
You should think earlier about seperating your opponent and making your own
stones work together.

I hope this review helps a little.])
