C[JPL: Hi there.  I'm an 8k player, have been playing a long time.  I'll do my best here.]
;B[pd]C[jdb [?\]: hello
heresiarch [18k\]: hi.];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[cd]LB[fc:6]
[cd:4][dd:A][ce:2][de:1][cf:3][df:5]C[heresiarch [18k\]: good luck!
jdb [?\]: You too

JPL: This is a non-standard joseki response to the invasion.  It results in some very heavy play.

The standard joseki I usually see is as numbered.  That is, black approaches with 1, and your response is at 2, underneath 1 as shown.

Sometimes black will respond at A instead of 3, but your response is still to play at 4.]
;B[dd];W[fc];B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[db];B[ce];W[bd];B[be];W[bb]
C[JPL: You secured the corner, but black has built a solid wall that haunts you later.]
;B[fd];W[dh]C[JPL: Interesting move.];B[cn];W[co]LB[ck:A][dk:B]
[fp:C][fq:D]C[JPL: Joseki sugests either a pincer in at A or B -- which works well with your stone at D12 -- or a slide at C or D.

I think the pincer works well here, although I usually avoid pincers.]
;B[cj];W[ci];B[bi];W[bh];B[di];W[ch];B[bj]LB[fd:C][ce:B][ch:A]
C[JPL: Your stones at A are very heavy.  You've counter-balanced black at B, but I don't think this was a fair exchange.  Black's stone at C helps to hem you in, so I think he's ahead in this area.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[pq]LB[qn:3][pp:1][kq:6][nq:2][pq:A][qq:5][pr:4]
C[JPL: Another non-standard response.  Consider Q2  The standard sequence to attacking the star point would be as numbered.

Your stone A in contact with 1 is an in-your-face attack.];B[qq]
;W[kp];B[qr];W[op];B[po];W[oo]LB[oo:A][dp:D][kp:C][pq:B][or:E]
[pr:F]C[JPL: A is a very small, heavy move.  It doesn't really put any pressure on black, but it leaves your stone at B still vulnerable.  You're trying for center strength -- but you have strength with stones at C and D.

Instead, A play now at E or F would strengthen your wall more than A did.

Working for center influence is good, but securing your wall is important, too.]
;B[or];W[oq];B[nr];W[pr];B[ps];W[mr];B[os]LB[mq:A]C[JPL: You still have a vulnerability at A.  Depending on what happens, black could use this to make real trouble later.]
;W[ic]C[JPL: This isn't bad at all.];B[on]LB[oo:A]C[JPL: Black just negated the strength of your earlier play at A.]
;W[nc]LB[ic:A]C[JPL: Another solid move.  It puts pressure on the corner and works well with A.]
;B[ne];W[od]LB[pb:B][ld:C][od:A][he:D]C[JPL: Black made a non-standard response to your invasion, but A doesn't really make you stronger.

If you want to play over here, I like B, C or D better.];B[oe]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[qj];B[rf];W[rg];B[se];W[ph];B[pk]
;W[nh]C[JPL: Center influence again, but your entire right side is still very weak with numerous diagonal relationships that are easily exploited.]
;B[qg];W[pf];B[rh];W[qh];B[sg]C[Note that not-quite bamboo joint well. It comes back to haunt me later.]
;W[pe];B[mo]LB[oo:A]C[JPL: Another move to destroy the power of A.]
;W[mp];B[oc];W[nd];B[ob];W[pc];B[qd]C[this was just poor reading on my part. I was hoping to catch the top of his formation against the wall, but I screwed it up.]
;W[pb];B[nb];W[mb];B[mc];W[md]C[Not sure why I did this - O19 is clearly better. This sequence costs me a fair amount.

JPL: Because your stones at O16 were in atari.];B[lc];W[ld]
;B[lb];W[kc];B[qc];W[kb]C[JPL: Although the moves at Q17 and Q18 were mistakes, the rest of the sequence worked out okay for you.  You have HUGE influence into the center.  A few stones carefully played could be worth 50 points at this point.]
;B[ma];W[ka]LB[kd:A]C[JPL: If you wanted strength here, then protect the cut at A instead.]
;B[qb];W[la];B[mb];W[mf]C[JPL: Compare what came out of this.  Black got the corner that he should have gotten anyway.  You each end up capturing a few stones.  But your influence into the center is huge.]
;B[ei]LB[ch:A]C[JPL: Black just said "I'm capturing the 4 stones at A."]
;W[gq]LB[ch:A]C[At this point, I was feeling pretty good. I had the S-SW wall reasonably well covered. I'd maintained good influence out of the fight in the top right, without giving up too much territory. I had a decent corner in the NW, and a not horrible chance of connecting the C12 group to the north corner via the center.

JPL: And you just said, "Okay, but I'm taking the lower side."

Personally, I think that's a good trade for you.  You can use the threat of rescuing A to make huge center territory.]
;B[eh]C[JPL: Black accepts your trade.];W[ig]LB[pk:A]C[JPL: And you say "Cool.  I'll just make some nice center territory here and use it later to put pressure on your stones near A."]
;B[ii]C[JPL: Black says, "Oh oh."];W[hh]LB[gh:A][kh:C][ii:B]
[pk:D]C[JPL: I don't like this move.  The knights move at A makes me feel a little better.  But you can use this stone to put pressure on B -- which you could use later with a stone at C -- which puts more pressure on j11 while aiming at more pressure near D.]
;B[hi]C[JPL: Black comes out stronger than you do.  Those diagonal relationships you like will haunt you.]
;W[gh];B[gi];W[fi]LB[fg:C][gh:A][fi:B][li:D]C[JPL: Another diagonal non-connection.  I liked your play at A, but not the play at B.  I think B could have been better played at C or D.]
;B[fj];W[fh]LB[fh:B][fi:A]C[JPL: You gave up sente with A, as it required B to make it live.]
;B[ej];W[eg]C[Got too excited about that connection possibility, and didn't read this out.

JPL: I admit, this is a very tempting play.  But you can use it to secure the center.

However, I think all the stones you played from H12 and further left were wasted.  the didn't have a chance to secure territory for you, yet they gave black a really nice wall across the center.]
;B[dg];W[df];B[cg];W[cf];B[bg]C[Another poor read...];W[ah]
;B[ef];W[ki];B[kj];W[jj]LB[jj:A][mj:B][en:D][kn:C]C[JPL: You ask in another move or so if you were making a cocky move.  You asked too late.  A is cocky.  I like B.  And I REALLY like C or D.]
;B[ji];W[gj]C[This was probably cocky on my part?];B[hj];W[gk]
;B[jk];W[il]LB[gk:A]C[JPL: This actually looks interesting.  If you can connect your stones near A to the lower side, you should be able to develop some territory.  Press against the left side, then put pressure on the right.]
;B[jl];W[kn]LB[il:C][jn:B][kn:A]SQ[lo]C[JPL: A is too late now.  You're trying to kill black.  B is much nicer, as it works with C and isn't in danger from a peek at the square.]
;B[km];W[ln]LB[jn:B][ln:A]C[JPL: Now you're REALLY trying to kill black, but you're playing into his hands -- giving him very solid strength without adding much for yourself.  You gain about 6 points, but he gains huge on the right side.

Instead of A, I like B.];B[lm];W[mn];B[mm];W[em]LB[em:C][jm:A]
[in:B]C[Should I have played this at A instead? I thought about it at the time, but figured I could defend against A at B. I remember thinking specifically about him snaking in through there, and figuring it wouldn't get very far. Oops.

How much would I lose by not having the stone at e7? That was looking like prime black territory to me.

JPL: Certainly not at A.  What good is that cut?  You arent going to kill black, so cutting doesn't help you.

A play at B now wouldn't be horrible, but your play at C is nice and probably does a lot more for you.

However, you have left a lot of room for black to invade near A and B.  A play at A is going to be bad for you though -- too easy to attack.]
;B[im]LB[el:B][gm:A][ho:C]TR[gj][gk][il]C[JPL: At this point, you need to decide what you want.  Black just said, "You aren't rescuing your stones and building territory at the same time."

So you have to pick.

If you want to rescue, then you play around A or B, something like that.

If you want territory, then you play around C -- threatening to rescue while building a bigger lower side.

A would probably rescue your stones and also threatens serious damage to blacks left side.  Which may leave you the chance to play at C as well, rescuing your diamond-marked stones AND building a big lower side.]
;W[jn]LB[hl:A]C[JPL: But this move is VERY heavy.

Black responds heavy, too.  I'd have played A as black.];B[jm]
;W[hn];B[hm]LB[hn:A]C[How might I have handled this sequence better?

JPL: Decide if you are rescuing, attacking the left side, or building lower territory.

You can use threats of doing one to make sure you accomplish the other.

But A wasn't bad.];W[hl]TR[il]C[JPL: Again, either resuce your stones or build territory.  Your diamond stone could be sacrificed for some big territory gains.]
;B[gm];W[fl];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[en];B[fo];W[fp];B[eo];W[do]
;B[dn]LB[gk:A]TR[il]C[JPL: You tried to rescue AND build territory.

You could probably have rescued the stones at A if you had let the diamond stone die.]
;W[dm]C[Another questionable read.];B[bn];W[cm];B[bl];W[bm]
;B[am];W[ao];B[in];W[go];B[an];W[bo];B[al];W[gd];B[fe];W[ge]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[kh];W[kg]LB[li:A]TR[ki]C[JPL: Good.  It would have been tempting to try to save the diamond stone at A, but your play is better.]
;B[li];W[nj]LB[lg:A][nj:B]TR[fl][bm][cm][dm][em][en]C[JPL: A first.

You have a lot of vulnerabilities you need to protect.  You're trying to prevent black at B.

If you hadn't lost all those diamond stones, you'd be way ahead right now.]
;B[lg];W[lf];B[jg];W[kf];B[jf];W[je]C[JPL: See?  Black just ate a ton of territory.]
;B[if];W[ie];B[jh];W[he]LB[he:A][mg:B][pg:E][pj:D][rl:C]C[JPL: I don't think you needed A yet, but maybe you read something I didn't see.

You can afford to take any of B through E now.];B[mg];W[ng]
;B[ni];W[mi]LB[oi:A]C[JPL: Greedy.  A instead.];B[oi];W[mh]
;B[lh];W[mj];B[oj];W[pj];B[ok];W[rl];B[rk];W[qk];B[rj];W[ri]
;B[si];W[qm];B[pg]LB[of:A]TR[pf]SQ[oe]C[heresiarch [18k\]: nice.

This was death.

JPL: You needed to play at A at this point.  The sequence forward isn't that bad.  Your stones pushing into black prevent the right side being very big.

Playing at A keeps diamoned alive, square dead.  The game looks a lot better for you that way.]
;W[og]C[I was counting on that whole group down there being alive to keep vast chunks of territory out of his hands. It doesn't work out like that after that cut.]
;B[of];W[nf];B[oh]C[Dum dum dum...];W[nn]C[JPL: Small move, but helps prevent trouble.]
;B[nm];W[om]C[I'm hoping here that I can pull some sort of tesuji here. That group around P11 only has four liberties right now - might I be able to nab it?]
;B[pn];W[nk]C[jdb [?\]: thanks :)
heresiarch [18k\]: got cocky with the bamboo joints - forgot that they're useless with a stone already in them
heresiarch [18k\]: likely cost me the game there
jdb [?\]: :):)
jdb [?\]: This is a _very_ interesting game :)
heresiarch [18k\]: too bad there's been no ko - that would be interesting
jdb [?\]: There's still time for that :)
heresiarch [18k\]: indeed


This was stupid, too, though I can't see a way to pull out a save of those stones.]
;B[ol];W[nl]C[heresiarch [18k\]: weird
heresiarch [18k\]: sorry about that
jdb [?\]: no worries!];B[lk];W[pm];B[qi];W[qp]C[a waste on my part...

JPL: Several stones played over here were wasted.  But when you're behind, you have to try things.]
;B[rp];W[ml];B[ll];W[lj]C[Another stupid move, better to cap off that dragon's head. That cost me another 5 points.]
;B[io];W[ip];B[ho];W[gp];B[hp];W[hq];B[jp];W[iq];B[jo];W[jq]
;B[ko];W[lo];B[fg];W[ec];B[ed];W[gg];B[ff]C[Now mostly just cleanup - the damage has been done already.]
;W[ms]C[jdb [?\]: watch your time!];B[qs];W[ad]C[jdb [?\]: phew!]
;B[ae]C[heresiarch [18k\]: indeed];W[me];B[ih];W[hg];B[ns];W[lq]
;B[ep];W[eq]C[jdb [?\]: forgot that one :)];B[mk];W[ke]TW[ap]

[is][js][ks][ls]TB[pe][re][pf][qf][sf][rg][sh][ki][kk][kl]C[jdb [?\]: I think that's it...

JPL: I read this very lightly, but I think your last play wasn't necessary.

I have a few general comments:

1. Be careful about diagonal "connections".  You seem to like them, but they haunt you over and over in this game."

2. Study some of the joseki.  It'll help.

3. Don't try to kill so hard.

4. If you push against your opponent to make him stronger, make sure you're getting something out of the deal, too.  You tend to push hard on your opponent, encouraging him to shore up his defenses, but you aren't strengthening yourself or building territory while you do it.

5. Make a conscious decision what your goal is.  If you want to rescue stones, you need to understand you'll be giving your opponent something to get your stones back.  If you want territory, you'll be letting your opponent live or giving up stones you might have been able to rescue.  You won't usually be able to do two big things at the same time.

6. Remember what I said about killing?  Kill-races MUST be won, so you MUST read them very carefully or else avoid them.  Personally, I tend to avoid them, cause I hate reading that hard.

All in all, I think you played well for your level.  I think the diagonal connections were a big part of what did you in.

A big help for me was to think about my goals.  Don't just make plays, but think about what the goal of my plays will be.  Where do I want territory?  Where will I allow my opponent to be strong?  I think when I started to turn those questions into a conscious decision process, I gained five stones.]

heresiarch [18k\]: very nice job

jdb [?\]: Thanks! You too...
jdb [?\]: It was CLOSE until the end I think.

heresiarch [18k\]: that would have been a delta of like 20 points
jdb [?\]: I agree. That was a big swing

jdb [?\]: I left those stones there because I hoped they would come into play again.
