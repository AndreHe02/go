RE[W+R]

C[SE -This is a game I lost on IGS.  My questions and notes are labelled SE (for sloweddie).  I thought I got off to a good start in this game, but I went wrong early in the middle game.  I'm unsure whether my mistakes were mainly stategic or tactical (or both).  Any help you could give me on those points would be greatly appreciated. - sloweddie

DC - Hi my name is Dylan Carter, I am 7k IGS and 5k BGA. I hope my review will be of use to you.]

(;B[pj]C[DC - The Sanren-sei fuseki, emphasizing influence and rapid development. Niren-sei is a popular alternative and follows the 'good openning principle' more closely. Which is to play in the empty corners first then make a corner enclosure or corner approach.]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[DC - It is a matter of style; but I believe black can keep the game simple without applying a pincer and obtain a favourable result.]
;W[pb]C[DC -This is a mistake by  white, the correct option is to invade 3-3 directly (giving you the moyo you are looking to develop with the sanren-sei fuseki) or jump out (denying you a moyo).]

(;B[qc]C[DC - See Var for moyo development and punishing W mistake. With the san san reply you are saying 'No, I'm not giving up the corner']
;W[ne]C[DC - White replies 'ok, i'll take your moyo away'];B[qf]
C[DC - Some joseki confusion here ; )];W[kd]C[DC - You let white flatten your moyo.]
;B[kc];W[ld]
(;B[ic]C[DC - Too submissive, the white group is not settled use this to build influence toward the 3-4 W corner stone. If possible always 'raise your head'.]

C[DC - If you want to pincer the white group because your group is settled play h3, it is still difficult to attack but you may gain thickness toward you sanrn-sei moyo.]
;W[nq]C[DC - K4 looks  a little awkward now. Attack the strong group then come back for O3 stone.]

(;B[oq]C[DC - Personnaly I don't like this approach for it gives white good shape. It is used often.]

C[SE- At this point I think I'm doing pretty well, but I clearly lost the thread of the game pretty fast after this.  My problem is that I'm not sure exactly where or how.  My next move attempt to spit and attack the two lower white groups, but instead I wound up getting clobbered.  Was my strategy misguided or just my tactics?

DC - Kill the White group on the right = 17 pts.]
(;B[jq]C[DC - Is this the correct direction? Does cutting the two live groups make a difference now?]

(;B[en]C[SE - A pretty bad move I think now.  This is just a waste of time that strengthens his lower right corner.  So what should I have done here?

DC - Settle the centre group. Var N2 should do it. Don't attach against weak stones]
;W[fl]
(;B[em];W[fm];B[kk];W[lk];B[jl];W[kj];B[km];W[jk];B[lm]C[DC - Try not to permit a ponnuki on the board it is said to be worth 30 points due to strength of shape. Difficult in this case.]
;W[nm];B[ml];W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[nn]C[SE - A bad read on my part and too greedy.  I think I need to play P 10.  Or should I have played it instead of O9?]

C[The games we play often contain many mistakes in strategy, our only hope is that our mistakes are reduced in future games from what we have learned. To this avail I have placed four main mistakes I believe where made during the game.

1st mistake - Complicating the game early on
2nd mistake - A slightly inconsistent plan in making a moyo type fuseki then inviting white to run through it.
3rd mistake - Allowing W to run through moyo when W made the mistake of trying to live small.
4th mistake - Not reading the W Group on the right as dead. the nakade shape is marked.

My advice is to learn to recognise and make the nakade shapes and read your opponents moves and intentions more thoroughly. Ask yourself, first what does your opponent want from the situation, and explore what you can achieve that will exceed that which you have given to your opponent.

Good luck for the future,
