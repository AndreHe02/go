;B[qp];W[pe];B[co];W[pm];B[oq];W[dl]LB[pc:a][dc:b]C[DRS: On the left, W has made a 6 space extension, and on the right, a 7 space.  To me this says "play into the overwide extension".  What do you think?

PC: A reasonable idea. It looks like White's play is to tempt you into playing moves like 'a' (Q17) and 'b' (D17) so that he can build some influence facing down the sides and make the extensions look reasonable.]
;B[qg]LB[pi:a]C[Invading here is that White gets to play a combined extension and pincer from his weak stone. A move like 'a' (Q11) would give White a more difficult choice of where to answer.]

(;B[od]LB[re:a][nc:b]C[You're behind in a pushing battle and this move does nothing to get you ahead, allowing White to follow up with the double hane. I'd start with 'a' (S15) to increase my liberties and then play 'b' (see the variation on the previous move).]
;W[nd];B[nc];W[mc]
(;B[md]LB[re:a][mb:b]C[You had a choice of two ataris here, and since it's not obvious which one you want to play it's best to leave them both unplayed for the moment. I'd play 'a' (S15) and then 'b' (N18) without playing either atari - see the variation on the previous move.]
;W[ne];B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[kc];B[re];W[rf];B[rd];W[qf]C[DRS: Shut in, but a big corner in exchange.  Good trade?

PC: The corner should end up being worth something close to 20 points, so White will need around 40 points to compete with your three corners. That doesn't look unlikely given the strength and influence of the White position - my feeling is that White's ahead here.]
;B[cg]LB[kb:a][jc:b]C[You need to push once more at 'a' (L18), which White will answer at 'b' (K17) before playing elsewhere. While you don't want to crawl along the second line any further than necessary, you do want to crawl far enough that White can't turn (at 'a') in sente and put himself in a position to make territory on the top edge as well as the right and the centre.

"Crawl far enough that your opponent can't turn in sente" is a pretty good rule of thumb for this sort of position.]
;W[nb];B[oc];W[kb]
(;B[ob]LB[dj:a]C[An interesting question (to which I don't have a definitive answer) is whether this move is big enough to play right now, instead of 'a' (D10) for example. If you play 'a' and White plays P18, your corner will be about 10 points; your move increases it to 16 points. Also, if White captures the two stones he gets an extra 4 points plus another (almost certainly) at L19. That makes an 11 point swing in total, which is about half a move's worth. However, if White captures the two stones then the group on the top edge goes from being strong to being almost invulnerable. That means White will be able to play more aggressively if you play on the top edge, plus it means that pulling out your cutting stone at N16 can only be an attack on the White wall to its right rather than a splitting attack on both that group and the top edge group. All that probably adds up to the extra half a move's worth of points.]
;W[bf]C[DRS: I never know what to do with this kind of move.]
;B[dj]C[That looks like a pretty good answer. Note that the White corner is still invadable, so White will need to add another move to make any territory there.]
;W[bg];B[ci];W[bh]LB[ek:a]C[You could ignore this move and continue your attack on the lone White stone with 'a' (E9). If White wants to spend a move pushing through and cutting off a single stone, let him.]

LB[fb:a][bd:b]C[DRS: Was there a way to make this live without ko?

PC: 'a' (F18) and 'b' (B16) looks promising - see the variations. 'b' looks like the best bet to me.]

;B[ah];W[aj];B[ba];W[fh];B[di];W[aa];B[on]C[Good idea: if you haven't got any particularly big threats, play moves you want to play anyway and get two of them in a row.]
;W[ad]
(;B[jp]LB[om:a]C[This almost feels like playing in your own territory. I'd play 'a' (P7), which is a junction beteween the two moyos. Compare what happens if White plays there now (variation on this move) against what happens if you play there (variation on the previous move) and both sides simply try to turn their moyos into territory. The sequences shown are a bit simplistic,as the losing side wouldn't go along with the plan, but they do show how big a difference moves like 'a' can make.]

(;W[pp]
(;B[op];W[po];B[oo];W[pn];B[nl]LB[pq:a]C[Note that 'a' (Q3)  is very large - I estimate it makes a difference of about 25 points just on territory, plus it also gives eye space to whichever side gets it. You should look to play it as soon as possible.]
;W[ll]MA[gm][hn][io][kp][lp][mp][no][hg][if][jf][kf][le][me]
C[DRS: I'm especially fuzzy on how to handle moyos, so comments here are particularly welcome.

PC: One very useful thing to do is to count the territory and use that to decide how much you need from your moyo. Here, I estimate:

Black:
  top right: 16 points
  bottom edge: 65 points
  bottom right: 7 points
  total: 88 points

White:
  top left: 60 points
  right edge: 20 points
  total: 80 points

I've marked the rough boundaries that I'm assuming as safe territory. The Black bottom right and White right edge estimates are averages of Black playing Q3 and White playing it.

So you'll need to keep White from increasing his territory by more than 10 points more than you. If you just defend your moyo, say by playing M6, I think this will be difficult - it's easier for White to expand his centre than it is for you. So you need to play more aggresively and attack the White stone, aiming to trash the White centre in the process. Alternatively, you could take the chance to play Q3, which would leave White needing to increase his centre territory by about 25 points.]
;B[mj]C[A good start.];W[kj];B[lh];W[ln]LB[pq:a]C[If you play some forcing moves and then answer this at 'a', the game looks very close - see the variation.]

(;B[ji];W[lp]LB[pq:a]C[Another good chance to play 'a' (Q3) - your wall doesn't have any eye space to the left any more and is not securely connected out, so that's another good reason to play it.]

(;B[ql]LB[qk:a][rj:b]C[With hindsight, it's probably better to play 'at 'a' (R9) to avoid the annoying atari at 'b' (S10) that White gets later. I still don't see a way for White to get two eyes - see the variation on the previous move.]
