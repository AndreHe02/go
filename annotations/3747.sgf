C[This is a live tournament game, so the record is incomplete.
  I'm playing black.

[EV\] This is your reviewer Eric Vella.  My comments will be marked by [EV\].]

C[I didn't feel like playing the hiraki to A, as wB would have seemed too good. True, I would have had a moyo of my own, but I dislike moyo games.]
;B[lq];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn]
;B[pn]LB[nq:A]C[This push is to reduce the aji of the A stone. Is it okay, or is it more of an ajikeshi?

[EV\] This push is never seen in professional games, unless B or W already has a stone around R10.  Pushing from behind gives W solid territory and eliminates aji.  Before this push, B has at least three options in this area: Q6 push (your move), P7 center development (threatening R7 clamp), R8 side development (threatening S5 invasion).  These moves are all more-or-less sente, and their aji constrains W play on the side.  Finally, if W just gives up the A stone, your area here is over-concentrated.]
;W[qm];B[dq]LB[np:A]C[I felt somewhat uncomfortable with this getting shut in. As the O3 aji is quite grave without any helping stones along the bottom. Plain A would seem too pathetic. What should I have played instead?

[EV\] This move is fine.  Certainly playing A is much too cautious, even without the Q6-R7 exchange.  You might also consider entering the corner at C3.  Most continuations will give W a wall facing your M3 stone, limiting the usefulness of the wall.]
;W[fp];B[co];W[cn];B[cp];W[dn];B[fr];W[dj];B[pj]LB[qc:A]C[White took his fair share of the moyo, so I wanted some too. Still, whites invasion to A is now natural. Are there options for this? Just closing off the corner sounds boring.

[EV\] What is the strategy behind this move?  It does not make side territory (W can still slide in to S10) and I don't see any center moyo for either side.  I think playing in the corner first is best.  A move around R14 would be simple and good.  With the W stone at R7 poking out, the right side has little potential.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[[EV\] Good, this is the correct side to block.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]
;W[ge]C[[EV\] Good W move -- focal point of two moyos.];B[ij]
LB[hc:A][gj:B]C[Quite selfevident moyo -move. I was rather comfortable with invasions around A as I still had C17 weakness to abuse.

But yet, wB does seem very very nice. Would there have been better way to reduce white moyo, but still build our own?

[EV\] This move seems a little loose, but that might just be my perception.  If W defends at B and both sides consolidate their moyos, the game still seems even.  Letting W cut off the F17 stone is very big, so defending at H16 or jumping into C17 immediately would also be good.]
;W[hd];B[ic]C[I wanted to close some of the top in sente. Would there have been a better move as this sequence left too much aji?

[EV\] You should jump into the corner first and see how that area develops.]
;W[hc];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[cd];B[bb];W[bc];B[cb];W[je];B[ke]
LB[kd:A]C[This didn't feel too good. But bA would have abused to wall I had. Painful.]
;W[kf]C[Nice.];B[ie];W[jf];B[id];W[kd];B[le];W[if];B[kc];W[he]
;B[fj];W[lf];B[me]LB[kd:A]C[I guess I should have captured A, left too much aji.]
;W[kp]C[[EV\] This is an interesting move.  It would be a very nice forcing move if B answered at L3 or M4, which W probably expected.  But W seems a little ahead at this point, so I don't think such a forceful move is needed.]
;B[hp]LB[kp:A]C[I wanted to cut A off and build some thickness towards whites moyo on the left. It seems quite open and invadable.

[EV\] Good.];W[nr];B[np];W[hk];B[hj];W[kj];B[ik]C[[EV\] Thick but slow.  How about G9 for better eye shape (plus D9 threat)?  Or maybe H8 or even K8?  Something which makes better use of your H4 investment.]
;W[ho];B[kk]C[[EV\] I think you should resist at the bottom with J5.  The fight is complicated but fairly even, so you would still have good winning chances.  Taking time out for this defensive move loses too much at the bottom.]
;W[io];B[qo]C[[EV\] Bad exchange, losing B liberties.];W[ro]
;B[lj]C[Plan foiled.

[EV\] Overly defensive I think.  To compete territorially, you need to reduce the W left side, not just save this group.  D9 may not work immediately, but you could try to set it up by attacking the bottom around G7.  Or you could take a big move like M4 or Q1, which defends the center group indirectly by fixing weaknesses.]
;W[os];B[mq]C[[EV\] Too thin, as you later discover.  I guess you were looking forward to S6 at this point, so you wanted to take a W liberty with N3, rather than just defending safely at N4.  Sometimes you can accomplish both objectives in a position like this by changing the order of moves.  Suppose you cut at S6 first as a probe, forcing W to respond before you decide between N3 and N4?  If W captures at S7, then the corner is short on liberties, so you can play N3.  If instead W captures at S3, then there is no play against the corner, so you can defend solidly at N4, and you still have the aji of the S6 stone for later.]
;W[ki];B[gp]C[[EV\] This just helps W strengthen his stones.  Don't play forcing moves like this if you cannot continue with the cut.  You lose a lot of the D9 aji by strengthening W here.]
;W[go]C[I suppose this sequence was played too early. I should have defended the center groups. Perhaps even the losing move?]
;B[fq];W[mp]C[[EV\] This is a serious cut.  I think B has to lose something big now.]
;B[mr]C[Didn't read this to the bitter end. Noticed too late that R6 isn't too easy to capture.]
;W[ns];B[ps];W[qs];B[ms];W[ps];B[rn];W[rp];B[rm]C[[EV\] This is too complicated for me!  Both sides are risking the game in the continuation.  I think W could win more simply by cutting at M8 now, or by playing N5 and L3.]
;W[ql];B[rl];W[qk];B[rk];W[qj];B[ri];W[kq];B[mo];W[lp];B[ol]
C[[EV\] This does not look like enough to win.  Try for a bigger capture while protecting the center with M8 or M9.]
;W[qi];B[rh];W[lk];B[mj]C[[EV\] The center group is too weak for you to afford playing on this side.  L8 seems necessary.]
;W[jk];B[il];W[kl]C[[EV\] Too good for W.  The game should be over now, even if the B center group manages to live.]
;B[di];W[ei];B[ej];W[dk];B[fi];W[eh];B[fn];W[fo];B[hh];W[ib]
C[Very painful.];B[jc];W[kb];B[lc];W[om];B[pm];W[pl];B[nm];W[ok]
;B[nl];W[nj];B[ni];W[mk];B[nk];W[oj];B[oi]C[I don't understand why did white play this sequence. I think he should have sacrificed those few stones and only threatened to save them. Or did I miss something?]
;W[fl];B[jm];W[kn];B[jn]C[I entered on byo-yomi here, so I ceased recording the game. Basicly I managed to connect through L7 and finally lost by 7.5 points.

[EV\] Looks like W can prevent any connection (with M6 for instance) and likely kill the center group, but B is behind even if it lives.]
