C[Hello,

My main concern is the fighting at the bottom and how I could have played it better. I'm interested in the early fighting and how I should have approached it in the first place. I don't feel that I accomplished much during all the fighting.

I'm most interested in the direction of play in the opening and middle game, and would like to know how to think about the moves I make, ie. the purpose of a move.

Thank you for reviewing my game.

;B[qm];W[jp]C[chimchim: This seemed to work well with the star point and act as a pincer. Would jumping out with P8 be better? I didn't feel I needed to run out with the P6 group yet, as there was not much pressure on it. Maybe R3 to help settle the P6 group.

Olaf: i think you are right. You have several moves to deal with the P6-group. running out at P8, capping at N6, make a base with R3 and/or N3, so there is no need to take one of them immidiatly. In my eyes you found a very nice move. :-)]
;B[kp]
(;W[ko]C[chimchim: I wasn't sure of the right direction or correct technique here. I felt I needed to respond to B in order to keep the pressure on. A play in the upper left seems possible, though.
olaf: i think its a matter of technique here. You want to keep on the pressure, but actually you are left with a cutting-point on the left side. Aiming at this cut black can get stability more easy.]
;B[lo];W[kq];B[lp];W[jo];B[lm];W[mn];B[ln];W[nl];B[mm];W[nm]
;B[fq]C[chimchim: Not sure how to handle this move. Try to enclose it or push it out into the center? What would be best to coordinate with the stones to the right?

olaf: Would you prefer to take a risk, then push it out. you both will get 2 weak groups each running out into the center. A hugh fight will result.
would you prefer to play safe and calm, then enclose it. You will get influence while black will get around 5 points for a small life. But there still will be a fight around the M6- and P6-groups. For that fight a stable position + the influence on the right would favor you a bit in that fight. So i would prefer to enclose here. :-)]
;W[eq];B[iq];W[jq];B[gp];W[ho];B[go]
(;W[hp]C[olaf: i would extend into the center here. first it costs you a liberty. That could become critical later. Second you are slow. Instead try to be as fast as possible to be always one step ahead of your opponent.]

(;B[pq];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr];B[qo];W[rr]C[olaf: offers another possibility for black.]

;B[qe];W[jj]C[chimchim: I felt the O10 group was relatively safe now. I felt pressing from the weak side would be better. How about pressuring at M11 instead?

olaf:  first, you are right with the O10 group. Next you are right with the conclusion that K10 would be better then M11 (at least in my eyes ;-))
now the next questions: which group(s) to attack. There are 2 weak black groups. You cant hope to kill them, but what can you gain from the attack? One possibiliy in this situation: first attack the right group and get enough strength for the own center group. Then attack th left group and gaining the territory on the left edge while black steps throu neutreal area. If this is your plan bhind K10, it is exactly the right move.]
;B[li];W[nh];B[lg];W[fr];B[gr];W[fp];B[gq]
(;W[er]C[olaf: risky. you try to kill black, but if it fails you has nothing but a weak group in the center. This is not consistent with your other moves here.]
;B[eo]
(;W[fo];B[fn];W[ep];B[hn];W[in];B[dn]C[olaf: and now? where is the territory on the left? Now its black, who get some strength and who ever is stronger (less attackable in some way) will dominate the fight in the center.]
;W[hm];B[gn];W[em];B[en];W[ce]C[chimchim: Right time to move in the corner? No group seemed easy to attack so I took a big point.
olaf: moving into the corner is big.];B[bp];W[co];B[cn];W[bo]
;B[bn];W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[bm];W[cq];B[gm];W[hl];B[gl];W[hk]
;B[dj]C[olaf: bad mistake in the direction. Blacks group is strong already and this stone violates the rule not playing near strong positions. An alternative would be to play around E16.]

(;W[ch]C[Same mistake as blacks last move.];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj]
;W[di];B[cj];W[dh]C[olaf: dont you feel that C15 is to narrow to this position now and the corner to wide open at the same time?]

But during the fight you got confunsed about the goals of the fight and consequently black gots a good result in the lower left. 
I hope my comments, questions and variations are some kind of help. Please feel free to ask if i was not clear enough at some points and of corse take in mind that i am not a good player by myself.

Happy playing

(;W[jo]C[olaf: if you want to attack the two stones, then simple extend. The reason is, it doesn't leave any weaknesses in your own shape. The attachment (L4) was played to stabilize the weak stone. In contact-play both side get stable in most of the cases. K5 holds up the pressure best.]
