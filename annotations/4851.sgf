C[Dear Jaakko,

I am happy to look at the game for you, indeed I can not say that there are no big mistakes, but I will help you find them and show you where you made big strategy mistakes.

Balladeer


Dear reviewer,

I played white in this game and lost by 0.5 points. Overall I was quite satisfied with my play and fail to spot any big mistakes in it, which is obviously a problem since my game is lightyears away from perfect. I would like your advice as to what moves were bad and what should I pay more attention to. Any comments would be more than welcome.

Thank you for your time and advice!

-Jaakko];B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp]
(;B[cn]C[Jaakko: Is this approach reasonable? I could have gone in (P4 or the like), but I felt it is not urgent to invade.


Balladeer: There is not really a matter of invading yet, with so much open territory, this is a very normal move, a lot of other things are possible also...
I added some very normal moves, and those aren't even all of them, but this is fine, just do what you feel you like]
;W[cl];B[fq]C[Possible];W[dn]
(;B[cq]C[Jaakko: Is this move OK? Wanted to establish a base quickly and even if white can shut me in the corner, I thought the bottom side would still be open enough for me to go there later, especially when there's a black stone at F3.

Balladeer: This is possible, there are 2 main variations here, one is play 3-3 right now, the other is cutting first, see variation.
When you play 3-3, you are giving white a wall in return for the corner, which is a possibility]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[do]
(;B[dr]C[This leaves a lot of cutting points, so you would like to play something else here, see variation]

(;W[bn]C[Jaakko: Here white did not play along with my plan.

Balladeer: Off course not, that would be giving you too much, since you leave all these cutting points... Letting white cut here is too big, since you cant save B5 and connect to F3, so you have to let B5 go, which does not make you happy.]

(;B[cr]C[Jaakko: Got a more or less stable group anyway there, but I'm not sure if this result is good for black. Seems white got too much influence in return.

Ball: Right]
(;W[bp]C[Too slow! White was allready very solid, here you get off easy, white could tenuki and you would have a move less than in the game.]

(;B[op]C[Jaakko: Would extension from F3 be better? As it happened, white pincer landed me in all sorts of trouble. Perhaps one strong group would have been better than two weak ones? I was afraid of white getting big corner, but perhaps that concern was not reasonable.

Balladeer: I think both is possible, but I would prefer to extend from F3, because you are not alive yet. If white plays at H3, you have to answer at B3 or you might get killed, or at least be left with no eyes, so I woul play J3 instead here. See variation]
;W[mq];B[no];W[oq]C[Jaakko: This caught me by surprise and the results were rather appalling for black.

Ball: This move isn't possible for white ussually, see variation]

(;B[pp]C[Jaakko:This must be a bad move.

Ball: Yup...];W[pq];B[qo];W[rp]C[Jaakko: Well, now white got the corner anyway and I have a very bad shape there. Fixing it in one move seems impossible, so decided to tenuki and hope it survives if white chooses to attack it.

Ball: I feel it is better to spend a move, since white still has H3 also, you can not leave too many weaknesses....]

(;B[od]
(;W[ro]C[Jaakko: This play seems rather soft by white.

Ball: Yes, white should play outside];B[qn]C[Ball: Now black is a lot stronger, thanks white!]
;W[hq];B[bq]C[Jaakko: Too slow?

Ball: No, this is necessary, but not nice, that's why it was better to play J3 earlier]
;W[ql]C[Good move, but better earlier];B[qi]C[Very scary to play here now, it is big to build upper right, but you make your group even weaker.. Hard to find a better move though, the reason is P16]

(;W[rm]
(;B[lp]C[Jaakko: This was a mistake. Did not read ahead and white got to cut this stone.

Ball: Yes, it is clear white is going to cut, since black will have 2 weak groups then]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[lo]C[Now you are cut you have to decide wether to save both groups, or sacrifice the one stone, in the game you try to save it, but the move you play is a little strange.]

;W[kn]
(;B[pn];W[kp]C[Now it would be too late]
(;B[jc]C[Jaakko: Should this have been somewhere around C14? This spot seemed like a good place to both get a big upper right corner and also help the upper left corner.

Ball: This is very big, but I would choose C14, since if white plays there he is also building]
;W[mc];B[nc]C[Jaakko: Could not think of a good way to answer the white stone. P17 seemed like overconcentrated play, but this left some bad aji in the corner, which I had to fix later in the game.

Ball: This is fine, makes sure white cant make a base];W[md]

(;B[je];W[mf]
(;B[pf];W[cf]
(;B[cd]C[Jaakko: Again I could not think of a good move, so decided to opt for a territorial move. This is probably too slow and if white would have played around C11 before I got there, I probably would not have had any chance of winning this game

Ball: This is fine, you can either play this or the variation move, but that leaves the corner open, there is no way you can pincer here]
