;W[dd];B[pk];W[ci];B[od]C[Was this too small?  I thought it was big enough here, but in the end analysis, I began to wonder...

It looks good to me. What I can recall about the chinese opening (Q3-Q9), this works well with the idea of letting white invade around Q5 later and build your right side and bottom while chasing him.]
;W[lc];B[jq]C[K4 area the biggest move?

Possibly. I might choose K4 rather than K3 to balance your influence and territory in the lower right area.]
;W[hn]C[I just didn't know what this meant.

Maybe he didn't either? :) I can't see any direct use of this move, so it feels like just a move to build some influence and moyo.]
;B[fd]C[This is a bit questionable. F17 might allow easier life. On the other hand, F16 doesn't get shut as easily.]

(;B[dc];W[cc];B[ec]C[this was bad, wasn't it? Ends in gote, for a piece of the corner, when I should be chasing m15

It's not bad. If you were to chase M15 (which isn't even all that vulnerable yet) before making your own group strong there are too quite likely outcomes: either you chase him from the right, you build your own moyo, but also force him to put a lot of pressure on your own weak H17 group, and meanwhile he gets to build his own moyo aswell. And the other choice, you chase him into your own moyo on the right.]
;W[mg];B[jf];W[kj]LB[fp:B][fq:A]C[white's moyo is getting silly big, but he's so thin.
Still, I'm not sure how to handle it...

I think you're safe to make an invasion. You have no weak groups on the board yet. But even before an invasion deep in his territory you should consider a corner approach of some kind. Here it works well as an extension to K3. This does secure some of his territory, but also his moyo is still wide open on the upper side, so you can counter it.]

(;B[nc]LB[og:A][fi:D][dn:B][nn:E][fq:C]C[I think this is definitely too small. A better local territorial move would be at A. Still, I think an invasion at around B, or approach at C, or possibly even D are better at this point, or E area for a nice moyo of your own.]
;W[gh];B[jh]C[This kind of move seems to be doing harm to your need to invade his moyo. White is too light and has too much free space to have much trouble surviving on the right side.]

I'm not sure which connection you mean... K13 to K17? simply J15 should work.]

;W[mj];B[oh];W[nj];B[oj];W[nh];B[pn]C[I think this is covering the wrong side.  N4 and Q6 look somewhat identical in a way, with the difference bottom is the weaker one. If you can choose, defend the weaker groups.]
