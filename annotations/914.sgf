C[Hi,  I am Thomas and I play white in this game. I loose this
game in a (for me) typical way:
My opponent builds a big moyo. I see this coming (maybe too late),
but I could not find
a way to attack it, or to reduce its size.

siamgo:

Thanks for let me review your game. I already mention many weak
points of your played in the game. Please take a look carefully.

Thanks

LB[dn:X]C[looks like W is getting enclosed in the LL corner, so

siamgo:  Actually, it's not really bad. B want to get the influence and
let W have some territory. Normally W would answer at X to take
some profit.];W[cj]LB[iq:d][hq:c][hp:b][go:a]C[I try to get out. But this move doesn't do this, right? What
alternatives are here available? trying to come into the center
with A or B? or trying to expand to the right with C/D? or leave
the corner for the moment and play elsewhere?

siamgo:

W10 wasn't good. It help B to get stronger and solidify B territory
on the TL. You don't have to think about get to the center right
now. This is still on the opening stage. First thing you have
to do is to occupy Corner, Side, then Center.]
(;B[dk]C[siamgo:

B should block and enlarge the territory on the top.];W[ck]
;B[dm];W[cn];B[cm];W[bm];B[dn];W[bo]LB[cm:X][bn:b][co:a]C[B5 doesn't really look right. But I was afraid of the cut at
B. Would "A" have been better?

siamgo:
If you afraid of the cut at B why didn't you play X earlier.
: )];B[do];W[dp];B[co];W[bn];B[fp]
(;W[di];B[dg]LB[qj:X][ei:a]TR[fq][qn][fc][cc][qq][nq]C[So what is the situation here? W has territory at the left side
& LL corner (~20?) but B has a strong wall there. B has laid
claim to the UL corner, the LR corner & the lower side. correct?
What should W do now? Play at  "A" to get a little bit into the
center? I thought that I had to do something on the right or
the upper side ...

siamgo:
Let B have something. It was no rush to play at A right now.
You can extend as far as X. Take the big point first. Notice
that B still have lot of weakness in his shape (as shown) and
yet he didn't make any territory.];W[qi]LB[qj:X]C[So I played R11. Now, I don't like this move very much, but I
cannot find a reason why . Just a feeling that here some better
moves may exist

siamgo:
You did the right thing. As I said you can extend as far as X.]
;B[pj];W[pi];B[qj];W[oj]C[Good];B[ok];W[nj];B[nk]
(;W[lc]C[another move where I have the feeling, that something better
exists, but I don't know where.

siamgo:
You need to keep on pushing. let B hane at the head of two stones
was bad.]
(;B[ch]C[siamgo:
This is bad for B.];W[ci];B[bh]C[siamgo:
No need to answer this move. W is already strong around here.]

(;W[bi];B[ei]TR[ch][bh]C[I think this was a good move by B,  I would have liked to play
there too. (Why didn't I earlier?)

siamgo:
The marked B stones helped W get stronger, so you don't need
to scare. (see variation)]
(;W[dh]C[siamgo:
Too submissive];B[eh];W[cg]LB[mk:X][bg:a]C[This wasn't really justified, if B plays "A" now W is in trouble,
right?

siamgo:
Cut here is too small. Play at X is a lot bigger.];B[cf];W[bg]
;B[bf];W[ah];B[ef]
(;W[ic]LB[mk:X]C[Again the feeling I should have played elsewhere...

siamgo:
X is more important.];B[jd]C[Here I begin to fear that B is building a huge moyo in the middle
of the board.];W[id]LB[jc:a]C[I played here and not at A, so I eventually can invade B's center
(or reduce it's size). But I have a very uneasy feeling here...]

Bad idea, you drive your opponent to your territory.];B[kf]

B won't make any big moyo if you play there earlier.];W[gg]

C[Unshure about H13. better at A?

siamgo: Yup];B[mf]C[Ouch, I didn't like this :)];W[lf]LB[nd:X]
C[siamgo: Not good, better play at X.];B[mg];W[ne];B[nf];W[og]
;B[of];W[pf];B[me];W[ld]LB[nd:X]TR[lf][le]C[siamgo: Those stones are already dead. Don't need to save them.
Better play at];B[nd]C[Now I was in a kind of panic mode. It seems to me, that at some
point I should have been able to stop B invading here, but where
& when?

siamgo:  The problem is you try to save every single stone and end up
with nothing. Sometime you should let B have something.];W[oe]

is that W lives small and again is enclosed by B, whose territory
in the center is almost secure. Comments welcome :)

siamgo:  It's good for B to let W live small here. If he tries to kill,
the game will be very complicate and if W live B will not get
any territory. So this is the right thing for him to do in this
situation.];B[lp];W[fj];B[fl];W[ff];B[fe];W[ek];B[dl];W[ej]

try this? Or should I better resign at this point? I would  like
to know more about  what is considered polite or appropiate and

already alive. Resign would be appropiate. ^__^];B[lk];W[ml]
