C[Any pointers as to my fighting, positional judgement, and direction of play. --Matsura


JL: There are some commentary along the way, plus a couple of variations. Also, please see the end of the game for final comments.]
;B[qd];W[ec];B[df]LB[cd:A][de:B]C[JL: Playing into the empty corners first is simpler. In order to improve, in my opinion, it is best to try to simplify one's game. The less reading there is needed, the more one can concentrate on issues like direction of play.

This move is novel. Usual kakari (approach move) is either 'a' or 'b', both of which are fine in this position. If you decide to play the move you played, you should treat it lightly.]
;W[cd];B[dd]LB[co:A]C[JL: This is not a good move. You give white secure territory and a strong position while you gain relatively little. It is best to play tenuki and take the bottom corner. I'd play 'a' or takamoku instead.]
;W[dc];B[ce];W[bd];B[be]C[JL: very slow and bad move. What does this move do other than give white a group to attack? Tenuki and playing into an empty corner is far better.]
;W[ed];B[cj]LB[de:A]C[JL: Connecting at 'a' is out of the question as it would be very heavy and white would attack immediately. Howver giving white a ponnuki early in the game is horrible.]
;W[de];B[ep]LB[dp:A]C[JL: Right direction. It would be simpler to play 'a' though.]
;W[ef];B[dg]SQ[be][ce][df]LB[cp:B][dn:C][nc:A]C[JL: Even though this move seems like the right move, it is slow. Most players at my level would play it. However I would have treated the marked black stones as forcing moves (bad forcing moves though) and played 'a' to erase white thickness a bit. If White were to atari here, black should either make a shimari at 'b' or something novel like 'c'.]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[od];B[kd]LB[oe:A]C[JL: This is perhaps slightly dangerous move, although it is probably the best hasami. I would have tried make some central influence and played 'a'.]
;W[qg]LB[kf:A]C[JL: This is a bad move. Very bad direction - white should have pressed against the black corner stone aiming at the boshi of 'a'.]
;B[pe]SQ[kd]LB[kg:A][pf:A]C[JL: Hard to say what is the best move here, but the move you played give white power to attack the marked stone. Instead of the move you played I'd play 'a' or 'b'. I think 'b' is best.]
;W[oe];B[pc];W[oc];B[hd]SQ[pc][pe][qd]C[JL: This move is bad for two reasons.
1. You approach a very strong enemy position - it is better to play lightly and jump towards safety in the center.
2. Your marked stones look awfully funny - they are like forcing moves played from the inside which goes against the principles of go.]
;W[pf]C[JL: settling the corner is not going to be fun for black.]
;B[mc]SQ[hd][kd]C[JL: One more tenuki is an interesting idea. It is not easy to kill the corner. However the position of the tenuki is bad. Black should treat the marked stones lightly and not try to make territory where one side is open.]
;W[og]LB[ob:b][pd:e][qe:d][rc:c][re:a]C[JL: A very bad move. This moves does nothing but connects. Instead white could probably have played any of the moves marked with a letter.]
;B[rf];W[rg];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb];W[nc];B[mf]LB[fe:a][nf:b]C[JL: I see no clear purpouse for this move. Why not go the the empty corner? First however you can peep both at [a\] and [b\].]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qe];B[se]LB[rb:A]C[JL:  bad move. Black should have ignored white's move or played at 'a'.]
;W[qf]C[JL: white blunders. Capturing the other black stone would have made black corner weaker.]
;B[rb];W[sf]C[JL: Playing small gote moves like this is a sure way of losing.]
;B[sd]C[JL: Playing small gote moves like this is a sure way of losing. What can white do here if black plays tenuki as he should? Answer: take 1.5 points in sente - perhaps there are bigger moves around?]
;W[pd]C[JL: Playing small gote moves like this is a sure way of losing. Seems like both players want to avoid winning.]
;B[qo]LB[qp:a][qq:b]C[JL: Right direction, but probably a questionable move. I would have played at 'a'. Now white can play at 'b and black has no good continuations because of the enormous thickness of white in the top right corner.]
;W[pq];B[pp]C[JL: This move is interesting in this position.]
;W[oq]LB[qq:A];B[qq];W[qr];B[ql]LB[rq:a]C[JL: Reduced w thickness nicely. Had black played the usual move [a\], white would have approached from this direction.]
;W[rq];B[ro]C[JL: Is this a typo or just a bad move? Black had two moves he could have considered, either solid connection, or fighting the ko. I would have selected the ko-making move and tenukied then.]
;W[qp]C[JL: No real hurry to play this move. It does mkake white very solid, but is a slow move. After all, would black prevent this capture anytime soon?]
;B[pn]SQ[pp]LB[qj:a]C[JL: no no no no... The marked black stone is worthless, why protect it?  Most important is to secure the black group, and a move like [a\] would do that while reducing the efficiency of the white thickness.]
;W[op]C[JL: White is childish if he believes that black will connect.]
;B[kq]SQ[pn][ql][qo][ro]C[JL: This move is too close to the thick white corner, especially since there is already a weak black group (marked stones). Also at some point the four scattered stones on the top may become under attack.
Black should have played this move one or two lines to left or made a shimari (corner enclosure) trying to build a moto on the left.]
;W[on]SQ[kq]LB[hq:a]C[JL: Horrible move. One should almost never lean on a weak group as it makes it stronger. However in this case black should ignore and play perhaps at [a\]. White lost a golden opportunity to attack the marked stone.]
;B[hq]C[JL: Good.];W[po]C[JL: Slow and inefficient.];B[ok]SQ[hd]
[kd][mc][mf]LB[pm:a]C[JL: hard to say what is the best way of settling the stones, but you do not want to approach your own marked stones as it might induce a double attack. I would have made one definate eye by playing simply at [a\].]
;W[qn];B[rn]LB[pm:a]C[JL: Why save these stones? Simple [a\] and then squeeze by sacrificing the two stones.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[pl]
(;B[qk];W[pk]
(;B[qj];W[pj];B[qi]C[JL: Lets analyze the last few moves. Even though black made several moves on the 3rd line, he still basicly has nothing more than eyes there. Very bad. On the other hand white has a beautiful wall. Now the question of the game is how white will use the thickness. I would avoid doing anything with it now as there is no good attack availalble yet. White should invade the last corner I think.]
;W[pi]C[JL: it is silly to connect two strong groups...];B[ki]
C[JL: The empty corner is most important. Also I see no clear purpouse for this move.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bq]C[JL: This move probably helps white more than black.]
;W[br];B[dq];W[aq];B[co]C[JL: Black has just lost his most potential source for territory. In the center there is nothing black can do as the white walls a extremely strong.]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[dr];B[er];W[bn]LB[bg:b][ck:a]C[JL: I do not like crawling like this. It is better to start a fight at [a\] aiming at [b\] in the future.]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[cl]C[JL: White makes a whipping one point with every move while giving black thickness worth a lot more...]
;W[bl];B[bk];W[kn];B[jo]SQ[hd][kd][ki][mc][mf]LB[gb:b][hb:c]
[in:a]C[JL: What is important now is the destiny of the marked stones. Black should play moves that do not make them much weaker. Anyhow I do not like the move played. [a\] seems more interesting locally, or (non-locally :) ) even [b\] which would prevent white slide of [c\] while treathening to make territory. In an open position like this professionals and us amateurs are separated. I have no clue what the best move could be.
Anyhow, a proverb says that there is no territory in the center, and that proverb is right here as well.]
;W[jn];B[lq]SQ[jn][jo][kn]C[JL: Sure this makes a few points and prevents white from making a couple of points, but exchanging the marked stones is really bad for black.]
;W[in]C[JL: ikken tobi better and faster];B[gn]C[JL: pointless move. There is very little territory next to the wall and you only give white a stone to lean against. In general it is a bad idea to approach thickness, regardless who is the owner of it.]
;W[io]SQ[hd][kd][ki][mc][mf]LB[es:a]C[JL: Worth some points, but as there is the sente hanetsugi of [a\]... better to figure a way to attack the marked weak black stones.]
;B[mo]C[JL: aji keshi];W[iq];B[ip];W[jp]C[JL: black should just connect as the variation shows]

(;B[jq]C[JL: why not [a\]? See variation at prevouous node.]
;W[hp];B[ir];W[hr]C[JL: a hanami-ko starts. Black has nothing to win, white nothing to lose...]
;B[gq];W[jr];B[ip];W[qc];B[rc];W[iq]C[Matsura [-\]: bad on my part lol
mac [-\]: :) lucky on my part
Matsura [-\]: i just dont have enough threats


JL: Black has about one threat at [a\], not sure if big enough though. White needs to figure a way to attack the weak black stones with the extra move he will get.]
;B[mm]C[JL: game over if white finnishes the ko by capturing. Black has awfully many weak stones all over the board and by attacking them enough territory should appear naturally.]
;W[is];B[lo]C[JL: black can not expect to save all the stones - at the moment they have zero eyes and white is extremely strong all over the board.]
;W[ko]LB[ll:a]C[JL: so slow and inefficient. [a\] or something like that much better.]
;B[lm]C[JL: black is happy to play this. The problem is now that the whole black group is still heavy and if white plays even ok, black should suffer a lot.]
;W[go]C[JL: white obviously had no clue what to do. Absolutely wrong direction of play. White MUST attack black - there is no way black can find time to make anything here. This point is also an aji-keshi and helps the opponent way more than white...]
;B[fo]SQ[jq][kq][lm][lo][lq][mm][mo]LB[lj:a][lk:b]C[JL: black should consider saving the marked stones instead of making a couple points of territory... either [a\] or [b\] is right, which is it is a good reading excercise.]
;W[gp]LB[kk:a]C[JL: I refuce to comment silly moves like this any more. The whole point of the game is to make severe moves. This move is yet again a perfect example of a move which lacks severity. If instead white plays [a\]or the point below it, it is hard for black to live and while trying to the topmost stones will be severely weakened. Black should also understand this and not play something silly in this area.]
;B[fp]C[JL: Small, silly, does just about nothing and allows white to take initiative. I simply do not understand the purpouse of this move.]
;W[hn]C[JL: ...or the purpouse of this move...];B[gm];W[hk]
SQ[jq][kq][lm][lo][lq][mm][mo]C[JL: Finally a move with at least some sense. This is assuming white is planning to attack the marked stones usign this stone...]
;B[gk]C[JL: no time to defend here. Something huge is in grave danger.]
;W[gj];B[fj]C[JL: all moves in this neighbourhood are pointless. Fighting for pennies.]
;W[gl];B[fk];W[fl];B[hj];W[hm];B[el];W[fn];B[en];W[fm];B[gi]
;W[ae];B[bf];W[hb]SQ[jq][kq][lm][lo][lq][mm][mo]C[JL: Both players have so far played many many end game moves far smaller than this one. Unfortunately for white black has a nice ponnuki protecting the previously weak stones on top. However the other black group really should die had white attacked it instead (the once more marked stones).]
;B[gc];W[gb];B[ic];W[fc];B[gf];W[eh];B[fe];W[ee];B[ei];W[lh]
;B[kh];W[lg];B[kg];W[lf];B[kk]LB[kl:a][lk:c][ll:b]C[JL: Finally black decides to start defending the weak stones. However W[a\], B[b\], W[c\] is a brutal way of cutting, but it is very severe. Reading the result is a bit hard but most of it is quite straight forward. It is surprisingly hard to make two eyes...
See the variation(s). I can not see any way for black to live.]

;W[me];B[md];W[ne];B[mb];W[na];B[ib];W[sj]C[JL: black must take care to avoid dying. Two answers make black aive, others more or less dead.]

1. You must study life and death, and basic eye shape. Learn the eye-stealing tesuji (and its counterpart, the eye making tesuji).
2. You play too small gote points, especially early in the game.
3. Allowing opponent to become thick is a way to lose.
4. First play important moves, then big ones. In this game you prefered small (should have been) gote moves over them both...
5. Basicly, if you want to play good go you must first learn to read well. Reading the the basis for a game - if you read play otherwise well, but read badly, it is like you built a statue of gold and iron, but with clay feet.
6. After you read well, you should try to understand what is big, what is small, and what kind of aji (potential) there is in positions.
7. Thickness should be used to attack with. And again, in order to do this you should learn to read better. In general, attacking is the way to win, however all attacking must be done sensibly.
8. Thickness should not be approached regardless to whom it belongs to.
9. Ponnuki is worth 30 points. You gave your opponent several of them.
10. A small life early in the game is usually much worse than sacrificing the stones in a sensible manner. Stones themselves have very little value (1 point each). What metters is how you use them.
11. Moves should have purpouse - you made some moves that were quite vague.
12. Do not try to play any fancy openings before you master the basics - it will just slow your developement.]
