C[I am playing Black. This was a mostly peaceful game, so most of my questions are about fuseki and large endgame.

csh: I will try my best to help. You really ask about the tough stuff. :)]

(;B[qo]C[csh: What do you think about the pincer? I added to variations.]

(;W[pp]C[csh: For some reason, I expected White to play the tsuke-hiki joseki to split Black's side. The avalanche joseki makes sense, though.

Another game, I suppose. I include that joseki as a variation.]
;B[qp];W[oq]LB[pn:C][qn:B][qq:D][or:A]C[One thought I had after the game was to try for the large avalanche, turn outward, to make thickness. What other ideas are reasonable for this board?

csh: First of all, you have to realize that while you can choose a joseki, your opponent may be able to choose a different variation that is more favorable to him. Why did you want to try for the large avalanche joseki? Not all of the variations will give you thickness on the outside.

While it is good to look at joseki to see what is considered an even result, I don't think  you should be memorizing joseki. The large avalanche has a large number of variations, and I think it might be foolish to play only one branch.]

(;B[or]C[csh: While this is listed as joseki in 38 Basic Joseki, I am not sure that this variation is agreed to be joseki anymore. I am told that it favors White.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[nr];B[pn]C[I played this variation so I could hane here.

csh: There are other variations where Black can hane here. It is actually feasible to hane first.]

(;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[de]LB[bf:B][cf:A]C[I played at A to try to exploit the ladder break, but perhaps B is better due to White's extreme thickness.]

(;B[fq]LB[dn:B][mo:A]TR[df][no]C[csh: Where is the follow up to the ladder breaker?

You traded the marked moves to force him to take, but this is rather a weak follow up. See the variation.]

(;B[dn]
(;W[fp]TR[fq]C[csh: I was seriously debating which way to play. I think White wants to attach to the other stone, though, because the marked black stone is a better target. It is hard to attack a stone on the fourth line.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[do];B[cr]
(;W[go]C[csh: No real need to push here. Black won't make territory at the bottom of the board, so pushing Black and making Black stronger is not great. White also does not control the lefthand side of the board, so the wall is questionable.]
;B[hp]LB[qi:B][in:A]
(;W[in]LB[dj:B][gj:A][pj:D][cn:D][on:C]C[Where now for Black? I felt the left side moyo was the largest area.]

(;B[gj]LB[ej:A][ij:B]C[I chose to reduce here.

csh: I think this is the first real mistake. You are treating the lefthand side as a white moyo, when there is really a lot of space on the left. Furthermore, White's lower left corner does not yet have a base. As a result, you can play more forcefully on the left. The stone played sort of floats, and it gives up most of the lefthand side to White without a fight.]

(;W[ej]C[Is this passive?

csh: Nope. I think Black surrendered the lefthand side to White.]
;B[pj]C[I felt I could begin to develop now that White's left was reduced.]
;W[nn]C[This seemed small.

csh: Yeah, I agree, but it does get rid of some bad aji.];B[jd]
;W[oe]C[How can I handle this?

csh: Well, it's one of the moves to make sabaki against the shimari in the corner. You didn't think you'd get the whole right side, did you?]
;B[nd];W[qe];B[pd];W[pi]LB[qi:B][qj:A]C[I felt the hane here would allow white more options.]

(;B[ph]C[csh: This just looks odd to me.];W[oh];B[qh];W[oj]
C[After this, I wanted to make some shape in the center. Does Black have other options at this point?]

(;B[ek];W[fk];B[fj];W[fl];B[ei];W[dj];B[gh];W[di];B[eh]C[csh: This trade isn't good. You solidified White's lefthand side to get "shape" and one eye in the center. This group is much too tight, almost to the point of being overconcentrated. Black played five stones to make one point. The black group can still be attacked.

Black needed to make sabaki and push further into the lefthand side.]

What does the landscape look like? Which player has better prospects at this point?

csh: This game is White's to lose. The marked black stones are a target, and while they run, White can push into Black's moyo and reduce severely.]

(;B[jk]C[csh: This move, while it can reduce the white moyo, does not help the marked black group. It's almost like playing on a dame point, as Black will not make much territory in the center.]
;W[on];B[pm];W[nl];B[hc]C[csh: Black still got this move, though.]

csh: Sure looks like it is sente. The group is weak.]

;W[gb];B[hb];W[hk];B[hj];W[ik];B[ij];W[jj]TR[jk]C[csh: Because it could be cut off, the marked stone ended up being a wasted move. Pushing White along damaged this stone's chances of survival.]
