C[Hello Mr. reviewer, my name is thomas, and i am about 10k.
Thank you for reviewing my game. I played white and lost by a lot. My opponent said after the start that he was 6k. I didn't know his real strength so we played without handicap.


I felt behind the whole game and i couldn't find a way to come back in the game. I kept creating weak groups.

If possible, could you insist on fuseki and approach moves because i think it is mostly why my opponent was able to get all this territory and me  getting weak groups in return. If it is something else that was the reason for my loss please insist on it.
I added two comments, if you could answer the questions it could be great bur make sure you review it as you please.
Thank you for all this time spent on the review!

Hi, I'm Chun-Kit, 2k in Germany. I will guide you mainly in the first about 100 moves. You're main weakness is spotting urgent points, also handling with unsettled groups.]

wR14 is common, but this is also possible]
(;B[dj]C[Black ignored my approach, so i tried to ... take advantage of it, but could do nothing but put myself in trouble.
A better way to take advantage of it?

rika:
The double approach is ok. After occuping the important D10 in the chinese fuseki, you can think of making an approach at E16 (see var).]

This isn't interesting at this point, black can easily escape to the center if he is in a hurry.
wC8 for a solid base with follow up invasion at C/D12 or submarine B10, or wE16]

rika:
it's almost difficult to turn the game. All black groups are pretty secure. you need to think about bC8]

you can think of B16 first how black reacts and then play lightly.]

rika:
difficult to say what you want. If you protect the side, black has the center, otherwise black can harass your group.]
