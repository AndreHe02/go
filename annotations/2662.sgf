C[S>
Thanks for reviewing my game. I felt like I played pretty well, but I still lost by 8.5.. Obviously there are some smaller tactical things I could work on (endgame, etc), but I'm interested in advice for larger-scale info.]

(;B[fd]C[Mirage: N17, then K17 to strengthen upper black. If wanna approach corner, C15 is better.]
;W[kc]C[S> This is gote for white, yes? I feel like it was good for me.

Mirage: This is gote for white, but F16 stone in strange position. F16 on fourth line, seems to get influence to the center. But white M15 stone on vital point to the center. So it's better to get territory than to get influence.]

[df:B]C[S> Should I have played the hane at A or gone down with B? This felt appropriate, to solidify the top black group.

Mirage: I think A is better. D16 is not effective enough. Grabbing not much territory with many black stones. And white can still invade!!! See variation on move 29.]

Wrong direction? My corner got pushed around a bit up top, but I felt like a play at A would be passive, since it would let white settle at R8. (And besides, I hate that shape that A would make.)

Mirage: I think this is ok, playing A would be passive.];W[rg]
;B[rf];W[oi];B[ng]C[Mirage: Better R18 to settle down the corner.]
;W[qg];B[qf];W[og];B[pg]C[Mirage: Since the corner is not yet settle down, it's hard to fight with white.]

Mirage: Maybe M3 better.];W[lq];B[dr]
(;W[iq]C[S> This surprised and frustrated me. How could I have prevented it, or dealt with it once it arrived?

Mirage: M3 instead of L3 to prevent it. Many ways to dealt with it... one example in variation.]

I was worried that White was starting to make a big territory up here.
I was surprised that I got off as easily as I did.

Mirage: I think P6 is necessary.];W[lh];B[li];W[oo];B[po];W[on]

Looking back, I guess this was a fairly major move. If I had played at A, I guess black has an advantage to make center territory? 
Naturally, white still has a decent response at B.

Mirage: Yes, this move is big.];B[hn];W[gn];B[fm];W[dk];B[dj]
