C[I played balck as yfh2



I lost this game by few points, while I thought after the fuseki that I had an advantage.



Two things :



Either I misread the board and the position advantage I read was inaccurate. In that case, question is : why did I misread ?



Or, my opponent succeeded in screwing my position. Question then is : how ?



I have the impression that appart from a couple of small mistakes that did cost me a few points, there was no patent blunder in the middle game.



However, I have the impression that in the end game, I lost sente, and therefore many small points.   Overall questions are :  1) Is this statement correct ?

2) If yes, where should I have prevented this

3) If not, where is my blindness ?



Thanks for your comments.];B[pd];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq];W[qj]
;B[qh];W[qm];B[oh]LB[qc:a][ro:b][jd:c]C[This move is too slow because white can invade black upper right territory in "A" and destroy black territory. Moreover, with this move, you cannot really attack the two white stones : they can live with "B" or escape to the center.

Better to play completely elswhere : for exemple at "C".];W[nc]
LB[pc:a]C[Now if you want to make real territory in the upper right side, you have to add an other move in "A", and so white can developp himself rappidly.]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[ld]LB[jc:a]C[This is a slow move but it is strong so black should add a move in the corner and strike at "A" later.]
;B[hq]C[Q : C3 better ?

T : I think this is a good move because this create a moyo on the bottom.]
;W[cq];B[cj]LB[cl:a][ck:b]C[You cannot extend so much now after the exchange of B4 for C3 because if white invades in A you are divided in two groups and you are entering in a very difficult battle (for black).

You shoul have play at "B"];W[bq]C[????????????????];B[ho]C[This is a good move because it creats a good moyo for black on the bottom and helps black stones at the left.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qg];B[pg];W[rh];B[qe];W[qi]C[You see, like this, you didn t make any territory and white has reinforced his group.

Moreover it seems to be quite sente for white because capturing the black stone is big because it makes the black group weaker.]
;B[hc]LB[fc:a]C[I think this is a strange aprroach move because you don t have so good moves after this. I would play in "A"]
;W[jc];B[ec]C[As this, you are giving a lot of terrritory to white in the corner and you do not stabilize your group so i think this is not a good sequence for you.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[ee]C[You see here, it is very painful for black. But you should play in "A" now.]
;B[cf]LB[fe:a]C[This is a good movze but I think it is a bit dangerous for black if for exemple white plays at "A"]
;W[ce];B[df];W[de];B[he];W[fe];B[db];W[cb];B[fb]LB[eb:a]C[Better to just connect in " A".]
;W[bc]LB[cl:a][en:b][ej:c]C[W : 32

8 bottom left

8 right

7 top

5 corner



B : 31

11 bottom right

5 top right

10 left

5 top



For black, I did not count the miai of Q18 or M3, that can add 5 to 10 more



Besides, Black has more influence on the center.





Anything wrong in this ?



My counts are :



W : 40

12 bottom left

12 right

8 top

8 corner



B : 35

15 bottom right

5 top right

10 left        here it is not yet decided because white can easely invade at "A"

5 top



In real territory white is leading but it is right that he hasnt the control of the center;

Moreover black can make more territory in the bottom and in the center. I think black should now protect at "B" or "C". But white can attack the upper black group so right now, it is difficult to say who is really leading.]
;B[mf];W[gd];B[gc]LB[hd:a]C[This move is very bad. You should have connected in A]
;W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[jb];W[kc]C[Like this you have made a life for your group but white gains a lot of points in the center so it is not good at all.]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[mc]C[This move does not give anything for black so it is not really good.]
;W[lc];B[md];W[mb];B[nd]LB[qc:a]C[For example, white could have play int A an black lost all his territory.]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[od];B[oe]C[bad exchange for white];W[da];B[eb]
;W[fg]LB[cl:a][jq:b]C[tobi is not good. White should play in A or in B]
;B[dh];W[lp];B[kq];W[lq]C[bad exchange for black because it reinforces white position.]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[kp];W[ko]LB[lo:a]C[This hane is dangerous for white as black can cut in A]
;B[jo];W[kn];B[mo];W[lo];B[mm];W[mn]C[to cut in the tobi is strange here : it reinforces black and give a bad shape to white.]

yes better];W[en]C[(sic)];B[hm]C[Why this move??

better to protect now (left side)];W[el];B[cl]LB[dm:a][os:b]
[pb:c][bf:d][gh:e][bo:f]C[Here again, It lloks like B is ahead by more or less 5 points to me. (counting next W moves)



Better to play at A as it is sente.

I think if white plays now he can win because the territory balance is equal (including the komi).

He has good moves at B,C,D,E or F.];W[bo];B[bn];W[ap];B[co]

There are bigger points on the board, probably];W[lf];B[me]
