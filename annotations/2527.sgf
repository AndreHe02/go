[cf:C]C[This move is a little odd.  It is important early in the game to spread out and take the big points.

A is huge because it forms the dreaded SanRenSei, the other star points are big.  E13 is weaker than say B, or C,  Your opponent can slide under it and it's not well attached to D16.]
;W[qf];B[pi]LB[nc:A][nd:B]C[There's nothing wrong with a pincer here.  Though, you might look at responses like o17 and o16.]

C[Now you've built a great big wall.  It's pointed at?  Nothing.   If you head a stone at A or B, you'd be in business.  White's next move makes your wall less useful.  Yikes!]
;W[kd];B[hd];W[ic];B[id]C[Okami: This is just messing around..]

[oq:C][cn:D][fq:E][qm:F][jp:G]C[M4 is a little odd too.  I can't say it's right or wrong, but the points B and C are the best way to approach komoku.  You could also try D and E to approach that hoshi stone on the left.  Actually, if you had both D and E, D4 would be in some trouble (hasimi).  I like G becauuse it's half way between your opponent's corners.  I like F because it makes an extension from your (weak) Q11 stone while still approaching the corner.  

The move at A might be nice too.  Something to give your poor isolated wall some breathing space.]
;W[jp];B[on]LB[oq:A][op:B][qn:C]C[I do not understand this move.    The moves at A, B, and even C make more sense here.  The move at B might even guarentee life.]
;W[pn];B[po]C[Good.  When your opponent attaches (tsuke) it's often good to hane the attaching stone.  This choice of direction was nice.]

;B[om];W[qs];B[pr];W[or];B[pl]LB[qf:A][rh:B][pg:C]C[This is not that bad a position.  It develops little territory though.  Your thickness is pointed at his stones at A which can slide out at C and which can slide under you at B.  See the variation at move 43.]
;W[dj];B[ci]LB[rh:A]C[I like A here because it threatens to slide under white's corner while at the same time giving your fight group something to point at.  But there is nothing wrong with C11.]
;W[cj];B[di];W[ei];B[eh];W[fi];B[bi]C[B11 is OK -- B10 might have been better.  There are probably bigger moves out there though.  Generally speaking, you should leave the stuff close to the edge for later in the game.]

Paul [14kyu\]:   Practice practice practice practice practice.  :)  It is difficult to know what to do when.  There's a temptation to focus on life and death too much (because it is very fun).  Look at fuseki also and you will improve.]
