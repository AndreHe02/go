C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game.

I am black.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq];W[op];B[lp]
(;W[pm]LB[on:A]C[White may think about iken-tobi, but the fight would be very complicated -]
;B[oo];W[no];B[on];W[pp];B[qn];W[nn]LB[qq:A]C[Usually White starts at A]
;B[om];W[qq]
(;B[qo]LB[rp:A]C[You may punish W for the wrong order by extending at A -]
;W[rq];B[pj]LB[cn:A]C[Tennuki is also fine. You may attack at A first]
;W[ip]LB[cc:D][dd:B][np:A][nq:C]C[What should I play now?
I wanted to exploit the weakness at A but I was not sure should I play immediately play in upper right because if I play B he plays C I D and then he first plays at E3 or F4.

A.D.: The pincer looks risky for White. I think, you may punish him by direct cut -]

(;B[cn]C[It's a soft answer -];W[dn];B[dm];W[en]
(;B[cp]C[Is C3 better?

A.D.: Yes, probably -];W[co];B[bo];W[do];B[bm];W[cq];B[bp];W[em]
;B[dl];W[hq]LB[nm:B][nq:A]C[Is this good or white should play somewhere else?

A.D.: I think, it's more solid to defend at A. White may also think about pushing at B]
;B[de];W[nm]C[A good move. Now the opening looks promising for White]
;B[nl];W[lm];B[ml];W[ln];B[cc]C[White territory looks very big...does white have a lead?

A.D: Yes, I think so];W[cb];B[cd];W[gc]LB[nc:B][fk:A]C[What should I play now?

A.D: Black can think about A or B];B[fk]C[I like your choice]
;W[nc]LB[ld:B][nd:D][ne:A][qf:C]C[I didn't know what is the best answer to this.
I haven't played A because he can take up his position at top by playing at B.

A.D.: Keima at C is most common. Also you can try the attachment at D -]

(;B[kd]C[The pincer looks strange here -]
(;W[ne]LB[qc:A]C[An invasion at san-san is the most simple way -]
;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ng];B[md];W[oe]LB[nd:A]C[Is it better to connect at A?

A.D.: Yes, the straight connection is normal];B[mc];W[nb]LB[pg:A]
C[What is the right shape for black now?

A.D.: How about defending at A?];B[og]C[It's more active, but there are some adji]
;W[lf]LB[nh:A]C[A strange shape. It must be at A];B[je];W[ge]
;B[jg]C[Now the position is unclear];W[lh];B[nh]C[A very important place]
;W[if];B[jf];W[ki];B[mg];W[qb];B[od]C[It's not necessary to push here]

(;B[pe]C[Is it necessary to defend?];W[lg];B[me];W[mf];B[nf]
;W[oa];B[qa]C[A very bad move. It makes your group on the left weaker]

(;W[ma]LB[lb:A]C[Also strange. It must be at A. White may even play the tennuki! -]
;B[ji]C[A good move. Now the game looks better for Black];W[jj]
;B[ii];W[kk];B[lj];W[kj];B[eb]C[Very sharp! I like this plan]
;W[ec];B[db];W[fb];B[bb]C[Black got a nice corner. Now you are ahead on territory]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[jd];B[le];W[jb];B[fd];W[fc]LB[eg:A][eh:B]C[Is it enough for black to take territory on lets side at A, B or somewhere around?

A.D.: Yes, it's enough. Black is leading];B[fe];W[gf];B[gd]
;W[hd];B[hc]C[This was risky. We can call it the losing plan]
;W[ie]
(;B[hb]C[It is still better to defend the group -];W[ff];B[ed]
;W[gi]C[It was hard for me now.

A.D.: Yes, you made it difficult. I cannot show you the way to live]
;B[kh]C[A bad exchange];W[li];B[gh];W[hh];B[ih]
(;W[hi]LB[fh:A]C[A mistake. It must be at A, so your group would be in trouble -]

(;B[id]C[This was big mistake. I played in wrong order, I should immediately play K19 right?

A.D.: Yes. K19 is the only move -];W[ic];B[hf];W[he];B[ja];W[ia]

Thx for showing the game. It was interesting.

A.D: I don't think, that this result is good for Black. It was a joseki, but we don't use it during the last 10 years. Everyone think that W is better]
