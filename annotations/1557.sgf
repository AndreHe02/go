C[Hi
I was black in this game.In the middle of the game,I thought I was a little ahead.But I lost a lot in the endgame.Finally I won by 0.5 point.It was very close.Would you please point my good moves and bad moves?


Thanks.


[R\] Hello, I am Remi,  I will review this game for you, I hope it will be helpful. Don't hesitate to come back to me if some things are not clear enough, or if you need more information.]

LB[fp:C][gp:A][jq:D][kq:B][qn:E]C[There's one thing about this position that I have seen playd in some professional games. Here, black has 2 options, either the hanging connection (tiger's mouth at A, which leads to the joseki extension at B afterwards, or the solid connection at C which leads to D afterwards. (or one point above D). The thing is that to get the maximum efficiency, it might depend on white's answer to a move at E. Let me show through variations.]

(;B[fp]LB[fp:A][qn:B];W[cm]TR[cn]C[The normal move is white C6. This move leaves potential for black at C5, which is for later.]
;B[jq];W[fc]TR[ec]C[Here, playing the tsuke at e17 will overconcentrate the white stones (see variation)]

(;B[cf];W[cc];B[dc];W[db]C[Accroding to the joseki, I should play on e18 next move.It will go as variation 2.But I think this variation is not good for me.Bad influence,not enough territory.So I tried c16.Was my decision right?


[R\] Yes. The variation is not interesting at all for black.]

(;W[cb]LB[bb:B][cb:A]C[Here white usually plays differently (see variation)]
;B[dj]LB[ci:B][cj:A]C[I don't like this move because it allows white to play B10,later on, which is a good move. B10 threatens black, stabilizes white and somehow fixes the defect at C5. So Here I would play A or B]

(;B[dp]LB[do:A]C[This is not good. if you must play this, play at A. When white plays A, the whole exchange seems to be a bad idea for black]

(;B[rp]LB[qh:B][rp:A]C[I thought a 3-3 invasion would not success here, so I tried in another way.Finally I failed.What should I do to invade this corner?

[R\] The first thing to wonder is wether you _need_ to invade it, and if you do it, whether it won't strengthen white too much on the outside. I don't know if I would have invaded (which does not mean that invading was wrong ;)]
