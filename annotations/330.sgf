C[Hi I am Slawek Piela. I played White in this game.
I am Polish 8 kyu and I played a fiend of about equal strength.
Any comments will be appreciated as well as pointers on further study.

bent: Hi, it was an interesting game. The points I noticed particulary where white moves 14 and 32, which show a lack of understanding about  urgent(desirable) and less important extensions. I'd like to recommend you a book to improve this part of your game: 'In the Beginning' by Ikuro Ishigure (Ishi Press), it's easy to read and there's especially a chapter about moves on the third and fourth line which might interest you, and it's full of easy to understand concepts and fundamentals.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dq];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[gq]
LB[fq:a][ep:b][eq:c]C[bent: generally at 'a' or 'b'.
White G3 is a little thin and leaves aji around 'a' and 'c'.]
;B[cj];W[pj];B[nq]
(;W[jq]LB[lq:a]C[Was it a good choice I also thought about q6

bent: the D3 group is stable so K3 is small in terms of territory, hence you should have played 'a' if you wanted to pincer O3, but I think there is a better choice (see variation)]
;B[no];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq];B[kr]LB[lq:a][lr:b]C[bent: This would be the normal move if W had pincered at L4 instead of K3, undermining the L4 stone, but here B should have played 'a' or 'b' or jumped toward the center.]
;W[fc];B[hc];W[cf]C[bent: Each of the white stones finds himself to be pincered, so this looks a little like an overplay, W will probably have to abandon one of these stones. This move might be playable if this stone creates some aji.]

(;B[ee];W[cc]C[I often play this way... 3-3 and 2 kakaris
Is it correct or should I avoid it?];B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[bc]
;B[ce];W[dc];B[dh]LB[ge:a][gd:b][eb:c][ej:d]MA[hc]C[bent: Too timid. 'a' or 'b' confine W to the corner, while due to the presence of X, W has an annoying weakness at 'c', so B might be able to play 'd' solidifying a nice piece of cake.]
;W[nc]LB[qf:a][nm:b]C[I felt that playing from the other side would give B too much territory

bent: In my humble opinion 'a' is the correct direction. If B O16 or something like that, W can enlarge his right side area with 'b' while putting pressure on the B O3 group.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[jc];B[lc];W[kd]C[I was convinced that l16 kills m17...

bent: If really in trouble M18 guarantees some kind of sabaki but that would mean that W should have hold back to L17 instead of K17.]
;B[lb];W[nb];B[jb];W[ib];B[kc];W[ic];B[ld];W[hd];B[ke];W[qc]
;B[pc]C[bent: White is in trouble here. You should either live in the corner giving up the three w stones for the moment (you already took profit with H16) or pull them out without destroying you future potential in the corner.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[oa];B[qb];W[pa];B[rc]C[bent: B should play R19 atari before S17.]

;W[hf]C[My mistake I misread the sequence...];B[if]C[bent: Black P16 instead would allow him to win the capturing race.]
;W[ig];B[jg];W[kg];B[hg];W[jh];B[he];W[nf];B[ng];W[of]C[My mistake !! should have taken o15 !!]

;B[fe];W[gc];B[ql]LB[ii:a][kj:b][jk:c][kk:d][jl:e]C[bent: Black could also play something like 'a' to enlarge his left side while attacking the White center stones. Imagine something like 'a' to 'e' and Blacks left side area becomes enormous, but R8 looks good too.]
;W[pl]C[Any better ideas ?

bent: I think this is the best move!
It keeps some kind of connection with Q10 and indirectly helps the center group.]
;B[rj];W[qm];B[qk]
(;W[qj]C[bent: White has to repare his defect by connecting at Q9 (see variation), else...]
;B[rm];W[rn];B[pk];W[ok];B[ol];W[pm];B[oj];W[nk];B[ri];W[nj]
;B[oi]C[bent: Blacks invasion was a success];W[jr];B[kq];W[kp]
;B[lq]LB[qr:a][rr:b][mq:c]C[bent: bad shape (empty triangle). 'c' keeps all connections, perhaps black should play 'a', W'b', B'c']
;W[mp];B[lp];W[np];B[op];W[oq];B[mq];W[mo];B[lo];W[mn];B[or]
;W[pq];B[ih]C[bent: J11 better.];W[ki]C[should have been j11 first, right ?

bent: Yes because the three w stones are not very important, while the center struggle is.]
;B[hi];W[gn]C[bent: good (imagine a black stone here),];B[mi]
;W[ii];B[hh];W[hj];B[ij];W[jj];B[ji];W[ik];B[ii];W[kk];B[hk]

(;W[hl]MA[go][gp][fq][eq]C[g9 better? g9 and then an attempt to connect to g6?
bent: white's center is still open around L6 and white is thin at X, so mutual destruction might have been better, but B can compromise (see variation)]
;B[gk];W[gl];B[fk];W[em];B[dl];W[el];B[ek];W[bn];B[bm];W[bl]
C[bad move ..
bent: yes, simply connecting in sente and then a move around F4 fixing up the shape (the difference is about 15 points)]

[os:b][mr:c]C[bent: overplay, W can play 'a', and black cannot take with 'b' as he has to make two eyes (else 'c' kills him).]

;W[mo];B[lp];W[pq];B[nr];W[or];B[ms]C[bent: W has sacrified two stones to built up the right side and the corner, while B gets a strong (thick) group, but this is not very important because it affects no other groups (the W groups around don't need any attention) and because of G3 any black extension (J3) would make B overconcentrated.]
