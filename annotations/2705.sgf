AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Joonas Tyystj√§rvi: first, some general comments:
- do not touch stones that you are attacking.
- don't attack only for the purpose of attacking - attack with the aim of making territory.
- spare small sente moves until the endgame - they may be ko threats or aji keshi.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[ch];B[cf]LB[fc:B][dk:A]C[JT: after white plays A, this move approaches his strength. I think a pincer at A or the extension to B are better.]
;W[hq];B[go]LB[ck:A][en:B]TR[hq]C[JT: I think that black should invade at A now. If white jumps to B, then black can play here. This move doesn't attack the triangled stone very strongly.]
;W[dk]C[JT: now white makes this group solid.]
(;B[bp]LB[jq:B][fr:A]C[JT: this doesn't really threaten the white left-side group and it lets white play A in sente to strengthen his own group. I think B is better now, to start building in the right.]
;W[fr];B[ip]LB[jq:A]C[JT: I think A still looks better. Since the left-side group is strong, building in the center is pretty difficult.]
;W[iq];B[jp];W[dr];B[jq];W[cq];B[cp];W[eq];B[ep];W[pj];B[cl]
LB[fk:A]C[JT: since this move doesn't actually threaten the white group, it's fairly small. If you want to do something about the group, I think A looks more threatening.]

(;B[jd]LB[pm:B][qm:A]TR[jq]C[JT: with the triangled stone played, you really should play the checking extension at A (or maybe B) first.]
;W[qn];B[nq]LB[pn:A]TR[qn]C[JT: the triangled exchange is great for white - white makes his group stronger and black's position becomes low.]
;W[qf];B[of];W[nc];B[nd]LB[qc:A]C[JT: you should not touch this stone - you want to attack it. I think A here is best, keeping both sides vulnerable.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[qh];W[rc];B[re]LB[rd:A]C[JT: this doesn't work, and should be at A.]

;W[rf];B[sg];W[sd];B[sf]TR[sg]C[JT: the triangled moves are best left as ko threats - they're nearly worthless.]

(;B[or]C[JT: again, better left as a ko threat. Also, there is the matter of white liberties (see the variation)]

;W[cc];B[dc];W[eb];B[fb];W[cd];B[ee]LB[de:A]C[JT: since this shape doesn't actually protect against white's cuts, I'd say it's better to simply play at A.]

JT: it seems to me that black is still ahead by about 8 points, so I guess something must have happened in the endgame.]
