C[Dear Reviewer,
My name is David, I am 11 kyu in my local club, I played black.
My oponents name is Markus, he is 10 kyu.

I added a lot of comments on my own moves, indicating what I was thinking at each move. I hope that enables you not only to tell me where I could have played better, but also to tell me where my way of thinking and estimating is wrong.

Thank you very much in advance for reviewing this game.
Regards,
David Peklak];B[dp];W[qd];B[pq];W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[pp]LB[qr:a]
C[I found out that in this situation 'a' is mostly played.]
;W[qp];B[oo]C[this move seemed 'good shape' to mee, so I played it without much thinking.]
;W[pr]TR[pp][pq]C[Now I realized the two makred stones were endangered.]
;B[qo]C[Here I read out the next 8 moves just like they actually happened. Which I considered good, because I could seperate white.]
;W[pn];B[or];W[oq];B[op];W[nr];B[qr];W[os];B[rq];W[qn];B[rp]
LB[ro:a]C[would 'a' have been better? I  thought that capturing the two white stones immediatly would keep white from using them somehow leter on.

AB: This is correct thinking. That would leave some bad aji behind]
;W[mq]
(;B[pk]TR[pn][qn][po]C[I saw the small marked white group and wanted to attack it, somehow building something useful on the right side at the same time. Was this good? Or bad? I have no idea.

AB: I found it interesting that White did not defend it, and you are absolutely right to attack it immediately.

I might have prefered to play a bit further than what you played as I have shown in the variation.]
;W[on]
(;B[nk]C[AB: Black is not in danger. Running out is not the best option for Black.]
;W[mn];B[qg]LB[mp:a]TR[qg][nk][pk]C[Here I was trying to make a base for my marked stones. My second choice would have been 'a' to keep on putting pressure on the white group.

AB: I find this late. If I were White, I would not let you settle like this so easily.

'a' is the play for White to link. You were following White with O9 and Q9, then you swithced to creating a base. If you were following to kill (this is what I tought from those 2 moves)]
;W[mp];B[cd]LB[ec:a]C[I thought playing in this corner now was good. I chose this point, because I thought when I had the possibility to enclose it with a play at 'a', it would work together well with te stone in the lower left.]
;W[ed]SQ[qd]C[AB: What defines the answer to your question on move 31 depends on the variation I have given that demostrates why White is not safe (White cannot connect)

You should consider a possible wall facing left.  You should also consider the weak top right corner (marked)

My top priority would be to play around the marked stone and see how White responds.From these moves, I got the feeling that White is following Black moves (although he should not be) This is rather a psychological analysis of my opponent which you should not rely on when playing strong opponents.]

(;B[ec]C[Is the idea of making territory in the corner good here?

AB: This may create White facing the center, which I would not prefer.]
;W[dc];B[dd]C[I played this one without much reading. I remembered 'When cought in a crosscut, extend', which would give the same result.]
;W[fc];B[eb];W[cb];B[fb]TR[cb][dc]C[Here I was unalbe to read, wether I could catch the marked white stones, I thought increasing my liberties like this would help.

AB: good idea. Those stones are as good as dead. White has to play another move there to defend (even that may not be enough) This will give Black a big chance to develop.]

(;W[cc]TR[cd][dd]C[Suddenly I had the feeling, I had to care for my marked stones here.]
;B[df]C[AB: Too close, too defensive. Black is not in danger.]
;W[fd]TR[eb][fb][ec]SQ[cb][cc][dc]C[Here I was thinking that I was definitly seperated, so I wanted to make both groups live. I did not consider attacking the marked white stones, because I thought my marked stones would loose a capturing race.

AB: If you do not defend your marked stones, they will die.

I guess your mood will set the pace of this game. You are strong locally there, but you are feeling the opposite.]

(;B[cf]C[AB: very very defensive.];W[be];B[bf];W[he];B[jc]C[still trying to make ky weak group stronger, while attacking a bit the weak white group.

(;B[ba]C[with this and the next move I thought I could kill white (maybe).]

(;B[cj]C[the variation shows that reviewing this, I think I could have killed whites group.]
;W[db]C[And he thought so as well..];B[mc]LB[fg:a]C[I still feared for he life of my group as well. Now reviewing my game, further chasing the white group with a play around 'a' maybe look better?

AB: this move is better. Because you are facing a White corner. This is also a weak approach move amking an attack to the top right corner, much sever.]

(;B[ij]TR[kf][jh][ii][ij][ik][jl][km]C[Here my thought was that I might be able to build some wall facing the right side while chasing white, I had something like the triangles shown in mind.

AB: not realistic
You would be better attacking White at the top with a splitting move.]

;W[kg];B[lg];W[lf];B[mf];W[lh]TR[ih][jh][kh][ij][jj]C[Even now I ignored the danger in which my marked stones were.

AB: now you understand better why the L13 black move i showed is important.

And you decision is correct. you have to take that stone in atari. if you are attacked your 3 stones will survive continuing the attack on the top white group.... That groups is still not safe.]
;B[kf];W[li];B[kj];W[lj];B[kl];W[lk];B[jl];W[il]C[This fight was hard. I thought, it would decide the game.]

(;B[mm]TR[lf]C[AB: Why didn't you defend ??? That is the most important move.

considering the complications of the variation, I understand your move. All this complication is because you did not play L13.

Well, looking at how the game developed in the next few moves, your move is good.   Go back to move 110 and see how unimportant K10 was.]
