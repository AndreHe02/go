C[In this game, please provide input on the direction of play for B as well as on the order in which i make particular moves.

If at all possible, kindly estimate my true strength as after playing (and winning) against higher ranked players in local club as well as online, i believe i am somewhat stronger than 10k.

Thank you.];B[qd];W[dp]C[jraitsev2 [10k\]: hello. have a good game]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]C[This is my absolute favorite opening for B now]
;W[jd];B[cf];W[bd]C[B16 - strong responce

I don`t know much about joseki, but I don`t like this b 16, it seems slack to me playing on second line in the begining.
Looks more like an end game move.
In this position a pincer seems proper(works fine with d4)]
;B[fc]LB[db:A]TR[jd]C[B is aiming at A


This is not good because of white marked stone black can come under attack and will lose on one of the sides.]

(;W[ch]LB[ee:A][fe:C][ef:B]C[this is bad  for white, better at  A, B, C to aim on both black stones, this helps black.]
;B[ef];W[cg]C[i don't know about this move, does not seem right

white make another wrong move c12 doesn`t need help, right now is urgent to keep black split so I`ll consider f16
in this position];B[bf];W[df];B[de];W[dg];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[bb];B[ld]TR[jd]C[Putting more pressure on marked stone

good];W[fe];B[ee];W[gd];B[gc]C[Strong];W[hc]LB[hd:A]C[A does not work]
;B[ff];W[he];B[fh]C[B needs to make itse;f more or less alive before anything else]
;W[dj]TR[bf]C[good move, B pays high price for its agressiveness

I don`t see a high price here, white left side is worthless at this moment because of marked stone, black is fine]
;B[hg];W[jf]LB[cm:A]C[A would have been better for W

I don`t think so, like I said before not much value on the left for white, better on the right, r10 or r11]
;B[gj]C[B gets into center and is almost alive - again i see bigger and better moves but i feel that making this group alive is of upmostr importance

unuseful move, black was already alive, better on the right  Q9, or Q10. 
A shimari in lower right with R5 is another option.];W[em]C[bad move - too high]
;B[cn]C[B can safely invade

too early];W[cl];B[bp];W[cp];B[bq];W[cr]LB[dn:A]C[C2 - bad move
Locally, A would have been better i think

 disagree, C2 is  good, see  next variation];B[br];W[bm];B[bo]

(;W[bn];B[cq];W[dr];B[dq];W[eq];B[ep];W[fq];B[eo]C[B is alive]
;W[jp]LB[ih:A][qj:C][gl:B]C[small

W shouls chase B with A or B

or play a move like C, which is bigger than marked move

White group on lower side could be attacked while making cash so it  is kind of  urgent to reinforce that group for white.

However K4 seems to be a little bit too far to realy help white group, J4 is better I think]
;B[pj]C[B looks strong now];W[rj]C[unusual invasion, i was not sure how to respond to this]

;B[qe];W[rc];B[rd]C[B gets here much more than W
Marked stone is needed for ...];W[sd];B[qc];W[rb]LB[kc:A][lg:B]
C[Question, what goes first - A or B? and why?

B seems the right answer to me.
Why? B worth a lot of points and second, A makes your center group weaker somehow, see variation for black A]
;B[kc]TR[rd]C[marked stone is needed for possible scenario i thought of see var]
;W[jc]C[with the marked stone in position black can`t make too much eye space in the upper side]

(;B[lg];W[le];B[me];W[lf];B[mf];W[kd];B[lc];W[ql];B[ie]C[this move was a probe

???
A probe to what? To see if white tenuki here?];W[if];B[pl];W[qj]

TR[pm]C[Please comment next moves as i tried (and failed) to capture marked stones]

(;B[nn]C[hmmm, maybe is better to attack from the lower side while making some points there and also prepearing to attack e2 group if you have the chance]
