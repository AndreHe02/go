C[Ah, a 13x13 game.  Small enough for a quick game but large enough to allow for strategic and tactical fun.]
;B[kc];W[cj];B[cd];W[jk]
(;B[df]MA[ji][ki]C[The marked spaces feel better.  Plays as an approach and an extension.]
;W[kg]
(;B[le]LB[jg:A][lg:B][ji:C]TR[le][kc]MA[jf][ej]C[If I want to compete on the right side (as I did): are any of the labeled places better than the one i played? Or should I play somewhere else on the board? What are big moves? The same question applies to the subsequent moves.

Your 3-3 stone guarentees the corner.  M-9 is a very weak move that allows white to play K-9 or K-10.    The marked spaces look better.  Remember, you are mapping out territory for now, so don't get emotional about that space between your two corners yet.]
;W[gc]TR[gc]C[Is this invasion a good idea? How to refute it if not?

You cannot refute it.  You play it to your advantage.  Play to your stronger side, keep sente, then invade the lower side.]

(;B[hb]MA[hd][ec]C[Bad, the other side or a shoulder hit is better.]
;W[ge];B[eb]TR[eb]MA[le][hb]C[We both think (now) that this is a bad move. Do you have any suggestions?   It is the same as the other two moves on the second line.  Rarely will you need to play there this early except to block.  All those on the 3 line instead would do the same job, but control more territory also.]
;W[gj];B[ch];W[ei];B[eh];W[fh]TR[fh]C[How to react to previous black move? Is D5 better, Are there other better moves???

This is good, see the territory white blocks off?];B[di];W[eg]
MA[dj]C[D-4 much better.];B[dj];W[ej];B[ek]C[D-3 much stronger.  takes corner with no bad weaknesses.]
;W[dh];B[dg];W[eh]C[Waste, plus white gave up the corner.];B[ck]
TR[ck]C[Is C5 a better move than C3? Why?

Think of all the moves that led to this.  How could you have played to avoid this?

C-3 works.  C-5 also works in a different way.];W[cg];B[bg]
C[C-5 a must here.  D-3 also works];W[ci];B[dk];W[bh];B[cf]
;W[ch];B[bf]TR[bf][gl][bj]MA[ck][dk][ek][dj][di]C[Is this move necessary? Why? Better moves??

No, it is a endgame move.  Endgame begins when all groups are settled (alive).   Blacks marked group needed that move more.]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[gl];B[el];W[fm];B[dm]TR[dm]C[Bad move, we think, but how to make live as black? What are the correct moves, and in what order?

Its a damn good move if you want to save black.  Its the latter ones that lose it.]
;W[bk]
(;B[em]C[See variation.  Also, notice how white could not play E-1?]
;W[bl];B[bm];W[bj];B[fe]TR[fe]MA[ie]C[OK black lost the left lower corner, but now: how to proceed? We would like to get your view on the whole-board situation.

Black loses. But I think F-9 needs to be J-9.];W[ff]
(;B[ee]TR[ee]C[Unnecessary? Better moves?];W[lg]TR[lg]C[We now think J7 is better. Is that right? Are there still better moves to take/strengthen the right lower corner?]
;B[jf];W[ig];B[jg];W[jh];B[if];W[hh]TR[hh]C[Is H8 (or any other move...) better?]

(;W[lf]TR[lf]C[Are there better way' s to proceed here, and reduce the black area in the right upper corner?

Well, white leads by 30 points but consider the following.]
;B[kf];W[ki];B[kd];W[me];B[md];W[mf];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[ag]
;B[af];W[ah]C[White wins by 30.  Keep playing and enjoying Go.  Hope my review helps.]
