AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,
there were a couple of invasions by white which i think i didn't handle properly.
I let white devellop many kos, which he was sure he could win something from.
Of course there were some obvious blunders as well which i didn't spot during the game.
but overall, the biggest problem during this game was probably the direction of play, or maybe I was trying to kill the invading stones too much.
thanks for the review

G: Hi,

I'll try to answer your questions as much as I can. I have inserted many possible variations just to see how else one might have proceeded.

After looking at the game here are a couple of general observations: 

Sometimes you both made small moves when there were much bigger ones on the board. I guess we (kyu players) have a tendency to want to settle a fight before moving on even when the last moves are only about a few points.

You both have ignored the left hand side for a very long time even though it was unsettled and you have fought about much fewer points instead. Did it look too complicated or was there an other reason?

When fighting make an effort to look at more possible moves both locally and globally. 

To answer your question: I think you had a good chance to kill when you tried. You did make some mistakes and so weren't successful, but that's another question.


I hope this review is helpful. Feel free to send me email if you have any further questions.]

;W[fd];B[gf];W[hd];B[cn]C[G: I think this is too small as there is much space in the bottom or on the top extending your Q16 stone.]
;W[cd]C[G: Very passive, but it certainly puts more pressure on black's row 14 stones.]
;B[jp]C[G: Good.];W[qf]
(;B[qh];W[of];B[nd];W[mf];B[rd]C[maybe M16 first aiming at L15 is better ?

G: not sure about that but if you want to protect the corner I would suggest R16 instead of S16. An invasion at R17 can still get very messy.]
;W[le];B[lc];W[kc];B[on];W[lp]C[G: You both seem to like this pattern 8-).]
;B[jn]C[is K6 without the 26-27 exchange better ?

G: I think this is better since white is more closed in. You have a nice moyo forming in the lower left quadrant but you also have a reasonably safe territory on the right edge.]
;W[qp];B[ro]C[G: Too small. Playing on the second line should be left for the endgame. Consider if you don't play here and white does: it's only about four points. Lucky for you that White answers.]
;W[rp];B[eq]C[G: This is very small. Did you know that even G3 -- together with the existing D4 and C6 -- prevents white from living in the corner? It's worth trying it out  as few people seem to know about this.]

;B[lf]LB[kg:B][lg:A]C[Was this cut sound ?
White's reaction carved the game, but he could have played otherwise.
White could have got strong influence by playing L13 and sacrificing his stones, or he could have pushed further towards the center instead of attacking the cutting stone, don't you think ?

G: The cut turned out to be ok as white lost the stones on the right, but that wasn't necessary, so I don't know if this cut is so great. I probably would have preferred to settle the left.]

C[Black to play now.
Which moves would you suggest ?

G: Ouch. 8-). I'll try anyway:

Let's look at the situation first. Even without the stones on the left of row 14 you are ahead, but he is stronger than you so your advantage may not be enough.

Have you given up your stones on the left of row 14? If not you have to do something quickly. If white make the first move there, you're in trouble.

Connecting on C8 is alsoa goo idea.

You can capture the M10 group and secure the right side whatever white answers. 

You can try to cut off white's D8 stone completely by playing at F7. This would give you a huge territory on the left.

Since white's group on the top right is not completely dead yet (as it turns out) you might play a safety move there. I'm not sure what is best but any reasonable black stone there would make it very hard for white to live or sneak out.]
