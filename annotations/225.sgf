C[Hello Alan-

My name is Barry.  I play on NNGS as bconwil.   I will try to make my comments mostly towards black.  I hope you find them helpful.   Feel free to email me directly if you have any questions regarding my comments.  I would be glad to clear up or correct any weak points (or mistakes :-) ).  I have made many comments to a true beginner and tried to bring in a few basic concepts and terminology.

Although black won this game by just a few points, a seemingly small oversight at the end cost black almost forty points.   This indicates that black played a solid game with just an expensive lapse at the end.  While its a little tough to point out tips when you could have won by almost forty points, I did the best I could.  ;-)]

LB[iq:a]C[A move at "a" (j3) is a popular opening called the Chinese Opening.


Also, I have read that it is good for beginners to play openings on the star points.   This allows them to learn the josekis for those configurations and that knowledge transfers easily to handicap games.]
;W[cm];B[dn]C[While I understand your wish to take advantage of whites slack move, I think d6 leaves you with poor shape when the sequence evolves.  A more typical response would have been at]
;W[dm];B[gp]LB[co:b]C[Perhaps I should have done more to secure the corner?    No, I think the corner is fine for now.  Putting another stone in the corner would lead you to be over concentrated in that area.  There are still other big points left on the board.]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[M3 is a good move.  You attack the white stone while making your stones stronger.  In your opening that is a good rule of thumb.]
;W[no]
(;B[qq]C[R3 is too defensive.  Q6 would be a typical response when white runs to the middle from a pincher.  (see var)  The variation is considered a joseki sequence.  While I don't recommend that you study joseki at your level, sometimes it helps me to find out what the joseki would be just to compare the final results.  You used to be able to get a free software joseki dictionary in sgf format from http://www.teleport.com/~kogo/index.htm.]
;W[lo];B[kp];W[ko]C[White might have done better attacking with q6.  He would still be strengthening his stones and attacking yours.]
;B[pe];W[qd];B[qe];W[rd];B[re];W[nc];B[ne]LB[nc:c][re:b]C[Would a play at c, looking for an upper center foothold been better? Was trying to balance the potential loss down the right side against the possible gain between 'c' and 'a'

"a" did not show up on my diagram; however,
S15 could have been played at k16 or k17 and when approached by white you could have extended to the other side. (see var)  I do not worry too much about the loss if white creeped along the second line.  There is a saying that the fourth line is the line of influence, the third line is the line of territory and the second line is the line of defeat.]

(;W[gc];B[ld];W[jd];B[df]C[Black may have been better off at d12. It would have allowed a better follow up move.  White could have put a lot of pressure on the black stone at d14.]
;W[dj]C[White should have atacked at C12 leaving you with a choice of trying to split the groups or run for the center.]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[de]C[White should have played at c12 to squeeze black.]
;B[cj]C[Making a connection move here was too ambitious.  Look at how you stone is far away from its support while white is a short jump away from a nice 2 stone pillar.  C 11 would have been better.

When attacking think safety first.  Don't throw a stone in to be gobbled up unless you are trying to force your opponent into a weak shape.]
;W[ci];B[di]C[This series I think I did alright with, but better moves sugestions are welcome.

While the following sequence turned out satisfactory for you, it was more because white missed some opportunities to attack.]
;W[bj];B[ch];W[ck];B[ee]C[Following is a variation that white could have used to give you a poor compact shape.]

(;W[ed];B[ff];W[ei]C[Instead of giving black a chance to to connect with d12, white should have played there  and split your two stones.]
;B[dh];W[eh];B[eg];W[bh];B[bg]C[White could have given you problems with an attack at c13.  This was a result of your over reaching move back at c10.]

(;W[fe];B[ef];W[ag];B[cg]LB[af:B]C[Seems to me I didn't play this correctly but was fortunate that white did not run down the line starting at B    The move you had was ok.  I think your problems started a little earlier.  Regardless of what white did, your group was alive.]
;W[gh];B[lg]C[While this extension is not necessarily a bad move (that I can tell), why not try to attack his weak group at the bottom while giving yourself some thickness.]
;W[jg];B[li];W[ll];B[on];W[nn];B[jo];W[oo];B[po];W[om];B[pn]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[ql];B[pl]C[Good cut.  White overextended and you utilized your suport from the q10 stone]

Yes but it was a small loss.];B[rc];W[se];B[sf];W[sd];B[rf]
;W[od];B[mc];W[nb];B[pd];W[qc];B[oe];W[gf];B[jj]C[Good attack!  You're playing from your strong stones and jumping into white's moyo.]
;W[jl];B[bc]C[I don't think this was the best move because this group was already alive and the sequence ended in gote, i.e. white got to take the initiative.  If you would have continued your attack in the middle with h10, I think you could have done white more damage.]
;W[cb];B[af];W[ah];B[bf];W[bb];B[bd];W[hj];B[cn]C[Good move.  That move was worth a lot of points.]
;W[bn];B[bo];W[an];B[ao];W[bm];B[mj];W[kk];B[kj];W[ij];B[jh]
;W[ih];B[ii]C[This move could have waited.  You know how white will respond and you lose sente.  (Sente is the ability to move and control where the game is played, i.e. making your opponent respond to your moves.)

Perhaps a move at e9.];W[hi];B[ji];W[mq];B[mr];W[lr];B[kq];W[nr]

;W[ec];B[ge];W[he];B[fc];W[fb];B[fe]C[Should have played 'a' instead of filling, Yes?

The "a" did not show up on my file but you should have played at e18, w d17 and b d19.]
;W[eb];B[gd];W[hd];B[tt];W[qp];B[qo];W[rp]LB[ro:b]C[Other than plays I needed to have made a while back not sure if there was a better way to play here, except perhaps 'b'.

Yes, you are right that b would have been better.  I think this mistake cost about forty points.  A good general rule is that one eye will beat no eyes.  So if you get into small battles and are having problems reading it out, lean towards forming an eye.
