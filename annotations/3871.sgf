AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[[Agi\] Hello, I'm Agilis, KGS 10k, and I'll be your reviewer for this game. If there's any questions or comments you'd like to make,I would love to hear from you, email me at agi.projectmail@gmail.com.

As always, variations are used more for illustrating ideas than to show ideal play. Especially here. Because I am only 10k, I obviously can't fully analyize or guess what a 1d white can do.]
;W[nq]C[i was fine kureo accets a game with me . to meet a 1d is very interesting . I was of course hopeless to win but hopeful to learn and to enjoy. I choose 6 handicap in order that it may be harder than with 9 ( or more)...]

(;B[pn]C[[Agi\] Q6 is a typical response to a corner approach. However in a handicap game. I feel it is somewhat slack. To put it simply:

White's the one outnumbered on the board. Why isn't black black pressuring white and taking control of the situation?

Instead I'd recommend a pincer. (see variation)];W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[[Agi\] The "kick" of E3 is a mistake. (discussed later)]
;W[fp];B[dn];W[jp]LB[dn:C][fp:B][hp:4][jp:D][lp:2][eq:A][hq:1]
[lq:3]C[[Agi\] D is considered to be an "ideal" extension from the 2 white stones. Notice the beautiful framework white has on the bottom now.

Additionally, the A/B exchange makes the formation much stronger. points 2 and 3 are common invasion points later. points 1 and 4 are much more difficult to execute now because of A/B

So again, Black is not putting as much pressure as he could on white. (go back a bit to see possible alternatives to A)]
;B[jd];W[nc]
(;B[pb]TR[oc][pc][qc][qe][pf][qf][qg]C[[Agi\] A submissive move that doesn't fully protect the corner. White can later do something that will be hard to deal with around the marked points.

Although white is a 1d, and black is understandably afraid of white's strength. Fear will lose you the game before you play 20 moves. With black's 6-stone head start, black should be able to fight back strongly.
(see variation)];W[ne]
(;B[cc]TR[ne][pf]C[i wonder if the san san was the best play at this time ..

[Agi\] Black should be looking to develop and to attack. White is running ahead of black on the side and can move to isolate the corner. Playing away to take a few points of territory is *not* recommended]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[gc];B[hd];W[he]
(;B[jf]SQ[ie]C[[Agi\] A mistake in shape, it gives white the chance to double-peep later which will cause problems when white chooses to play it. 

Worse, it will take one whole move by black to fix the flaw right now if he becomes worried about white playing it.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[cg];B[ce];W[ie];B[md];W[oc]C[[Agi\] This is a good idea to learn. Looking for a way to respond to your opponent that also counts as an attack instead of simply connecting.]
;B[mc]C[[Agi\] Moving at N17 seems dubious. Usually, you need a very good reason to not connect aginst a peep. This makes the corner extremely weak]
;W[pc]C[[Agi\] White pushing in here was probably automatic.]

(;B[pg]C[[Agi\] This move doesn't particularly connect anything to anything, or attack something. Being on the 4th line, it is also not very secure territory either. (see variations)]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[pe];B[pf];W[od]
(;B[ng]C[it was difficult for me to get alive the two sides and the corner

[Agi\] It is usually better to get out into the center than to live and get surrounded. If groups connect, you don't have to worry about life.

Here, O13 does little to no work. White is alive in the corner. The top group is in danger because of the shape weakness earlier, and O13 does not help it connect. Instead...]
;W[je];B[ke];W[id]
(;B[ic]C[[Agi\] this move, saving 2 stones, gets you into a great deal of trouble.]
;W[jc];B[kd];W[hb]C[weakness of my shape...

[Agi\] Yes. (go back a bit for variation/discussion)]
(;B[me]LB[mf:A]TR[ng]C[[Agi\] This doesn't connect the 2 stones. it makes a knight's move. and those can be cut. Thanks to the surroundings, a move at A instead would be a connection]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[ql];B[pq];W[qo]TR[pl][ql][qm][pn]C[[Agi\] This is a somewhat advanced abuse of your shape here. The situation is simple, either you connect, or white will attempt to cut.]

(;B[rm]C[[Agi\] this is an agressive splitting move. You are betting that you can make the corner live, and can kill/damage something in the fighting.]
;W[po]
(;B[ro]C[[Agi\] a strange move that doesn't really connect anything to anything If you're going to fight, you must Fight.]
;W[qp];B[rl];W[oo]C[how i finish this fight  in two broken weak groups !! ??

[Agi\] the short answer is, because you didn't connect when white peeped.

Notice, since you did not take the P5 point, white took it and now is safe.]
;B[om];W[nf];B[mf];W[mg]C[[Agi\] that cut that I previously mentioned comes to pass.]
;B[lg];W[mh];B[ol];W[re];B[rf];W[qf];B[qg];W[rg]C[[Agi[ This ko isn't very important. There are some simpler variations]

(;B[qe];W[lh];B[jg];W[qf];B[sf]C[[Agi\] Again, just give up the stones, they're worthless to you.]
;W[rh];B[qk];W[qe];B[nh];W[kg];B[kf];W[lf];B[kh];W[lj];B[mj]
;W[ni];B[oh];W[mi];B[ki];W[mk];B[oi];W[nj];B[ok]LB[rj:B][pl:A]
[qn:C]C[[Agi\] This seems unnecessary. A is 1 eye, regardless of whether you play this move or not. B and C are easy places to make another eye. There are other places to make eyes also.]
;W[jk];B[qi];W[ih];B[ii];W[hh]C[[Agi\] An extremely risky situation...]

(;B[hj];W[gj];B[ch]LB[lg:A][gj:C][io:B]C[[Agi\] White is expending all her energy into attacking that black group in the center. Tenuki is not an option if you want to try to live.

White seems to have a number of plans.if white takes A, it effectively reduces black to 1 eye.

The white stones around B  have good potential to develop the bottom territory more while attacking the weak black group.

And finally, the stones that will later form a white wall around C will help when white invades the left side. 

None of these ideas involve black dying, but white would welcome that too.]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[ij];B[gi];W[hi]C[dame question than before how my stones are separated ? and now i am afraid for the life my L16 group and ...

[Agi\] At this point, it feels that if white wanted to try hard enough in the ko, white could outright kill L16.]
;B[lg];W[dg]C[[Agi\] This is a difficult choice. Black  will probably die if the ko is lost.]
;B[le]C[...and i killed L12 and M14 for eyes .];W[bh];B[ci]
;W[bf];B[be];W[db];B[cb];W[ec];B[ab];W[ck]C[[Agi\] this is the price of life for L16. White gets to undermine the left side, and threaten to surround all the loose stones around E10]
;B[dk];W[cl];B[cm]C[[Agi\] This is somewhat greedy, since D10 is in grave danger. However, black needs both in order to really make a game of it.]
;W[dl];B[el];W[bm];B[gl];W[co];B[cp];W[dm];B[bo];W[cn];B[do]

;W[bg]C[i thought my left side group E9 had enough space in south to get one more eye ...]
;B[bq];W[dh]
(;B[di];W[hm]C[... but i didnot play there . Was it possible to save my group ?

[Agi\] Saving it seems to be beyond my abilities. Yes there is space in the middle, but white is thick all around, and it's a relatively narrow space.

Because white is alive all around, you have very few chances to make forcing moves to help you live. White has his hands free to poke every last eye out.

To go back, there's another idea I might suggest.];B[lq];W[lp]

The result -96.5 for w - is severe but obvious . But i am ready to listen all your advices to improve my game .

i already thank you

[Agi\] The main highlight of this game was that early on, black didn't try to attack white, giving her secure and living positions that were used to launch attacks.

The second highlight was black often ignored white's peeps, in situations where black should have connected, and instead played away.

The key to black on handicap is to cut and split where possible, keep things simple where possible, and pressure white whenever you can. If white is busy trying to live, she's not coming up with nasty surprises.]
)
(;B[im]C[[Agi\] This is a shot a saving the group. But things are looking bleak.]
;W[hl];B[hm];W[gn];B[gm];W[km]C[[Agi\] that second eye is getting harder and hrder to find.]
;B[kn];W[jn];B[ko]C[[Agi\] However, you do have one thing to use. You can use the Threat of connecting out,  to get forcing moves. in order to damage the bottom]

;W[mr];B[or];W[lr];B[lp];W[iq];B[ms]C[[Agi\] There are likely more ambitious sequences that may work better for black, but this is a good enough example of the idea.

There might be variations of this sequence where white can survive, but Black should be able to pick up enough liberties to try living in the corner, killing R4 in the process.]
)))
(;B[hi]C[[Agi\] it seems best to keep pushing. Running down straight towards white is what white wants.]

(;B[jc]C[[Agi\] It is important to learn to give stones up. Trying to save the two stones led to more weaknesses in your shape.]

(;B[hq]LB[jq:A][lq:B]C[[Agi\] Again, a pincer of some sort feels more active. Since white is on the 3rd line, a low pincer seems a bit more appropriate, but a high pincer might be playable also.

The pincer separates the bottom two white stones. This time, white needs to take care of 2 weak groups. Cutting and connecting is one of the the foundations of go.]

(;B[lq]C[[Agi\] A pincer (high or low, near or far, doesn't matter too much which one) is very active here. The bottom is this big wide open space where white could try to make a base. A pincer would force white to work for it.]
