C[ This game was played between me and Justin, a friend of mine to whom I taught go. We have been playing  for a little over two months now, one game peer week. This is about 8th match.

At the moment I am 15k on KGS . As you go through the game, and based on our moves, could you estimate roughly what level you think my friend is? If you think he is about my level (after all, we played this game evenly), could you let me know if  this seemed to you a  15k level game? (I am not sure how stable my KGS ranking is)

Throughout the SGF I have made some comments and asked some specific questions. However, I would appreciate very much any general comments on tactics and strategy both for Black and White. Also, any comments on Fuseki (particularly on W's fuseki) would be very welcome.

Thank you very much.

Brenno];B[qd]C[HI, My name is Tim, and i'll try to review your game.
Every time i comment, i'll proceed it with: "TIM:" so you can more easily see where i commented.

Let's start!];W[pp];B[dp];W[cd];B[ec];W[ee]C[TIM:
This move is for when you want to play a territory based game imo.]
;B[cc]
(;W[dd];B[dc];W[oq]C[TIM: 
This is a small move. Sure it almost secures the corner, but no sente (forehand, the opponent needs to answer)
B can attack D16 or play anywhere he wants now];B[oc]C[TIM:
Not bad, but all the black stones are on the upper side]
(;W[cq]C[Q: Too early for W to invade? What are the pros and cons of invading at this time?

TIM: 
Too early
the standard answer to P17 is R10
If black gets to play these two points, he has a strong formation.
the only pro is that you'll get the corner.
But white still has a weak group at the upper left side. And white will get shut in on the lower left. So, no advantage at this point]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gq]
(;W[gr]C[TIM:

not the correct move.]
(;B[bq];W[br];B[cr];W[dr];B[ar]C[Q: B tried a change in the standard sequence here. What do you think of it? I didn't like the way W got to the center...


TIM;
I preferred that black would keep white low, like i showed a little before.]
;W[cs]
(;B[bp]C[TIM:

like this b ends in gote (he has no forehand)
This is and endgame move. Sure it is big, but not the biggest move right now.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[jq];B[pj]C[TIM
B gets strong up there];W[pl]
(;B[rk]C[Q: Too small? What are the big moves on the board right now? Maybe D10 / K16?

TIM:

Too small indeed.
What does B want with this?];W[rm];B[dj]C[TIM
good move
Even a little higher might be good to push white a little. But then you might get a fight]
;W[nk]C[TIM

small again. This will make b stronger on the right side!]

;B[ke];W[kd];B[le];W[ld];B[me];W[md];B[jd];W[nd];B[ie];W[jf]
C[TIM:
white dies in the upper right side and his moyo in the centre is totally gone]
;B[if];W[nc];B[ob];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb];W[hc];B[hb];W[ic]
;B[ib]C[At this point W resigned.

Tim:

You should both look at fuseki moves, joseki. Learn some, and some of the variations. But it is important to know why you play a certain move. What is your objective. 
B got lucky a few times.
W needs to make sure every group is alive, connected,... etc.

if you have any questions left, you can contact me any time

cheers!!])
(;W[jh];B[lj]C[Tim:
give up those 2 stones, keeps the dragon smaller.
But white is already far behind now.]))

Mistake from b! white didn't see it]))

This is bigger.])

so is this]))

I prefer this move, if you were to make another move over there:-)]

Or why not this one?
B get's a nice moyo on the left side!]))

you see? Try to invade that!
much more difficult!]))

Better to invade, or something like that]))

(;B[hq];W[hr];B[iq];W[ir];B[jq];W[jr]C[TIM: 
you see? White gets a miserable 10 points or so, and b gets a nice strong wall.]

(;W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn]SQ[ch][dh][ci][di][cj][dj]C[TIM: 
White can play now...
Should play around the marked places.
If not, b will get very strong at the left side too!]))
(;W[qj]C[TIM:

this is better for white. B stays on the upper side.
Here you see that O3 would've been better than P3]))
