RE[B+12.50]

C[[Malweth\] My comments will be preceded by "[Malweth\]" (which I use on KGS/IGS). Toward the end of the game you asked about the proper way to go about an invasion - see the Move 66 variation. Many variations have been added - I suggest using the SGF viewer (and IGS client) "ggo" for its ghost varations and branch jumping (I mention this because you requested I mark the moves I would consider - I typically did this in variation).
Hope this helps. I am 10-kyu KGS (and hopefully hitting 9-kyu soon :)

For the reviewer:
I am interested in knowing what my biggest mistakes were. I was playing white, but comments on blacks play would also be useful. I have commented on a couple of moves that with hindsight I would not do. Ranks are IGS.
Thanks in advance.];B[dp];W[pd];B[po];W[dd];B[oq]
(;W[jp]C[[Malweth\] I typically prefer the K3 reply to black's shimari at P3/P5, but this is mainly a stylistic point. K4 should be ok. The reason I personally like K3 is because a black response at M3 doesn't undermine a base for this stone.]

(;B[no]C[[Malweth\] This seems like a slow play by black as this corner territory is already enclosed. I realize black wants to put pressure on K4, but K4 isn't in much danger at this point, and a black play at O6 would accomplish the same (assuming black would like to emphazise the right side).]

(;W[mp]TR[cj][cn][jd][qj]LB[fq:A]C[Maybe this would have been better at F2? Or should I play somewhere else? This move obviously strengthens black.

[Malweth\] This play aims at the cut at P4. This play touches black, which should never be done when attacking. You aren't currently in need of strong defense, so building a base in the other direction looks better. Additionally, you leave your underneath open for black here and in any case this black group cannot be cut. See variation.

Playing elsewhere is possible, but brings up additional danger to white. the move at A is probably your best, but it has drawbacks for white as well. Both are explored in variation.]

(;B[np]C[[Malweth\] As shown in variation, this isn't necessary for black.]

(;W[mq]C[This move, having seen blacks reply doesn't look good to me.

[Malweth\] You are now forced into over concentrated position - the 2 point jump is small here (K4) - the problem with N3 is the direction. You've been playing influence moves in this area, and then decend for territory. N5 is better, and if black ignores it, it's even better. See variation.]
;B[hp]
(;W[cn]C[[Malweth\] You have a very weak group, tenuki is a bad idea - the problem is that if you don't tenuki, black is likely to get a good result... If I were playing black, a pincer of this stone looks good as it will give white two weak groups to look after.]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[cm];B[em];W[dj]C[[Malweth\] Black now has fairly secure corner territory in both of his corners.]

(;B[ok]C[[Malweth\] This 5th line play is dubious - it looks better to kakari the Q16 stone at R14. If pincered, black's thickness will help in the battle. White should try to take advantage of this play if possible. Black will likely get some secure side territory, but R11 is probably sente.]

(;W[jc];B[qf]
(;W[rd]C[[Malweth\] It would be very good for white if black invaded at the 3x3 here... (Before S16)]
;B[of];W[nd];B[lk];W[ir];B[hr];W[iq];B[hq];W[jn];B[hn]
(;W[jl]LB[jl:A]C[Not sure how efficient k8 is. Maybe n14 better? I have tried a variation.

[Malweth\] The real question is whether the bottom side group needs escape. It doesn't seem to, so enclosure by black is safe. the A stone travels through neutral territory and only threatens to escape. N14 would reduce black's moyo while increasing your own - which is very big right now.]
;B[lf];W[je];B[hk]
(;W[jj]C[[Malweth\] Again, do you need escape? If you (completely) protect this large upper left you should win.]
;B[ln];W[mo];B[mn];W[ko];B[dc]C[[Malweth\] Here's black's invasion. I think black could probably reduce easily with a kakari around D14. Escape seems possible to the right group at M14 or the LL group at H9. Black could do damage to his groups, though.

If black wants this type of invasion, the 3x3 point is also very open.]
