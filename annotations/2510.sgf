C[In general I want to know how I could have improved my opening in this game, and how I might have invaded some of the areas that developed for black later on.  I also have some specific questions listed during the game.

Thank you for your time.



I'm lucky enough to have a pro-level teacher who stresses two things:

1) Patience 
2) Do not be greedy

Patience in making sure your groups are safe and secure
Not being greedy means giving your opponent his due - it is not realistic to severely reduce a solid corner enclosure if your opponent has made two moves securing it.

Playing all over the  place, grabbing big points is going to leave you with weak groups and get you in trouble.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc]
(;W[pj]LB[po:A]C[This seems like the correct play here, but it is pretty lonely on that side.  Should I have played on the 3rd line and tried to live on that side, or is playing high the right way to go here?


Best play would be A - GOGOD (up to Dec/03) shows the most common move is at A with 137 matches.

If you're going to play in the middle play on the 3rd line as it will be easier to establish a base.]
;B[qo];W[jp]C[Two shimaris on his two corners.  They end up counting for the majority of his points.  Again, is K4 a good response?



I'd play on the third line, with 4 stones on the 4th line you must now commit to an influence/moyo/centre strategy.]
;B[cj]
(;W[cm]TR[dd]C[I'd extend from the other star point as it looks lonely.]
;B[cf];W[fd];B[dh]C[This seems slow for black.  Wouldn't C13 have been better for him?


Nothing wrong with being patient and making sure your groups are safe from attacks.]

(;W[jc]LB[qf:A]C[Is this too aggressive?  ie am I extended too far?

This is OK.  I'd want to get to play A, however....see variation]
;B[lq];W[pr]LB[rd:A]C[I thought this would be a good aji play for later.  It kinda worked out later, but I don't really know what I am doing with these type of moves; I'm just imitating.  Was there a better way to approach and reduce this corner?


This kind of probe is better at S16, your options at Q2 are quite limited because of B M3.  But better right now to be patient and not play here yet.  Wait until your Q10 is secure first.]
;B[or];W[kq];B[lp];W[jn];B[qh]C[B already looks ahead to me.]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[rd]C[This looks as though W is jumping all over the place with no real plan.  

Either play this before you play Q12 or settle Q10 and Q12 first.

Patience is a virtue, especially in Go.];B[qc]C[A similar attempt as Q2, but this one doesn't work out at all.  What would have been a better approach to this corner?

First make sure the Q stones are safe and then W N17 is good enough for this area.  You can't expect total destruction of either of B's corners since he spent two moves in each to secure them.]

C[big profit for B....]
(;W[qm]LB[mc:A][dq:B]C[R7 to settle, or Q7 to influence center and maybe reduce black some what?



R7 is fine; N17 or D3 are also big points.];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp]

;B[cr];W[mc]LB[dm:A]C[There is bad aji for W at A];B[cc]C[I think this is outlandish for white.  If the corner lives the group at C14 is pressured by whites solid shape; however, I might be pushing my luck by seperating thses groups.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[eb];W[fb]C[This move is gote.]
;B[ec];W[fc]
(;B[gn]LB[ed:A]C[Should I go from below (G4) or above as I did?  And if I should go above is g8 more of a standard response?

Fixing the bad aji at A is more important at this stage.  It is also not easy to capture this stone because of the cut at D7.]

;W[jl]C[W too thin to capture B];B[fg]C[Pure misread on my part.  I thought the following sequence ended well for me.

Very nice move by B, only possible because his H group is solid.  

There is no way now to engineer a double-attack.];W[eh];B[eg]

B should've connected as he is clearly leading.]
