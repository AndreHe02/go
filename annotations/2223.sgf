C[Dear Reviewer,
I am playing White in this game. Relative to my level, I consider this game as a good one on my part, so I have chosen this one to learn where I can improve.
Thanks for your review in advance!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
;B[qo];W[dj]LB[jp:B][fq:A]C[Is it OK to play here like this? (The danger is I give Black a chance to close the second Shimari)


***** I suspose it is OK to play here, but you should be prepared for B to play at A or B.]
;B[jp];W[qf]LB[nc:A]C[**** I understand the desire to play in B's area, but I would generally think this is the wrong direction.  I would be more interested in playing at A so as to develop the hoshi stone in the upper left corner.]
;B[qh];W[qc]LB[qd:A]C[**** this is why i suggested playing from the other direction.  black is very happy to play at A.]

LB[me:A][pj:B]C[Is the pincer good when black has a stone on K4? Should have I played D6?


**** two things.  1) this move is too aggressive and you will most likely lose this stone.  2) since B did no play at A, I would ignore F3 and play at B to prevent black from perfecting his moyo.  without A, a white play at B is very strong.]
;B[cq]LB[gp:A]C[***** this is weak.  B should play at A.];W[cp]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[go]C[***** B really made a mess of things here.  He let you bully him with H3.]
;B[pk]C[****** since B ended in sente, he has now played a wonderful moyo move.]
;W[ld]LB[nd:A]C[**** i think this move is too slow.  I would play at A to directly put pressure on B.]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[hd]C[I would appreciate your opinion about the following sequence - did both players do the right thing?]
;W[ic];B[id];W[jd];B[gc];W[je]LB[gd:A]C[**** W should cut at A instead.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[hb];W[jb];B[db];W[cc]C[***** B gets a nice position.]
;B[dh];W[eg];B[cj];W[ck]C[Is this the correct way to play here?]
;B[ci];W[bk];B[eh]LB[gg:A];W[fg]LB[gg:A]C[***** jump to A instead]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[fj];W[gh]LB[ij:A]C[***** way too slow.  this play simply allows B to jump into the center and begin developing an even larger moyo.  Playing at A would be better.]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[fk];W[el];B[fh];W[he];B[gf]C[I guess black missed next move


*** no, he gave up two stones to keep access to the center.  in addition, if you play at G16, he plays F16 in sente, then cuts at G13.]
;W[gd];B[fd];W[ie];B[gg];W[hh];B[cf];W[ce];B[cg];W[cb];B[eb]
;W[be];B[ga];W[ig]C[Should I have played F18 instead to prevent getting two eyes?
I as afraid it is too dangerous since I am too thin on the outside


*** yes, absolutely.  Even if you are thin on the outside, you should force B to fight.  You let B live too easily.]
;B[fb];W[mf]LB[hk:A]C[****** wrong direction.  Play at A is better.  Keep pressure on black.]
;B[pf];W[op]LB[qm:B][oo:A]C[***** there are several better places to consider.  A or B would be my choice.]
;B[fl];W[em];B[mp]LB[oq:A]C[***** i think this is a bad move for b.  I would probably play at A.]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr]LB[qq:A]C[***** connect at A instead.  this move leaves a weakness at A.]
;W[on];B[pm];W[mq];B[lq];W[mo];B[nq];W[np];B[mr];W[ko];B[lo]
;W[ln]C[I have the feeling black played this sequence in a submissive way, leeting me close the center


***** not really.  B still has K4 and the wall at F9.  there is no danger of B being closed out of the center.]
;B[lp];W[mm];B[or];W[pn];B[qn];W[jo];B[ip];W[io];B[hp];W[gp]
;B[ho]LB[gq:A]SQ[fj][fk][fl]C[******* B should cut at A instead.  Huge profit for B and W gets a wall that is ineffective because of B's marked stones.]
;W[hn];B[fp];W[kp]C[******good];B[fo]C[Another error


**** this is OK for B.];W[jq]LB[dn:A]C[***** this is not urgent.   A is safer.  I don't see how black can save these stones.]
;B[gn];W[iq];B[bq]LB[eo:A]C[***** this is a mistake.  B should play at A.]
;W[dn];B[fn];W[hk];B[ng]LB[mk:A]C[***** this is a mistake.  It is urgent for black to play at A.]
;W[mg];B[hl];W[ik]LB[il:A]C[***** you are strong here, you should hane.]

;W[kb];B[an];W[bm]LB[am:A]C[**** why not A?];B[bj];W[ah]C[In the end game I made several simple errors, but fortunatley none was too severe...]

;B[ms];W[kq];B[mq];W[ol];B[pl];W[ml]LB[ok:A]C[***** push at A instead.]
;B[om];W[nn]LB[nl:A]C[***** connecting at A is bigger.   If black plays at O6, you just connect at O5.  If black plays at O5, you connect at O6.  Black gains more by your play here.]
