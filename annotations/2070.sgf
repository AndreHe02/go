C[shai:id like to know my general mistakes btw no need to tell me about the 2 groups i know why i lost them that is unless there was a way for them to live
shai:id also like to know places where i could have gotten more terretory and where theres a better move(hopefully you can cover all or at leest most)
Broege: The review was done using cgoban 1.9.12];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[op];W[dd];B[fe]LB[fc:A][fd:B][cc:C]C[shai: good move?
Broege: This move is very nonstandard - it does not push White too strongly. Common joseki moves are approaches at A, B (or symmetric points) or invasion at C. In this situation an approach would be more welcome.]
;W[dj];B[df]LB[pj:A][qp:B]C[shai: moving in=good?
Broege: It depends on your style. I'd rather try to develop myself (any point near A) or close LR corner (at B), but if you prefer fighting it's OK.]
;W[cc];B[fj]LB[ei:A][ek:B]C[Broege: This move seems too high, White can try to get territory on fifth line (i.e. by playing at B). How about A?]
;W[ei];B[ec];W[ce];B[de];W[kc];B[hq]LB[ic:A]C[Broege: After L17, the D15 group is weakened. A could strenghten it and put pressure on L17 stone. Then Black can play on the lower side.]
;W[dm];B[pj];W[qp];B[qo]LB[pn:A][qq:B]C[Broege: A and B are other common options.]
;W[pp];B[po];W[oq];B[rq]LB[np:A]C[shai:better move?
Broege: Perhaps simple A, building strong influence toward the center is enough. Black begins to create huge moyo - F10, Q10, H3 and O4.]

;B[nl]C[Broege: Now it is high time to take care of D15 group. Unless Black wants to discard it]
;W[ml];B[nk];W[mk];B[mj];W[nj];B[ni];W[lj];B[oj]LB[mi:A]C[Broege: Don't always kill a stone in atari. A would be better - the O10 cannot escape and Black is stronger here]
;W[mi];B[nj];W[li];B[jp];W[jo];B[ko];W[kn];B[kp]C[shai:where should i have moved after this
Broege: I think that Black should try to take control of the center - either by strengthening D15 group or by coming down from the H3 group. It might be already too late, though - D15 group is rather weak.]

C[Broege: You don't want to waste your time playing such moves. White could ignore it completely and still be safe, see the variations.]

(;W[bo];B[cs];W[bs];B[es];W[ar];B[bq];W[bp]C[shai where to now?
Broege: I think that now it is too late for Black to do anything. White has solidified his lead (remember marked areas at move 103, in a variation - White has gained some territory in the lower left) while Black gained nothing and is still weak in the center.
White could now just cruise to the victory.];B[ji];W[jk];B[jg]

[or]C[Broege: And now Black has to take over the center:
Solid potential territory for Black is (rather generously) marked with triangles - this gives about 50 points.
Solid potential territory for White is marked with squares - this gives about 80 points.
Including komi and prisoners this gives +40 for White. So Black has to do something in the center or the game is lost.]
