C[I am black.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[do];W[co];B[dp];W[cp]
;B[cn];W[ep];B[en]C[I like d6 instead of e6 for b because then w b6 can be answered at  b7, which it can't now.]
;W[gp]C[this w g6 look dangerous, since b can cut at c3, after which b will either capture the c4 stones or atari at e3 and then capture the e4 stone.]
;B[oc]C[as for studyng josekis i suggest the "get strong at joseki" books.]
;W[qj];B[jd];W[gc];B[cf];W[cd];B[di];W[bn]C[see why b d6 would have been better than e6 ?  now b can't answer at b7.]
;B[cm];W[qg];B[qm];W[nq];B[lp]C[I dont want white to make a moyo in this area but I leave the corner. What to do?  well, before w played b6, c3 would have been good.  actually, it still might be.]
;W[qq]C[as w, i would perhaps play O5 instead of r3 .];B[pq]
;W[pr];B[qp];W[rr];B[rq];W[qr];B[ro];W[no]C[the b m4 isn't doing much.  so i think b should have answered  q2 at p2 to keep w seperated.]
;B[iq];W[gq];B[mr];W[nr];B[mq];W[np];B[io];W[sq];B[rp];W[lc]
C[I think this invasion can be stopped. How?  seems too late to stop it to me.  but b should be thinking about how to use k16 and j5 and e6 to form large center and attak the m17 stone to help do that, as well as take advantage of the long extension at g17, for example by poking at f16.  one possible answer to m17 is to play L17 and if w plays M16, then b can jump to K14, and then keep the M17 stones separated from the R13 ones .  however, b doesn't have living shape at s5 yet so some of the subsequent splitting attack between the m17 stone and the r10 ones might be premature.  this trouble stems back to the choice of r4 instead of p2.]
;B[md];W[ld];B[le];W[me];B[ke]C[i think i may have played b L16 instead of L15 in order to fill a w liberty.  And then if w ataris, draw out of atari instead of letting w capture the n16 stone so easily.]
;W[nd];B[ic]C[the b J17 doesn't have much value unless the M17 stones are captured.]
;W[ge]C[if w just captures at n17, w has position on both sides of b's upper right corner.]
;B[ef]C[instead of b e14, since  w never captured at n17, b can play n17 and make the j17 stone worth something.]
;W[ed]C[once w bothered to play g15, i don't see that e16 is needed.  if b invades at e17, the trick is that w plays e16 and if b crawls to f17, w plays g16 and not f16.  instead of e16 i like w n17 which b should have taken.]
;B[bm];W[bo];B[cq];W[bq]C[instead of this w atari, suppose w ataris at E5 first.  Then b doesn't capture the e4 stone !]
;B[cr];W[br]C[suppose w played D2 instead of B2.  if b then plays B2, w can play A2.]
;B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[cs];B[fp]C[b got away with too much here.]
;W[go]C[it's unreasonable for w to attempt to save these stones now.  instead, how about O7 and start attacking the rightside b group ?]

(;B[fo]C[this b f5 is unimportant since if w plays here b can just capture a stone.  instead, b can play H7 and force w towards b's left side thickness.  see var 2 in previous move.]
;W[gn]
(;B[gr]C[this G2 lets w out completely.  w isn't about to make eyes here so instead of b G2 how about b J7 and keep w pressured.  see var 2 in previous move.]
;W[hr];B[fr];W[hq];B[ir];W[is];B[js]C[again, since w isn't threatening to make life here, b shouldn't be playing here.  b should be playing j7 instead which strengthens b and attacks w.]
;W[hs];B[jr];W[gl];B[el]C[this b e8 of little value.  if w plays here, b can answer at d9.  since b let w escape (see previous discussion) then instead of e8, n17 is still large for b.  also, s9 for b makes stability while reducing w.]
;W[im];B[ln]C[it's painful for b to be having to defend here when b should have attacked the w stones before (the g5 ones) .]
;W[nm];B[km];W[ik]C[i lik w k8 instead of j9 because it threatens L8.  if b answers k8 at L8, then w can continue with K10.]
;B[pk];W[nk]C[i like w r9 instead of o9, since r9 cramps the b group.  now that w has played O9, b can play r9 for stability.]
;B[pj];W[pi]C[maybe w should play r11 instead because with q11, b p11 becomes sente, as it threatens to cut at r11.]
;B[nc]C[forcing w to take at n17 still leaves b with problem of the L15 stones safety.  that's why i like b n17 instead of O17.]
;W[mc];B[od]C[this b p16 not as important as p11.  maybe w should answer this p16 with n14 to continue to attack L15 stones that b neglected.]

;W[mk];B[mi];W[mh];B[li];W[lh];B[kk];W[ih];B[hb];W[gb];B[if]
;W[jb]C[how about w g13 instead of k18 ?];B[kb];W[kc];B[hg]
;W[hh]C[w g13 instead of h12 keeps up some attack on the b stones.  as w, i'd also have my focus on the L10 cut, since the lower right b stones aren't alive yet.]
