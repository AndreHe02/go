C[Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game and lost by the komi (6.5 points). I need your help to really understand what I did wrong in this game. I went through it myself more than once, and I am still puzzled.
This game in a way represents my current ability, so understanding my mistakes here will help me to improve.
Thanks!

Hi,

I'm walther, my comments will be noted as HWC. I think that it's good that you think in terms of strong and weak, but it might also be helpful to count at all times. This means knowing what is actually solid territory, what is territory with a move added (and maybe can be reduced at a later stage of the game), and what is moyo. Counting will help you be patient, which is important, because a complete game is usually over 200 moves. My comments may not all be coherent, but I hope some of the ideas are helpful. You might also want to try to read some books on attacking. I hope my comments are helpful.

Walther];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[qf]C[HWC: this is unusual. Since white is fighting inside your sphere of influence, you should be able to get a good result from the beginning]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[nf]C[This is not quite standard - usually White plays around Q12. Did I respond well?]
;B[ld]C[HWC: This is one possibility. It keeps the q14 group weak, and starts to stake out some territory]
;W[qn]C[And now White leaves the first group unfinished, and invades on the other side. If Black respond with the diagonal attachment also here, this will leave Q10 quite isolated, so I responded with the pincer.

HWC: this seems like a bit much for white. two weak groups inside the sanrensei is almost an ideal situation for black.]
;B[ql];W[rp]C[White did not invade the 3-3 point, but rather fought to live here. I do not think this is the right approach, but I could not really punish him badly, as you will see later.

HWC: Why do you need to punish him badly? Did you expect to kill him outright? one of the keys to go, I think, is to only take what you can get.]

(;B[qq]C[HWC: This move doesn't feel good. It's usually used to block off part of the corner, but your other side is open. maybe build thickness, then attack the other group? But maybe this line of thought is ok, I'm not too sure. It does deny some eyespace, but black is left with some thing shape]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[on];B[np];W[jq]C[This was an important point. I could of course defend at around M3, but then White will take over the whole left side. So I played on the other side - but I am not too happy with the result.

HWC: This line of thought is a little greedy, and also a little misdirected. First, where is the hottest area on the board? the right side contains a couple of weak groups, so the person who has an extra move there will have an advantage. Second, "the entire left side" is a bit pessimistic. White will merely have a sphere of influence you will have to play within. White can add two moves to the left, and you can still make easy life. Meanwhile, the right side has groups you can actually attack.]

(;B[hq]C[HWC: this is definitely an overplay, considering the thinness of your corner.]
;W[fq];B[lq];W[jo]C[HWC: Now, white is still taking over the left side, but he even has a stone to attack. The trade of h3 for k5 doesn't look good]
;B[ho];W[in];B[fp]C[I am not sure about this attachment. Should I have simply run to the center with G6? Or to try to connect at K2?

I'm not sure. The problems began with h3, I feel, so I don't see any great moves. the more moves white gets in the center, the weaker your q10 group looks]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[hr];B[gr];W[iq];B[eq];W[fr];B[er];W[gs];B[ep]
;W[cq];B[do]C[HWC: this trade strengthens white. Just jump to the center]
;W[co];B[dn];W[cn]C[The result here is that White has the corner, the White group around J3 is safe, and the Black group around F4 is not safe yet. I do not think Black should be satisfied here.

HWC: Yes. Be patient! you don't need to make plays like h3. Even just playing at m3 is better.]
;B[mn]C[HWC: This is a move you wanted to play on the right side anyways. So maybe play this first, build some strength before moving to the left side. Usually in a sanrensei game, white trades territory for a black moyo, then black attacks white in compensation. Here, white has nothing]
;W[nm];B[qh]C[HWC: The center is where the action is. Don't worry about this group living. Try o10 perhaps]
;W[lf];B[hn]C[HWC: wrong direction.d7 side is better];W[dm]
;B[fn];W[em];B[en]C[HWC: This looks too good for white];W[gc]
;B[ch]C[Black must now invade or otherwise will take over this half of the board.

HWC: I think that "take over" is too ambiguous a term, and it leads to dangerous play. Please see my first comments on counting.]
;W[ce];B[ck];W[cl];B[dk];W[jc];B[ke]C[Protecting at M17 looked to me too defensive, and not taking advantage of the fact that White group around O14 is unsafe.

HWC: Attacking sooner probably would have given more advantage. Now white is solid, except for his two weak groups, so he doesn' have to worry about black's thickness becoming overwhelming.]
;W[kf];B[fl]C[Should I have continued to push at K15 instead?

HWC: Yes. If you decide to attack, then attack. Otherwise, then play f8 without exchanging l15]
;W[je];B[me]C[thought the cut at K14 was premature - was I right?]
;W[mf];B[kd]C[HWC:ouch. It hurts to play this.];W[if];B[eg]
;W[fm];B[gm];W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[im];W[el];B[jn];W[ek];B[og]
C[Since the White group is now safe, I started with a sequence to take over the center and prepare an attck on thw White group around P6 by taking advantage of the gaps. Should I have been more aggresive and cut at P14?]
;W[of];B[mh];W[nh]C[HWC: What is white doing here? he needs to make life for his weak group]
;B[ni];W[oh];B[oi];W[ph];B[pi];W[pg]C[So now I though I could start attacking the P6 White group. Capturing it is huge, and it seemd to me that since it does not have eyese yet the fight would be easy. Surprisingly enough, I could not find the right moves to kill it. What should have I done?

HWC: As far as I can see, there is no easy way because of shape defects at n11 and around l6.]
;B[mm]C[HWC: this is wrong direction, white is already blocked at j7 area. I think it's tough if you fall behind this move]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[po];B[rm];W[pm];B[rn];W[pl];B[nl];W[qk];B[rk]
;W[pk];B[ro];W[qm];B[rl];W[nk];B[mk]C[HWC: this looks like a mistake]
;W[ol];B[ml];W[nn];B[qo];W[no];B[mo]C[At the small price of the 3 stoe around S3, White manages to live!

HWC: having both weak groups live easily inside your sphere of influence with such little compensation (I'd say maybe 25 solid points) is certainly not good. I think that you should have taken more control of the game earlier to attack them. I'm pretty bad at attacking, but I'm sure a book like "get strong at attacking" can help you.]

;B[sk];W[rg];B[rf];W[sh];B[nj];W[ok]C[HWC: White shouldn't answer]
;B[lg]C[This is very small, i think. Doesn't q11 have enough liberties?]
;W[ma];B[oa];W[gf]C[This white move (G14) is big. Otherwise, Black could cause quite a damage with E14. I wanted to play E14 first, but the preceding sequence was all sente by White. Was I right?

At this point, White leads by at least 10 points and there no too many open spaces here. The rest of the game is a fight to reduce White lead, but it was too little to change the result.

Your comments are welcome also on the yose!
