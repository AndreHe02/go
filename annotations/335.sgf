C[This time I play more carefully and use more time to think,unlike last time,play without thinking thoroughly and lost.Hopefully next time can play better.Could you tell me where did I play wrong and how to improve,thank you!

My Comments will be prefaced by DS:  I hope you may learn from my comments.  I am about 8k* on IGS. As W is a computer (ManyFaces) I will limit most of my comments to your moves (Black).]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[fc];W[dg];B[ld]C[DS: somewhat loose and unusual.  B usually should either play D18 J16 or K16.  These provide more opportunities later.]
;W[co];B[nq]C[DS:  K3  would be bigger.];W[iq]C[DS: Now W has gotten a nice lower left corner moyo.]
;B[qj]C[DS: Good. big move too.];W[nc];B[nd]C[DS: Ok.  Does work well with R10.]
;W[oe]C[DS: ??? very strange. This is a problem with computer opponents. very inconsistent with O17.]
;B[od];W[qh];B[qf];W[oh];B[pi];W[ng];B[ph];W[pg];B[of]C[DS: I would think that R13 here would be enough. This feels like an overplay to me.]
;W[pf];B[nf];W[pe];B[mg]C[DS: B should play more solidly.  Just play R15  would be fine. N13 is too much contact play. Too much fighting when not needed.]
;W[og];B[qe]C[DS: finally, good.];W[rg]C[DS: this move is totally bizarre. Makes no sense.]
;B[qg];W[ri];B[qi];W[nj];B[li]C[DS:  Seems wrong direction.  Perhaps consider playing P9.  This would attack and make territory at the same time.  M11 is single purpose move.  P10 would be dual purpose.]
;W[ok];B[pl];W[pk];B[qk];W[nm];B[nn];W[ol];B[om]C[DS: Very bad.  This just sets up for a double atari by W.  Q7 would be enough.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[rh];B[rj];W[rf];B[re];W[qd];B[rd];W[qc];B[rc]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pb];B[mc];W[nb]
(;B[na]C[DS: Bad move.  just N18 and W is dead. See variation. W has chance now to escape.]

(;W[ma]C[DS: overplay. W missed chance to live.];B[oa];W[pa]
;B[mb];W[ne];B[ob];W[pn]C[DS: W missed chance to play N14 or even R8.]
;B[mf];W[me]
(;B[md]C[DS: Meaningless.  B does not have to connect here. This is a wasted move.  M15 would create a massive wall facing left. See variation.]
;W[le];B[kd];W[lf];B[lg];W[ql]C[DS: enormous move by W.];B[rl]
;W[oi];B[mi]C[DS: Heavy move.  B should jump loosly to K12 or perhaps M9. I'm not certain. B's R10 group is in danger now too.]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[nl];B[mm];W[mk];B[ll];W[jf];B[je]C[DS: B plays too many contact plays.  Remember, do not touch what you are trying to attack.  Contact plays just create stability for your opponent.]
;W[ie];B[id];W[he];B[hd];W[ge];B[fe]C[DS: no.  Too 'tricky'.  Just G16 would be ok.]
;W[ff];B[ee];W[de];B[ed]C[DS: avoid making empty triangles here.  there are much bigger moves like C11 R7, or L10 that would be bigger.  Even C17 would be ok.]
;W[ef];B[gf]C[DS: Doesn't work.  This is just enemy helping.  If you wish to peep, play G13, but cutting here is suicide.]
;W[gg];B[hf];W[ig];B[gd];W[kf]C[DS: ??? W should connect at J14.]
;B[if];W[lk];B[kk];W[jg];B[kh]C[DS: I don't understand what B is doing here.  The Bamboo joint at M12 and N12 is secure. This move is unnecessary.  B can protect the cut at L10 just by playing K10 if desired.]
;W[ji];B[kj];W[ii];B[hk];W[jl];B[jk]C[DS : Wrong direction.  L8 connection would be better.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[jm];B[kl];W[km];B[lm];W[lo];B[ln];W[ko];B[lp]
C[DS: no, just N5. moves like this just open up too many holes in B's position.]
;W[kp];B[lq];W[kq];B[kr];W[jr]C[DS: I would think W at N5 is of enormous value.]
;B[ks]C[DS: Very small move.  N5 much bigger.];W[js];B[lr]C[DS: ditto. endgame.  There are bigger moves on left side, N5, C17, C9 or C11.  Also, just helps W get nice wall facing left.]
;W[jo];B[hm]C[DS: no too loose. B will be cut.];W[ik];B[ij]
;W[il];B[hj];W[hi];B[jj];W[hl];B[gl];W[hn];B[gm];W[gn];B[fm]
;W[fn];B[em];W[en];B[dn];W[do];B[cn]C[DS: B just helped W make nice territory at the bottom.]
;W[bn];B[cm]C[DS: B7 is ok for Black.];W[bm];B[bl]C[DS: Bad!  Allows W to atari at C8 and capture B8 stone.]
;W[bp]C[DS: but W missed it. I doubt a human (even beginner) would miss such a simple play.]
;B[dl];W[cj];B[ck];W[bj];B[ak];W[aj];B[bk];W[gk];B[gj];W[fk]
;B[ej];W[ek];B[dk];W[rn]C[DS: I have no idea why W does not just play S7.]
;B[qm]C[DS: W's moves make no sense.];W[pl];B[rm];W[qn];B[sn]
;W[so];B[sm];W[ro];B[rp]C[DS: T9 mandatory.];W[sp];B[rq];W[sq]
;B[rr];W[sr];B[qo]
(;W[po]C[DS: B's R10 group in exteme danger.  Neither W nor B see it though. If W T9, B in trouble and might die.  See variation.]

(;B[mo]C[DS: Still biggest moves are at the top left. See variation.]
;W[fh];B[jh];W[ih];B[ni];W[nh];B[mh];W[pj]C[DS: W missed opportunity to kill B with T9.]
;B[sk];W[im];B[sf];W[sg];B[si];W[ke];B[kg];W[ki];B[bh]C[DS: what???]
;W[dj];B[am];W[an];B[al];W[ml];B[cc]C[DS: finally. Good move.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[bb];B[cb];W[ba];B[ca]C[DS: no.  just B17 is more than enough.]
;W[bc];B[cd];W[ce];B[ec];W[bd]C[DS: Now W connects.];B[ea];W[be]
;B[rs];W[ss];B[qa]C[DS: totally unnecessary. Game is over.]
;W[bg];B[sh]C[DS: not needed. just giving points to your opponent.]
;W[ah];B[la]C[DS:  don't make these moves. fill in dame if needed or just pass.]
;W[ch];B[el];W[bi];B[fl]C[251moves, Black wins by 35

DS:  Both sides played what seemed to be superfical strategy.  Playing computer opponents can be fun, but you will learn bad habits. It is much better to play other humans if at all possible as that way you will be able to learn many different styles and improve much faster.]
