C[Review completed by David Bird 14k , Dec 27-28.];B[pp];W[dq]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[oc]TR[pj][qj][pk][qk]C[Very good opening.  This enclosure (shimari) is solid territory and makes for a very good follow-up move.  Something around the marked triangles.
"Corner enlosures aim for side extensions" - to paraphrase from a favourite book of mine: "Opening theory made easy" O. Hideo

The shimari at the upper right makes something around R9 very urgent for both players.  Arguably, the biggest move now.]

(;W[co];B[ce]C[this move is not bad, but something around R9 is bigger and more urgent, I feel.]
;W[cd]C[white C16 is not best I think.  it secures the corner, but at the cost of making black stronger.]
;B[de]
(;W[bd]C[B16 is too slow.  this is neither enough pressure on black nor enough profit.  White should try to get out of the corner with something like F17.]

(;B[ch]C[C12 is ok, but I think with a 2 stone high wall at D15, black can afford to jump one more to C11, or D11.  White can scoop out black's base, but black will get strong influence to the centre.]
;W[be]C[again, this is very slow and black could even afford to tenuki, since this group can easily grow along the side, escape to the centre, or put pressure on white's corner from the top side.  See variations after a black tenuki.]

(;B[bf]C[This is fine too though, it makes a strong, solid group.]
;W[af]LB[jc:3][pj:1][jq:2]C[more end-game play by white  when there are huge moves to be made.
In order of priority, I would say that the following areas are biggest.
This is much more important then chipping away at black's small group.]
;B[bg];W[ag];B[ah];W[ae]LB[qj:1]C[Here, black should take careful stock of his position.  Black should be itching to play around 1, but is his shape settled?  It is ok, or is it in threat of being under attack from white?
Is white ok? or is there a move that black can put pressure on white?
Ask yourself the following questions for each move:
1.  Am I ok? (do I have a weak group that needs help?)
If I'm not ok, I should help my weakest group
2.  Is she/he ok?  (does my opponent have weak groups to attack?)
If my opponent isn't ok, I should make an attacking move that will ensure me some profit.
3.  If none of the above, I should look for the biggest move.

Here, black's shape is strong, with eye shape at B12, C14.  It looks concentrated to me, but very very hard to pick on.
White has 2 groups, a strong shimari at the bottom, and a very weak corner at the top.
Black should look for a way to attack this weak corner.]
(;B[fd]C[was this move ok? or should i have played else where and left this alone

This has the right instinct I think, black looks like he is aiming to put pressure on white's corner.  But he can be more aggressive than this.  See variations.]
;W[fc]C[not much choice for white here other than this.  Now white's shape is pretty much settled]
;B[gc]C[good.];W[fb]C[at this point, black should just fix the cut at G16, either by simply G16, or a hanging connection.]

(;B[gb]TR[gd]C[this is end game, and there is too many other big moves to make.  Also the cut at G16 would be irritating.]

(;W[ga]LB[kc:3][bi:4][qj:1][jq:2]C[more end game from white.  not yet white!  the board is still wide open!
4 much more important areas to consider.  Numbered in order of what I percieve as priority.]
;B[ha];W[fa];B[hb];W[ed]
(;B[fe];W[ee];B[ef];W[dd]C[these are all very tiny little moves on white's part.  White makes 1-2 points for each of these moves.  Remember the bigger areas.]

(;B[ff]C[is this cut dangerous?  I don't think so, let's look at the variation, if black ignores.
Remember the bigger moves.];W[qq]LB[qp:A][pq:B]C[Never never do this so early in the game.
White takes a corner, but will make only 3-4 points.  Black will gain huge influence over the board. 
The only two choices for black here, is A or B.
choosing which depends on the relationship of the soon-to-be-black wall to the rest of the board.
Does black want a high wall on the right side? or on the bottom side?
For me, I think A is better than B.
See variations.]
(;B[pq]
(;W[pr]
(;B[or]
(;W[ps]C[never do this, black will get a move for "free".  See the variation]

(;B[qp]LB[os:A]C[was this the right move? or should I have actually played at (A). i thought i could kill the white gorup.

A is sente for black (see the variation where it's followed up).  So it's probably important to make. 
Not playing A allowed white to crawl along the bottom.];W[rq]
;B[rp];W[sp]C[this is more end game, white's group is not yet alive.]

(;B[so];W[sq];B[rs]LB[ro:A]C[i realized the cut at (A). thinking back i think i should have played there instead

Probably.  The kill could have been made before T5 (see previous variation).]

(;W[rr];B[ro];W[os];B[nr];W[ns]C[white has lost this group, white should cut his losses and tenuki now.  Crawling on the first line is futile.]
;B[mr];W[ms]
(;B[kr];W[lr];B[lq];W[ls];B[ks];W[kq]C[instead of atari, i should have played R1. that would have killed that entire group

ok.]
(;B[jq];W[kp];B[lp];W[jr]LB[mq:A]C[i forgot about this cut. I was only thinking about the cut at (A)

ok.]
(;B[qr];W[qs])
(;B[qr];W[js]TR[jq]C[here, black falls into the trap of trying to save useless stones.
White has escaped, cutting off K3 from being much use.  Forget K3.  Black has immense thickness along the right side, and black would be better off using the thickness for profit.
The big move around Q10 is still available.]
(;B[jp];W[ko];B[lo];W[qs];B[gp]C[again, ignore K3, they are weak and very hard to help.

The big move is around Q10];W[gq];B[ip]TR[jp][jq]C[looking back i think this move was a bad move. it doesn't really have any immediate threat or use, and its bad shape and fairly thick.

thick isn't the word that most would use here.  Heavy is more appropriate to use than thick.  these stones are a burden for black to carry.  Best to let them die.

Very good to see that this is a bad shape.  

Thickness is like what black has at the bottom right, or at the top left.  A shape that is very solid, with a bit of eye shape.  This is thickness.]
;W[hq]C[again, very slow on white's part. 
this is arguably equal to a pass move.
black is about to seal nearly half of hte board in the top right.
The following moves are all too small on both white and blacks' part.  Black is about to have a huge moyo in the upper right part of the board.]
;B[in]C[again, these stones are a burden for black, better to let white try to capture them while black takes profit at q10]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[iq];B[jn];W[jo];B[io];W[go];B[gn];W[fp];B[kn]
;W[fn];B[kr]C[this capture is actually smaller than Q10];W[ks]
;B[gm]C[very slow and small.  white still might live at a move like Q10, though it would be a struggle.]
;W[kq]C[ouch!  1 point move.
white must think about bigger moves.];B[kp]C[1 point move.
black must also look for big moves.];W[kr]C[1 point move.];B[ir]
C[count liberties first, before making a move like this.];W[hr]

(;B[el]C[take profit in the corner first, then side, finally when the corners and sides are settled, then build the centre.
See variation.];W[fm];B[fl];W[gl]C[too much tiny fighting.  G8 will have to struggle like mad to live.  There is no white group to connect to.]
;B[hl];W[gk];B[hk];W[gj];B[hj];W[gi]TR[lk][mk][nk][ok][pk][ll]
[ml][nl][ol][pl][lm][mm][nm][om][pm][nn][on][pn]SQ[cj][dj][bk]
[ck][dk][bl][cl][dl]C[i kept extending because i thought white wouldn't get much because i could invade anywhere around the squares, but i get a solid wall to work with to gain from the general and further right of the board. (triangles)

ok.  But black is "pushing from behind"  
Meaning for every black move along the H column, white will be one stone ahead along the G row
All this being said, white's 4 stones have little hope of surviving, as long as black ensures that the F8 group connects to the C12 group.]
;B[ej]C[good.];W[em]
(;B[dm]C[stay solid.  A hane here is asking for trouble.  See the variation.]
;W[dl];B[dk];W[cl]
(;B[en]C[D7 has served it's purpose.  Forget about it.
see variation];W[fo]C[after white connects, E6 has no purpose.]
;B[ck];W[cm];B[ih]C[J12 feels redundant to me.   white can do very little to make this group live. Q10 still feels most important to me.]
;W[bk];B[bj]
(;W[ak]C[this mistake is made by white throughout the game.
See variation];B[aj];W[bm];B[qj]C[Black finds the urgent move.]

(;W[qk]C[when white attaches like this, black should take care.
Here, white doesn't have enough space to live, so black should stay solid.

White would have had a better chance attaching on the other side (see variation)]

(;B[pk]C[this is an overplay, and just what white would be hoping for with a move like R9
still, I can't see an easy way for white to live.];W[rj];B[rk]
;W[ql];B[ri];W[rl]C[make the pon-nuki!
see the variation]
(;B[pi]TR[pl]C[i played this move because there would be many buts with the triangle move. I thought i can kill him anyway but it turned out i didn't.

Just take S10.];W[sk]
(;B[pl];W[qm]C[don't let white get a second eye]
(;B[pm];W[rn];B[sm]C[too late];W[sn];B[qn];W[rm];B[sj]C[that was a misclick but i didn't bother with undo because i think he would have played it at T10 anyway

ok];W[si];B[rh];W[sh];B[sg];W[sj];B[rg];W[nc]C[what was the best move against this? this isn't something you see often so i didn't know how to play against it.

It's a special move and impressive to see from white at this skill level.
it's a very very good move for this board I think.
still, because black is so strong everywhere, I think not enough.]

(;B[nd];W[mc]C[seems slow.  
black should take away the space for a base.  (pardon the rhyme)]

(;B[md];W[lc]C[black is "pushing from behind" again.
take away the base.]
(;B[ld];W[kc]C[again i thought i was ok just drive him towards my wall. 
i think i should have played my variation instead though

driving white towards thickness is appropriate thinking, but black must be creative in doing so.
pushing from behind like this is too slow.  It allows white the time to make enough space for eye-shape.]

(;B[kd];W[jc];B[jd];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[pa];B[qa];W[mb]
;B[ka];W[ib];B[jb];W[ja];B[ia];W[kb];B[ja];W[la];B[ic];W[ii]
;B[hi]C[H11 should make it clear to white that J11 was a futile move.

black is so thick all throughout the centre that J11 can not possibly capture to connect back to the lower left.
Nor is there anything else to connect to.
Nor will white have enough time to make a living shape in the centre.]
;W[ji]
(;B[jh]C[black is pushing from behind again.
Instead of this, look for white's vital points];W[ki];B[kh]
;W[li]
(;B[lh];W[mi];B[mh];W[ni]C[i think P10 would have been A LOT better here. even earlier. i just had a lot of thick walls this game so i tried to use them but i guess my moves were too slow

slow because black is pushing white from behind.  
all moves from K12 to N12 are not using thickness appropriately.  
Black should play moves that deny white good shape instead of this solid play.]

(;B[nh];W[oi];B[oh];W[oj];B[mk];W[ok]C[O 8 would have been better I think.

O8 for whom?  instead of Black N9?  or instead of P9?

In any case, White should not succeed with this attempt.
Black N9 seems fine.];B[ol]C[bad shape, but at this stage, it shouldn't really matter.]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[pj]SQ[qj]C[too many cuts here

i didn't realize the square stone was cutting white off. I thought it was some other stone. So i didn't think it was that important. I should have played R11 although i would lose some territory at the buttom.

right.  P8 (the bad shape) was the first step in white's last desperate hope here. 

R10 is vital.  Learning  the difference between a cutting stone, like R10, and a useless stone like K3 is very important.  Saving K3 was only 1 point.  Saving R10 is immense.   

because of black's weak shape, white still has a few last-chances after black connects R10.
See variation.]
(;B[nm];W[pn];B[om]C[ah, white saw it too.];W[qo];B[on];W[po]
;B[oo];W[qn]C[now i should have played R 11 although it would just be lucky

i find that i get really tense in ranked games. if you look at my record, i've played 12 games in total, won 8, and lost my 3 ranking games, with one ranking game where my opponent escaped because he was losing.

any advice on how not to get too tense?

Advice on not getting tense?
Gosh, that is my worst (and everyone who you might ask) weakness too!  
Seriously, this is what the time in a game should really be used for.  Deep breaths to get calm again, before proceeding.
Emotional control is vital to Go.  
For me, I have found learning Go to be very helpful to me in real life in this regard!

As far as advice to deal with this:
Ensure that your rated games have a decent amount of time (30-40 minutes per player)
Never make a move until you have recovered emotionally from a large loss/win
Don't allow yourself to think about the win/loss of the game, during the game.  Only look for the best move.

In summary, here are the biggest areas for both black and white improve from this game:
1.  Playing for small points and ignoring big moves.  (Study opening theory to help here)
2.  Trying to save/play stones that are better sacrificed.

Black should avoid pushing from behind.
White should avoid deep invasions like R3 early in the game, it only allows black to gain influence while white gains little.
(this isn't to say that a 3x3 invasion is always bad, but timing is essential).

This ends the comments.  I hope it has been a useful review.
