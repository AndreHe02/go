C[Hello, I played this game in Oro server against a 1dan player. I have this Oro acount becous I think if you play agains diferent players (more strong and more weak) you can learn more than just play against player ate your level. In KGS I am 17 kyu and played only against 17 kyu players, so my rank stoped and I don't get better! Now I am trying to play, everyday, aone game against a player around my level and one game against a 1 dan player in oro. Sometime I play against players a little more strong, around 13k in KGS. What do you think about this plan to study/play?

Well, talking about the game, I like it becous I don't think to much and I lose by only 22 points (not 50 or more, my first game against a dan player I losed by more than 100, and normaly I lose for about 50...so 22 was a great result!)

Let's see the game...I'm White.

Hello, Jaime here. I'll prepend my comments with "j:"

I think playing higher ranked players is good to improve, but maybe not too much higher, so you can understand the moves! I prefer keeping in the +/- 2 stones area, *unless* the high rank player is willing to explain things, of course.

As for this game, I'm not sure of anything as it's a extrange game, but black played a leisure excercise IMHO.

Well, let's see.];B[qd];W[dq];B[cd];W[qp];B[co];W[eo]C[Is it ok? Is E4 good?

J: too ambitious IMHO. I prefer g3, maybe f4, or c7 or 8 if you want to pincer. Pincering is maybe a good idea, to avoid B developing too easily]
;B[dm];W[jq]C[Is there any problem if I play around C10 instead?
J: it seems too early for me to invade there, but it's an odd situtation. Ideas, extending (r10), invading the upper side (more open); if want to play around k3, I prefer K4, k3 seems too low.]
;B[fm]C[This is a kind of move you don't see in kyu games...How should I respond?

J: yes, maybe an odd move, but he's developing big. C11 seems ok to me know, but I tend to worry too much. Extending (tenuki) the right side still seems ok.]
;W[cp]C[I don't know if it's good...I think it gets the corner and good points, I am rigth?

J: pffff , it seems extrange to me, I'd tenuki and play one of the moves I said previously, but, yes, it protects the corner and seems a good deal of points]

(;B[do]C[Why b played this move????

J: if he didn't, you could c6 or d5 in sente. Also, extending after a contact move is a standard response, now B position is solid, and if he later d4 you'll lose something]
;W[nc]C[is P17 better? Or p16... Just don't know...

J: in theory, you should invade high to develop and low to search for life inside, but this is an *open* area, so anything could work. I prefer playing in the middle, k16]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re]C[Can I live here? As you can see my next move was not close to my white stones...

J: this is too hard for me to answer. If left as it is, you should start to worry when B cuts the escape to the center. For the moment, I feel it's ok to tenuki.]
;W[pj]C[Is it good?

J: yes and no. Ok in relation with the lower side, but maybe induces B to develop S17, and then r17 could be in danger. I like it, anyhow :-)]
;B[pf];W[op]C[J: now danger looms above...];B[le];W[ne]C[J: good idea, just hope not too late]
;B[oh];W[qh];B[mg]C[J: Black is playing a funny game];W[rb]
C[J: good!];B[sb];W[ra];B[qg];W[qm]C[J: invading the upper left area becomes *urgent*!]
;B[mb];W[nb];B[od]
(;W[pb]C[Can b kill it?
And if I ignore and play something like E17?
Is q18 necessary for w live?

...lots of questions:)

J: yes :-) but this is a L&D hard problem to me. I *think* q18 is necessary, seems a vital point for making eyes, ... I'd probably play it after being unable to read it all. For example, if you avoid playing q18, B p17, w p18, and bulky five. (see var)]

(;B[fc];W[ci]C[Maybe this move was ok, but I don't know if c11 is the right point...

J: C11 seems ok to me, even if a desperate move. B moyo is bigger, I don't believe just expanding your moyo would work.]
;B[cg];W[cl];B[dp]C[J: now d5 in action];W[ep];B[cq];W[bp]C[J: at least this ends sente...]

C[mmm...very common...but..What is the best respond move now?

J: dangerous here, heavy split. I'd probably go for an all or nothing attack at h5]

J: yes, he played a extrange game, but he didn't suffer much during the game, so probably he's a dan player!]

>From now on I don't have more questions...

Thank you all from GTL!

J: I don't think you have any chances, seriously. he's let you live small in several places, and the developement of your only "big" ones are now handicapped by n3. B, on the other side, can grow at ease.

The developement of the game from now on is quite curious, however, at times you were really close, so I resign in understanding it :-)]
