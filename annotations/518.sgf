C[owl: To the reviewer. I am not very satisfied with my playing in this game. I think especially my middle game is rather weak. That's why I ask you to pay special attention to this part of the game.

Thank you

Joshua: Unfortunately, I think the middle game is also the weakest part of my game. I do think I have a reasonable whole-board sense relative to other players of my strength, but not a very good tesuji sense.  I hope my comments are at least some use to you.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[do];B[cq]C[This choice, going into the corner, seems a little odd to me.  Playing near the middle of the left side would feel more natural, or the middle of the bottom side.

My thinking is that white wants to get outward influence (why else play the 4-5 point?) particularly on the lower side, and now you are giving him what he wants.]
;W[eq];B[co];W[dp]C[This seems a little odd for white.  My instinct would be to play out (C6 or D6), but I don't know joseki here.]
;B[cp];W[dn];B[cm]C[The D4-C4 exchange looks bad for white, since it lets black jump here without fear.  D6 should come first, I think (but I haven't checked a joseki dictionary to see if I'm right!)]
;W[el];B[mq]C[owl: I am not sure about this move. I was thinking also about O3 but was afraid of a pincer which would work too well with the white wall on the left side. K3 seemed to be an option, too. But W might answer at M3, B G3 and then I would have a rather weak group.

Joshua: If you wanted to play on the lower side, I think it would have been better to do so around K3 before playing the joseki in the bottom left. Now white has a lot of strength, and your stone is weak.  Better to reduce more lightly (Q6, say) or build up your own area at this point, I would think.

As regards your particular suggestions, I agree that you want to play far away from white's wall.  N3 is a fine spot.  I think O3 is OK, too; if white pincers close, you take the corner and white gets the outside, then you reduce lightly around L6 or something later.

K3 is not good.  White would certainly answer at M3, but you shouldn't continue with G3; that's ramming your head into a brick wall.  Try K5 instead as a lighter, faster way of playing.]
;W[jq];B[mo]C[Now you have a weak group anyway, and white is getting a lot while chasing you.]
;W[pn];B[ce]C[Now you abandon your weak group!  How about playing K5 to limit white's area while strengthening your group?

When you tenuki at C15 (a not-so-valuable move ... it should be at D15 at least, I think, because you are already low on the left side, the upper side is more important), white should play K5 himself (chasing your group and making the lower left almost into territory).]
;W[cl]C[This is a small move, since C15 is low.  K5 is much bigger.]
;B[bl]C[owl: I know this move should be at B7.

Joshua: yes, play simply here!];W[ck];B[qf]C[Another tenuki!  You need another move in two places now (lower left corner, and lower side group).

It is greedy to keep taking territory: you fall behind in influence, and that's what makes your middle game difficult for you.  You already have territory (or you would have with B7, anyway).  You need to make influence.  So play K5.]
;W[bn];B[cn];W[bm];B[bo];W[bk];B[dm];W[em];B[er];W[fr];B[dr]
;W[fq]C[Now you have made white's outside even stronger ...]
;B[jo]C[owl: Is this playable? I did not want to play P2 to keep the option of an invasion at R3 later.

Joshua: Luckily you find the key move of K5 to try to offset that strength (though now white is so strong you might need to play something even lighter, like L3 to try to settle...)

I agree that P2 is the wrong direction.  L3, or N7, or K5 seem to be the reasonable choices to me.]
;W[oq]C[white tries to keep you from settling. L3 looks like a good move to settle your stones now.  K4 might do the job also, but it looks a little heavier. N7 is probably OK too.]
;B[io]C[This seems a little greedy.  K4 instead gives you a bit more eye shape, more connection, and does just about as much to prevent white from getting territory.

If you're going to jump on in, why not play F5 and at least mess around with white's shape a little ... but that's clearly an overplay, isn't it?]
;W[kp];B[lo];W[hq];B[jc]C[owl: better around Q10?

Joshua: Better to do something to help your weak group. You continue trying to take more territory and give white more and more and more influence ...

When white plays a solid defensive move like H3, that makes white VERY strong here.  Is your group similarly strong?  No!  So it needs to be defended.  Play N8 if you like ...

You try to take sente too much, and take territory too much, instead of defending your groups properly!

Also you can see now the benefit to your shape if you had played K4 or L3 before white got L4.]
;W[pk]C[This move gains some points on the side and looks almost like an attack on your weak group at the same time.  Your group needs shape!]
;B[lm]C[This is the right way to think.  A calm, steady defense (which helps you run out, gives a bit of shape, and helps defend the L5 cut too.]
;W[db]C[White doesn't need to come in so low.  The K15 cap would almost be an attack on your group below!]
;B[ec];W[eb]C[owl: I expected W C17 and get a wall on the outside. This move looks heavy.

Joshua: yes, this looks like a mistake for white.];B[cb];W[fc]
;B[hc];W[gb];B[fd];W[gc];B[gd];W[hb];B[ib]C[maybe an overplay here?  The solid J17 would be safer (and remember you have that weak group below, and white has no weak groups, so you have to play more conservatively)]
;W[ed];B[cc];W[hd];B[ic];W[he];B[ee];W[fe];B[dd];W[ge];B[ed]
;W[fa]C[White gets a tiny life and now you finally have some weak stones to chase.  On the other hand a white move at M17 or thereabouts would have some attacking force (but only if white's outside stones get stronger first)]
;B[jf]C[that is the right direction for sure.];W[ji]C[this move looks at attacking your bottom group and at pulling out the four white stones. Which is more important?]
;B[ig]C[You hang on to the four stones (does that mean white gets sente at G12, etc, also?  If so, white can get a lot of profit for sacrificing those four stones!)

Now you are starting to get a bit of influence at the top, but if your bottom group dies, the game is over.]
;W[il];B[ko]C[It looks a bit heavy to play here.  Where are your eyes?  If white cuts off those two stones but the other half of your group lives, how does that affect the balance of the game?  I think you can let those two go, run out, and try to get a big area on the top right.

DOn't be too greedy about territory.];W[lj];B[nl]C[owl: I did not like this fight. It spoiled my plans to get a big territory in the upper right.

Joshua: Right!  Sacrifice those two stones, play M10 yourself instead of L5, and the trade is much better for you.]
;W[nn];B[lk];W[mj];B[ok];W[pj];B[oj];W[pi];B[jk];W[ik];B[kj]
;W[ki];B[jj];W[ij];B[jl];W[mk];B[ml];W[kl];B[jm]C[It looks like you have one eye, at least...]
;W[pc]C[White tries to use the influence to get rid of any hopes you might have had of getting territory.

Remember, make your groups strong!  Don't tenuki, defend!];B[oc]
;W[qd]C[P18 looks calmer for white here.];B[qe];W[qc];B[ob]
C[This is starting to feel a little heavy for white.];W[pe]
;B[od];W[re];B[rf];W[sd];B[rb];W[pf];B[pg];W[ne];B[og];W[nf]
;B[qh];W[ng]C[I don't think white handled this corner very well.]
;B[oh];W[mh];B[oi];W[pb];B[rc];W[rd];B[oa];W[pa];B[lc]C[owl: This seems to be necessary because if I kill the corner W would get the outside and then attack my groups in the upper top.

Joshua: yes, your five stones might lose a capturing race if you don't defend here.  Connecting your groups is very big.]
;W[ra];B[ii]C[owl: This cut did no good. But I'm weak in middle game fighting and often don't find the right moves.

Joshua: the four stones above are not completely captured, so starting a fight here you may well have to give those back.

Maybe the double-hane at Q8 and then R7 would be a good place to start.

This game doesn't look too bad for you at the moment, does it?  Try estimating the count, assuming you capture white's four stones. Then decide how aggressive you need to be.]

;W[fi];B[fj];W[ei];B[gk];W[gj];B[hj];W[hk];B[gj];W[gl];B[im]
;W[hl];B[ej];W[dj];B[eh];W[di];B[gm]C[owl: I knew that I couldn't save the G10 group. My goal was to get forcing moves like E12 and G7 on the outside and gain some profit. But I'm sure there is a better line of playing.

Joshua: yes, you gave up too much. You could have started around G13, finishing off the four stones safely and making the cut more of a real threat. Or, you could have started around J7, defending your group and again making white worry about the cut.

Peeping at the cut and forcing white to connect is bad; building up the pressure from afar until white reluctantly spends a move defending is good.]
;W[fl];B[ql]C[why not double-hane Q8 and then R7 instead of this move?

Seems like the rest is mostly unremarkable endgame after this.

Try counting at this point (approximately!) and see if you can play ordinary endgame as you did, or if you need to try something fancier.

It looks to me like it's a pretty close game, so ordinary endgame should do the job.]

;W[dh];B[bf];W[bg];B[cg];W[bh];B[df];W[ci];B[fn]C[Is this good?  Compare its size to O2.  The edge is bigger than it looks!]
;W[hm];B[hn];W[go];B[gn];W[kr];B[gp]C[Again, you take a small move in the middle instead of a big one on the edge.

Now that your group is connected to the right side, you have two eyes for sure (don't you?) and so you should concentrate on this edge territory. O2 should have been sente for you, too, which makes it doubly bad to have missed it.]
;W[nr];B[lr]C[now this move is not so big any more.];W[hp];B[fo]
;W[ho];B[fp];W[en];B[lf]C[owl: Mistake. Should be M15.

Joshua: yes, lost a point or two here.  You lost closer to eight points by missing O2, and you lost almost infinitely many points by answering white's O2 at M2 (now what should have been your sente became sente for white!)]
;W[kf];B[ke];W[nd];B[nc];W[le];B[kd];W[md];B[kq];W[eg];B[fg]
;W[jg];B[if];W[mc];B[mb];W[jr]C[Observe the way white took many sente points before connecting at K2.  You needed to take your sente point at O2 a very long time ago.]
;B[no];W[oo];B[om]C[A nice move for you. I still wonder if you couldn't have succeeded in cutting if you'd played Q8 earlier yourself.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[ol];B[nm];W[nk];B[ll]C[Now it doesn't look so nice for you any more: you get cut and need to end in gote here as well as filling in some of your own territory to make eyes.  Was the one stone you cut off (O6) worth enough for that?  I don't think so.  Staying connected yourself was more important.]
;W[da]C[owl: I should have played D19 and then C19 earlier because it would be sente.

Joshua: Yes, but white would get H19 then, after which J19 is not so nice for you ... it's hard to handle this position.

Summary: you mishandled the lower side and white got an advantage.  White didn't handle the upper right corner so well, and the game became even.  In the end, missing O2 might well have been enough points to turn the game in white's favor.

I hope you found my comments helpful!  Feel free to write me at zucker@yahoo.com if you have any comments on my comments.  You are very close to my strength, so I wouldn't be surprised to hear that you disagree with some of my ideas.
