C[To the reviewer:

In this game, I ended up resigning not so much because I was about to lose a few stones, but because I realised I was behind by something like 40 points.  I probably could have resigned earlier -- at some point about 2/3 of the way through the game when my opponent took a particularly long time to think on one of his moves, I did some counting and came to the surprising realisation that I was behind by 30-40 points.  I had felt for most of the game as though I was on the defensive, even though I had tried to take the initiative by attacking at the beginning of the game, but I didn't know just how badly I was trailing.  I still can't figure out where I went wrong.

I'm hoping that by sending in another game to the GTL, somebody stronger than me will be able to figure out what I'm doing wrong, and I'll be able to start improving again.

Thanks in advance,
Ted Schuerzinger
Fedya on KGS/IGS];B[pp];W[dc];B[ep]C[*****  i am a bit suprised that black played the e4 point.  if one is going to play on a 5-4 point and your opponent played the 3-4, it is better to emphasize the approach to the 3-4.  in this situation, i would have rather played d5.    Hubert : The E4-Q4 formation can be viewed as a moyo. From E4, black can easily make powerfull
cental influence that works well with the Q4 stones.
A game of competing moyo is allways more strategic than tactic and can be wom or lost without fighting.]
;W[qd];B[cn]C[*****  again, somewhat unusual, but does suggest an approach at d15 or c15.  when i have played another stone in the corner after a 5-4 opening, many players at my level of play become immediately frightened and invade the corner at that instant.  a corner invasion can live against this type of opening, but may be pretty small and black will build a lot of influence toward the side and center.

Hubert : This move is very bad. Later, blck will have to add a stone in the corner to complete his formation and be overconcentrated.
For white, there is a problem of timing, he must not invade early because black will make too much influence if he does. Just force black into an ovenrconcentrated shape is good enough.]

(;W[qn]LB[nq:a][pj:b][qj:c]C[Fedya: Considering the Black shimari in the bottom left, I feel like I have to attack already.


*****  in general, white should attack early regardless since black plays first.

Hubert : I fell that an approach move at a is better. The classic joseki ends with a great advantage to white so black will have to make a pincer. And without a stone at b or c, black's pincers are not very effective. (See var)

Moreover, this approach mlove does not work well with the R16 stone.]
;B[qo]C[Hubert : NOOOOOOO !

Never do that !
It does not protect the corner effectively
and helps white too much.

Play the usual move at O4.
When the usual move turns well,nevr try something hard.];W[pn]
;B[np];W[qj]C[****  this is a nice result for white.  if i was black, i might have been a bit more combative and played a pincher.

Hubert : I agree. The left side formation is very attractive.]
;B[qg]LB[jq:a][jp:b]TR[np][pp][qo]C[Hubert : Bad move.   1. Black is jalous. To invade iin such narrow space usually turns very beadly.

2. Black must learn joseki to the end. Without a move at a or b, the botton right corner is very weak. Black must play at a or b first or all his botton moyo will disappear an one shot.]
;W[oc]TR[qj][pn][qn]C[Fedya: Should I have done something to increase the amount of territory the stones at the bottom right could get, say at S12?

******** no, this is a perfect response.  some might prefer the play at p16, but this makes pretty secure corner territory while putting quite a bit of pressure on black.  as it stands, the bottom right group is pretty safe - lots of room to make eyes and access to the center.  when you make a play like p17 against r13, you should be thinking about how you want to push your opponent while you attack.    Hubert : P17 is a good move, good direction.
Now R13 stone is a burden for black. The P6-R6-R10 formation is strong so black has a weak stone between too strong groups. It cannot turns well for him.

P16, instead of P17 is even stronger because it is more severe.]
;B[gc]C[******** it is pretty clear that black is trying to break up your potential moyo early.    Hubert : Another bad move. Black  just helps you to make points in the corner and create a weak group in the process.]
;W[ce]C[Hubert : Good ! He gives you the corner, just take it.]
;B[jd]
(;W[lc]LB[lq:a]C[********* this is an excellent set of moves, but, as you can see, black still has a somewhat early lead in potential because of playing in front of your shimaris.

Hubert : M6 is a BAD MOVE.
Maibe the LOSING MOVE

It is very slow. Black has not to answer this move because his stones G17-K16 can easily flee in the center.

This extension from the corner  1. does not make many points (about 6-8 points)
2. does not attack correctly black R13 stone
3. does attack G17-K16 taking eye space but the timing is bad because these stones can flee.

Because black gave you too corner, you are in advance in territory. Just destroy black's moyo in the bottom and you have an quick victory.
Play a first to harass the pitifull bottom right corner.]
(;B[kc]C[Hubert : bad move. Locally the move is M16, not L17. But you have not to answer and play immediatly at the bottom.]
;W[ld]LB[je:a]C[*** personally, i would have taken that opportunity to take sente and play on the bottom.  on the other hand, m16 puts some pressure on r13.  but notice how black's play on the top before running with the r13 stone effectively reduced a lot of the potential territory you could make by attacking the r13 group.

Hubert : too late. White cannot suffer a black stone at M16. It will radiate powerfulle influence and help R13 too much.
Moreover, the L17-M16 exchange is all in white's advantage : black shape is weak (Imagine a white stone at a) and white shape is strong.]
;B[oh]C[Hubert : too early.
Black R13 stone is light (black can abandon it if needed).
When you add a secong stone, you replace a light stone with an heavy group ( a target).]
;W[oj]TR[qg][oh]LB[qq:a]C[Fedya: If I'm not mistaken, my objective here should be to make it difficult for Black to live, while playing to get as much territory as I can.  In light of this, should I have done something different here?  I'm thinking of R12, but that's just a guess.

***** i don't think r12 would be all that good.  think about the other stones on the board.  with the lower left group, if you play r12 and black pushes down from the top, and manages to build a wall facing the center, it will work nicely with the lower left corner.  i think your response is reasonable - it secures your lower right group and maintains pressure on theblack group.

Hubert :  1. R12 would have been a bad move. never play contact moves when you attack, it just hepls your oppenent to make sabaki.
2. P10 is perfect.
3. Don't think in territory, what you want is influence to destroy black moyo at the bottom.
One way to have influence is to make thickness.
With P10, your group becomes very thick, creating a weak points at R3 in blacks corner.]
;B[re]LB[mh:a]C[Hubert : to leave here is not a good idea
(too narrow).
Just jump in the center.];W[rd];B[ri];W[rj];B[sj];W[sk]C[Hubert : bad shape, S8 is better.]
;B[si];W[rl];B[rn]
(;W[rm]C[Hubert : Nerver submit twice. Tou have made a submissive move at T9, don't make another one.]
;B[ro]C[Hubert : very slow.   1. White has play submissively, now black can play elsewhere. If white S5, black S4 and his corner becomes solid.

2. There is still bad aji in the corner.]
(;W[cj]TR[re][qg][oh][ri][si]C[Fedya: I didn't like the outcome for my stones at the bottom right, so I felt I had to go out and do something big in another part of the board.  Should I have been doing somethign to make Black's shape on the right worse?  There were a number of times that I thought about R11, but I only saw Black's immediate reply.  I didn't see the follow-up for White that I've included in the variation.


****** this would not be my first choice.  i would play on the bottom.   Hubert : Yes, bad move. Invade the bottom is far bigger.]
;B[ch]C[Fedya: I always have trouble when my opponent tries to split my stones like this.


****  look at how the stones lay.  the top left group is not in much of a position to support the c10 stone.  if you make an extention this large, you have to assume that will need to make it a living group.  you could run to the center with it, but black has you in a pinch with this since any attacking will strengthing the lower left corner.  however, with the g17 group, c12 is almost sure to connect.

Hubert : this move is VERY VERY VERY BAD.
Now, black has 3 weak groups. Just keep them separate and you will win automatically. Neither the top group nor the right group is clearly alive,
moreover, his bottom has many invasion points
(so more weak groups could appear)
so black will collapse sooner or later.];W[ej]C[Fedya: This is a guess.  I was also thinking of B7.  At any rate, I don't like the sequence that follows from this point is very good for me.  What should I have done diferently?


****  you might want to begin with e11.  the ladder works for white and it opens up the shape a bit while pressuring the c12 stone.

Hubert : E10 is excellent, making influence wich affect strongly the bottom left corner and the weak right group.]
;B[eg];W[bm]LB[ed:a]C[************  i would wait to play this.  as i said before, anything you do here will strengthen the lower left corner.  you might want to play on the bottom first, or the corner to see how black responds before you seal off your options.

Hubert : DEFINITLY THE LOSING MOVE. NO NEED TO COMMENT LATER.  If you let black play a, hois two weak groups becomes one strong group aand your corner begins to cry.

PLAYING ON THE SECOND LINE DURING A FIGHT IS RARELY GOOD.];B[bn]
C[Hubert : Black is very kind to answer.
Moreover, the aji in the corner is still bad.];W[cm]TR[oj]LB[jj:a]
[jh:b][lh:c][lj:d]SQ[oh][qg][re][ri][si][sj]C[Hubert : irrelevant. You have not to make life.
You have a powerfull ally at P10 so your stones are in no danger.
Moreover, if you play around a, b,c or d, the S15-S10 group becomes in great danger so black must make life immediatly.]
;B[dm]C[Hubert : D6 is clearly better shape.];W[dl];B[em];W[el]
C[****  see, this is exactly what you did not want to do.];B[fe]
C[Hubert : THE END.];W[bg]C[*********  this is tiny!!!!   one more move secures life for the left side group and with the territory in the bottom left, you have to break up the bottom moyo before black has a chance to perfect it.]
;B[bh]C[*******i'm suprised black replied here.  just imagine black playing k4

Hubert : yes.];W[cg];B[dh];W[jq]C[Fedya: Is F18 a bigger move than this?

******absolutely not.  however, i have seen stronger players do something prior to an invasion - often they will place a couple of stones to see how their opponent responds to prepare for the invasion.  for example, maybe p3.  if black responds p4, and you then play L3, you may never connect to the p4 stone, but it's presence will influence how black plays.  i am just beginning to experiment some with these types of preparations, so i can't give much advice.

Hubert : The rule is :  "Invade when you can see weak points that will help you live"
Here there are weak points everywhere so life will be easy.]
;B[kq]C[Hubert : bad move, M3 is better from this direction.]
;W[gq];B[fq];W[gp];B[eb];W[db];B[ea];W[ec];B[fc];W[fp]C[Fedya: I was thinking about the eye-stealing tesuji at G19, but I didn't think that would work because there's no way for me to connect the stone to anything else.  I eventually picked F4 because I figured it would allow me to connect the stones at the bottom to the stones in the center left of the board.  The problem is, I wasn't able to do anything with the wall I built.


**** before playing this, i would have closed the top left by playing d19 - black has already indicated he will respond, so you keep sente.  instead of f4, you might consider the corner invasion but i'm not quite sure how to do it.]
;B[eq]C[********* this effectively prevents a corner invasion.]
;W[fm];B[eo]
(;W[en]C[Fedya: Was this a mistake?  Black at D6 and White at F6 are both forced, after which Black has sente.  I'm thinking that F5 would have been simpler.


*** yes, f5 would be better];B[dn];W[fn];B[fo];W[go]C[Fedya: I thought I was doing well here, but ended up with virtually no territory in the center, despite my center-facing wall.

Hubert : To invade, you play on the third (and second) line. To makje center territoty, you play on the fourth (and fifth) line, so you must choose.
To want both is to loose all.];B[ko]C[*********  i would test the waters at this point with p3. if black responds p4, you could probably live because of the threat of linking with k3.   the game is basically over if everyone keeps the territory they have made, so you definitely need to be more aggressive.  thus far, black has dictated the pace of the game, in part, because you have not taken sente when you could.    Hubert : L4 is better for black.
A white invasion at P4 will not work but because the game is lost you can try.
Let's see why it will fail.]
(;W[kp]C[Fedya: I think this is a mistake.  Black should have responded with K4.]
;B[lp];W[jp];B[lq];W[jo];B[kn];W[lf]C[Fedya: I wasn't certain where else to play, so I figured it would probably be best to jump out toward the center.  I guess that the other possible move is K6.  (Yes, I still hadn't seen R11!)

*********well, you won't make much, if any territory in the center because black has plenty of access to the center as well.  you could try breaking up the group on the left with something like e14.  also, i think p14 or p15 has a bit more potential for making territory.]
;B[of];W[lh];B[on]
(;W[po]C[Fedya: I didn't realise what a mistake this move was.  Black's next move puts a lot of pressure on me.  Should I have played at P7 instead?

*** yes.  this is a nice move by black.];B[oo]
(;W[qm]C[Fedya: I felt that this move was forced, but I probably should have played at Q8 instead, since it results in a better shape for me.


*****  definitely.];B[qi];W[pi];B[ph];W[oi]C[********* there is no reason to play this that i can see.  take the sente and attack with it.  try r3 now, see how he responds.  or j15 to reduce and try to get something in the center.   this might not be the best advice, but when i am playing a losing game, i will try a few things and if they don't work, resign.]
;B[qe];W[pe];B[pf];W[oe];B[om];W[pk]C[Fedya: I played here in order to ensure I'd be able to make two eyes.]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[ok];W[nk];B[ol];W[nh]C[Fedya: I had to play a lot of defensive moves to make certain I'd end up with two eyes, and Black ends up being able to take the entire bottom right corner in addition to the bottom left corner.]
;B[jf];W[jh]C[Fedya: I realised that I could play here because a Black response at L13 won't stop me from connecting all the stones to one group or another.  This should have helped me to get territory in the center too, but it didn't work out that way in the actual game.]
;B[ig]
(;W[ih]C[Fedya: Could I have played at H12 instead?  I was worried about Black splitting at J12.

***** with the L6 group poking its head up, i think j12 is safer.]
;B[hg];W[hh];B[gh];W[gi];B[jk]C[Fedya: I have no idea how to respond to this move.  I think that my next move is a mistake, however.]
;W[jr]C[Fedya: I probably should have tried L18 instead, or something in the center.  But what?  I guess that my poor play in the center is one of the main reasons I lost the game.]
;B[kr];W[gs]C[Fedya: This sequence gets me nothing, but clearly I had no idea what to do here.


*******  as i said, the game is pretty much over at this point.  i will limit myself to comment on major mistakes and write a summary at the end.]
;B[fr];W[fs];B[es];W[gr];B[lb];W[mb];B[kb];W[lk]C[Fedya: Here I intended to try to take some more territory in the center; namely, the marked points.]
;B[kl];W[ll];B[lm];W[mm];B[mn];W[kk];B[jl];W[nl];B[nm];W[ml]
C[*****  don't play n8.  what happens if black captures?  not much.  take sente to play A6, d19, t15.  there are three moves where you keep sente.]
;B[da]C[Fedya: To this point, Black has been able to play all of these one-point endgame moves.  I don't know how much territory I lost as a result, but I can't find any sente moves that would have allowed me to play such a move.]

C[Fedya: It was around here that I realised how far behind I was.

Black's territory: ~20 in the bottom left, ~30 in the bottom right, 10 at the top left, ~30 at the top.
My territory: ~20 in the top right, ~20 in the top left, ~10 at the bottom, ~10 in the center.]
;W[jj]C[Fedya: Not that it makes much difference, but would H7 have been bigger?

*** yes, because of g6.];B[ij];W[ii];B[gn];W[gm]C[********  play h6 instead.  when black responds g7, play f8.  but with h6 there, black cannot reduce your territory as much as with the sequence you played.]
;B[hn];W[ho];B[hm];W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[jn];W[in];B[im];W[io]
;B[kj];W[ji];B[ni];W[mh]TR[nh]C[Fedya: This is a mistake.  I needed to sacrifice the O12 stone and play O10 instead.  Of course, considering how far behind I am, it makes no difference whatsoever.]
;B[nj]TR[oi][pi][oj]C[Fedya: Here I resigned, since I realised I was about to lose a bunch of stones in addition to trailing badly.  My opponent suggested that I should just sacrifice the three stones, but that doesn't work:]

(;W[lj];B[pj];W[qk];B[sm]C[Fedya: and now the group on the right is dead.


*********  summary -   there are two things that i can see that might help you.

1) look for any place that you can take sente.  sometime people do this too much and leave lots of weak groups, but there is a balance to find between the two extremes.  there were many places that you responded exactly like your opponent wanted you to and s/he kept sente.    2) if you are white, play aggresively.  especially when black tries to dictate the course of the game.  as early as you can, take sente, and use it to keep pressure on black.   don't let black make big moyos unless you also have big moyos.  break them up early, like you opponent did in this game.

i reviewed one of your games before and i think you are definitely making progress keep up the great work and you will certainly see results.]
