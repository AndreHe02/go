C[Llywelyn: I have taken a long absence from playing Go seriously and only just got back into it.  This game is against a computer (gnugo) while I practice and "get back into shape" so to speak.  Thanks for reviewing my game! Any help is appreciated.

Sincerely,
David

Hello David, 

I am Rogerio, I will be your reviewer for this evening :) hope you have a nice time. 

First of all, I would strongly advise you to drop playing computer programs, they make it too easy to create vices in your game, since you start involuntaringly taking advantage of their inner flaws. 

If you can go play on the internet, even better if you can get to a go club and you feel it to be a good learning envirorment. 

I strongly recomend the KGS server for begginers, and the gobase.org site for reference and articles. 

Whenever you see a " R> " it will be me giving my humble and probably not so acurate opinion ;)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[dj];B[jp];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne]
;B[pf];W[ng]C[Llywelyn: My understanding is that this is not strictly joseki, but I am not quite sure how to punish for it?  My move seems correct but I am uncertain.]
;B[oh]C[R> This seems ok];W[mp];B[pm];W[jc];B[cf]C[Llywelyn: Attempting to save M17 seemed like a bad idea with white's thickness.  An invasion seemed best, though perhaps it would have been better around F17?

R> Actually saving M17 can make it very hard for white, he will lose all his power in building influence with the O line stones, but an aproach is good also right now.]

;W[dl];B[dq];W[cq];B[dr];W[mh];B[nj];W[cr];B[bm];W[oq];B[pq]
;W[mr];B[lr]C[R> This is not so good, the stone imediatly gets into trouble, and makes it easier for white to live. M3 seems better]
;W[lq];B[kq];W[kp];B[jr]C[Llywelyn: That sequence seemed too defensive to me, is there a way I could have played it more aggressively?

R> As I said after M2 it is dificult to play agressive here, this seems good enough in the curent circumstances]
;W[ko];B[jo];W[op];B[oo];W[no];B[on];W[qb];B[rb]C[Llywelyn: This particular situation comes up often in my games and I'm not sure whether S18 or S17 is the better move.

R> S18 is better.];W[lb];B[li];W[mm];B[lk]C[R> Wrong direction, white is building teritory on the top, the extension should be towards that territory . The bottom group is alive, and that is all white wanted.]
;W[lh];B[ki];W[be];B[bf];W[ck];B[bk];W[jg];B[jh];W[cm];B[bl]
C[Llywelyn: Defending here and protecting the second row seems small and vulgar?

R> Seems right and necessary :)];W[fn];B[go];W[bn];B[ci];W[pr]

;B[ag];W[ae];B[bh];W[hh]C[R> Your response here and in all yose (endgame) plays lacks pressure, put stones where they will make him awnser, sente is the key to win games.]
;B[gh];W[kh];B[ih]C[Llywelyn: I think this move was a mistake, but white failed to capitalize on it?]
;W[hg];B[hi];W[gm];B[gl];W[hn];B[ho];W[ep];B[fp];W[fl];B[gk]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[nl];B[ol];W[ok];B[nk]C[Llywelyn: In retrospect I'm not sure this move was a good idea.  I really have no idea what I would have done to improve my position if white had taken the stone.

R> Q8 captures a stone after white P7];W[pk];B[ml];W[ll];B[og]
C[R> You must try to take advantage of weaknesses in white´s position now, for example: P17 followed by O16 is one way.]
;W[oe]C[R> Now he fixed it.];B[pe];W[mi];B[mj];W[hl];B[hk];W[hm]

;B[nh];W[of];B[ni];W[mf];B[fe];W[ge];B[ee];W[ed];B[gf];W[gg]
C[Llywelyn: Is there a weakness at F12?

R> No. 

And the endgame comes to a close with no surprises. 

Hope you understand what was said, you MUST get a better understanding of what is and what isn´t weakness. The endgame depends much on that. 

Any other questions feel free to e-mail me :) 

Bye for now.
