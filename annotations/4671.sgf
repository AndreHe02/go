C[banjiro: Hi!
dancristi: hi

Hi, I am playing black and would be thankful for hints in every part of the game. I am especially interestet in your ideas on how to develop my groups in middle game to get more teritory or to invade white teritory.

Thank you very much for your help!

**I'll be giving comments for both sides.  FYI i researched the opening and compared it to pro games as well as paid special attention to direction, which I think is the main point of this game. - Jon]
