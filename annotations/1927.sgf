AB[pd][dp]C[I played black.

Overall I thought I started out fairly well, except for the two moves I've commented. I thought I built some good moyos. Mistakes in the endgame cost about 10 points, but not the game.

I would appreciate the pointing out of any blunders, suggestions for study-- or pretty much any comments you'd care to make.

Thank you.

djna: This is a pretty peaceful game, no really dramatic fights. The use and abuse of sente determined the result.

Both players tend to "believe" their opponent's claims that certain moves are sente and follow through "obvious" sequences when they really should tenuki - there is one blunder by B towards the end of the game when he does not answer a threat when he should and he suffers a loss in the top right, but that is not the usual pattern.

So my suggestion for improvement would be to simply say "can I tenuki" before virtually every move!

For technical study a book such as "get strong at the endgame" or the Elementary Go series "endgame" book would be useful. It's very important to understand concepts such as double sente and reverse sente.]

;W[cc]TR[cb]
(;B[dd]C[djna - don't  think that this is joseki, see variation. This move should 
feel wrong - you know where W is going to be playing, and you have in effect
forced him to hane at the head of two stones. Your F16 stone does not
seem to be working too well, rather over concetrated.];W[cd]
;B[ee];W[df];B[ef]C[
djna - effectively you are pushing W along the 4th line. is your thickness going to be worth as much?]
;W[dg];B[eh]LB[cm:A]C[comment: this (12-29) didn't seem to work out very well, but I'm not sure what I should have done better.

djna - I find it very tough to find an alternative move in this area. I think that it's probably best to play somewhere else. The B group are not going to a target for attack, so I'd be inclined to approach the bottom right. Alternatively, playing somewhere in the region of  A  avoids the problem of W building a large side.

The problem for me in playing in this area is that you can't make a really convincing threat against the W group.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[fh]C[
djna: hand-to-hand fighting - anything can happen];B[di]LB[ei:A]
C[
djna: feels like a bad-shape move. A would feel better to me.]
;W[gg];B[ff];W[ci];B[dk]LB[ei:A][fi:B]TR[eh][di]C[djna: sometimes this is a good idea, let the opponent have a few stones and build on the outside. Here A seems to be too good, see variation.

but otherwise B ends up having to run with marked stones. I don't see any great  move here.

Perhaps B and hope to harrass the W group.]
(;W[cj]TR[eh]C[djna: feels like the natural move but now B can connect and has some prospect of building in the centre.

I think that the marked stone is pivotal, W should capture it.]
;B[ck]C[
djna: follows through the plan of conceding a bit and building a bit.]
;W[ch]LB[ei:A]C[
djna: why not A?]
(;B[gh]LB[dj:A]C[
djna:  good idea. B threathens to dominate the whole board. But did you see the ladder coming?

How about just playing A, see variation.

An important idea is that sometimes by cutting you allow the opponent to give up a small piece and by sacrificing get pressure.  You'd like W to connect where you cut and then you can  attack the clump of three stones.]
;W[fi]
(;B[hg]C[
djna: this is big, and as the ladder works seems reasonable. But it's galling to allow W access to the centre.

The variation is probably not playable but feels like a nicer idea]
;W[gi];B[hh];W[ei];B[mc]LB[pj:A]C[
djna: I can understand the impulse to make your wall mean something, but this is probably too small scale!

"play away from thickness" is the proverb.  Using thickness to build territory is usually bad, rather you want to encourage invasions and then attack them.

A seems about right to me.];W[pf]LB[mc:A]C[
djna: interesting. You can see how you can get drawn into hanging on to the territory at the top and before you know it W has built almost as much on the right with many fewer stones.

I find it hard to find a response that I'm happy with. Hence my reasons for not liking A.]
;B[qh]C[
djna: so B takes a consistent approach and seeks to attack by driving W towards thickness. Trouble is that it's hard to build much down the left.

Which pincer? Not sure, the result seems disappointing, so perhaps high would be better.]
;W[og]C[
djna:  robust response]
(;B[oq]TR[og][qh]C[comment: this was not good, either. I should have approached from above. Perhaps R8 is a good move, so that if W tries to cut at ~R10, I can approach the lower-right stone (C4) at R6 and then either return to R12 or continue to attack R4, depending. On the other hand, that seems overconcentrated-- maybe it's best to play R6 directly?

djna: Yes Ithink this is bad. If you exchange the marked stones you are committing. to making sense of the pincer. I dont' think that sacrificing it can make sense. See variation.]
;W[pi]
(;B[qj]C[
djna: the "skip away, sacrifice" ploy again. Quite a reasonable idea locally, but see variation for what I think is important.]
;W[me]LB[qm:A]TR[oq]C[
djna: W seems to be rather keen to reduce the upper side, I think he should look after his corner first, by playing A. This asks B to make sense of his two stones. By the time the dust has settled W may even get time to attack the marked stone.]
;B[pn]LB[qi:B][qm:A]C[
djna:  I like the fact that B did not defend at the top. Bottom right seems like the right area to play in.

I wonder if A would turn out better? There's a good chance that B also gets B and potentially a fair degree of territory and some pressure on W. But the chosen  taisha seems like a decent idea too, the details don't seem so clear though.]
;W[op]LB[qj:B][jp:A]TR[pn][oq]C[
djna: now this is what B was expecting, isn't it? Taisha joseki. Notoriously difficult. I tend to avoid it  because I'm a coward. I think that it's good to be adventurous, I reckon that being prepared to fight is good. Of course you may as a consequence suffer a few bad results on the way ...

The general idea is that  W is likely to be heading off in the direction of A, and B will tend to get two groups growing from the marked stones. If B gets the timing right then moves in the general vicinty of  A will grow territory to the left - and B has a potential framework there, so this  could be good. He has to think about the upper group,  the stone at B ought to be helpful, but as far as.I can see it seems just be on the wrong point.]
;B[pp];W[po];B[pq]
(;W[qn]C[
djna: not in my joseki book, see variation];B[oo];W[qo];B[no]
LB[pm:B][on:C][np:A]C[
djna: this seems odd, capturing at A feels better, but in either case allowing W B seems bad, I feel that B should tough it out by connecting at C.]
;W[pm];B[ql]C[
djna: seems a very odd move to me - subsequent plays seem to show that B doesn't have a good  follow up]
;W[qm];B[om];W[pl]LB[qc:B][qe:C][jp:A]TR[me]C[

djna: as B has effectively ignored the marked move I can understand the urge to play in the top right now. My feeling though is that a play near A must be bigger. 

My reasoning is that unless W can completely kill the top right, all he can really do is take a larger share in this area.  B and C are close to miai.]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[rf];W[rg];B[re]LB[qe:A][re:C][qf:B][jp:D]C[

djna: can W ignore this? If he can then playing at the bottom is pretty urgent.  Although there's quite a big loss for W in allowing B to whittle away at the territory here, I reckon it's not fatal to let him do so.

So Black has probably given up sente in playing  A for B perhaps not playing C but instead D is better.

Very important that you don't assume that your opponent will paly the natuaral move. As W I would certainly be arrogant and play D next]
;W[qg]C[
djna: W decides either to be "proper" or conservative.];B[kd]
LB[jp:A]C[
djna: I feel that this is too conservative. Does B need to answer if W plays here? I don't think so.

B play's A. One more move down there and B has huge territory, so W will almost certainly follow. I don't see a way for W to reduce B furtther at the top in *sente*]
;W[nc]LB[je:A]C[
djna: Now follows a "when do we tenuki" exchange. My feeling is that W should not start on this, because B can't really do anything very urgent here, and it's going to be very hard to keep sente. Best to switch right now.

In the end W seems to do more harm than good. Note that there's moves such as A that nearly work. By playing this sequence W loses all the aji.]

;B[jp]C[
djna:  this point it seems like B is well ahead. about the same solid territory for  each at the top but a huge framework at the  bottom. Only little problem, is W's potential in the centre.]

djna: this does seem appealing, but the corner is big and makes W's life easier. See Variation]

[jr][kr][lr][mr][nr][or][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os]C[

djna: this move seems so natural that it's quite surprising  to see how badly things turn out.

At first sight B is just calmly winning the game. W has invaded but got a little less territory
that B in the bottom left (triangles) So B just needs to keep the bottom territory to about the same size as white's upper middle (squares) 

However the game now swings. The first cause is that A is not forcing against the W group. So
W gets first move at the junction of two moyos. With hindsight something around B is better.]
;W[mm]C[
djna: this seems like a remarkably effective move.];B[nm];W[ml]

(;B[rh]C[

djna: the second cause is this unreasonable sequence. B gives up standard sente yose and in exchange donates stones to W. In the end this probably is sufficient to account for the loss, as W later gets too far into the B corrner.

See the varaition for some ideas.];W[sg];B[ph];W[oh];B[pj];W[oj]

djna: B can only play like this if he *knows* it works. Evey move is making W stronger.]

C[
djna: so this looks really effective. Surely W can't get that much territory here?

Still B seems to be winning comfortably.

I've added a variation after the next move to estimate the score and similar estimates after a few more exchanges in the yose. The thing that goes wrong for B is that he keeps losing sente and each loss of sente costs something.]

djna: this looks really big but somehow ends up losing sente. What happens next is  that W gets both A and B and there are really big for either side. Although B is taking points from W here, they're half value unless he keeps sente.]
;W[lh];B[mb];W[mg]TR[le][kf][lg]C[
djna: it feels natural to answer here, but actually giving up 3 stones is worth sente.

W should not play this because B should not answer - see variation]
