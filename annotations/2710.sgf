C[Kyo: Hello ! I am Kyoshinai, 11k on KGS. I'll try to do my best reviewing your game.

I commented mainly for white, but I added remarks and variations for both players were I saw huge mistakes or simply felt like stressing that point.]

(;W[pp]C[Kyo: This is quite unusual. It is a slow move at this point of the game since Black can get away very easily, and it doesn't make any territory or moyo yet.]
;B[kp];W[oo];B[pn];W[iq]C[Kyo: Here you can see some of the ill-effects of Q4. None of White's  groups is very strong, and the Q4 one's shape is not good.
While attacking a group, you should do it with your weaker one, so that it gets stregnth during the fight. So here I'd start with some move around N4.]
;B[np]C[Kyo: Now the Q4 group does not look so good.];W[mo]
;B[op];W[mp];B[no]C[Kyo: If you let Black take the P5 stone, he secures his group very easily, and can attack the bottom.]

(;B[nd]C[Kyo: Black cannot hope to gain anything from that. He has a huge wall , so he'd better try to use it with a move around K10, taking a good option on the center and build a huge moyo on the right.

If he wants to make a wall on the top, a play at O15 N15 or N14 is much better, since it stays away from the White stones. However, I feel like K10 is more important at the moment because if Black lets White play there his moyo is destroyed, since killing this stone will be almost impossible.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[me];B[jj]C[Kyo: Compare it to the situation prior the exchange 015-16 N15-16. Now White has an opening from where to invade.]
;W[ih]C[Kyo: Better invade with N13 first.];B[kh];W[jf];B[ng]

[nn][ao][bo][co][oo][ap][aq]C[Kyo: That was a close game. Black made some huge mistakes, but you managed to take profit from them well.

Black's moyo on the right was huge, and I think it was partly due to both Q4 and the early sacrifice of P5.

Next time, I advise you to anylse your own game first. You will see many of the mistakes I mentionned above, and it will allow you to see other possibilities, and thus asking questions about them, who may be more interesting to analyse, and  whose outcome is more difficult to see.]
