C[F: Good game. Points to consider:

1) Try to find sente moves (moves for which your opponent has to respond ).
2) Try to find out at what your opponent is aiming with his last move. Does he want to invade ? Does he want to attack a group of yours ? Every move should have a meaning ( unless your opponent plays all his moves on the first line, but that is a special case  :)        )]

;W[bc]TR[eb]C[F: I think white had to play at e12 instead of b11. W e12 seems solid and good shape. Now white has a weakness there and you can profit from it]

C[F: Good result for black !];W[cd]TR[ic]
(;B[hc]C[F: H11 looks to close to your wall at e11. I added a variation playing B j11 instead, which seems enough to keep the white f11 stone under control.]
;W[ki];B[lj]CR[ki]LB[kf:a][kg:b]C[Here I was unsure how to handle the white stone...

Pincer at a? or b?

;B[gk]C[F: You miss a move at m9, which is sente AND secures the upper right corner.]
;W[ek]
(;B[ci]TR[le][ck]C[Should I have invaded at 3-3 straightaway?

F: I think l9 or m9 are still the most interesting points for black.

c3 is possible ( see variation ), and leads to ko fight.

Actually, your move at c5 is ok, in co-operation with your strenght in the center and with b9. Whatever white's reaction, you always have a place to run to.]

C[F: White is still looking for a way to get his f11 stone out. g7 could be seen as a preparation move. Black has to answer here in my humble opinion.What about B g8 ?]
;B[jg]TR[gf]C[Black trying to prevent White from getting a larger center territory.]
;W[ii]TR[kg]C[F: As the saying goes: when you say A, you gotta say B   :)
The usual follow-up for black k7 is black l7. It leads to  complicated fighting ( which i think is slightly favorable for black because you separate the white groups ).

Your move is fine too. White has to respond and ... black g8 looks more interesting after k8.]

(;B[ck];W[cj];B[bj];W[bi]TR[dl]C[F: Black usually continues here to obtain a ko fight (which is better than nothing ). If black wins, the corner is for black, otherwise it is white territory. 

A move at B3 is not possible for black 

So, c3 is possible ( and a good move ), but it all depends on whether how many ko threats you and your opponent have.]
