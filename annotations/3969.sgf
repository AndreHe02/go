C[A: Hi, my name is Andreas Teckentrup, and I am about 1d in germany, but between 2-3k on KGS, so I am not much stronger than You. I hope my review will help anyway. 

A: Note: maybe a short introduction would be good at the beginning of the SGF file of Your next review request]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[po]LB[qo:A]C[A: Until here, a very common opening pattern.

90% of all pro games with this position the approach is answered at A... dont ask me why, though. I guess its because black likes to secure the corner in sente and move on to the upper left corner]

(;B[qm]LB[qo:A];W[on];B[om];W[nm];B[pm];W[qp]LB[nl:C][nn:B]
[qq:A]C[A: I would probably take the corner. Professionals prefer the hane at c or the cut at b instead]

(;B[mq];W[qq];B[jq];W[nl];B[pj]C[kilroy [6k\]: i realize i messed up joseki, but do you think this result is bad?

A: Its not that bad, K3 reduces the Influence of the lower left star point. I probably would have taken the corner, though.]
;W[rd];B[qe];W[jd];B[ce]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[A: With k16 in place, an approach from c14 or d14 is more common.]
;W[dh]LB[fe:A][df:B]C[kilroy [6k\]: which joseki would you have picked, but also looking at it now, C13 or D13 may have been a better approach]

(;B[ee]C[A: the one space jump is not joseki here, b plays f15 or d14 in answer to the high 2-space pincer.]
;W[fd];B[bh]C[A: normally, this is too low]
(;W[cd];B[bd]
(;W[de]C[A: this exchange seems unnecessary, so its aji keshi]
;B[df];W[dd]
(;B[cf]LB[bf:A]C[A: better at A];W[bc]C[A: w could have played b17 right away]
;B[cj];W[cm]C[kilroy [6k\]: what is the best move in the lower left?]
;B[cq]C[A: The invasion is reasonable since w cant use the resulting influence well here.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[do];W[cn];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
;W[fq];B[bp];W[eo];B[qr]C[kilroy [6k\]: do you think it is a good idea to make sure my bottom group is settled?
A: The group was settled before, but the lower right corner is also big territorially so its a good move. it also revives the o6 cut]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[ph]LB[oi:A][nj:B]C[kilroy [6k\]: how to respond?

A: I think here you made a crucial mistake. The upper right corner is strong, while the right side is threatened to get surrounded. Its important here to move the right side group into the center, splitting white.]

(;B[og]C[A: this is certainly the wrong direction];W[oh];B[ng]
;W[nj]C[Black got surrounded and didnt get much in exchange.]
;B[oi];W[ni];B[nh];W[qj]C[kilroy [6k\]: what to do now?

better do something earlier, this is tough for black];B[qk]

;B[em];W[en]
(;B[gg]C[kilroy [6k\]: how is my result up to here?

A: looks good after the big capture in the center. I dont like g13 though, should be one line higher, at g14.]

A: w should live but at high costs];W[ip];B[hp]LB[hq:A]C[w must cut at A!]

A: Your fighting was quite well, but in the early endgame You missed a few big points like J16 (probably the frustrating misread where white broke into the center made You lose concentration) and that lost You the game.]
