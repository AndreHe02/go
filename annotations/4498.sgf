C[Dear reviewer,
Thanks for your assistance with this game.
I played Black and lost by a big margin.
I played the san-ren-sei, which I thought I know well, and this game was quite surprising to me - I thought I was leading and suddenly I found myself trailing behind quite significantly. I would like to know my mistakes - especially on the strategic side.
Thanks!
Avi (abennun)

Hi, I'm Lin .  I'm 2dan at the local club which means I'm too weak to tell you what the correct moves are, but maybe I can give you ideas what to think about.]
;B[pd]C[ I'll comment both black and white because it's useful to know when you opponent does something wrong.]

;W[rf];B[og]C[Now It's ok for both.];W[cf];B[ch];W[cc];B[dc]
;W[cd];B[de];W[bf];B[eg];W[jp]LB[jj:A][cn:B][qn:C]C[So far - quite standard]
;B[jn]LB[jj:A][cn:B][qn:C]C[I thought this is a good move aiming at taking control of the center.

Too greedy for me. Your reality territory is less than white now, but moyo is big enough, which means this is going to be a serious fighting game.

A B C is good enough. If you want to play at K6, You must prepare for the white invasion to your up-territory.]
;W[jf]LB[id:2][le:1]C[White counter-atacked.

W Good move!
black can play at 1 or 2. K12 means you want to kill W inside your territory, but you are not strong enough that means K16 is lonely and too weak to counter-atacked.]
;B[jh]C[I thought this is the proper direction to respond - forcing White to live small at the top, and in-line with the K6 play take control over the center.]
;W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[kf];W[jc]
(;B[if]TR[jc][kd][ke]C[This move is not good enough, W's maojor part is  triangle.]

;W[lc];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[ic];B[ld];W[le];B[md];W[he]C[If I want to kill W that I will try to play at H14 or somewhere but not J13 which is useless to the W major group.]

C[So far I felt good - White has still to invest plays at the top to live, and Black's thickness at the center looks promising.

Black is too heavy; besides, B has not enough real-territory and W is easy to win the game.]

(;B[db];W[cb];B[fe];W[nb]
(;B[la];W[ma];B[pb];W[mc]C[White selected to give up the corner, which increased my confidence...]
;B[rb];W[qb];B[qa];W[rh]
(;B[qe]C[Maybe R11 is better for the centre.];W[qi];B[ph];W[rj]
;B[re]C[This is the first play I have doubts about. Black secures 12 points in the corner, but in gote - White'e next move seems much bigger]
;W[cn]LB[ip:A][kp:B][qq:C]C[To now, Black do not have enough territory or moyo to win the game.]
;B[hp]C[Suddenly I realized the center alone is not enough to win, so I had to invade the bottom as well...

A B C is better than H4];W[io];B[in];W[ho]
(;B[gp]C[May be playing lighter, like F4?];W[go];B[ep];W[eo]

(;B[dq];W[fp];B[eq];W[fq];B[cp];W[co];B[do];W[dn]
(;B[fr];W[gq];B[gr];W[hq]C[I thought OK, still seems reasonable game for Black - the bottom left corner is Black's, and the center is still dominated by Black as well, and White cannot make too many points on the left due to C12]

(;B[oj];W[pn];B[pl]C[Does not prevent the linkage between the 2 White groups. May be R9 or R8?]
;W[ql];B[qm];W[pm];B[qk];W[rl];B[rk];W[pk];B[pj];W[sk];B[ok]
;W[qj];B[om];W[pk];B[nn];W[ol];B[nl];W[hl]C[White starts proving to Black that the center is not that big...]
;B[jl];W[hj]C[I evaluated the situation as follows:
Black can make around 30 points in the center, 10+ points at the bottom left, 12 points at to top right = ~55 points.

White has the top left corner - 10 points, thep top - 10 points at most, may be 10 points on the left and less than 10 points at the bottom. Now the issue of the bottom right corner is still open - if Black succesfully invades there, than it dos not change the score by much, so Black leads by 10-15 points.]
;B[np]C[So in line with the previous analysis, I prepared the invasion by playing O4.]
;W[lo]C[This is a good move by White. I thretens to cut off O4 and aims at the cennter as well. I did not find a good answer.]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[qq]C[I would like to get your input on this invasion. I was sure Black could live in the corner, and was quite surprised this was not the case... What went wrong, or simply Black cannot live there? If I knew this I would have played Q3 probably...]
;W[pq];B[rp];W[rr];B[qr];W[pr];B[rs];W[sr];B[rn];W[so];B[qo]
;W[qp];B[oo]C[I could not find a way to live, so I at least reinforced the connection - may be a slack move]
;W[po];B[ik]C[probably M7 better?];W[lm];B[hk];W[lk];B[ml];W[ll]
;B[gl];W[bp];B[bq];W[bo];B[dp];W[cj];B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[ck]

C[Well... Now it is clear that White comfortably leads. The right side is big, as well as the left and the botton as well has much bigger potential for White that for Black.

The rest of te game is a strugle to somehow get back to the game, but to no avail.

Thanks again for your review!
