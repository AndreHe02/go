C[Hi,
In this game I'm playing as white.
As always, I have a problem with giving my opponent a big moyo and being unable to reduce it.

Thank you for all your comments.

Hi,
My name is Tim Kington, and I'm about 8-9k on KGS.  My name there is MatCauthon.  If you have any questions about my comments, you can reach me at timkington@gmail.com.]

;B[pl]C[unleash: I don't know this move.

Me neither :)];W[qj]C[unleash: ok?

Yes.  This is good - extending from your stone above while attacking Black's base.  It's very good to play moves like this that have more than one purpose.]
;B[od];W[qf]LB[pf:a]C[I would prefer A, especially with the stone below in place.]
;B[ld];W[de];B[fd];W[cc];B[dd]C[unleash: Again a strange move to me.

This is pretty common.  Black's making a nice framework to the right.]
;W[cd];B[ee];W[df];B[qh];W[oj];B[oh];W[mj];B[qp]C[What about P14 for white?]
;W[rl]C[This move is alright if you can take away Black's base, and chase his group out into the middle.  Otherwise it isn't worth a lot of points.  P14 would be good, too - if Black runs away with those two stones, you will get a big gain out of it, and it should help you reduce the territory above.]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[pj];W[pi];B[pk];W[qi];B[ph];W[oi];B[ci]C[Now you should attack Black's group on the right.  R3 would be a good start.  If you can make it run away, you'll get points along the bottom, and some strength out towards the center that will eventually hurt Black's lower left territory.]

(;W[ep]C[This isn't the standard move.  I'm not sure if you're trying to make it complicated here or not.  See variation for the usual sequence.]
;B[eo];W[eq];B[fn]LB[do:a]C[I think you should cut at A here, if your goal was to start a fight.  See variations.]

C[unleash: To me the situation seems already bad but I have no idea what to do.

Black got more out of that last exchange than White, but I wouldn't say you're behind  Right now you have territory on the bottom, and a little in the upper corners.  I would guess the bottom's worth about 35, and the corners may be worth about 10 each, so you have maybe 55 points.  Black only has territory in the lower left corner.  The rest of his areas are still invadable.  Since your stones on the left are so strong, I think you should have played to reduce Black's potential at A or B.  A is probably more important.  Also, the attack at C is much more difficult for Black now that you have a strong wall to the left.]
;B[mo]C[Oh well, now these stones are safe.];W[je]C[This is the right idea, but you need to be a little more aggressive.  In this case if Black just connects straight across, he's very satisfied.  You need to play on the fourth line to keep that from happening.]
;B[jd];W[id];B[jc];W[ic];B[ie];W[he];B[if]
(;W[jb]LB[gd:a]C[I think this should be at A.  You have already reduced the territory to the right, and you might be able to get an attack going on the stones to the left.  Also, Black won't be able to ignore you on the left, so you can come back to this point.  See variation.]
;B[hd];W[kc];B[kd];W[lc];B[mc]
(;W[mb]LB[lb:a]C[This is a mistake.  A is better.  You have succeeded beyond your wildest hopes.  See variation.]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[ib];W[ka];B[hc];W[nc]C[You are already alive.  This move is uneccessary, damages the group to the right, and makes Black's center influence stronger.  You should do something to reduce Black's framework on the left.]
;B[md];W[pc];B[oc]C[unleash: Black seems to have a lot of influence now so it's even harder to invade the moyo on the left side.]
;W[ob];B[bg];W[bf];B[cg];W[db];B[eb];W[ec];B[ed];W[ea];B[fc]
;W[cb];B[ml]C[This is a mistake by Black.  This gives you a chance to really get out into the center.]
;W[qm]LB[kj:a]C[You need to take this chance to ruin Black's center potential.  I would suggest A]
;B[pm];W[qn];B[op];W[qq];B[rp];W[rq]C[This is far too small to play at this stage.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[np];W[mq];B[fj]
(;W[nf]LB[of:a]C[Here you missed your chance.  You MUST play at A to attack these stones.  This makes it very easy for Black to stay connected.  See variation.]

White suffers a bitter defeat.
B+res.

Where did I make a mistake? I still agree with my decisions in this game but for some reason I failed badly.

There were two major problems that I see.  Obviously, you let Black's moyo on the left get too big.  The other problem I see is that for the second half of the game, you let Black lead you around by the nose - answering every move he played.  He gained more and more ground at the end of the game this way.  I think at this point, instead of resigning, you need to invade the left side.  Depending on the life and death skills of the players, it may be possible.]
