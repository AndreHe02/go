C[Hi, this is a game a recently played in a tournament. I wrote it down afterwards until the point I remembered. I'm looking for hints on the middlegame and the balance of influence and territory and the choices I made. In the end I was lucky to win by the smallest of margins, so I'm sure there is plenty of room for improvement :-). Thank you!

The result is ok, but I think this move a bit slow, w cannot attack b here. I'll go A.]

LB[on:A]C[AB: Maybe I should have played this without C14 first?


This move is not necessary, L16-P15 is good structure and O16 maybe your sente, here is not the weak point. And, this move doesn't enlarge your moyo.

Moves like A will enlarge your moyo and erase w's downside, so that's better.]
;W[dj];B[ch];W[eg];B[bd];W[cc];B[nn];W[kg];B[lh]LB[ki:A]C[I thought defending is big enough here.


Here b have a weak point at A, so I think not good shape. And if I cannot find a very good defense point, I may go attack L13 from outside.]
;W[ll];B[kn]C[But here the possibility of the M3 invasion looked more promising to me.


M3/H3 is big but now b may get more profit by attack center w.]

But w center become strong, I think b lose more potential here.]
;B[ho];W[ln];B[mq];W[np];B[dr]MA[bd][cf][ch]C[I thougt this one increases pressure in White and stabilizes my own group, which is necessary, because two weak groups on the left would be difficult to handle.


I agree, This move is always big.
I feel X stones will be easy to live.];W[nk];B[oj];W[om];B[pm]
;W[rp];B[gm]C[Is this a good attacking point?

Not bad, the right direction, may be G6 a little better.];W[gn]
;B[hn];W[fm];B[hm]C[slow move, F8 of course. you have no weak groups to worry about, so continue attack.]
;W[fl];B[eo];W[fn];B[on]LB[fj:A][hc:B]C[How big is this really?


Not small, maybe >10 points?
Now it's possible to go N4 cut, and get some endgame profits.

A will be good attack, B maybe bigger than P6.];W[bc];B[bj]
;W[ic];B[ck]LB[eh:A][fj:A]MA[fl][fm][fn][gn][go][gp][fq]C[This seemed very big to me...


I will attack the w group.];W[ki];B[jc]MA[lc][lb][la][ma][mb]
[mc][ka][kb][kc]C[Not good, b won't  get big profits around X. But w J16 helps him.]
;W[id];B[kh];W[ji];B[jh];W[ke];B[ld];W[mf];B[lf]C[I underestimated the damage White does here to me. Was there a better way out?



Here b was not good shape, so this result is not so bad.];W[pe]

LB[fj:A][eh:A][ce:B][ib:C][hh:D][ii:D][nr:E][mb:F][mk:G]C[Is this the right time already? Who's leading? What are other big endgame points? Thank you!


You may consider some attack around A.
For endgame, yes, this is about the right time.
Hard for me to tell who is leading, should be close.
Other big endgame points are like B-G])
