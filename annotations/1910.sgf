C[*SEKKOW*: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.

z: Game reviewed by zenjutsu (12k* on IGS).  Reviewer comments to be preceeded by "z:".]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq]C[*I played black in this game, komi 0.5, my current rank in IGS is 18k, my opponent압 was 16k at the game압 moment. All my comments on the game are between ** marks*

*This (f3) is a typical move I do after playing two 4-4 stones*

z: Completely reasonable play.];W[jp];B[iq]SQ[dn][cn][cq]C[*this is the extension I do almost everytime if I have enough room in the Fuseki*

z: With white's loose pincer at K4, this play is possible.  However, Kogo's Joseki Dictionary does not list it.  Kogo's lists a 3-3 entry to the corner or double-approach (marked) as black's joseki options.  Personally, I feel that these black stones will be too easy for white to contain and/or threaten, thereby giving white some leverage.  Perhaps that is why Kogo's does not list J3 (used in game) as a standard reply to W's K4.]
;W[jq];B[fo];W[cn]C[z: ...and now we can see that white was able to restrict B's growth with K3, followed by creating a reasonably stable pair of stones with room for expansion.  Meanwhile, B's 3 stones do not appear to offer much future territory expansion.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[dr];W[np]C[z: I think W should have placed this stone at O3.  O4 feels too high, and allows B to M4.]
;B[lo]C[*here I usually would play at p3 or p2 in order to attack the white압 group, but I wanted to try something different*

z: First, P3 or P2 don't attack W, they only force W to respond. While this helps secure B's corner, it also secure's W's group. That's why I don't feel they would "attack" W, but rather "threaten" W.  I know... it's just semantics.  However it's an important distinction.

Second, if B want's to attack, I think M4 is more appropriate.]
;W[lp];B[mo];W[mp];B[no];W[ko];B[oo];W[op];B[po]C[z: No.  If you feel a need to play locally, then go with O3 to seal the corner.  Otherwise you are allowing W to O3 later, which is too valuable.  However, this play does achieve your first objective of securing your 4 stones, I just feel O3 would do the same in a more efficient manner.]
;W[ip];B[hq];W[km];B[ep];W[do];B[oq]SQ[qj][jc][jd][de][ce][pj]
C[z: Very valuable play, however I think there are bigger plays on the board.  Some suggestions are marked.  Basically, this play is worth about 5-10 points, whereas the marked plays could be more around 20 points.]
;W[nq];B[or];W[nr];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir]C[z: This entire sequence along the bottom just feels far too small for this time in the game.  Remember, play critical plays first (none of these seemed critical), then big plays.  There are bigger plays on the board.]
;W[qj]C[*before this white압 move at r10, I hoped he didn앖 do that since that was my planned next move*

z: You should have done it earlier.];B[ql];W[qg];B[rk]C[z: Wrong timing.  White doesn't _have_ to respond (not a critical threat), so he can tenuki and make a big play.]
;W[nc]C[z: Looks good.  If I were B, I'd feel compelled to protect UR stone, so this move appears to have sente.]
;B[rj];W[ri];B[pj];W[pi];B[qk];W[qi];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj]C[z: Now W has a large wall, and that lone B stone in UR corner is looking _very_ vulnerable.]
;W[jd]C[z: W is building a large framework, and also threatening to take entire UR.  B appears very far behind right now.]
;B[ce]C[z: Good job.];W[ee];B[ch];W[ck];B[cc];W[dd];B[bj]C[*mistake ... I think this move caused the loss of the upper left corner since I didn앖 conect c15 and c17*

z: You are correct.  B must C16 to maintain upper left.];W[cd]

;B[cj];W[cm];B[al];W[fm]C[z: I don't like this play.  W should either C2 to secure group (if that's goal), or finish off UR corner.]

C[z: Mistake by W.];B[re];W[qe];B[sf];W[rf];B[se];W[sg];B[sc]
;W[ne];B[rb];W[ma];B[oa]C[z: Too small.  Only worth a point or two, and not _necessary_ to ensure life for UR group.  So, B could opt to make a bigger play instead.]

(;B[bh]C[*b13 is better? ...I guess around here is one of the biggest mistakes I made in this game by loosing the b15 group*

z: B13 still appears to lose group (see alternative move tree). Basically, game is _very_ uphill for B about 20 stones ago.]
;W[bg];B[ej];W[ii];B[hb];W[gb];B[fc]C[z: Mistake.];W[ib];B[jb]
;W[ha];B[fd]C[z: B is just giving more prisoners to W.];W[fe]

;W[ml];B[nl];W[ln];B[mm];W[ll];B[cr]C[z: Somebody finally went for C2.  This is worth a good 5-10 points. Clearly more than the T12 sequence.]

C[z: ?  Not necessary until W forces it.  You basically just did the same thing as pass.  Why not use sente to L1?]

z: B lost by a wide margin because the early play gave W large and efficient framework while B appeared to often miss potentials for big plays.]
