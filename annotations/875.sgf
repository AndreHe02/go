C[Hello. I was white in this game and I loose with 0.5 point.
I add some comments and questions and would be very appreciate if you'll help me to understand where I did wrong.

RickMott: Hi, Alexey.  Nice to meet you.    I edited the SGF file using Cgoban 1.9.10 under Linux.  I hope you can read
the variations.  I have a few general comments after looking at the game.
First, you should break the habit of always answering an approach to your
4-4 corner stone with a contact play on top.  Often an extension on the
other side is more valuable.

Second, you have a tendency to play locally too long during a fight.  It is
very important, especially in the early game, to leave a fight as soon as
you are sure your group is stable or your opponent will not be forced to
respond to your move.  Take a big point in some open area of the board.

Sente, or moves your opponent must answer, are equally important in
the endgame.  You can often make a small sente play before a big play
which is not sente.  Searching the board carefully for sente moves
throughout the endgame will improve your rating very quickly.

Good luck!

;W[qf];B[qd]C[That wasn't what I was expecting for.
RickMott: Yes, this is not good for Black.  He should either play a contact move
on either side at P17 or R15, or play a splitting move at P15 to avoid being
sealed into the corner.   R16 would normally emphasize the right side, but
you have a stone there so it makes no sense.];W[qi]C[Is this move ok?
RickMott: I think P15, sealing Black into the corner, is better.
He will have to work to live and you should get outside influence
in sente.

If you wanted to reinforce one of your two stones, the O17
stone is potentially weaker because of the black stone at top
center, so you should help that one first.  The R14 stone can
either run out or make a base easily later.];B[pk];W[pi]C[RickMott: This is a small move, and makes you overconcentrated.
P15 is still good.  You can also ignore Black locally and take a big
point on the bottom, which is wide open.  K3 or O3, for example.]
;B[nd]C[RickMott: You could consider a wedge at P16 here instead of
the outside hane.  See the variations. (I use cgoban under
Linux, hope you can read the variations on your SGF editor;
please email me if you cannot see them.)]
(;W[md]C[RickMott: Maybe a wedge at P16 would work better.  See variations
from previous move.];B[ne];W[kc];B[ld];W[lc];B[me];W[jc]C[RickMott: I think connecting at N17 would be better.]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[kd];W[oc]C[RickMott: This is not a good exchange; you force Black to  strengthen his wall which weakens your right side group.
A solid connection at O18 fixes your own cutting points and
leaves open extending on the left and reducing the Black
corner by the monkey jump at R19, for example.];B[od];W[pc]
;B[qc];W[nb]C[may be too small...];B[fd];W[fc]TR[df][dc]C[I'm not shure about direction - it not looks like I could get much on the upper side, so maybe it's better to play something like D14 or D17 - to get corner and left side?

RickMott: I would prefer D14, for two reasons.  First, extending on the side
away from an approach move is standard because it maintains a local balance.
Second, I would not want to play a contact move against the black F16 stone;
that tends to strengthen it, and you might want to play a splitting move at
H16 later.

You could also leave this corner alone and play a big move on the bottom
like K3 or O3.  Overall, I think that either be better than any of the upper left
alternatives.];B[gc];W[ec];B[ed];W[dc];B[ce];W[bd]C[Seems, stupid move...
RickMott: No, not so bad.  It secures your corner.  You have to worry
about a big developing area of black influence in the top center, though.
It might have been better to split Black with D15 right away and not
worry about the corner.  Hard to say for sure.];B[cd];W[cc]
;B[be];W[bc]C[RickMott: All fine so far.];B[gb]C[RickMott: This is a mistake for Black.  He should complete
his wall with C15.];W[de]C[RickMott:   Good move!  Split Black and break into his area of
influence.  This is much more important than either the corner
or the top center for White.];B[cg];W[gd]C[RickMott: Again, good play.  Black made a small move, and this
cut is dangerous for him.  So far, so good.];B[hd];W[ge];B[he]
;W[gf];B[ja]C[RickMott: This is a greedy move.  Black cannot afford to try this
with the cutting point at H17.  You can play J18 to capture the
stone by threatening a cut at J\H17.  See variation.]
(;W[ka]C[RickMott: You let Black get off too easily here.];B[ia]
;W[fb]C[RickMott: Protecting the corner is not important now.  Make one
of the big moves at the bottom.];B[ic]C[RIckMott: This is a small play for Black also.  The bottom is
bigger, or an approach like C6 to enclose the left side and
attack your corner at the same time.];W[jb]C[RickMott: Sente locally, but Black should still ignore you and
take a big point.];B[cn]C[RickMott: and he did.];W[dn]C[RickMott: Extend in the other direction.  This is a bad habit which
you should break; you did it at the top, too.];B[cp];W[co];B[cq]
;W[dq];B[bo];W[do];B[cm];W[cr]C[RickMott: Too small, Black should ignore you.  A move around
K3 or K4 is big for both sides now.];B[bp];W[jq]C[Too far?
RickMott: No, this is correct.  The general rule is jump 2 spaces
from a single stone, and one more space for each stone in the
wall from which you are extending.  So 5 spaces from a 4-stone
wall is perfect.];B[er];W[fq]C[RickMott: No, just connect at D2, this is a bad move for Black.  Your
move lets him capture C2 and hollows out your territory.  Make him
fight to live; that stone should not do well so close to your strong wall.]
;B[dr];W[fr];B[br];W[np]C[RickMott: I like this move.  You want to play high to grow your
moyo toward the center and counter the influence of the Black
wall at the upper right.];B[lq];W[lp];B[nq];W[mq];B[mr];W[mp]
;B[oq];W[lr]C[RickMott: This feels small to me.  You are fighting over 6 or 8 points
at the bottom, when the game will be decided by whose moyo
facing the center develops better.  How about P7, which both
expands your moyo and threatens to jump into the black right
side with R7?];B[kr];W[kq];B[nr];W[ls]C[RickMott: Small moves on both sides, ignoring the decisive
battle for the center.];B[gr];W[fs];B[gq];W[gp];B[fp];W[eq]
C[RickMott: Black has no business starting this fight.  This is good for
you.];B[hp];W[go];B[ho];W[hq]C[RickMott: This is OK, but I like extending at J3 better.  It still takes
away any hope of eye space for Black and strengthens you.  You
want to either capture the black group, or build up strength while
chasing it in order to attack the right side.];B[iq];W[hr];B[gn]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[eo]C[RickMott: Fine, no worries, your group is now solidly alive.]
;B[ir];W[gs];B[jp];W[jr]C[RickMott: This move is not needed.    Even if Black plays here, he
cannot make an eye.  Cut at H6 instead to keep Black separated.]
;B[kn]
(;W[mn]C[RickMott: You need to cut Black somewhere, otherwise his group
gets too strong to attack easily.  This move gives him a lot of
potential.  I would play either J6 or the clamp at K5 (see
variations).];B[pn];W[ql]C[RickMott: Wrecking Black eye space with J6 or K7 is still better.]
;B[qm];W[qk]C[RickMott:  Too defensive.  You can extend toward the center at
Q8 and fight.  This move lets Black connect the Q9 stone back at
Q8, making him much stronger.  Locally, you have the advantage;
you can either connect to your upper right group or to the bottom
group.];B[nl]C[RickMott: A puzzling move.  What does this accomplish?  You should
punish Black by splitting with Q8 or even P7.  Chasing these weak
stones will allow you to neutralize his center-facing top wall.  You
may be able to come back to attacking his bottom center group,
as well.  Black should definitely connect back at Q8 here.]
;W[qo]C[RickMott: Not a good time for this.  You will force Black to
strengthen himself and you will not be able to attack the
O8-Q9 stones as easily.];B[qp];W[po];B[oo];W[ro];B[rp];W[on]
;B[om];W[qn];B[pm]C[RickMott: I do not understand why Black connects instead of
capturing at O6. If he then gets to play a block at N7, he will
have almost blocked your bottom group from influencing the
center at all.  That would make the game very hard for you.]
;W[rm];B[el]C[RickMott: This is a mistake for Black.  He should still capture
at O6.  You will have some chance to attack his floating stones.]
;W[nn]C[RickMott: Good move.];B[og];W[lm]C[RickMott: This is a difficult decision, but I would prefer to
jump out with O11.  It would take Black two moves to
connect his weak groups at the bottom center and right
side.  O11 prevents any large black moyo from developing
in the center.];B[km];W[lk]C[RickMott: this line of play makes the black bottom center
group fairly secure.  But you get to reduce any potential
Black center territory.];B[nj];W[ok]C[RickMott: Playing inside like this gives Black too many
choices.  I think O11 would work better even now.  You
may capture Black on a larger scale, and you will surely
destroy any possibility of center territory while chasing
his group.];B[oi]C[RickMott: This is a sensible move for Black.  He makes potential
for territory from his upper wall.  Compare this to the position
after White O11 on the previous move to see how much better
that would be for you.];W[nk];B[pj]C[RickMott: Small move for Black.  He could consider a contact
move at M10 to expand his moyo.];W[pl];B[oj];W[mk];B[qj];W[rj]
;B[rk];W[ri];B[rl];W[ol];B[nm]
(;W[mm]C[RIckMott:  These stones cannot escape anyway.  Take a couple
of extra points by capturing at P4 instead.  This also creates a
useful cut point at Q3 which is at least a good ko threat.  See
variations.];B[kk];W[li];B[qg]C[RickMott: Black would do better to build his own moyo with a
move around H10 or so.];W[rg];B[rf]C[RickMott:  This hane is no good; locally Black should hane
above at P14, but enlarging his center moyo is more valuable.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[re];B[qe];W[sf];B[pf]C[RickMott; You did very well out of this exchange, and ended with
sente.  Your most critical task is to keep Black from making too
much territory in the center.  This next move is very important.
About G11 feels plausible; you can jump in any direction from
that.  Black cannot defend everywhere.];W[rf]C[RickMott: Oh, dear. Very small move.  Now Black gets to look
for a big one.];B[lg]C[Here I realize that black looses some of his groups, but anyway gets much profit in the center...
How should I play there?

RickMott: I like G11.  Black can try to cut you off, but the result will
only be worse destruction of his territory.];W[hf]C[RickMott: This is OK, but gives Black a chance to make some
territory in the center and left side.  If I were Black, I would
also play G11 now.];B[if]C[RickMott: But he responds locally, so you get away with it.
This move protects a small territory instead of a potential
big one.  Mistake for Black.];W[dg]C[RickMott: This is OK, black has to respond.]
;B[ch];W[dh];B[di];W[ei];B[fj];W[cf]C[RickMott: Small move.  I like H10 here to reduce Black.]
;B[bf];W[df]C[RickMott: This sequence ends giving Black sente -- very important
at this stage of the game.];B[fi];W[fh];B[ej]C[RickMott: Black should complete his moyo with J10 here.]
;W[hh];B[hj]
(;W[ji]C[RickMott: You could put more pressure on Black with a contact
play at J10.  That would also threaten the peep at L8.  See variations.]
;B[ik]C[RickMott: K10 would be stronger for Black.];W[ib]C[RickMott:  Good end game move, worth at least 4 points, but
does not end in sente.  The hane at T4 should come first, and the
hane at A15, and maybe a move at L5.  Black should ignore you
and take the hane at T5; it is sente for both sides.];B[hb]
;W[ha];B[ig]C[RickMott: Black is missing some good moves, too.  His hane at
T5 is atari and sente.  Connecting at P4 is big, too.];W[ga]
;B[hc];W[qb]C[RickMott: Big, but again gote.  In the end game, you need to be
more careful about looking for sente moves first.];B[rb];W[qa]
;B[ra];W[pb];B[rd]C[RickMott: But Black fails to take advantage of his opportunity as
well.];W[is];B[ip];W[hg]C[RickMott: Only 1 point, look for something bigger (and all the sente
plays we discussed before).];B[gi];W[gh];B[kh];W[mh];B[mg];W[nh]
;B[oh];W[ng];B[nf]C[RickMott: Good moves!];W[ki]C[RickMott: This move is not necessary.  You can connect K11 to
either M11 or H11.  You have some sente plays available which
you should do first.

You should play A15 and T4.  Black must answer both.  These
plays are worth at least 6 points at this stage of the game.]
;B[lh];W[mi];B[ii];W[op]C[RickMott: Good idea, but hane at the edge first.]
;B[so]C[RickMott: Black gets it first.  This is worth 4-5 points, your capture
of P5 only 3.  (Unless Black is forced to make a defensive move
in the corner, but I do not think so.)];W[ml];B[kp]C[RickMott: This is only 1 point; extending to T6 or taking K10 are
both worth more.];W[ds];B[cs];W[es];B[cr];W[lo];B[sp]C[RickMott: This is a mistake, Black can extend to T6 which is
worth 2 points.];W[ms];B[ns];W[ko];B[jo];W[dm];B[dl];W[ae]C[RickMott: Good move!]
;B[bg];W[af]C[RickMott: 1 point in gote; E7 and K12 are both sente, T6 is 2
points in gote.];B[ag];W[ad];B[eh]C[RickMott: Black still misses T6 and K10.]
;W[eg];B[jh]C[RickMott: 1 point move.];W[kl];B[jl];W[kj];B[jk]
C[RickMott: Good, you got one of them.];W[ll]C[RickMott: Ouch!  Filling a ko is only half a point.  T6 would win
it for you.];B[mj]C[RickMott: Good sente move for Black];W[lj]
;B[hi]C[RickMott: This move does nothing for Black, makes no points
and is not necessary for defense.];W[jj];B[ih]C[RickMott: Another pointless Black move.]
;W[sn]C[RickMott: Phew!  You found it at last!!!];B[sd];W[rh]
C[May be this is loosing move :)
RickMott: Yes, you could reduce Black by 1 point in sente at E7,
so this is a net loss of 2 points.];B[md];W[ei]C[RickMott: You still should take E7 first.  Black must answer, and
you have lots of ko threats left attacking Black cutting points at
Q3, C11, H6, K6.

So taking this ko is the last losing move :)];B[em]C[RickMott: Too bad; Black got it first.]
