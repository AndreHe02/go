C[Hello Dear Reviewer,

the protagonist of this game is a White group on the left side.
It comes back in two stages of the game...
Well the status alive/dead was never really clear untill the end.
At first is was left as "dead" but connected to an other group.
In the second stage this link was broken during a Ko fight which Black (me) won.
But still the group stayed alive.

I made also a big blunder at the end of the game.

Thanks for the review and have a great time!

Buitenland

PS: I've preceded my comments with "B:".];B[dp]C[>Hi! I've started my comments with ">". There are quite a lot of variations, but they're only really there for demonstration.

Your opening was very influence-oriented, concentrating on controlling the centre. White made lots of invasions throughout the game - some reasonable, some not so reasonable - and you handled them well. Black left a group of stones floating in the middle for quite a while, but white never got round to attacking them. 

The white group on the left was probably dead, but you failed to kill it. Much more important is the black group on the right - it was definitely dead, and yet neither player seemed to notice. If you really want to improve your playing, the best way is to start doing some life and death problems. You should only do easy ones at first, but even that will help you a great deal.

You were also let down in several places by poor reading, and at one point gave away lots of stones for no reason. Doing life and death problems also improve your reading, so you won't make unnecessary moves.

Apart from that, the game was very good. You should try some different styles of opening (more territorial, less influence), just to gain more experience.

If you have any questions, do find me on KGS as "Qq" or email me: Lcjs at cam.ac.uk.  Have fun!]
;W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[dj];W[pj];B[jp]C[>This is all fine so far, but it's important to realise that stones on the fourth line aren't good for taking secure territory. White will be able to invade, and you mustn't expect too much.]
;W[mq];B[jd];W[gp]C[>This is a good invasion, and it's hard to say how to deal with it. It's supported by the stone at N3 and has lots of options. You should certainly attack it, using your fourth-line stones for fighting power, but you can't reasonably expect to kill it.]

(;B[eo]C[buitenland [13k\]: B:Is E5 ok to defend the corner and attack G4?

(;B[fq]TR[jr]C[buitenland [13k\]: B: Would K2 have been better? It would seperate the bottom group.

>No, K2 is what white wants you to play. The difficulty is in knowing when something can be killed and when it should be attacked for profit. In this case, the white group can't really be killed, although it will struggle to live, and if you play K2 white will happily extend to E3 and make a base.

This is a good move, securing a large solid corner and forcing white into the centre.]
