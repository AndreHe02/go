C[I was black in this game. This game was kind of difficult for me and I felt I was behind a lot after the 40th move and continue to be behind via the whole game.
Therefore, please give me some instructions.

I will try. Please exuse my bad english.];B[pd];W[qf];B[qh]

;W[qj];B[ql];W[rf]LB[sf:a][sg:b][se:c][rh:d][pf:e]C[That seems too early to me. After the sequence black a-e white has problems.]

[oc:c][nb:d]C[I think this is a bad move for sure, and I should play m14

I think m14 would be very bad. This move is ok because of the bad aji which doesn?t allow white to answer tha atari a. (black b, c, d and so on)]
;W[oi];B[pj];W[pi];B[rj];W[lg]
(;B[kd]C[atari from the wrong side?
but perhaps ok, because now white could give up the two s14 stones.]
;W[lc];B[ke];W[ic]LB[kc:a]C[seems very bad to me. black a now a must. and then catching the two s14 stones.]
;B[id]LB[kc:a]C[a is much better.];W[hc]LB[kc:a]C[probably white had to play a.]
;B[jg];W[jh];B[ih];W[kh];B[hg]LB[if:a][ig:b]C[Because of the later possibility of the peep at a with cutting potential, I would prefer a]
;W[hd]LB[ig:a][ij:b]C[if black had payed a he could now happy answer b, but  because of the peep, now I am not sure.]
;B[ie];W[pk]LB[jj:a]C[seems to small to me. perhaps a.];B[pl]
LB[kc:a]C[I would take the upper left corner, because it looks bigger and would bring the three white h17-stones into difficulties. so perhaps white would be forced later to make a small move at a or so.]

(;W[mq]C[see one another possibility at variation];B[lp];W[lq]
;B[kp];W[jq];B[io]C[this building of a wall seems rather inefficient for black because the white center stones are not so weak any more]
;W[hp];B[iq]C[I felt H4 was overpIayed, so I decided to cut it.
However, I didn't know if this move was ok or not.

This is difficult for me, too. It looks like a white overplay, at least because of leaving bad aji. If I were black I would?nt cut at once, bcause the result of var2 seems to me not so bad for white]

(;W[jp];B[ip];W[jo]C[It was difficult at this time.
I needed to proctect the cut for p5 and the group J5.];B[nn]
LB[oo:a]C[I would prefer a. white can?t cut anyway. this move makes the corner more vulnerable.]

C[This move was super difficult for me to respond, so do u have any good response?



I would just make a secure move like a. Perhaps its even better to concnetrate on the upper left corner. Remember your sente moves b or c. 
d is also a very big move, but the upper left corner seems biggest to me because the black cutting possibility of e.]
;B[do]C[thats a bit to far away. it only makes sense, if you are willing to sacrifice the j3 stones.]
;W[eo];B[ep];W[fp];B[dp];W[gp]C[a very strange move. now the local situation is good for black.]

;B[co];W[bp]LB[hr:a][fq:b][kq:c]C[now keep in mind the a-aji which makes the cutting at b and the possible.]
;B[fm]LB[bo:a][cq:b][fq:c]C[perhaps better a.];W[cm]C[I let white gain too many territories.]
;B[dm];W[cl]C[white is greedy :)];B[cd]LB[ec:a][kc:b]C[semms to be wrong direction. now white can attack the corner with a. If black plays a here himself, white has to fear the cut at b.]
;W[ec];B[dc]LB[pq:a][kq:b][hr:c][fq:d]C[now playing in this area is not so big any more. black a would safe a big corner and prepare the cut at b (because c which makes d possible.)]
;W[ed];B[cg];W[ci];B[bh]C[too small];W[bi]LB[bo:a][gm:b]C[better a which makes b possible.]

no. its big. the comment stopps here. Black played a good game but missed a lot of chances.]
