C[
Dear reviewer,



I am white (Jernej), and lost this game by 0.5 points. Mainly, I made several ambitious moves without proper followup. I'll need advice here, and I will ask questions along the way.

Hope you enjoy the review. I used to play at the same club as you :-)]

(;B[nr];W[lr];B[or];W[pj]C[I sacrificed the two stones to build moyo and have sente. I like the result, but maybe the traditional M3 instead of K14 (move 18) was still better?

In my opinion, simple move was better.

Also this split, I don't like it being played on the 4th line.
Seems harder to make a base that way.];B[nn]LB[jc:C][qg:A][cn:B]

I don't like this move either.];B[ql]

Definitely feels like the wrong moment to play this move.];B[qe]

LB[ch:A]C[Should I have played E3 instead?

I'm not sure actually. This move makes the probe at A far more severe. Of course, the bottom is still open. It depends on what your plan was :)]

(;W[dk]C[Should I play N6 instead?

You can't enclose a giant moyo so easily yet, I think D9 is fine]
;B[mn];W[ln];B[lc]C[Should this be M7 instead?

I think so. M17 seems a bit timid as an extension too];W[lm]
;B[hc];W[dh];B[ch];W[lj]C[Any better alternatives for this move - K10?

not sure. I might play L10 myself. The gap does seem a bit wide]

;B[hj];W[hh]SQ[ji]C[Is this too ambitous? Can H10 either escape or build life inside, so there is no way to kill it? Can you show some variations please?]

C[Should it be M9 instead?

K8 seems fine to me, hold onto your moyo as Black is able to escape]
;B[lk];W[hl]C[This is to protect and also aims at a cut around J10 later. Any better moves for this double purpose?

I can't see that cut right now ^^, but H8 is good for protection, so I approve]

looks a bit risky to me, some aji still

(;W[je]C[Should be J18 instead, right?

I think J17];B[jb]
(;W[ng]C[Any better alternative to reduce black's moyo?

I prefer playing a few sente moves. It is possible just to build your own territory]

It's too slow to save them]
