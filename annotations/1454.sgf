AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[The white player is rated 11 kyu on NNGS.
He used to be rated 8* kyu and are using that
rating in tournaments in Sweden. He has not
played go for a long time. I am still a newbie
and are not sure if I deserve my rating of 14* kyu.
I
want to know what moves are dissplaced. Any situation where I should
have placed my stone in a different location. The beginning of the game
is where I feel most confused.];W[fq]LB[cm:A][cn:B]C[AB:

Hi Matthias,

I will to try to do what you have asked me to do as much as possible. I hope you will find the review helpful...

As
a quick comment on this shape I am looking at, you have definitely
secured a small territory in the corner (emphasize on small) but with 
reasonable attack power due partly because you seem to have a wall
facing the left and bottom...

The drawback I see is that it does
not offer you a nice chance develop. I mean the shape is not very open
to developing itself....];W[dj]C[AB: A loose move by White. not securing anything... He will change his plans according to what you play...]

(;B[dg]TR[cg]C[AB: 

I
would tend to play this move at the marked location. The strongest
reason is to be able to attack under the white formation around 'a'.
White's fourth line play makes its base open to attack. AND it protects
Black's corner];W[mp]C[AB: 
White is using usual handicap
tactics, moving from one area to another, not concentrating on
anything, trying to spot weaknesses... Black should just play solid.
Keep to the basics:
- don't leave a weakness
- seperate White stones.];B[pm]C[AB:
I prefer 3rd line corner enclosures. Same comment I did before for the top left corner.]
;W[qj];B[qg];W[qm]C[AB: 
if you had your stone on the 3rd line, this move wouldn't be possible.]
;B[qn];W[pl]C[
buffel started observation.

AB:
there is nothing weird with White's moves. he is just trying to create
a base for himself... you are using this as a chance to build a wall to
attack the bottom.];B[om];W[ol]
(;B[gd]C[AB:
in light of the discussion in the variation, this answer was not very appropriate.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pb];W[jd]C[AB:

if
we look at the board all we see is very insecure white groups (except
the one on the right). That makes 3 vulnerable white groups.

You should not follow White's game plan... You should have your own... 

When the chance comes, you should attack.];B[ic];W[jc];B[id]
;W[ie];B[he];W[if];B[hf]TR[dl][jq]C[AB:
a very small move.

options are marked.];W[fo];B[ci]C[AB:
same mistake.];W[cj];B[di]C[ AB:
now White is feeling more secure.];W[cc]C[AB:
secure enough to launch an attack.];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be]
;B[cf];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[bf];W[ad];B[ne]LB[lc:1][en:2][jp:3]
C[AB:

you
are letting White claim the bottom for himself... When we gets a chance
he will make another move at the bottom and it will much harder for you
afterwards.

NOW is your chance to use your chance cause you have 'sente' from the play in the corner.

White's invasion personally was a mistake...

you directly attack the top (1)
seperate groups and attack left. (2)
attack the bottom (3)];W[md]C[AB:
and after this, you did not play any strong aggressive moves. White easily led the gamme to victory.]

these are very small moves.];W[ni];B[mi];W[nj];B[mj]C[AB:
as you will see this is ignored by White.];W[kf];B[kh];W[nm]
;B[on]C[AB:
not necessary.];W[oo];B[po];W[op];B[oq];W[nq];B[or];W[nr];B[nn]
;W[no];B[pn];W[ml]C[AB:
bottom is whites now....

interestingly, there was no other major attempt by either side to change the flow of the game...  

after
the skeleton was set like this, moves were made to clarify the border
and that marked the end of the game with 30 point lead because of the
bottom claimed by White.

Black needed to invade the bottom at least to decrease black territory there, much earlier in teh game....

The only major suggestion I have is that you should not play the game your opponent wants to play... 

White did not play really strong in this game. You should have played more aggressively.]

(;B[nm];W[rm];B[jq]SQ[mp][fq]C[AB:
this is what I meant by attacking the bottom. Both black stones are severely harassed by this move.

Most probably White would not let this happen, but still that is the idea....]
