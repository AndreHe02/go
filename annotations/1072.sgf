C[I'm rusty at this point, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

Your comments in general make sense, and of course you won, so I'm not going to have much in the way of severe critique.]
;B[pp]C[I played this game on KGS. Both I and my opponent are 14k (I with a=
 ?), but we both claimed we are weaker than that ^_^ In my case it's defini=
tely true, because last time I logged in, I was 16k. So I don't know our re=
al ranking.

I think this was a very interesting game, very small-moyo. There were some =
points where I didn't know what to do exactly. For example in the lower par=
t of the table I continously had the feeling that I can kill some of his gr=
oups, but I didn't find the solution (if there was any).
Please give some advice on how should I play in such situations.]

;W[mf];B[lf];W[ib]C[With this, I wanted to protect my stones below.]
;B[ki];W[jj];B[kj];W[il]C[Now I try to make two eyes. I'm not very good at =
this, though. I had enough space in this game, but usually I fail.]
;B[gl];W[hn];B[gn];W[km]C[There's a proverb, "when trying to make life, play in contact".  The idea is to threaten your opponents weak stones and build life as he protects them. Conversely, when trying to kill a group you generally play off contact, taking away eye space without putting your stones at risk. In this case I would advocate L9, putting some pressue on the group of L10+L11 and threating to take away the eye space of the whole set of black stones above.]

(;W[hp]C[I like G2 better, threatening the group at the bottom. Then black has to play L1 to save it and you get an extra move in the fight in the middle. After G2 L1 then G4 becomes a good option.]

I agree you should have moved elsewhere.  You could keep this in reserve for later.]
