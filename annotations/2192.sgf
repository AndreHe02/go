C[Dear reviewer,



I played white in this game. Though I made several mistakes in this game I don't think that could account for such a big loss.



I lose quite often in come games that consist mostly of encircling the territories. In this game I could not create any problems for my opponent.



Thank you for the review.
Arend: This is a good solid game by both players. In such a mostly territorial game, it is simply the player whose mistakes sum up to a higher value who looses. A few times, you played inefficient moves or missed the biggest move, and you incurred local losses about 3 times (W24-28, the sequence starting with W48, W104). That is enough to loose such a close game.
Possibly you worry a little too much about creating difficulties for your opponent. It is enough if his only problem is that you might have 2 points more of territory than him. And anyway, the opponent will most often create his difficulties himself. I promise!]

;B[qi];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[np];W[jd];B[cf];W[gc]C[Arend: This move is unusal. I can't really judge whether it is bad, but I think black is satisfied if he jumps into the corner.]
;B[bd]C[Arend: I am pretty sure that this is a mistake (see comment on next move to see why). I would directly enter the corner at 3-3. Otherwise, an extension down the side might also be possible.]

(;W[ch]C[Arend: White should just answer at C17. (See var.)]

(;B[ef]C[Arend: I still think Black should take the corner.]
;W[cc];B[di]C[Arend: Again, this looks similar to a well-known joseki, but it is not. You probably know the joseki I am referring to (kakari, close pincer, black jumps out). The difference is that in the joseki, Black can still enter 3-3. This means that White cannot gain much by cuttting somewhere between D11 and C14. In the situation here, Black has to worry about this cuts.

Btw, I have written quite a lot of comment up to this point. Not because the mistakes were very big, but because I felt they are interesting.]

(;W[cj]C[This plan could be wrong. I was aware of the fact that I allow black to settle the group, yet I thought that I'd have a compensation.
Arend: Yes I think it is wrong. Your compensation isn't big enough. See var. for a simple and IMO good plan for white, and another more enterprising one.]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[dh];W[dj]LB[bh:A]C[Arend: This move gives up quite a bit of territory. Maybe it is better to connect at A.]
;B[bh];W[ej]C[Arend: Now this move is a bit too slow. The problem is that when black captures B11 with B10, he still has (despite this strengthening move) the possibility of following up with the clamp at B8. So you can almost assume Black gets the capture in sente, as in the game. But when you mentally add the moves B43-W46, it becomes clear that white is overconcentrated.]

;W[pi]LB[ok:A][qg:B][qc:C]MA[ej]C[Perhaps this was a mistake. I wanted to strengthen the right side group yet I did not obtian the result

Arend: It is a reasonable idea to strengthen your only weak group. If you do it, you should play the simple move at A. Although unlikely, you might get a chance to invade at B.
But I am not sure whether that is right. 1st there is exactly one very big point left, at C. 2nd your group is not very weak. 3rd, all your other territories are really safe, so it is not clear what black should do with the strength he would gain from attacking this group. It would also be very difficult for him to build a moyo after you have already played the marked stoned, and you are generrally very solid on the left side.]

;B[nn]C[Arend: Good move.];W[oo]C[Arend: I don't see what you are gaining from startin this fight. It doesn't help your group, and it makes the black corner safe.]
;B[op];W[no];B[mo];W[mn];B[nm];W[lo]C[A bad move.
Arend: You are right.];B[mp];W[ln];B[ml];W[ll]MA[fo]C[Arend: It is hard for white to find a good move for white. This move doesn't really look good, as it pushes black up right between your two weak groups. But the marked stone also makes it hard to run to the left.]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[ok];W[pj];B[pl];W[ql]C[Bad. S2 was better.
Arend: I assume you mean S7. But it's not clear to me which is better. E.g. S7 would look silly if Black gets to play at S5 first.]
;B[lj];W[ph];B[pg];W[ni];B[mj];W[jl];B[lp]C[Arend: This move shows good shape judgement. Note that it is not really necessary on the lower side. But it creates a potential shortage of liberty for white]
;W[jj]C[Wrong side?
Arend: I don't think so. Your center group is pretty weak, because it has bad shape. The group on the right doesn't look so much in danger, as S5 is enough to make it alive locally.]

Hmm, it seems to me that you want to make up for your mistake at F4 -- please excuse the following general remarks if that wasn't the case...
I think go isn't like that. If you have made a mistake, it's usually best to take a quick break, and then just calmly play the next biggest move. You cannot fight back immediately to regain the ball as when you are playing football :) If you try to do the same in go, you will only increase your losses. Continue playing big moves, and wait for your chance -- you are not playing against a pro, so your opponent will certainly present you with more mistakes to come.
Of course you have to push the limits a little when you are behind, but you shouldn't overdo that.]

I will not comment on yose. The game is essentially lost by this moment.

Another way to say this is that the exchange of B16 for C17 is in a way bad for black, because it makes the corner safe, and so white gains more territory in the exchange. Only in the usual josekis with a stone at A or B it is ok, because white ends up a little overconcentrated, making it a fair exchange overall.]
