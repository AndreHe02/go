C[Hello Sven, here is my review. I focussed especially on the fuseki and the early middlegame, for the bigger mistakes were played at that point. The biggest mistake in the game was that you worried too much about the size of your opponent territory so that you gave up the attack on his groups from the upper right side. If you respond to territory-oriented, non-urgent moves then your opponent can turn back and defend his weak group, and he took the best points while you were responding. Every time you respond to an opponent's play, he gains something! Bear this in mind!]

;B[dg];W[ck]C[Usually, here black punishes white for not finishing the joseki (an extension near F17 is in order), by playing at E17. Playing at E17 also works well with the Q16 corner stone. I don't like this tenuki of white.
(you can check out the josekis in the Kogo dictionary. Some tenuki are also shown so that you can see how to punish them! I show you one variation, but I have no credit for that one :-)]
