C[Hi, Matthew!

This was an interesting game. You fought better than your opponent in the fight in the beginning, and your opening was a lot better. What you should learn is the judgement of a weak and strong group - it's not easy, but something to aim for :)

You gained about 10 points in the yose and won the game by a small margin. Without the top-left corner your victory would have been clear, though.

All in all, the game was interesting. I hope I was of some help - this is my first review. Good luck for your go!

- Ville ('Dansc')];B[cp]C[> This is one of the most interesting games I've played in some time!]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[pd];B[eq];W[kq];B[dj]C[Big point. Much larger than L3 was for white, because the black enclosure is strong in this direction.]
;W[dh];B[dm]LB[jc:B][qf:A][pj:D][qj:C]C[> I feel now this was overconcentrated.

A bit slow, maybe. You already had the big point at D10, so the left side is not as crucial anymore. All the points from A to D would be good choices for black now.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq];W[hq]C[Small. The top and the right side are bigger.]

(;B[pj]LB[jc:A][qf:B]C[> Now I would prefer A.

A is indeed big. Playing on the right side isn't bad either, but you might consider approaching the corner at B instead. See the variation.]
;W[qh];B[pf]LB[pe:B][qf:A]C[> I think this was a good attack. Things of course get interesting now!

You should ask yourself: what do I want to accomplish with an invasion? Invasions are usually used to stop an area from becoming territory. Here white can't make territory with a single move, because the 3-3 is still open. Therefore it would be bigger to play on the top here.

Also, Q14 isn't a very good invasion point. A is the usual point to invade in this shape. B is another possibility.]

(;W[ql]C[White wants to fight. :) See the variation for another option.]
;B[qj]C[Very good! It's important to keep the two white stones apart.]

(;W[oh]LB[qf:A][ol:B]C[This stone can connect to the corner with A, so it's in no real danger. It would be better to pull the other stone out with B and keep black weak. See the variation.]
;B[nf];W[nd];B[mh]C[Very good, your group needs more solid footing in the center.]
;W[ni];B[nk];W[ok];B[oj]LB[qf:A]C[> Is this good? What should each sides objectives and priorities be? How does one conceptualize these situations without getting lost in a morass?

This move was natural. The cut was an overplay. Apparently, both of you have missed A. 

Here white should try to enlarge his top side territory while attacking black. If black can capture the two white stones, he shouldn't do too bad.]
;W[nj]
(;B[ol]LB[mk:A]C[> Is this move too conservative? A came into consideration as well. How much should I expect to get, and where?

This is necessary. A would result in a huge loss. See the variation.]
;W[mk];B[nl];W[ng]C[> I didn't really like this move for him.

If white wants to connect to his corner, there is an easier way. However, this could lead to complications.]
;B[mg]LB[mf:A]C[Dangerous. I would play A to keep my main group intact.]

(;W[of]C[A mistake. See the variation.];B[pg];W[ph];B[og];W[nh]
;B[oe]C[Very good! White has now destroyed his own escape route to the corner.]
;W[od];B[mj]C[Too eager, this doesn't work.];W[mi];B[lj];W[li]
;B[mf]C[Important point. Now both groups are weak, so the fight should be even.]
;W[kj];B[lk];W[kh]C[> Now the struggle is more or less defined. But I think, once my group on top runs away, I got much the better of that fight.

Since the white group emerged first, black is in more trouble. White should try to make territory on top while attacking.]
;B[ji];W[kk];B[ll];W[ki];B[kf];W[kl];B[lm];W[jh]C[White should concentrate on attacking rather than defending here. This move drives black towards the valuable top area, which is clearly the wrong direction.]
;B[lc]LB[ld:A]C[> My objective is to link my group to eye space, while threatening White's group.

You have the right idea here, but even this might be a bit too far. A would be safer.]
;W[mc]C[This gives black what he wants. Also, white has little territory here yet, since black can invade at R17.]
;B[ld];W[lb];B[kb];W[mb];B[gc]LB[fc:A][ic:E][fd:D][cf:C][df:B]
C[> Is this the best point here? I would also consider the marked points.

Even this move is too far, since your group is so weak. Playing at E might be correct. Invading the white formation on the left side is unreasonable until your group is safe.]

(;W[fc]C[Slack. See the variation.];B[fd];W[ec];B[gd]LB[jc:A]
C[> This wasn't the most logical way to play; I could've gone here at once and left the weakness. Losing sente cost me there. The next part of the game, I don't know very well what's going on.

This was correct, you can't leave any more weaknesses. Actually, white A would still be powerful.]
;W[jf];B[je];W[ke]C[> A nasty move that I overlooked. How best to deal with it?

M15 is the correct move, the troubles were caused later.]
(;B[le]LB[if:A]C[> Perhaps A first was more exact.

Not really. See the variations.];W[ie];B[kd]C[> Extending was surely more logical.

Yes, by extending black gets out of trouble. This gave white chances.]
;W[jd];B[if];W[ke];B[jc];W[hf]C[> I was rather relieved by this.

You should be. :)];B[je];W[ig];B[id]C[Black got out of trouble too easily.]
;W[mn]C[> White profited greatly from the last scuffle and it's not surprising he starts another one! More chaos! Please help me figure out what's going on. There are so many possibilities for both sides, I have a hard time prioritizing.

Actually, this move doesn't threaten anything. You should ignore it and play some big point.]
;B[mp]LB[ln:B][mq:A]C[> I didn't want him just to take this territory while terrorizing my group, so I tried either to capture his invading stone or to mount a counter-invasion on the lower side.

This is a good leaning move. If white answers at A, you can play B and capture the white stone.]
;W[ln];B[kp]LB[km:A][kn:C][mq:B]C[> Is this good? I marked some other ideas.

N4 threatened B, so you should play there immetiadely when you got the chance. Actually, it probably captures the two white stones to the right.]
;W[jp];B[ko];W[kn];B[km];W[np];B[lq];W[jq];B[jo];W[jn];B[io]
;W[jm]LB[no:A]C[> Obviously, although I managed to invade a little White territory, I wasn't too happy with this outcome.

I think that this is a success for black. You lost nothing.]
;B[gp];W[lr]C[> Unfortunately White is quite safe - I boxed in the lower group but can't contain the big wall.]
;B[kr]C[Silly.];W[mr];B[hm]C[Very big!];W[qr];B[rr];W[pn];B[pm]
LB[on:A]C[A would have captured the white stone.];W[on]
(;B[po]LB[cf:B][hj:A]C[> Too defensive?

Necessary. See the variation.];W[hk]C[> Yes indeed. I should've played around here myself, I think.

You never had the chance :)];B[gk];W[gj];B[fk];W[fj];B[ej]C[Black got more than white here.]
;W[fg];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc]C[> This invasion seems appropriate - I must have mishandled it severely.

The area is very small, hard to say if there was a better move.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[db];W[eb];B[dc]LB[ba:A]C[Better to make life immetiadely at A.]
;W[ed];B[bf]C[Not good, these stones can't escape anyway. You just made things harder for your corner.]
;W[ae];B[bi]LB[ba:A]C[> Careless! I had to tend to my weak group. How best to do this?

A will live.];W[ad]LB[ba:A]C[A mistake. White A would have killed immetiadely.]

(;B[ac]C[Black lost his chance. See the variation.];W[ba]C[> Ouch. I think that kills it.

It does.]
(;B[ca]C[Nothing helps now, but see the variation for a curiosity.]
;W[bb];B[ee]LB[bh:A]C[> Trying to make the best of a bad situation by combining threats. What is optimal here?

You should connect your two stones with A.];W[de];B[df];W[ef]
;B[fe];W[af];B[bg];W[bh];B[ah];W[ag]C[A huge loss for black.]
;B[fb];W[ai];B[aj];W[gb];B[ah];W[fa];B[eg];W[ff];B[eh];W[ei]
;B[fi];W[di];B[ci];W[fh];B[gi];W[hj]C[> Catastrophe for Black! Now the game is close again.

Very close, white may lead by a couple of points. Your yose was a bit better, and you gained a well-earned victory. This is the last comment.]
