RE[W+10.50]

C[In this game I followed a moyo strategy. I would be interested in some comments on whether my moves expanding the moyo took the right direction.

EO: Hi, I'm Erik O, 3dan from Sweden. Hope you will find my comments useful.]

C[Is the 3rd or the 4th line better here?

EO: 3rd line is usually better, since it make it easier to make a base.]
;W[ch];B[cn]LB[cl:A]C[Same question: 3rd or 4th line?
 I didn't count on making territory here. If W invades at A, it will give me influence.

EO: Seems like a good strategy, but you must be careful not to make the group heavy.]
;W[em]LB[eo:A]C[EO: A thin move, 'A' is a weak point in this shape.]

(;B[ck]TR[dj]LB[ek:A]C[EO: This move makes the triangled stone look like a bad move.]
;W[eh];B[fd]LB[fj:A][jd:B][jc:C][cc:D]C[I didn't want to jump out at A yet because the upper edge is very big. Even if W encloses me, it should be possible to live.
But perhaps the move I played is too close to W's rather strong formation. Would B be better, counting on the possibility of the 3/3 invasion in the top left corner?

EO: B or C seems largest here, but it is also possible to move out at A and let C and D be miai.]
;W[ec];B[jd]TR[fd][ec]C[EO: Now the triangled exchange is bad for you.]

(;W[fc];B[gd];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od]C[The top being open from the left, I wanted to stress the right side.]
;W[oc];B[nd];W[rc];B[nc]LB[rd:A]C[EO: Wrong direction. Due to F17, the upper side is rather small. 'A' is better - if white doesn't respond, will O17 be black sente.]
;W[re]C[Is it a correct judgment that this move is good for B because of the influence B builds?

EO: Not really, this move makes your moyo smaller. But white need to be careful, there are not two eyes in the corner yet.]
;B[rd];W[sd];B[qf];W[rg];B[rf];W[sf];B[qg];W[rh]
(;B[jj]LB[mj:A][jg:B]C[EO: It's quite hard to make territory here since the moyo is open both at A and B.]
;W[fj];B[bp]C[EO: Good move.];W[bo]LB[bq:A]C[EO: Better to block at A instead.]
;B[co];W[bq];B[dp];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[bn];W[ap];B[ep];W[fq]
;B[fp];W[gq];B[en];W[mj];B[ml]LB[kl:A]C[Was this a good attack?

EO: Yes, it's ok, but it is not easy to attack this stone. If you want a strong attack, you need to play something like 'A', but that will invite white to destroy all  your moyo, so it is problably an overplay.]
;W[kk]C[EO: Good move.]
(;B[lk]C[EO: Bad shape.];W[kj];B[lj];W[ki];B[li];W[kh]C[EO: Pushing from behind like this is almost always bad. White gets a very strong shape and your tengen stone has become a bad move.]

(;B[gm]C[EO: I don't see the purpose of this move.]
(;W[ob]C[EO: Very bad.];B[rj];W[oo];B[np];W[rp];B[qo]C[EO: White can tenuki now and live in the corner later.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qr];B[ro];W[sq]
(;B[pr]SQ[nr][or][ps][os][mr][ns]C[EO: Wait with this move. All the squared moves can threaten the corner later, and white has no followup (see var.).]
;W[rr];B[so];W[sp];B[gc];W[df];B[kq];W[km]LB[jq:A][lh:B]C[EO: 'A' and 'B' are larger.]
;B[jq];W[ip];B[lg]C[EO: Very big move. The last three move have put you quite a bit ahead.]
