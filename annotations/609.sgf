C[forfun (FF) - This is an interesting game. B starts fighting early on the left side of the board - too early it seems. The lesson here is that we have to prepare ourselves for the fight.  It does little good to fight from our own weak stones - the opponent ends up with too many alternatives.

Another interesting point is Black 9, the pincer against W's left side stone.  I think this was the wrong choice for fundamental reasons as explained in the notes.

These two issues set the tone of the game and the fighting up and down the left side.  W came out of that fighting with a secure lead.  B could not find a way to catch up in the further course of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[cn];W[dj];B[en];W[fp]C[FF - B has to decide how to proceed next. By exchanging 7 for 8, B has already elected to play against 6. The next question is how to go about it.  An immediate attack against 6 from the upper left must be based on the assumption that the two B stones at the bottom are strong enough to form one side of a pincer.  In the game W shows that this is not the case.  I agree with this - the B stones are not settled enough.  Let's consider the variations...]

(;B[cg]LB[dh:a][eg:b][cc:c]C[How about this move? I can't tell whether it's good or not. D13 instead? Or is it generally to early to pincer here?

FF - I think that this is a mistake for two reasons: (1) it is too early because the 2 B stones in the lower left are not strong enough and (2)  it is the wrong stone to play when attacking W 6 from B3.

Fundamentally I think this stone needs to be played at 'a' instead.  Imagine W answered B 9 with a capping play at 'b'. What would B do?  I think that there is no good way to respond because B's corner is still open at the 3-3 point 'c'.  Because of this fundamental weakness, B should want to pincer W with a high stone.  B's strategy should be to form influence in the center by driving W out.  The low pincer does not achieve this.]
;W[dm]C[FF - W makes B pay for trying to use these stones without strengthening them first.  After just this one play we can ask what B 9 is doing on the board.  If B connects it will be a situation of W attacking B instead of the other way around.  In such a case B 9 does not help the B stones being attacked at all.]

(;B[cm]C["Even a moron connects against a peep". I had the feeling though that not connecting and playing C7 would also be ok, since I either can cut Wd10 or do something else which is ok for me using E6. Any comments?

FF - I think this is an interesting attempt to make sense of the lower left. I think it is good that B tried to think beyond the obvious connection.]

(;W[dl];B[cp]C[This is probably a bit slack, as if W plays d6 now, he probably gets a better result from his large wall than I would get from the edge.]

(;W[cq]C[FF - An overplay? B's reply puts W on the spot.];B[bp]

(;W[bq];B[do];W[ep]C[Like this I think I can be pleased with what I got here, right?

FF - B has finally connect his original two stones in this area. In compensation, however, W has sealed the corner with over 10 points of solid territory. B still doesn't have a secure base and now has to return to the original point of attacking the W stones on the left.]
;B[bk]LB[eg:a][gk:b]C[FF - This is the wrong approach. If W had used plays like 'a' and 'b' to handle the left stones lightly, B would have been unsatisfied.]
;W[bj]C[FF - A free gift from W.];B[ck];W[cj];B[dk];W[ei];B[fk]
;W[eg];B[jd]C[This move is probably nonsense. I just didn't see a way to attack the white group yet and hope to get a better position to do so like this.

FF - Actually it is not so easy to decide how to attack W. B has achieved a base for the left side stones but little else. B still needs an approach that will build enough territory to beat W. Leaving the left side W stones for a while is an interesting idea.]
;W[fc]LB[qf:a]C[FF - This has to be an overplay.  It is an invitation to split W into two weak groups.  W might have considered just starting on the right, at 'a' for example and leaving the right for later.]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[ee]
(;W[jb];B[kb];W[kc];B[jc];W[lb];B[ib];W[ka];B[kd]LB[mc:a][ld:b]
C[FF - This is a bad idea because it settles W's stones.  These stones were strong to begin with but there are still potential weak points at 'a' and 'b' which B might choose to play later depending on how things work out to the left.  Playing the sequence in the game does very little for B.]
;W[ld];B[le];W[md]
(;B[gb]C[FF - This is too submissive. B is fine if W takes the time to connect the two stones. B should be attacking the stones on the left side with the idea that the two stones can fall any time as part of a larger strategy.]
;W[cc]
(;B[fb]C[FF - This just gives W a follow up at D18. B should choose something else instead. There are many variations here.  The key idea is to keep the W stones separated.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[be]C[i didn't understand why white wanted the edge in exchange for the two stones.]
;B[cd];W[bd]
(;B[ef]C[FF - B must keep the W stones on the side separated.]
;W[cf];B[dg];W[df]
(;B[fg];W[eh]C[now I know ;-)];B[hf]C[FF - The game is over at this point. W has made more territory and has more opportunities to make even  more in the future than B has. W also has sente.]
;W[nq];B[qj];W[ql];B[oj];W[ol];B[qf];W[iq]C[FF - W plays rather conservatively to avoid trouble?]
;B[jp];W[ip];B[jo];W[hn];B[mk]LB[jm:a]C[I planed to either invade or make some center territory. Ok to play like that here?

FF - B needs something to happen in order to get back into the game. But actually if W gets the chance to play 'a', B is going to be too busy saving the two stones on the bottom to make territory in the center.]
;W[me];B[mn];W[lf]C[I think this move is a bit slow

FF - Perhaps but it is very powerful in the center. If W prevents B from making any significant territory here, B can't get back into the game.]
;B[gn]C[FF - B makes a mistake here on the next play but more importantly this area is small. B should leave all this until later anyway. The lower right is the most important area now.]
;W[go];B[hm]C[complete nonsense];W[fn];B[fm];W[gm];B[em];W[gl]
;B[pn]LB[pq:a][qn:b][qo:c]C[FF - Reducing W's territory is not going to be enough. B has to either try to attack the two stones in order to invade the corner or jump directly into the corner now. Plays like 'a', 'b', or 'c' need to be considered here.]
;W[qn]
(;B[pp];W[po];B[oo];W[qo];B[op];W[pr];B[pm];W[pl];B[rm]C[too early since it is gote, right?

FF - Right.  It is small at this point.  This play also strengthens W.  B should be concerned about W cutting through the center and threatening B's lower side stones.]

(;B[dn]C[FF - If B connects, the initiative is in W's hands.  B will not be caught but this is still very different than if B were pressing the fight on W.  The two variations use very similar plays to those shown in the alternatives to B 9 above.  But in both variations the exchange of W 10 for B 11 is helpful for W and W is a play ahead in the lower left.]

[np:b][kq:c]C[FF - B settles the stones in the lower left and waits to see what W will do next.  In this joseki W is often trying to play 'a' but in this case B can choose between plays around 'b' or 'c' to easily limit the effectiveness of 'a'.  On the other hand if W tries to make a shimari in the lower right, B can play at 'a' and both limit the lower side while casting an increasing shadow on W 6.  Overall this is a quite playable, calm approach for B.]

LB[lq:a][nq:b][cq:c][pk:d]C[FF - This is one standard approach to attacking a pincer stone around W 6. B is playing on a large scale.  W has to settle the stones on the left side carefully to avoid allowing B to form too much influence around them.  W's potential along the bottom is still limited and it is the only real potential that W has.  Note that the bottom is still open to plays by B at 'a', 'b', and 'c' among others.  Also if W tries to fix up the bottom with a play around 'b' then B 'd' is a very big play that combines very well with center stones just played.  This is not to say that B is actually better already.  But B is playing an aggressive game with good potential.]
