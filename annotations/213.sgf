(;W[kd]C[C:In fuseki there are three rules which you should follow, until you understand them and know how to use them properly:

* First play in an empty corner.
* Second play enclosures or approach moves to 3x4, 3x5 and 4x5-cornerstones (here: near R5 and near P17)
* Third play extensions along the side

From this point of view P17 (or P16 or O17) would be correct. See variation.

By the way, I would feel more comfortable with L17 instead of L16. The resulting pattern would be called chinese opening, if it where played by black.]
;B[jp]C[I still get confused in the opening, especially when I play white. Playing L16 seemed like a good idea at the time, but after black's K4 I'm not so sure.

C:In the opening there is freedom for own style, so I think it is still playable, but now R10 or Q10 is an important point. (Because otherwise black gets a doublewing formation)]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[bn];B[co];W[dj];B[qi]C[C:Now black has the big point...]
;W[fq]C[C:Before invading, one should stabilize the own groups: The group at B6/C6 is weak, so black can start to attack it at D6, and after getting strong there, he can attack your weak stone at F3. This will lead to a difficult fight for you.]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[hq];W[fr]C[C:Wrong direction. You should simply connect your two weak groups with E6. See variation of next move.
The reason, why it is wrong is, that you neither get eyeshape, nor you can connect to an other group.

You may say, that this reduces blacks eyespace, if black does not defend. But if black cuts your weak groups, he will get strong by attacking yours. A proverb says: "A weak group between two weak groups isn't weak!"

As an endgamemove this would be great.]
(;B[er];W[en];B[cq]C[C: I don't think, that this move is necessary.]
;W[hr]C[C: This only strengthens black, so an invasion arround N4 will become more complicated later on.  Look at the whole board. The territory, that black mapped out is much smaller than yours (although it is more secure). So you should do a firm move, like R13.]
;B[ir];W[gq];B[hp];W[go]C[C: If you want to connect against the cut, you should play at G7. This one is to slow.]
;B[qf]C[This would have been a better move than my last move G5. Hind sight . . .]
;W[lp]C[I decided on another invasion. But later black punches into my territory at the top. What should the priorities be here? Invade or solidify the top? I'm not sure how to judge this situation.

C: If the game is equal or you are leading: Always first solidify, then invade. If you are behind, you have to play at more risk, then an invasion might be ok.]
;B[lq]C[C: I would not have answered, but attacked the upper right.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[mq];B[lr];W[mr];B[kr];W[pr]C[C: Connection is more important (at N5). If you try to live small, than black has a lot of attacks againt you, which makes him strong. So the better way to live is, to run into the center and connect.]
;B[qr];W[or];B[mp];W[np];B[mo];W[no];B[oq];W[nq]C[C: now you have one eye and have to run anyway...]
;B[ps];W[mn];B[lo];W[nm];B[ln];W[lm]C[C:good move!];B[on];W[nn]
;B[om];W[pp]C[C: This is an endgame move. You should return to the upper right corner now and protect.

You should not play this move, although it is sente, because you waste ko-threads.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[qo];W[ol];B[pl];W[ok];B[pk]C[C: Now black is very strong at the right side, so an attack at P17 or somewhere there will become very easy for black.]
;W[oj];B[oh]C[C: Now even more];W[ni];B[nd];W[oc];B[lc];W[kc]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[ka];W[ja];B[mb];W[nb];B[nc];W[pb];B[ld];W[ma]
;B[ke];W[jd]C[C: You should capture at M18 (snapback). Then your groups are connected and stronger.
If you want to protect the left group, play at J16. Now you have no empty triangles.]
;B[lb];W[je];B[kf]C[C: What is now important?
Black as about 60 points of secure territory, you about 10 (upper right).
So you should get more than 50 points in the upper right. You should now prevent a 3x3-invasion at C17. Play C16 for example.]
;W[ki]C[C: This move guides black into your territory. Black will feel quite happy to play K14 or J13.]
;B[dg]C[C: Cut this stone of! At J13! Then D13 has to live on it's own, which is quite difficult, because it is on 4th line. An invasion at C17, C14 or C13 or even C16 or D17 would have been better for black.]
;W[cf];B[ci];W[cj];B[bj];W[bk];B[aj];W[ak];B[bh];W[cg];B[ch]
;W[cl]C[C: Ups. What happens, if black plays at C9? You catch him in a ladder! Read it out!

Instead you should attack the weak black group at F14. This move has double purpos: It attacks and while attacking it creates territory at the top.]

;B[if];W[jm]C[C: Good move!];B[in];W[im];B[hn];W[gn]C[C: Now you direct him into your territory. Play a net at G7.]
;B[hm];W[hl];B[gm];W[gl]C[C:I would feel more compfortable with F7, but I can't tell why.]
;B[fm];W[el];B[em];W[dm];B[fl];W[fk];B[dk]C[C: Black wastes a ko-thread]
;W[ck];B[eo];W[fn];B[ie];W[id];B[nh];W[mh];B[mg];W[lh];B[pd]
;W[pc];B[od];W[re]C[C: Why not R15?];B[qe];W[rc]C[C: Good move. First I thought, that it is unneccessary, but if black plays correct, he will kill your group, if you play, say S14.]
;B[rf];W[kg]LB[sf:a][ao:b][es:c][is:d][bg:e]C[C: This move has no meaning. Some moves, to think of:
a) Sente/sente move. This is an important one.
b) Sente/gote move. Black will answer, because you might kill his group, if you don't.
c) Same as b)
d) Gote move.
e) Reverse sente, that means, for black it is sente, for you it is gote.

So I would play a,b,c,e in this order.];B[jh];W[jf];B[jg];W[kh]

;W[af];B[ah];W[ls]C[C: Arghh! You have to protect at C16. As you have seen later.  You are about 10 points ahead. You may play calm moves here and protect.]
;B[ks];W[ms];B[os];W[nr];B[qs];W[gp]C[C: 0 points in gote!]
;B[he];W[gd]C[C: Maybe H16 and give black the two white stones would have been better than this empty triangle.]

;B[gc]C[I though I was doing pretty good until this cut. This is what seemed to unravel the game for me.

C: You did pretty good. Your next move was your fault!]
(;W[fd]C[C: G18 is better. See variation!];B[fc];W[ec];B[eb]
;W[dc];B[hb];W[db];B[ib];W[fb];B[jc]C[C: now you are about 25 points back. This is normally not winnable any more, at this stage of the game. So you should watch out where your opponent might do mistakes. Lower side seems to be a possible target.]

[sh][si][sj][sk][sl][sm][sn][so][sp][sq][sr][ss]C[ghojda 28k*: well this was a very nice game ... we both fought hard

I have to agree with my opponent here. It was a fun game as we both attacked and kept the game lively. There was a point or two that I felt like I was doing really well. But it didn't turn out so good.

Obviously losing the group at the end changed the whole game. . .   I guess I would appreciate any general comments on my game, priorities, development, etc., as well as any specific advice you have.

Thanks!

C: Three final comments:

* What you should improve is you endgame. There is, where you lost the game. Try to understand, which moves are big, which are sente, and where you have to defend, and even more important: where you have not to defend. If it is not importent to win the game, you should not defend, if you don't see what your opponent could harm you. If he will do, then you learn much.

* Second, you should learn to play firm moves, that means to understand, when it is more important to protect, than to play big moves.

* Last, I think, you played very strong in the middlegame, most of the time.

Final remark:
As far, as I have counted, you have lost only by 13.5 points instead of the 20.5 points that the game information shows.

white 70.5 points])
