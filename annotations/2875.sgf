C[I'm starting as black with 6.5 komi and I lost with 6.5 points.
So somewhere I failed to use my advantage beeing black.

Hi, Marcus:

I'm Bob (~8k) and I'll be writing the review for this game. I hope you find it helpful.

I generally orient my reviews around general principles that will help overall play. I won't mention every single place where a play might have been sub-optimal, so that more attention can go to developing a different way of looking at the plays.

I think this was a great game for you to submit for review, BTW. Both sides played generally sound games, and we mainly need to look for missed opportunites.

If I were to summarize what I think the most important thing for you to keep in mind so that you can regain those lost opportunities is: SEIZE THE INITIATIVE rather than make an automatic response locally. There were many times that your opponent's moves were not really threatening, and you had the chance to make a move elsewhere that would give you the initiative. Instead, you responded locally, giving White the chance to take the initiative. See the examples in the comments.

In general, though, your play is quite solid. Keep at it.];B[pd]

No Joseki that I'm aware of, but this line of play went OK for you.]

;W[dj];B[kd]C[Maybe instead of L16 taking sente and playing somewhere at F3?

-----
Well, technically you did take sente, in that you didn't feel it necessary to respond directly to his last move. This move is quite reasonable, connecting your two upper-side groups into a huge moyo.]

;W[nb];B[mc];W[gq];B[cn]C[Thought I have to use sente to attack here

----------
This is a reasonable place to invade, but the timing perhaps isn't right.

For one thing, we should mainly think of invading when we're behind. You have other moves that would grow your groups, or reduce White's groups, which would put you back ahead in territory.

(Note that your lead up until this point isn't just the advantage of playing Black. You've been ahead even including White's Komi.)

For another thing, the timing of an invasion is very important. Why? It's important to realize that when you invade there's always a trade-off. The invader (if the group lives) gains some territory. The defender (whether the group lives or not) gets to strengthen their surrounding position.

A good invasion is done at a time and place where the strength that the defender gets is not very useful. Often this means  invading at a point where the defender already has the surrounding territory, and the strength they gain as their part of the trade-off is therefore wasted.

It's still a little early in the game for this, though. White's positions above and below are still moyos - they're not territory yet. This invasion does about as much for White as for Black, in that it allows White to solidify his surrounding moyos into secure territory.]
;W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[do];W[cp];B[ck];W[cj];B[dk];W[bn];B[bm]
;W[ao];B[dm];W[ek];B[eo];W[ep]C[OK, so the invading group is secure now.

But notice that you've only gained about as many points of secure territory as you could have simply by an a single expanding/reducing move 15 moves ago, instead of an invasion.

And also notice how secure his postions above and below are, still with plenty of access to expand into the middle.

This illustrates what I was saying before about the tradeoff of an invasion.]
;B[fo];W[jq];B[kr]TR[po][qo][qk]SQ[eg][qm][ok][dh]C[OK, here is where I might suggest some things that could have opened up some opportunities for you...

This move is really and endgame move, in that it pushes on already-established boundaries without really threatening anything.

Rather, this is a good point in the game to pick a weak group of White's and attack it, either through a severe reduction or an invasion.

The group that catches my eye right now is his right-side triangle group. You may object that it's "secure" in the sense that you probably can't kill it. And that's true, but killing a group is rarely the reason for attacking it.

Instead, you usually attack in order to gain some other advantage while the opponent is forced to defend.  The triangle group is pretty loose, and is surrounded above and below by your strong groups. You can definitely give it some headaches.

I've marked the probable reduction/invasion points with squares (and also marked some other ideas for similar tactics on the left side, which push White back while expanding your position.)]
;W[jr];B[kq];W[jp];B[ko]C[I'll take this move as an example of another way you can find more opportunities.

In this move, and quite a few others, you respond locally when you don't really need to. This move is a reasonable, in and of itself. But it's not really necessary to secure your stones, so you want to take this chance to look around the board for a place to take an advantage elsewhere.

The invading/reducing moves I marked before are still open to you and, if anything, look even better now.]
;W[jo];B[el];W[fk];B[fl]C[Again, you didn't need this move.]
;W[ef]C[Now White takes the initiative rather responding to you locally. He cuts off one of the areas that could have been used against him if you had gotten to that area first.]
;B[ff];W[eg];B[fg];W[fh];B[gh];W[fi];B[gi];W[gk];B[hl]C[Another move you didn't need, which could have been used elsewhere.

The last 10 moves or so were GREAT for you, in that the wall you built up in the upper-left worked perfectly with your wall on the upper right. You now have a huge central moyo.

You could have capitalized on this by pressing the white group on the right, or by making moves that would have started to seal off the large central opening to your top moyo (say, J10).

You're ahead by ~25 points at this juncture, with no real weaknesses to keep you from pressing this advantage. I think that the above tactics might have expanded this to over 30 points.

Instead, this move did not gain you much, either in territory or in influence. It seems like you simply felt obligated to respond locally to his last move.]
;W[pi]C[So, instead, White gets the chance to seize the initiative. He reduces your large central moyo and secures his right-side group at the same time.

I'd suggest that White's taking the initiative starting with this move is really where he makes the biggest gains of the whole game.

The moves later where you make some minor mistakes and lose a few stones are insignificant, compared to the points you lose on the next 10 moves or so.]
;B[ph];W[oi];B[oh];W[op];B[oq];W[no];B[mo]SQ[ni]C[Once again, not a necessary move; again seems like you were only thinking of a local response.

This would have been a great chance to play a move such as the one shown by the square. This would have salvaged some of the potential of your central moyo and simultaneously constricted his room for expansion.]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[mm];B[lm];W[mk];B[mi];W[ni];B[nh];W[mj];B[li]
;W[hj]
(;B[hk]C[Another unnecessary move. Pushing on this link when you can't cut him just doesn't buy you much.]

;W[fr];B[hq];W[gr];B[ho];W[hr];B[iq]SQ[bk][rj][rp]C[Another unnecessary local response. This one, in particular, was an important missed opportunity.

You've managed to fight your way back to being ahead by, say, 10 points. but now we're getting to the end-game, and it's critical to keep sente in order to try to get as many of the disputed end-game areas as possible.

I've marked several areas where you could have taken initiative on this move, and gained a few points in each area. Because the opponent almost has to respond to each one (lest you be in position for a huge incursion), each one is sente and you can just keep taking them all in sequence.

That way you gain a few points here and a few points there, all the while sealing off your positions against any counter-attacks.

Taking the initiative here could have salvaged the game yet. I think you could have expanded your 10-point lead to 15 or even 20.]
;W[rp]C[But, now White takes the initiative, and in the following play he ends up reducing your 10-point lead back to being about even.]
;B[rq];W[qi];B[kk]SQ[rh][ro][bk]C[This move is safe, in that it can't be captured. But in the endgame you should be relentless in thinking about using your moves efficiently to gain territory.

This move simply does not gain territory. Other, more standard, end-game moves are marked with a square. Any of them would have gained you a few points of territory and also kept your opponent off-balance by having to respond to them.]
;W[jk];B[jj];W[ik];B[im];W[gl];B[gm];W[jm];B[in];W[hi];B[hh]
;W[bk]C[And, once again White takes the initiative to get those few points for himself.]
;B[bl];W[ak];B[al];W[bj];B[ri]C[OK, now we're talking. Only this sequence is gote for you, and so you only get this one position.]

Well, maybe, but in order to avoid this you would have had to see it coming 6 moves ago, and played 175 differently.]
