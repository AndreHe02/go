C[kicker> this is a game which shows a weakness of my play:
kicker> i dont seem to understand how to handle big mojo games
kicker> frequently i end in positions where my opponent makes
kicker> secure territory while my potential area remains open
to invasions
kicker> i seem to miss the right moment to reduce and/or invade
and lose games without

If you play in the upper right, you should think about P17 this
makes the corner more secure.
Anyway with the cutting points in the white wall there is much
aji.];B[jh];W[kg];B[cm]C[kicker> now B has a lot of secure territory while my site is

This is not easy and there is no general rule.
You can only try some variations and count the territory ;-)
But I think white is not in a lost position now.
The most common way is to invade at F3, H3, D3 or E2.
If you live in the corner you can still reduce.  I would play first a test move on the left like D9. The territory
is almost secure, so white can not lose much to get some kikashi
stones.];W[be]C[This is endgame, but black answers ;-)];B[bg]

but you can test blacks response on H2];B[hr];W[hq];B[iq];W[go]
;B[gn];W[kh];B[ki];W[li];B[kj];W[pj]C[white should push on M10.
whites territory is not secure but if black can live only in
one place, white should win.
To protecting the territory 54 must be on the third line.];B[nn]
