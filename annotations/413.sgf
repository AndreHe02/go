C[Main questions:
 - Suggestion about the joseki in the two lower corners.
 - What was wrong in the response to the attach tesuji played
by black in the upper side ?
 - Maybe I missed something in the invasion in the center ...


Hello Cristiano Garbarini.  Thanks for your questions which I will try to answer as I review
your game.  Please keep in mind that only a high ranking pro knows
the truth about go. Accept all my amateur comments with polite
suspicion. Their value is only how they may stimulate your own
thinking about your game.

To view this record so it makes sense with the comments, please
set your viewer to SGF style, such that it shows the
next move as the letter "a". If you see a letter "a" displayed
at D4, the
first move in this game, then your viewer is set correctly.

Enjoy.

C[As a matter for you to contemplate, moves at the marked interesections
are all slightly bigger than a, due to the D4 stone being on
the 4th line. Of course go is not so rigid, so a is doable, nevertheless.]
;B[pe]C[Play at b may be the largest point for white.]
(;W[nd];B[qc];W[qb];B[qd];W[ob];B[qi]C[Since white's purpose in the lower right is to simply establish
a base in the black neighborhood, the third line (black at b)
is better than the fourth line for this purpose.]
(;W[op];B[oq]TR[dp]C[The move at a is correct when compared to the alternate play
at b, since, in this game, the bottom is more developable for
white than the right or center. In fact, white will diminish
the value of black's D4. (So perhaps Black should have pincered
in stead of P3.)]
(;W[nq];B[pq]C[Here a white play at b is sometimes seen. The idea is if black
responds at F3  it can infuence if white makes the hanging connection
at N4 or
if black responds at G3 if whites makes the solid connection
at O4. See variations. Nevertheless, a is good enough.]
(;W[np]TR[qi]C[Black should take up a position at B.  C is not good because
its to flat on the right. A is slack because it allows black
to be pressed low on the right in conjunction with the marked
stone.]
(;B[jp];W[qo];B[ro]C[A is a bit heavy. White normally play at b, etc. See variation.]

(;W[po];B[rn];W[ol]C[Perhaps black at b is better to prepare for meeting the inevitable
white play on the bottom. B is a bit tighter on territory also.
This game does not seem a moyo style game.]
(;B[dj];W[fq]TR[jp]C[The black pincer is overconcentrated because of the presense
of K4, which already functions as a pincer stone.];B[hq]C[Can white afford to take cash with b? See variations.]

(;W[cn];B[fp];W[cq];B[eq];W[cp];B[do]C[The connection at a is not necessary right now. White can use
his sente to patiently strengthen his stones on the lower right
or, if white has confidence that these stone are sufficiently
comfortable, he can take a big point on the top. (I think playing
b is sufficient because it also cuts down the black center potential
while helping white.)]
