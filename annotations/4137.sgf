TM[3600]

C[Hello, this was a game I played with 1 hour main time each and 20/5 min canadian overtime.
It was part of a semi - final competition, played on kgs.

I played white and was out of practice slightly.
After around the first 30-40 moves I fell behind, and by 100 moves I knew it would be very difficult and I would most likely lose.

Any help would be appreciated, especially the opening which I think I played too slow. And my opponent tenuki's a lot which is his style.

Thanks,
neil

(;W[oq]C[Is the high approach better P4?
perhaps try O3 instead ?

What is a good direction here?

JL: black will now either play Q6 to connect the side stones and make potential territory, or attack with a hasami which will work nicely with the E3 stone, so maybe it would be better to play a kakari on the E3 stone. I would probably play  D5 because of the white D16-stone.]
;B[mq];W[qq]C[Would it be better to jump out P5?

JL: no. This is a good move. If you jump, you would force black to strenghten his positions and maybe keep you under attack while developing his position. Instead settle the group quickly locally. I would probably play the same move 95% of the time.]
;B[rq]
(;W[rr];B[pq];W[qr];B[pp];W[pr];B[qf]C[JL: black should have either played the peep on the bottom (O2) and then connect S4 to attack or just close the white simply in by playing P4.]

(;W[qe]MA[qf]C[would O17 be better?

JL: anything would be better than this time. This is maybe the worst move you can play in this position. Black pretty much has to answer at Q14 and not the marked stone is in ideal place regarding the new two stone wall.

One technique to play in this local position is to play the variation to try to make black over concentrated, but it may not be such a good idea now as black may be able to create a rather nice side, but still it is possible.

I would play the simplest move there is, keima of O17, locally speaking. Globally, I would definately ignore this kakri and push through at P4 to punish black.

There are two situations you play this kosumi-tsuke you played: either you try to make the opponent a target of attack by making him heavy, or you try to make your opponent over concentrated if he has a stone close by on the side.]
;B[pf];W[op]C[Is this too slow?
Instead play O16? or D5?

JL: you should not have exchanged the moves in the other corner, but since you did, it is hard to say if you should play one more move there (O16 or O17) or to play this move. Maybe this is more sente against black than black P16 is against white, so this is probably best move.]
;B[dj]MA[pq][pp][qp][rq]C[JL: totally wrong direction. The marked stones are now weak and may be attacked right away. Also black could press down the white corner in the top right corner.]
;W[rp]LB[pn:A]C[JL: This is small and pointless - you just help the weak black group to make shape. Instead A.]
;B[cf]LB[pn:A]C[My opponent tenuki's.
It is difficult to say white is bad here. But I feel black may be better by playing fast.

How would you play instead?

JL:  'A' catches a big price. The corner stone is light - no one move can attack it in a severe way, so no reason to play there yet. Black should have played S5-T3-Q6-combination.]
;W[cp]C[I feel this is vital to stop black shimari

JL: It is not urgent. The sides would still be open for invasion/reducetion. Instead Q6. Also finnishing the top right has a higher priority. Same for top left.]
;B[cn]C[JL: this is good.];W[do]C[JL: i have no clue about these josekis, so hard to say anything. What white want to do is to not help black solidify his positions. Especially you want to keep the center bottom open. So, this is probably a good move to start with.]
;B[em]C[JL: too loose.]
(;W[fp]C[JL: I am not sure how to proceed here. You sure would like to get sente and since this is black's sphere of influence, don't try too much. Maybe settile like in the variation is better.]
;B[fd]C[JL: this is interesting as black has still pressing move of P16 left. Still it would be tempting for white to play F3 now - the bottom would look good then. But usually letting the opponent encircle oneself into corner is bad. I'd play F3 now most of the time.]
;W[ce]LB[df:A]C[Is need to defend the corner, is this best move?

JL: don't think of territory this early in the game - you need to be flexible early on to not lock your plans. You can play this way, sure, but the 4-4-stone is not designed for territorial play as it leaves lots of potential under it for the opponent to take advantage. I'd secure the bottom left first, but if I had to play here, I'd play the other tsyke even though it also makes black stronger ('A').

Anyhow, black's move was interesting and I can't see any really good locall variations, so why not tenuki to the bottom instead?]
;B[df];W[ee]C[Afterwards, this looks bad by white, but the center was looking too big for black

JL: The center is undefined, no mans land and it is far easier to make territory in the corners.]
;B[id]C[JL: not sure if better to play one step closer.];W[ef]
;B[jq]LB[dh:A][gq:B]C[JL:  'B' better move locally for black, a light jump to not let white have his way with the corner. Black left side seems thin now, though light.]
;W[fq]C[JL: finally.]
(;B[nd]C[JL:  This is too loose I think, though I've never really given it a thought. It may actually work nicely now that I think of it. I've never played it myself, but will someday try it.]

(;W[nc]C[JL: an overplay.]
(;B[mc]C[Can black play P17 instead?

JL: yes and white must give in.];W[oc];B[ld]C[JL: white is so happy.]
;W[bf]C[JL: better to just extend one point up. No need to provoke black to make himself stronger.]
;B[bg];W[be];B[eg]LB[dh:A]C[JL: ikken-tobi 'A' better. No reason to help the opponent.]
;W[fg];B[eh];W[dn]C[JL: aji-keshi I think. no reason to play here this early. Q6 huge.]
;B[dm];W[bn];B[bm];W[co];B[cm];W[ge]C[JL: one point lower much better (regular hanging connection). Not only it connects well and keeps the center open, it also doesn't provoke black so much to answer and protect his group here]
;B[gd]C[JL: hard to say if this is the best way to connect. One stone higher might be better.]
;W[ec];B[fb]C[JL: this is one reason why - had G16 beer at G17, black would not answer to white E17.]
;W[fc]C[Should I play near R7 instead?];B[gc];W[eb];B[ro]C[JL: finally. This is huge.]
;W[sq];B[pn]C[JL: proper shape.];W[qn]C[I didnt think enough about this move, S6 would have been a lot better ?

JL: neither move is good. You missed your chance with this group now.  Too late for anything, pity.]
;B[qo]C[JL: black sure is smiling now.];W[rf]LB[on:A]C[JL: always a big move., but the center is beginning to look awfully black. Maybe 'A' first to use the stone you played? It would put a little pressure on the bottom black stones while travelling lightly towards the center.]
;B[rg];W[fh]C[JL: no real reason to play this now. Black will tenuki and eat S14 now, aiming at F14 later.]
;B[ei]C[JL: ...I guess not ;-)];W[so]C[JL: not urgent, loses ko threaths and some distant attack/reduction aji (which may never materialize anyhow).]
;B[rn];W[sn];B[sm];W[sp]C[JL: as black I would feel tempted on ignoring this and playing S15 now. Needs lots of reading and counting first and won't be doing that in this review though.]
;B[qm];W[re]C[JL: good, a huge move];B[no]C[JL: the peep O2 first.]
;W[nj]C[I tried to hold back one line instead of P10 but this is mybe too deep also.

JL: it sure is. Way too deep. Black must attack with M10 or something similar. Much of black sides are reduceable in sente (T13, A13), and N18 gote is huge. No reason to play this deep. Also you should try to find a weak spot in the opponent's formation to place your invasion, not just in the center of everything. This is very bad move.]
;B[oi]C[luckily my opponent doesnt play M10

JL: yes, this is not the best of moves (if black were to play from this directikon, then better to not lean on white, but play Q12 or something like it), but white is still living dangerously.]
;W[lj]C[JL: maybe even bigger jump?];B[jj]C[JL: black should have peeped first I think. The attack is late, but at least it comes.]
;W[ml];B[ff]C[JL: Wrong direction.];W[fe];B[gf];W[he];B[hg]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[ic];B[ib];W[ig];B[hh]
(;W[gm]TR[lj][nj][ml]C[Letting black play G7 would be too much.

The game has a bad feel from now on, the N8 group is not yet alive and black has a lot of influence. White does have territory but I feel it is difficult to win now.

JL: This move is loose and overplay and may become under attack since you already have one weak group. Also, territorywise the game seems close, and I'd pick white, not black to play with, so no need to try this much.]
;B[gn]TR[hn]C[JL: black has the right idea: ignore territory and attack two groups with thickness - one will usually die, and even if not, the struggle may make black good solid territory.]

(;W[fn]MA[nj][lj][ml]C[H6 better?

JL: not sure what you plan to do here. Your 3 stone group is not safe yet, and black will probably become even stronger cause of the new struggle.

Also, the variation you suggest is problematic - see the variation.

Try to not create many weak groups.];B[fm];W[hn];B[go];W[ho]
;B[gp];W[hm]C[The only move?

JL: I agree.];W[kn];B[km]

JL: hard to say, but this is just tactics. your trouble started when you invaded with the marked stone and continued overplaying.]

JL:

1. you play too much tenuki. It is better to spend a move to fix the weakness than let opponent take advantage of it.

2. you don't estimate the score well enough, leading to over deep invasion/reduction and then trouble.

3. weak groups are evil, evil I say, try not to create them, and if you have one, don't create another one. 

4. You play moves that strenghten the opponent more than they help you - like the kosumi-stuke of R15 in the early fuseki. 

5. When your opponent plays a tenuki, it may be (and often is at this level) a bad move and if it is, punish him for it.

Rather interesting game with all the tenukis, makes for a fascinating opening, weaknessess or not. Live game is not only more fun, but also more rewarding. Keep on tenuki'in, but make sure the tenuki's are good.]
