C[I was playing black here. (benedict)

Hi benedict!];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[eq];W[qn];B[qo]C[The pupose of this joseki is to put pressure on Wr6. It is especially usefull, if you already have a stone around q10. In this situation, i'll leave the corner open (Wr3 later on) and also doesn't combine very good with your shimari at c4,e3. See the comment later on this...]
;W[pn];B[np];W[qk];B[jq];W[hq];B[lq]C[I think this is too lax. I'ld probably play K5, maybe K4 or J4 are better. M3 makes territory, but as the right edge is still open to R3 invasion, you will not get much out of it.

A still better idea may be to play H5 to let white live small and take a strong position on the outside.]
;W[fp];B[ep];W[jp];B[kp]C[same as before];W[jo];B[fo];W[gp]
;B[dk]C[
I would rather extend to C10 or D10];W[iq];B[jr]C[You put too many stones in work to build up this territory. I would rather play elsewhere now.

If you had played D10 f.g. now c14 would be nice. C13 could still be interesting. Maybe also K17 or N17?]
;W[dm]C[White is really greedy :-)

One should stay away from thickness (strong and save positions). The question how to punish bad behaviour is dan-work but i think just extending along the left side, say to C13 or some point around look good to me. White will have to run for live while you can calmly hunt him. Good prospects if you manage to weaken the white try on the lower side. Big points are still to be played on the upper side...]
;B[cm];W[dn];B[do];W[cn];B[cl];W[en];B[eo];W[fn];B[go];W[ho]
;B[gn];W[fl];B[cg];W[cf];B[dg];W[df];B[gl];W[fk];B[gk];W[di]
;B[ci];W[dj];B[cj];W[fj];B[gj]C[what follows now is endgame play, i think it's high time to play the big points now]
;W[bo];B[bp];W[fq];B[fr];W[gr]C[There is really no need to anser such a move before the late endgame.

You should always try to keep or get the initiative of the game. White settles his group now. The price for this is to loose the initiative. By answering at e2 you gave him a gift.]
;B[er];W[cr]C[White is really greedy. I'm not sure you really need to answer in the corner at all. How about F12 to close white in and maybe kill him?]
;B[cq];W[ko]C[Again, no need to answer...];B[lo];W[qg];B[jd]
;W[hd];B[nc];W[oc];B[nd];W[ic];B[jc];W[lb]C[I didn't know what to do about this stone.
How does one normally handle this?

The move robs you of a base for your gourp. I'ld play m17 or m16 to maintain a connection between the four stones, maybe wrong...]
;B[kb]C[as w i'ld rather play o18 than m16...];W[ld];B[mb];W[lc]
;B[la];W[ob];B[le];W[ke];B[kd];W[me];B[lf];W[md];B[jf];W[ie]
;B[je];W[if]C[i cannot really see the meaning of j14. i'ld play o14 now, maybe no catch, but a good base probably for an invasion at the right side...]
;B[ne];W[mf];B[ib];W[hb];B[lg];W[mg];B[id]C[no use at all this move... really...]
;W[hc];B[ig];W[gf];B[fh]C[Is this a good way to attack the white  group?
Oh yes! :-)];W[fi];B[gi];W[eh];B[eg];W[dh];B[ch];W[fm];B[gm]
C[I should have played atari here.
some 60 points of a difference :-)];W[ek];B[gg];W[ff];B[fg]
;W[rq];B[qq];W[ro];B[hg]C[these are moves you should really try to avoid... You do not close up some large territorry, and the connection is already there. play at c17 or keep attacking that m17 group,  and try to invade the right side afterwards.]
;W[hf]C[okay, now white has been nice (or afraid) enough to just follow you. good luck :-)]
;B[jj]C[This was not an ideal move.  Where  would you have played?

No... what's up on the board? white has just one weak group that can be hunted (maybe not catched, but that doesn't matter).]
;W[lh]
(;B[kg]C[why not just cut him off? (n12) I see no way for w to annoy B any further here. L13 is too friendly.]
;W[kh];B[jh];W[lj];B[og]C[now the move lost most of it's power, still you cannot allow white all the right side...]
;W[oh];B[of];W[nh];B[qf];W[oe];B[pe];W[od];B[nf];W[pg];B[pf]
;W[qd];B[re];W[rd];B[rg];W[qi];B[qh]C[Should I rather have played the monkey  jump here?



Better than this, yes];W[ph];B[rh];W[ri]
(;B[qe]C[what is this? :-)

Trying  not to play useless or veryvery small moves alone will get you some 3-5k better. This is like giving the partner one handicap stone per such move (well some you'll get back in return :-)]
;W[qb]C[Here i have some ideas (variation). Not worked out, sorry, i have not enough time, just take a look at it, maybe something like that may work...]

;B[af];W[ce];B[si];W[sj];B[mm]C[At this point, I felt that I was playing small  moves, and should rather find a larger  point.  I wanted to attack the centre white  territory to reduce his score.]

;B[ng];W[mh]C[you should concentrate on not playing useless moves. If you get used to it, try then to find urgent moves and try to keep the initiave in the game (not blindly following the partner).

Sorry for the long time it took me to finish the comment and excuse for beeing so short in imprecise. I got loads of unexpected work to be done lately :-(
