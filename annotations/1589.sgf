C[Hi, I feel Black did not value connecting his groups and making outside influence while sealing white in enough.  Instead Black made many weak groups everywhere on the board.  In fact White had the chance to kill 2 large dragons.

Also around move 87 it was Black's turn to attack a weak white group, but Blacks technique was not good and instead White took many points that should have been Black's.]

(;B[kq]C[Throughout this fight, I think both white and black should focus more on getting into the center.
Black should try to seal white in and connect his stones.
White should jump to the center and separate black into 2 weak groups.

I put several variations showing this along the way.  They're all showing basically the same thing.]
