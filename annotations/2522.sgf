Dear reviewer, 

this game was played on KGS. My opponent (ke3n) is probably above
2k.  

Please comment on the following points: 

a) opening stategy (if possible for both sides) b) the corner
fight in the upper right (move 136) c) overall performance d)
and all other point you think are worth commenting ;-) 

Thank you very much 

Rainer 

Hi Rainer, 

I'll do my best to provide useful comments. 

In this game black plays a much stronger player .. he does well
until the middle game. As a general development I would recommend
that you always consider defense before attacking. Once you have
strong groups then you can attack. A good rule of thumb is to
never have more than one weak group on the board at anytime.
If you have 2 weak groups then it is worth losing sente to make
one of the groups safe.  

The fighting in this game got very complicated and I couldn't
work out what was really the best moves for black from time to
time because I couldn't predict how the play would develop. 

I wish you every good fortune in learning and playing this wonderful
game.

the r15 group looks just alive although now the aji of o15 has
been removed I would be a bit worried about it so r17 is a possibility

the o4 group has no eyes - although it is out at the moment 

d5 is developable 

d16 could be attacked by black playing at c14 

White has a heavy group l4 which is attackable although any attack
from around h4 would weaken the black group 

As a gerneral principle it is best to defend before attack so
I would play to defend n4 group]
