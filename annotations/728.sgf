;W[rf];B[fd]C[Tennin: This move is the first question. I think my f16 was a very good move. However, the opponent's following move was H17. H17 made me hard to make the following move. Could you give me some sugguestions about possible sequential moves?]

;W[cc];B[be];W[bd];B[ce];W[eb];B[cn]C[Tennin: This move is the second question similar to the first question. The opponent played C8 again. From the theory of go, C8 should be a bad move because of my big wall. However, I still don't know how to response white's C8.  My C10 might be right? Then white E8,  Then, I should play E5 instead of E6? Could you give me some suggestions about how to solve this problems? Thanks you.]

I don't think C3 is bad.];W[cp];B[dq];W[fp]C[Tennin: At this time, I did not have enough time to think, so finally, I lost by time.]
;B[ep]C[This is a bad move because your two cutting stones get captured. Just extending would be much better.  Black is clearly ahead.]
