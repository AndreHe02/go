C[chess [-\]: HIHI
Fargus [9k\]: Hello
Fargus [9k\]: Enjoy the game

Llywelyn: There are three major issues I saw in this game.

* B was overly timid with W.  This lead to B playing defensively when an offensive attack was better, or leaving a critical weakness (e.g., the end of the game). Don't Panic (in big friendly letters).   As a friend of mine likes to say, Black's play needs more Rawr™!

* Black frequently seemed to be replying to white.  Try to tenuki more, on every move can be a lot of fun and can clear your head.

* There's More Than One Way to Connect™.  W was taking advantage of B's knowledge of the motto that "even a moron connects against a peep."   While connecting is good practice, frequently there's more than one way to connect that works just as well.  Keep an eye out for these, as well as forcing moves of your own that you can play if W gets annoying.

I hope that this review helps.  Let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns!]
;B[qp];W[pd];B[dq];W[do];B[cd]C[Llywelyn: I'd consider this the first mistake of the game.  It sets up a move at E16, which feels too nice for white.  

Moves I would consider instead are a pincer  on D5, an approach at R14, or taking the corner at some other point (the 4-4 or 3-3 point, maybe).]
;W[ed]
(;B[df]C[Llywelyn: Given D5, this strikes me as being the wrong direction.  See variations.  Also sylistically, it feels too passive to me.]
;W[hd];B[dc]LB[ec:A][qf:F][dk:H][dl:C][cm:D][op:B][oq:E]C[Fargusnote: I felt like I should do something to stop white from playing C17, and this also cut under white's group a bit, so I went with it

Llywelyn: Slow at this point in time. If W responds at E17, then B feels weaker at C15 while W has gotten a strong position out of the deal.  On the other hand, W doesn't have to respond, because W has room to run or settle locally at W's option.

H16 is a misplay on W's part, and while this is a punishment for it I am not sure it is the best punishment or that it is big enough to play immediately.

Moves that my eye jumped to at are marked.

A puts more pressure (substantially) on the W group, gives B a bigger corner, and can end in sente. 

B and E are conrer enclosures.  Perhaps not the best given the circumstances (rather placid), but certainly big.

C, D, and H are various pincers.   They work well together with both D3 and D14.

F lays immediate claim to the east side, preventing W from making an attempt at a double-wing while also working well with R4.]
;W[oq];B[dm]C[Fargusnote: Looking again, perhaps I should have just played F4, reaching between white's two single stones.

Llywelyn: I dislike F4 here.  F4 is a move that wants to grow, but growing potential is reduced by P3.   Meanwhile, D14 also wants to grow.  So, in my mind, the only reason to play F4 is to sacrifice the east side to get a pincer and a secure foundation in the south.  I am not sure if it is incorrect, but it seems like a passive way of thinking to me.

Instead, I pefer a pincer, though I would have gone with a slightly looser pincer at D8 or so.]
;W[cq]
(;B[cr]C[Llywelyn: Rather serious error.  See variation.];W[cp]
;B[er]C[Fargusnote: I spent a lot of time thinking about this. I thought about F3, but then white could get a base with B2 in sente. I concidered F4, but it seemed to be reaching too far.

Llywelyn: This is confusing jeongseok.    If B's stone at D7 were in a different location, maybe.]
;W[dk]LB[cl:C][el:B][cn:D][en:A]C[Fargusnote: I really have no idea how to deal with this, how to leave white separated but not make D7 a weak and heavy group.

Llywelyn: the diagonal moves all catch my eye here. They make it difficult for W to connect up.

It seems unlikely that B will be able to outright kill, so putting pressure in the hopes of profiting seems like the wisest course of action.]
;B[cn];W[fo];B[fm];W[en]
(;B[em];W[ch]
(;B[cf]C[Fargusnote: Too slow? I'm not sure.

Llywelyn: B lacks good options here (see variation).  C14 is also a good move in that it makes W's position very weak.]
;W[fk];B[hm];W[gn];B[gm];W[gq];B[br];W[qn]C[Fargusnote: Not really sure how to deal with this double-approach, not sure I've even seen it before.

Llywelyn:  I believe this pincer is a mistake given that W is rather weak right now in the SW.]
;B[po]C[Llywelynn: a reasonable reply.];W[oo]C[Llywelyn: An unusual answer by W.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[no];B[nn];W[mo];B[jm]C[Llywelyn: this feels too peaceful to me.    B should be thinking of how to keep white separated... or at least put some pressure on W somewhere somehow.  B is strong enough with that overhang at H7 that diving in to that W framework looks very tempting, and putting pressure on at R8 is also an option.]

(;B[nj];W[ll];B[kk];W[mn]C[Llywelyn: At this point its worth taking a step back and noting that W is dominating the game.]
;B[jj]C[Llywelyn: Nice maek (tesuji).];W[oh];B[jd]C[Llywelyn: I'd be thinkin of a 3-3 invasion instead, but I can't object to putting some pressure on W.]
;W[ld];B[jf]C[Llywelyn: given that W can connect under this, a diagonal play here is best.]
;W[lf];B[qc]C[Fargusnote: I thought this was a good time to 3.3 invade, too bad I mess it up.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nc];B[rd]C[Fargus [9k\]: Fargusnote: I see now that I am in error here.

Llywelyn: I'm not so sure this is an error.];W[re];B[rc];W[nb]
;B[pb];W[jc]C[Llywelyn: White connects, but at a somewhat high price (and note this could have been avoided by playing at J15 instead of K14).]

(;B[fc];W[fd];B[gc];W[gd];B[cj]C[Llywelyn: I dislike leaving the weakness at E17.  It seems that B is desperate to kill something.]
