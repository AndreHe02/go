C[Eratos [26k?\]: Is this a good way to attack this corner?  Or should I instead have gone towards another corner with A or B or made a base with C or D?  I have little clue how to proceed giving handicap.
-reviewer--
it's a good way , 
you make many things playing here
- first, you make a big option on the top right corner
- second, if you play elswhere black will play a move to keep the corner and next have a real option to make a big moyo on the right side
- third , if you play C9 it can be considered like an attack on the bottom right corner and you have no base to make it]

C[Eratos [26k?\]: Looking back this moves looks too small, perhaps it should be at A? Or again near B?
-reviewer--
A better than B 
as A as only two stones on his left
and B three (don't go against strongest group)];B[di];W[er]
;B[dr];W[ep]C[Eratos [26k?\]: This move seems to give up sente which is bad I think, any suggestions?

-reviewer-- move 13 at E2 would have been better at C3 , but you can plan to make a moyo on the bottom]
;B[dq];W[gr]LB[jr:A][lq:B]C[-reviewer--
move 17 lose sente and black can now play
at A and deprive your group  for a base
so i prefer a white move at B
next you can invade san san to attack black a make profit];B[do]
;W[en]C[-reviewer ---

this move is gote , and black can take now initiative, it's him who is sente now
- you can invade top left corner and reduce black influence on the left side]

at this point you can get nothing in the center
it 's better to attack top left
but if you look at bottom you see you looses 
because you play G2 instead of M3

it's a long time before when you plau move 29 at H7 a move at D8 whould have prevent it]
