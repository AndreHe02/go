C[P: I think I've lost this game because I havent defend a weakness at the end of Fuseki. It has created a weak group that my opponent has attacked.


CR:
Hello Paco,

I hope, I will be able to give you some useful hints.

Yours

LB[dp:B][jp:A]C[P: Im not sure if this is the best response now.


CR:

This move only strengthens White's position on the upper side. A or B instead would be better with you Chinese Opening.]

;W[no]LB[om:A]C[P: this is not joseki.

CR: A is usually played here.];B[mp]C[P: Is this the best response?

CR: I think, I would have played this one, too.];W[mn]TR[mp]
[np]C[CR: I think this is very tight, since Black is thick below.]
;B[ce];W[de]LB[cg:A]C[CR: I would pincer at A instead.];B[df]
;W[ee];B[cd];W[cc];B[ch];W[gq];B[ir]C[P: I think this is bad. Better to play aroud c8 or o9

CR: I agree, something around C8 looks good to me.];W[iq];B[jq]
;W[hr];B[cl]C[P: P11 better?


CR: I think this one is ok.];W[ph]C[P: I think this move has made me loose the match.]
;B[qh]LB[nf:A]C[CR: Too submissive. Try A instead.];W[qi];B[qg]
;W[pi];B[nk]LB[qk:A]C[CR: Connected, if W plays at A?]

C[P: His moyo is very big. This move is too risky, but if I dont enter I loose

CR: Something should work here.];W[fc];B[he];W[hg];B[jb];W[kb]

;B[ck]TR[rl][qk][pk][nk][lk][jk]C[P: also too risky because of the group in the right, but If I let him have much territory in the corner I'll loose

CR: The marked group is surely attacked by this move.];W[dj]
;B[gf]C[P. This is a mistake I think. I should have made something with te group of the right. I did that thinking that my group of the left up was weak.]
;W[kl];B[kk];W[fg]TR[rl][qk][pk][nk][lk][kk][jk]C[P: I dont understand this move. Maybe g14 was not too bad?

CR: I think W wants to prevent the marked group from escaping towards the top of the board.]
;B[gc]C[P: this is not necesary


CR: Yes, surely not.];W[il];B[jl];W[jm];B[ll]LB[hj:A]C[CR: At A instead.]
;W[km];B[ik];W[hl];B[om]LB[gj:A]C[CR: First run, then make eyes! At A instead.]
