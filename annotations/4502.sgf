AB[pd][dp]C[Greetings,

my name is Zoran Rilak aka wayward at the KGS.  This was a two-stone handicap game against an opponent who was probably at about my rank, but since I haven't played for a while my rank has drifted upwards.  Anyway, at this point I am less concerned about ranks and handicap stones, and more about the quality of my play.

I tried to play a "light" game, create presence and leave good aji, to have a chance at catching up with Black's two-stone advantage.  I have made some blatant omissions (as you will see) and I generally do not fare well when it comes to life and death.  I would be much obliged if you could give me some guidelines on what I am doing wrong, and what right.

Thanks for your time!
Zoran

Here is my impression after reviewing the game.  I think you will benefit most if you imnprove your reading skill.  As stated by yourself, you can do this by studying life and death problems.  

You seem to like to attack very directly.  You may want to think about preparation for the attack.  Play elsewhere first, build some thickness, and then come back for the attack.  If you opponent decides to defend his weak group first and ignore the moves that you play elsewhere, you should be able to make some profit there.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[df]LB[cf:A]C[Although you may have seen the game move in many games, it is considered to be a slight disadvantage for white.  It's usually played to avoid a pincer by black, if a pincer is good for black, such as forming a framework with black's thickness at the bottom left.  At this time, the standard move at A is better.]
;B[fd];W[ci]LB[cj:A]C[I will prefer to play at A for a faster pace.]
;B[cf];W[cg];B[ce]LB[dg:A]C[You can now see the problem.  Connecting at A creates an overlapped shape.  If not connecting, A creates a weak point.]
;W[qi];B[cl];W[jq];B[fq];W[hc]LB[qf:A]TR[ce][cf]C[Black's upper left corner is strong with the two marked stones.  Without them, black may be able to exploit the 3-3 point weakness.  But in this case the option is not available.  I like A instead.]
;B[ge];W[fg];B[jc];W[he];B[hd];W[id];B[gd];W[jd]LB[ic:A]C[I prefer to connect at A.  Although this will create a weak group for black to attack, letting black cut at A and take all the upper left territory is just too big.]

LB[kd:E][ie:D][if:A][ih:B][jh:C]C[Connecting at A is better.  I suppose you are hoping with the game move the excchange of black B and white C is good for white.  But with the game move, D becomes a weak point for white after black cuts at E.]

;B[kj];W[hj];B[ij];W[gh];B[ii];W[kf];B[ni];W[mg];B[nf]C[Black doesnt' have the luxury to play this move.  Besides, white's group is already alive.  He needs to defend his center group.]
;W[oh];B[oi];W[pk]C[White should defend at A.  Please see variation.]

(;B[nl];W[ok];B[no];W[on];B[om];W[nn]LB[pm:A]C[I prefer to play A to take right side profit.  No need to kill black's group.  Chase black around and make profit during the process.  That should be enough to win the game.]
