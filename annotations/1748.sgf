C[Hi,
Thx for taking the time out to review this game for me.  I'm mostly trying to concentrate on developing my moyo building skills and learning to do the fuseki better.  I know i tend to play a little too defensively and too strong but i'm trying to change that. Please give suggestions on moves where you think a bigger extension would be better or a better move gobally would be better.  I know that i focus on playing locally way too much and i hope that you'll point out the points in the game in which i do that.  Thanks once again.

C[I am not an expert in Joseki, but I think that
a safer move might be to extend towards the right here, maybe at or around "A" (I hope
you can see my marks!)];W[jp];B[cm]C[You are here playing very agressively
towards white's corner.  While this might not be necessarily bad, as you can build up 
thickness, it is still risky.  If he successfully
counterattacks, you could easily lose a group.];W[bn];B[bm]
;W[do];B[en];W[eo];B[fo];W[fn];B[dp]LB[fn:A][dn:B][en:B][fo:C]
[co:D][cq:E]C[Instead of this move... would a move at g5,g6,or f7 be a better move?

I don't think it is a problem, as your move is
sente:  White cuts at "A" to threaten "B" and
"C".  If you take at "D", his threat is useless
and he must defend his corner.  After he responds to your sente, you anyway have time to protect your group further.  In the 
meantime, you create a threat at "E".];W[co];B[go];W[gm];B[pj]
LB[fn:A]C[Now this move is a large fuseki move, but
I think it is very unwise to ignore the situation
in the corner now.  You have two weak groups which are cut by white's "A", which is still very much alive!  You must do something about the situation.]
;W[pl];B[nk]LB[ce:A][jd:B]C[I am not sure what this move is intended to achieve, but I would rather play somewhere 
at the top, like "A" or "B".  (or of course in the
corner that you are still ignoring!! ;-)];W[ce];B[cd]LB[cg:A]
[fd:B][dj:C]C[what is a good response to whites move at c15? i forgot what that move is called but i know its fairly common so i'd like to know some basic responses or ideas to defend against it.

The move you played is a common 
response in the case where your stone is
on the 4-4 point.  It is not usually used 
from the 3-4 point, and in this situation it
allows white to get influence pointing to your
weak group at the bottom of the board. (See variation after next move)

A more normal way to respond is either to 
play a pincer (which is almost certainly
going to lead to trouble with your four
weak stones further down the board)
somewhere near "A".  You might do better
by simply running along the top, somewhere near "B", and after a move or two playing 
near "C".];W[de]
(;B[cg]C[i was trying to play a pincer move but i'm not sure if i'm doing this correctly... this is my first time trying it and i'm not sure if i should be playing farther out or on the 4th line or what?

This is an unusual response, as white can
now push against your stones in the corner.
The variation shows a more normal
response, which, however, does cause
problems for your weak group further down.];W[fe];B[fd];W[he]
;B[hd];W[nc];B[je]LB[lc:A]C[This move looks a bit high.  Maybe now a 
pincer against white's last move would be 
better.  Maybe "A" for example.];W[kd];B[jd];W[kc];B[le]LB[jc:A]
[pf:B]C[This move looks strange.  Maybe rather "A" or "B"?]
;W[ne];B[nf]LB[pf:A]C[Here again, I would rather play a lower move.

C[Now white is well connected, better to play somewhere else.  Maybe A, follow up with
B to attack white's center group?  Also C
is interesting, to keep white from connecting
to his stone at D.];W[oc];B[oe];W[qi];B[qj];W[pi];B[oi];W[jh]

It is definitely good to protect against the cut
here.  Maybe the direct connection would be better, though.  If I were you, I would also
be looking for an opportunity to play the 3-3
point invasion.];W[ol];B[ok];W[ql];B[mm]C[just trying to run into his territory as much as possible to get rid of his territory
