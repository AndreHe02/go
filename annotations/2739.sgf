AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[alaric: Hello, I'll be reviewing your game today.  I'm a 16K KGS player, so take everything with a large grain of salt.  Also note that I don't presume you know the japanese terms, don't be insulted by my simplified explanations if you already know the terms.

Hello and thank you for reviewing my game.
I always won against gnugo with 9 handicaps, so i tried 8. This has nothing to do with my rank, i'm just used to gnugo's moves.

alaric: After playing a good bit against gnugo I don't think it's a good learning tool, the moves feel too artificial, and at times completely nonsensical.  For example I used to get regurarly beat when given 4 or 5 stones by gnugo, but could regurarly defeat it in an even game, mostly do to the fact that if you open the same you basically get the same game over and over again with very little variation.  You end up playing very good against gnugo, but most of that won't help against other players.  There are always games online somewhere that are likely better for sharpening your skills.  

My main question about this game is:
There will be a dead group of mine in the center from about move 120 onwards. Could I have saved it? If yes, what should I have done? Or should I let it die and try to make some territory elsewhere?

alaric: Yes (if you acted earlier), and yes (once your group was dead).

I'd also appreciate some hints for a better "opening" or more effective use of the handicap stones.

alaric: The higher ranking members of my go club have always suggested to play high handicap games aggresively, using your strong opening position to springboard attacks against weak white groups, and I've found that works quite well.

GnuGo thought it won by only 1 point, but I think it miscounted because of the size of my dead group. I counted myself and think I lost by 14 points.

alaric: I believe the count of W+1 is correct.];W[dm];B[cn]
;W[fm];B[cm]C[alaric: A little slow here, c6 and d10 already make life on the side very difficult, that is why white ran to middle, when your opponent runs towards the middle there is often much to gain by chasing him.  You can build moyo (a framework, or potential for territory) while playing sente (moves where your opponent must respond, therefore keeping the initiative) moves.  Something like F9 might be a good choice here.]
;W[gn];B[gp];W[md];B[nc]C[alaric: Not a bad response, but make every move count for the most points possible at that moment.  You know you don't want white to play a second stone in that area, but is there someplace else you could play that gives you good gains, is sente, and would allow you to come back and play this defensive play at a later time?  For every move you play keep three things in mind (and in this order)

1) Do I have any weak groups?  You have individual stones that are weak, but those are not groups, you should feel comfortable sacrificing single stones for a larger gain somewhere else.  On the board now (Before move 8) you have a single group in the bottem left that is quite secure, so do you have any weak groups? no, then on to 2

2) Does your opponent have any weak groups? Look at the stones D7, F7, G6.  This group has no eyes, is denied access to the corner and the sides, it's nearly surrounded by black.  What if you played G9 or J6 here? You create a very dire attack on the white group, if white does not respond you can kill that group and with it take 1/4 of the board and the game is over on the 10th move.  If he does respond he is going to need to fight for his life in the middle of the board and you will merrily build moyo all around him, probably taking huge gains on the bottom and left sides of the board, if you play it right the game is over.  This is one of the keys of playing with a large handicap.  Do not be passive, don't respond in kind to your opponents moves, you already have a strong defensive position, now build off that to attack white where he is weak, and in a large handicap game white will be weak everywhere.

3) Didn't get to 3 in this example, but it's "Play the big point".  If you have no weakness and your opponent has no weakness then find the largest point on the board and play it.]
;W[pg];B[qf];W[mp];B[nq];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[dg];W[qn];B[pn]
;W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp];W[rk];B[qh];W[mn];B[jn]C[alaric: M3 is probably the better play here, your thought process is good, you split two white groups, leaving both of them weak, forcing white to respond, but you can see from what follows that if you had a stone at m3 you would control the entire bottom half of the board, around 50 points. How many points does black have right now?  Very few, you have the top right, the left side, if you control the bottom even if he takes the entire center he loses.  If he plays K6 instead of you then he has a nice wall, makes himself fairly secure, but will likely get very little territory from it. you can spoil all his territory by extended off your strong sides, such as F9, G10.  He will live in the center, but with not near enough points to win the game.]
;W[lq];B[lc]C[alaric: I think this is the wrong time to tenuki (play away from the current fight).  M17 is an important point, as it prevents a white assault on K16 that could give considerable territory, but you have a strong string of stones on the 4th line on the bottom of the board, that's worth 30 points right now, your opponent has just made a move that prepares him for invading your territory, to me you simply must play something like L3.]
;W[jr]C[alaric: That move hurts, it gives white eye space on the bottom of the board, it is a sente move that threatens to destroy the entire bottom side of the board for you, and sets white up with enough strength to put pressure on your group in the bottom right.  A move like S4 by white would cause you to lose any real value in the corner and let him build strength while you fight to live small against the side.]
;B[ir];W[mc];B[mb]C[alaric: I would prefer something like H17 here.  If your pupose is to keep the k16/m17 group living then you can do so while attacking a weak white group.  Any time you can make a move that strengthens you while attacking the enemy do so.]
;W[cq];B[dq]C[I hate that 3-3 attack! ;)
Was there a better way to defend?
Of course, playing there myself could be the best way. But I always miss the right time to do that.

alaric: All new players fear the 3-3.  They fear it because it makes them feel like they lost "their corner".  There in lies the problem.  A 4-4 stones purpose is not to guard or own the corner.  4-4 is an influence play, it's purpose is to allow you to expand towards the center of the board.  When you start to play more even games and practice with different openings you will see why a 3-4 or 3-3 is a move to take the corner, and the 4-4 is not.  In fact, the 3-3 invasion gains white little in the way of territory, gives black a strong outward facing wall, and it's only real purpose is to spoil the corner for black.  Not just that, but most new players tend to play the 3-3 too early, while there are bigger points left on the board.  In this case, it was about the right time, white just spoiled your bottom side, and has stones blocking you from getting to the center, as such the strong outward facing wall you get is worth less than it would be at other times.  If you really dislike the 3-3 invasion and what to control the corner than you need at least 2 more stones, both played on the 3rd line to own the corner.  4-4 needs 2 stones to own the corner, 3-4 needs one stone to own the corner, 3-3 owns the corner by itself.  This is why 4-4 is not a play to gain territory, but instead to gain influence.]

;W[ds];B[fq];W[ml];B[qc];W[mf];B[il];W[fk];B[ej]C[alaric: I think F10 is the better move here, it severly cuts white off from the center and is in no danger of being cut off, you will have friendly forces in every direction.  E10 is too slow.]
;W[ng];B[hc]C[alaric: good move, but i think pressing the attack on the F7 white group is worth more to you at this point]
;W[fb];B[eb];W[ro];B[rp];W[om];B[gb];W[ff];B[eg]C[alaric: Again to slow, a one point extension (two stones with a one point gap) is very strong, so strong that they are generally considered "connected" effectively, twice you've missed the oppurtunity to start a severe attack on a weak white group by playing slowly.]
;W[ed];B[dc];W[hf];B[jf];W[hh];B[fa]C[alaric: This games you very little at this point, still lots of points on the board worth more than this.  White has almost no points, but has some strength in the middle, playing to reduce that potential, or to press whites weak groups would be good here.]
;W[pi]
(;B[qj];W[qi];B[ri];W[rj]C[Any way the stones at QR10 could have been saved?

alaric: At this point you are cut and there isn't any real way to save those stones, but they still have value as aji.]
;B[rh];W[oi];B[ph];W[oh];B[fj];W[en];B[eo];W[el];B[dl];W[dn]
;B[do]C[alaric: Unnecessary, even if white cuts at D5 both of your groups are alive.]
;W[fo];B[fp];W[lr];B[mr];W[np]
(;B[oq];W[po]C[And again I lost two stones unnecessarily. Or was this unavoidable?

alaric: See variant, a simple bamboo shoot on the previous play would have prevented them from being cut off.]
;B[op];W[oo];B[cl]C[alaric: Slow, but if you are going to play something like this i prefer D9.  If secures the D8 stone and surrounds slightly more territory.]
;W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[rr]C[alaric: I used to like diagonal protection plays like this, but they create a ko threat at R3, a simple connection at S3 is probably better.]
;W[is];B[hs];W[iq];B[hr];W[jq]
(;B[hq]C[alaric:  Your group is already alive, even if it weren't connected to the left side of the board it has two eyes of it's own.  This play is unnecessary and allows your center stones to be cut off.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[jm];B[im];W[io];B[in];W[hn];B[jo]C[Maybe I should have given up the stone at K4 and try to connect to the F10 group?

alaric: Yes, you risk the whole group for the sake of a single stone.]
;W[ho];B[hj]C[Thought about H9, but wG10 would have prevented the connection again, wouldn't it?

alaric: I've heard the rule "Don't run with a knights move."  This appears to be because a knights move can always be cut, such as it was here.  You are already in trouble here, but I think your best chance is to play J10, which threatens to connect to either F10 or K14.  That at least gives you a fighting chance of trying to connect.]
;W[hk];B[ij];W[ik];B[jk];W[jj];B[jl];W[km];B[kj];W[ji];B[kk]
;W[ki];B[lj]C[alaric: When you are dead you need to realize it, currently you are throwing more stones that white will capture, while helping white to build up an impressive territory.  Put down the shovel! (stop digging your own grave).]

;W[ee];B[nl]C[I run and run, but there was no way for me to connect to a living group or make life with the group itself ;(

alaric: At this point realizing that you are "drawing dead" (to steal a poker term) is what is important.]

;W[pk];B[pl];W[ql];B[lk]C[alaric: I appreciate a never say die attitude, but you have to have a plan, what are you trying to accomplish with your current plays?  For a group to live you need to either connect it to a living group or form two eyes, your plays here aren't moving towards those goals, so they are wasted and end up costing you points.]
;W[mm];B[gc];W[gd];B[js];W[ks];B[is];W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[li]
;W[si]C[alaric: Here you played a stone that gained you nothing, that ends up captures and therefore loses a point, instead of playing the one point gote move of T10, which instead your opponent plays gaining him 1 point instead of you, that's a 3 point swing in a game that you lost by 1 point.  "Little" moves count.]

;B[ns];W[ls];B[cj];W[tt];B[tt]C[GnuGo miscounted that it won by 1.0 points, maybe because of the strange black shape in the center. I actually count a loss for me by 14.0 points.

Thank you for reviewing.

alaric: Cgoban has it as White+1 and it looks correct to me.  Alltogether you played a good game, it's obvious that you see the whole board well, play the big points.  You play a little too defensively at times (although admitedly I play very aggresive).  In fact you only made one real mistake, allowing your K6 group to get cut off.  You compounded this by throwing stones to your enemy, instead of fighting for life you could still have won by using the aji of those stones to reduce white's center, but other than that a well played game.]

(;B[op]TR[oo][po]SQ[on][pn][pp]C[alaric: Bamboo Shoot.  The triangle points (P5, Q5) are Miai (two points such that if your opponent plays one you can play the other).]
))
(;B[qi]C[alaric: Don't overly concern yourself with a single stone, you must be willing to sacrifice stones if there is gains to be made by doing so.  In this case you could end with a very favorable position if the Q10 stone is cut at R10 because the Q10 stone still has aji (potential to cause trouble).  Continue on this branch to see one such conclusion.]

;W[oj];B[nj];W[ok];B[nk]C[A serious of slow forcing moves can lead to a good invasion of whites potential center moyo.  Each move puts alot of pressure on white and generally forces a response, so you can continue snaking your way through whites territory.  As this sits here you have sacrificed the Q10 stone, solidified whites position on the lower right, but in exchane you have pretty much destroyed any chance of white taking any real gains from the center.]
