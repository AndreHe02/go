AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Handicapped Game 6-Stones
Ranked
In KGS];W[nc]C[Hello, I'm Pekka Keipi and I'm going to review this game. I will give more comments for blacks moves, because this is a 6 handicap game. All my comments from now on will start with "Pk: "]

(;B[od]LB[lc:D][oc:C][jd:E][pf:A][qf:B]C[Pk: This is not a standard response for white's move, these standard moves are A, B, C and D. and even E.]

(;W[fc]
(;B[ec]LB[dc:A][oc:B][ed:a][hd:b]TR[od]C[Which is better? A or B? 4 in (a) could be better?  Or (b)
Pk: black should have played B instead of the marked stone. 4 at (a) isn't good and 4 at (b) isn't bad.]
;W[fd]C[Pk: this is the best move for white.]
(;B[fe]C[Pk: this is an overplay. White has many good moves now.]

(;W[ge];B[gd]C[Pk: This doesn't do any good for black.]
(;W[hd];B[gc];W[gb];B[hb];W[hc];B[dg]LB[gc:A]C[How could be the best way to recover from white invasion in A?]
;W[qn]TR[nq]C[Why white has given keima here?
Pk: This move is called kakari. It is a standard approching move towards the corner hoshi (4-4). I think white should have done this from the other side (marked point)]

(;B[pm]LB[ql:A][qo:B][nq:C]C[Pk: I think black should have played A instead of the marked stone. B or C could have been good too.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[qq]TR[oq]C[Pk: marked stone is now too big for both. white should have played it.]

(;B[pn]LB[qp:B][oq:A]C[Pk: this is too passive, better would have been A (or B)]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro]
(;B[op];W[oq];B[pq];W[pr];B[mq]TR[mr]C[The white position in right bottom corner is strong? Why?
Pk: It's alive, but strong? no. and black has a sente at the marked point.]
;W[cn];B[dn]
(;W[fq];B[fp];W[cq]TR[co][eq]C[Pk: black now has really big moves at the marked points.]
;B[ep];W[cp];B[do]TR[ep]C[Pk: the marked stones are too passive.]

(;B[bo];W[bn];B[al];W[bl];B[ck];W[em]TR[gm]C[White splits black's left units. How could I prevent it?
Pk: by capping it around the marked point.]
(;B[fm];W[fn]
(;B[fo];W[gn];B[gm];W[hn]
(;B[in]C[Pk: this is an over play. Do not try to kill all, it never works.]

;W[ip]
(;B[km];W[jm]C[More or less here, my oponnent (in the post-game revision) had commented that I play securely. So why I had lost so much space?
Pk: you try to get everything. This isn't going to work, not in this game or in any other. Go is a game of sharing. If you attack against your opponents stones, do not try to kill them. try to gain something from attacking them (area, influence, points in some way)]

[gc][gd][in][io]TB[gp];W[en]C[Pk: this was worth a 100 points.]
;B[el];W[gl];B[gk];W[fl];B[mf]TR[lh]C[Pk: more efficient would have been around the marked stone.Do not try to make territory with strength (M16-R16 is strength, orcourse). Instead, try to attack and expand with strength.]
;W[kf];B[jj]LB[fk:1][lk:2]TR[ge][kf][fl][jl]C[Tengen here is a good idea to make some territory?
Pk: no, because or the marked stones it is not a good idea. better would have been around 1 or 2]

Pk: black had nothing in the end. the biggest mistakes were 1) not to defend moyo on the right and 2) not connecing E6. (the last comment at move 186). I belive that studying basic joseki, fuseki and tesuji will easily give both of the players some strength]
