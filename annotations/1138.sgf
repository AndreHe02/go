C[I have black (Darwi). Mostly I felt pretty good but I think I made a big blunder in the middle of the game. I am sure you will find many problems in my play and would be very thankful if you could point them out. thank you]
;B[qd];W[qp];B[oc]C[dude: I think this shimari is to small in the beginning better play somewhere in an other corner]
;W[cp];B[dd];W[qm];B[pj]C[did
not want to let him have the side. plus: I thought the extension fit well
to the upper right enclosure];W[cm];B[eq]TR[cm]C[this time I felt it was more important to prevent white's shimari

dude: you thought well but in my opinion a little bit to late because the triangled stone strengthens whites position on the side]
;W[cc];B[dc]C[correct side? I wanted to take the upper side by creating a wall to the left]
;W[cd]C[dude: correct direction];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg]
;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[fc]C[so now there is the wall];W[de]C[I was puzzled. but I think I have the ladder correct-he cannot escape]
;B[ee];W[df]C[dude: the ladder doesn´t work see variation]
(;B[eg]C[but felt a net would be safer

dude: you felt right];W[ef];B[ff];W[ed];B[dg];W[fd];B[gd];W[nq]
;B[hq]C[too small? but in the middle of white's moyo did not dare more

dude: right size- larger would white give a posibility to seperate your stones]
;W[kq];B[cr]C[Good move to settle on the lower side];W[cj];B[bg]
C[i did not want to let white connect. maybe too timid?];W[ad]
;B[kd]LB[kc:A][lc:B]C[this I felt was very big

dude:it is a big move but  better at A or B];W[mc]C[how can he ... ;-)]
;B[md];W[kc];B[lc]LB[jc:A]C[probably better at j17 but i wanted to split him

dude: A seems better to me];W[lb]C[of course];B[ld];W[mb];B[jc]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[jd];B[je];W[id]LB[hb:A]
(;B[ic]C[empty triangle. but how to prevent it?];W[hc];B[hb]
;W[hd];B[he]C[at this point i was confident to be able to kill the h16 group but now am not so sure]
;W[ob];B[pb]C[dont let him into the corner];W[nc]
(;B[od]LB[nd:A]C[dude: A is better (See Variation)];W[nd]
(;B[oa]C[i think this was a big mistake. should have kept him insiode by O15

dude: If you dont play A at move 61 B63 at O15 is neccesary to save the upper side for you (variation)]
;W[ne]C[he has escaped. boo];B[me]C[another empty triangle. but i was afraid of him taking this spot.]
;W[mf];B[ie];W[ke];B[gc];W[kf];B[oe];W[of];B[pf];W[pg]
(;B[qf]C[dude: playing the atari might be better (variation)]
;W[ph];B[qg];W[oj];B[ri]C[dude: better at R12];W[qj];B[qi];W[pi]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[ok];W[pl];B[oi];W[og];B[nj]C[now i still have hope to close him in]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[nm];B[nk]C[wanted to use this wall for extension to K10 at the next opportunity

dude: the K10 extension is a good idea but you first should try to settle the P9 Group]
;W[hr]C[dude: dont let him play in your territory - press him against his own stones- it would create thickness in his corner but you can easily make some territory and escape to the center (another variation)]

(;B[ir]C[but this has to come first.];W[gr];B[gq];W[fr];B[er]
;W[is];B[js]C[bad move. but I have not handled the whole sequence well. whre did I go wrong?]
;W[jr];B[hs];W[ks];B[fq]C[if j2 could not be saved, at least create wall towards center]
;W[is];B[fs];W[iq];B[ip];W[hp];B[es]C[dude: This move (E1) is gote and you aren´t under pressure to make it]
;W[gs];B[ho]C[dude: wrong direction if you want to escape to the center]
;W[gp];B[go];W[fp];B[eo]C[another net];W[io];B[jp];W[jq];B[co]
C[this should get me the corner

dude: well done];W[jo];B[kp]C[i
think I am caught in a ladder here but did not see it then. i thought i was
safe since i netted the h4 group. but it had one too many liberties

dude: it was an exchange for the corner you weren´t able to get both]
;W[lp];B[ko];W[kn];B[ep];W[lo];B[fo];W[ip];B[bo]C[make sure the corner is mine]
;W[cn];B[jh]C[start attack on white group

dude: your P9 group is still loose];W[lg];B[jl];W[li];B[lh]
;W[mh];B[kh];W[mi];B[nh]C[try to reduce his eyespace];W[ni]
;B[mm]C[i need an escape route. try to combine with attack]
;W[mn];B[lm];W[oh]C[oops - now he lives for sure

dude: and he causes you a big problem];B[oj];W[le];B[jd];W[kg]
;B[jg];W[jf];B[if];W[ln];B[km];W[jj];B[kj]C[I
think this is where my big mistake starts - insted of securing life I build
a stupid eye

dude: here I agree with you];W[hj]C[I did not see this as an attack

dude:  it saves whites K10 stone and makes pressure to your upper territory]
;B[ji];W[ij];B[bi];W[bj];B[aj];W[ak];B[ai];W[bn];B[ej];W[ek]
;B[dj];W[fj];B[dk];W[cl];B[dl]C[attacking the white group c8 and maybe h10 as well]
;W[mj];B[mk];W[lj];B[lk];W[ng];B[bk]LB[hm:a]C[I
wanted to destroy his 2 eyes.I know I should connect (at a=H7?) but then
he might make 2 eyes and live on the left side, maybe even take away the
corner...

dude: the corner is save and your P9 Group is worth around 30 points so there is no question what to save]
;W[jm];B[im];W[kk]C[dude: good white move this makes big trouble to the P9 Group]
;B[kl];W[ki]
(;B[jn]C[was there still a way to safety? I think maybe j6 was better?

dude: first play J8, J6 gives W a cutting point if he plays J6 you can connect at h6]
;W[in];B[jm]C[there must have been some ways (?) but i let myself be closed in

dude: see the variations again];W[hm];B[hn];W[hl];B[om]LB[da:D]
[ma:E][af:C][fi:F][sk:A][an:B]C[a desperate attempt

dude: to early for a move like this there other points you should play first (examples A to F) you later can use this move as a KO threat]
;W[nn];B[pm];W[ql];B[fk]C[at lease try for some territory];W[gk]
;B[fl];W[fi];B[ei];W[hh];B[ig];W[gg];B[fg];W[ec];B[de]C[dude: kill the 3 stones]
;W[ea];B[fe];W[fb];B[ec];W[gf];B[ge];W[fh];B[eh];W[fm];B[em]
;W[fn];B[en];W[gl];B[el];W[gm];B[qn];W[pn];B[nb]LB[ka:C][ma:B]
[sk:A]C[now
it is more or less finished. what do you think of the endgame? would there
have been big points to gain?

dude: the moves at A, B or C seem to be  the biggest points left]
;W[rj];B[qh];W[si];B[sh];W[sj];B[ma];W[la];B[na];W[ka];B[ja]
;W[nf];B[gb];W[fa];B[ga];W[da];B[af];W[ae];B[ag];W[hg];B[ii]
;W[hi];B[ck];W[jk];B[bc];W[bb];W[do];B[bp];W[dp];B[bq];B[ac]
;W[bd];B[ab];C[
 so I lost by about 35 points - do you think it was only the one mistake?

dude: In my opinion there are some small points where you could succeed if you take a closer look at the situation  the only big mistake for sure was attacking whites group with your loose  P9 Group (you´ve lost around 40 points)

Thanks in advance for reviewing my game
