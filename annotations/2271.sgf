AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, I am Thorre. This 4 stone game was really hard for me (black).
I won, but it was all about one very lucky move (S234).

So I am sure, there were a lot of mistakes, that I made. It would
be nice to hear / read your advice. Thanks a lot!

At some points you will find my questions. Perhaps it would help
to look at these questions, cause you can check my wrong logic.

Thorre (KGS 10.Kyu)

Black luckily wins the game!!

He starts well playing solidly and trying to keep white separated.
he attacks too early and the results are that his atacks help
white and weaken his own position. I suggest that you use the
principle of defense before attack and to calculate territory
when giving your oponent some points. Giving a little to get
a lot seems a good winning principle .. If only I had learned
all I am saying in my own games!!!

I enjoyed looking at your game .. thanks for including me


Robin 5k igs];W[qf];B[nd];W[lc];B[me]C[At this point I decide for runnig out, cause I dont want to get
shut in.

This is a very good move ..keeps white separate];W[id];B[jp]
;W[nq];B[oq]C[Here I decide for buliding corner territory and hope for some
white stones left to attack.

Again an excellant move .. works well with k4 and makes white
heavy];W[np];B[pn];W[fp];B[kq]C[The idea is to hold the right white group small on eye space
and to stabilze the side star stone.

this seems ok to me although I would probably play c6 as white
is still split into two and I get a bit of territory];W[nn]
;B[om]C[I hope for more pressure on the 3 white stones.

I would prefer p8 as p7 will help white a bit and push him towards
my relatively weak group (k4)];W[pj]TR[rd][jn][dn]C[I dont know how to deal with that, thats why I decide for...

My choices in response would be the following .. I've marked
them on the board

I think r12 is bit early and if I intend to play there I think
either r16 or s16 aims for that and gives me territory

k6 aims to push white onto o7.. this will help me as black then
gets stronger threatening r12

d6 seems to invite f6 which invites k6 which then gets us back
into 3 weak white groups one weak black one]
(;B[qh]C[... attack.];W[rd];B[qc]C[Hoping for small white eye space.

This is the problem with your invasion as black has to defend]
;W[pg]C[The disadvantage of pushing as you did is that white gets thickness.

You could give up the stone and play elsewhere or you could play
just outside forcing white to reply.

I would probably give it up and aim to play just outside a bit
later once the position has clarified itself];B[pi]C[Dont know how to break through or link up...

I don't think black can break through so having decided to save
this stone your response seems the best option here];W[oi];B[qj]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[pk];B[ql];W[rg];B[pl]C[Well it seems to work, but was it good?

see earlier comments];W[ok];B[nm];W[lo];B[jn];W[lm];B[ml]C[Hoping for pressure on the white stones...

this seems fine to me];W[dq]
(;B[ep]C[Dont know how tho handle. I dont want white to link up the easy
way plus taking a fat part of the the corner.

the problem with this move is that you loose liberties

see variation];W[eq];B[dn];W[fn];B[gq];W[fq];B[hq]C[Fear about the middle black group.

It is a good move as white has got stronger you need to strengthen
this group];W[cl];B[em];W[di]C[I think c4 is urgent as white can attack this group]

(;B[df]C[At this point I feel the white influence on the upper left quarter.
I dont want to white to get this part with some tricky attacks.

I think white should attack the black group now see variation]

(;W[cc]C[And here the attack comes...]
(;B[dc]C[I decide for letting white live in the corner, cause I am hoping
for influence on the center of board.

I think wrong way as you can build territory and threaten white
group];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[fc];W[ad]
