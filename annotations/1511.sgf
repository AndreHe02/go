C[Hi reviewer.

I played this game on KGS against a person with a 15?k rank.  I myself am at a stable 15k rank - I was 14k but had a bad run of games - mostly my fault due to not concentrating and poor reading.

In this game I lost by a margin of 6.5 points, which surprised me as I felt that my fuseki was absolutely terrible.  I also don't think I invaded well enough.

In general, please could you comment on how my fuseki could have been improved, and on occasions where I missed invasions.

Also, I make a lot of comments in the file on why I played certain moves or took certain strategies.  You don't have to comment on these if my thinking is sound, but if I've played a bad move when I think I've played a good one, please comment on them.  Thanks.

(;W[dj]LB[jp:a][rq:b]C[black grabs the big point in one side, so in the interest of balance i grab the other


In my opinion, the three white stones in the lower-right corner are not stable. The black can gain huge profit while attacking them. There are two points I suggest (a and b). They are more urgent than w10. Let's see the var.]

(;B[jd];W[cf]C[I still feel that there's a big hole in the lower area.]
;B[fd];W[bd];B[jj]C[I expected black to play c17 but instead he played here.  i found the resulting moyo intimidating and was unsure of how to proceed.]
;W[jp]C[in hindsight, i fear this was too passive

This is wonderful. Both of you are almost even now, one coner and two sides for you both.]
;B[on];W[md]C[i played here with an eye on getting some stones on the side/centre before doing a 3-3 invasion.  unfortunately...

Invasion on the forth line is too high. It's so important to have a root first.]
;B[pg]C[black played here.  this, to my eye, made a 3-3 invasion look unreasonable, as the result of a 3-3 invasion would be that black would make firm territory on the right and top side, and in the centre. see my variation for how i saw a 3-3 invasion going.

B19 is a bad move. It's useless and give you a good chance to invade at 3-3.]

(;W[mf]LB[nc:a]C[Jumping out seemed the only option.  was this correct?  or was n16 itself a big mistake?  it looks too high to me now.

I don't think it's a good idea to jump into the center. Point 'a' will be better.]
;B[jf];W[lh];B[jh];W[lj];B[jl];W[ll];B[kn];W[nl]C[here i try to make room for eyes, with also the possability of trying to cut blacks 'corner' group from the side.

Actually the six white stones are still in danger. It's hardly to survive if the black attacks correctly.]
;B[no];W[lq]LB[lp:a]C[i have to protect my weakness here.  but i wonder, would it have been better a line higher?

I agree with you. 'A' is better since you had got strong backup here.]
;B[pl]C[black prevents a cut so i try to connect to the bottom instead]
;W[ln];B[ko];W[kp];B[lo];W[jm];B[km];W[kl];B[il];W[gp];B[dl]
LB[nj:a][ef:b][fj:c]C[B41 is so strange here. If I were the black, I will keep attacking the white in the right side. If the attack works, the game's over. What about the attack at 'a'?

Besides 'a', points around 'b'  or 'c' are much better than b41.]
;W[co]C[i wanted to ensure i had a big bottom side and bottom left corner, so i played here to stave off a 3-3 invasion.

Good. You not only protect the corner, but attack the b41 at the same time.]
;B[fl];W[qo]LB[rq:a][cc:b][dh:c]C[I lost focus somewhat here, i think.  i should have noticed that the left side and top left corner are very weak.  black immediately too advantage

First, 'a' is the right point if you want to play at the lower-right corner.

As long as you play at 'b' or 'c', the top left corner will be stable.

Don't forget, the whites in the right area are still in danger.]
;B[cc];W[ro];B[ch]C[W46 is not important at all, and b47 is excellent.

Since you lost the top left corner, you have to settle down immediately. Now you lose both important points.]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[ba];W[cd];B[de];W[cg];B[dh]
;W[eg];B[ei];W[cl]C[by this point satisfied with that i'd be able to make the top left live no matter what black did - and was later almost proved wrong.  was i right to tenuki at this point, or should i have played there a bit more to ensure white would live?

Tenuki here is ok, since the black has no serious attack.];B[cm]
;W[bm];B[ck];W[bl];B[dk];W[dm];B[em];W[dn];B[rn]C[i increase my corner up into the side.  i'm happy with this.  although black has a moyo in the centre still, it's open and i think i can reduce it severly by playing out from the e13 stone.  i didn't actually notice until late in the game that black could cut me off by playing d13.  thankfully black didn't notice either.]

(;W[sn]LB[pn:a]C[immediately after making this move i thought it was a bad mistake.  i made it with the intention of playing q6 immediately after, but in hindsight i think i should've played q6 without t6.  or maybe somewhere else entirely.

You're right. W70 is too small. I'm afraid that 'a' is also not good.]
;B[sm];W[pn];B[qm]C[black surprised me here.  i expected him to atari and then protect a cut after i'd connected.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[po]C[black is now left with two cuts and can only protect one.]
;B[so];W[ol];B[pk];W[nj]C[a move to make space in the fight i anticipated coming.  unfortunately i hadn't noticed j6 was an important position and that a play around there, perhaps j6 itself, or j7 was now urgent.]
;B[in]C[black gets there before me.]
(;W[lb]LB[nc:a]C[i try to extend my options for the shaky looking centre group by making space on the top for it

You shoud do this as early as possible. 'a' is still suggested.]
;B[jb];W[oc]C[by this point i had given up on a 3-3 invasion totally and just wanted to make space.

You're right. The most important thing you have to do is securing the whites.]
;B[pc];W[ob];B[pb];W[ji]C[this is where i really started fighting.  looking at the board, black had lots of territory on the right and the top, and the potential for more in the centre.  so at decided to treat the game a bit like a handicap game and try and mix things up a bit.

in hindsight, perhaps the best way to try and mix things up a bit could have been to make a bamboo joint at e14 and then reduce blacks territory from that side, and try and claim some for my own in the process.]
;B[ii]C[black ataris from the side other than the one i expected him to, so my continuation was probably not ideal.]
;W[kj];B[ki];W[kh];B[rq];W[rr];B[io];W[ip];B[bk]C[black makes what seems to be a slack move, so i take the oppurtunity to grab sente and make a start at reducing the center.]
;W[gg];B[oa]C[black attacks.  so i play here for a bit.  i'm not too bothered that he's grabbed sente from me, as i feel i have a lot of options with how to further attack from g13 when i get sente back.  it goes without saying that i've still not noticed b d13, but black hasn't either - and in fact, never does.]
;W[na];B[pa];W[od];B[oe];W[ne];B[of];W[kf];B[ke];W[le];B[sr]
;W[rs]C[this move cause problems for me later.  looking at it now, i'm wondering if i should have played r2 of if it was a move i missed later.

W110 is the biggest point in the corner. This is ok.];B[gn]
;W[fo];B[kg];W[lf];B[mc]C[what seems to be a totally unreasonable invasion by B.  i deal with it quickly before it can cause any trouble by connecting to the wall down the center.]

;B[og];W[ph];B[qh];W[hd]LB[he:a]C[i get unreasonable now.  part of my plan to mix things up and wory black.  this invasion fails, but i do end up making two definite eyes for my group on the right of the center, so i'm happy with that.

You run too deep in the black territory. 'a' may be better.]
;B[ge]C[although, this move of black puts pressure on my other weak group, so in hindsight, i should have perhaps approached things differently.]

(;W[hr];B[ki]C[the ko is worthless for me as it doesn't attack either of blacks groups, so i move on to what i think are simple endgame moves.]
;W[ah];B[ae]C[black ignores my move and strikes fear into me by playing a15.  it's only now i start wondering if i've badly misjudged the side.

You should punish the black for his tenuki. The white is safe. No further comments, since there's nothing wrong after this.]

;W[fh];B[ji];W[if];B[ca];W[hf];B[hh];W[gf];B[be]C[now black notices b15, but it's too late.]
;W[dg]C[as i can't see any more territory making moves on the board, i go right ahead and show him his mistake]
;B[tt];W[mg]C[black passed even though he has a threat to kill the m9 group.  so i connect it anyway.]
;B[tt];W[qi]C[i know i'm losing, and don't expect black to make an mistakes at this point, but i play these last few moves anyway to see what happens.]

AJR90 [15k\]: i'm surprised, my fuseki was terrible
berabo [14k?\]: yeah, you did nice in upper left
AJR90 [15k\]: you missed a move in the upper left, which had you played it would have made it sente, i think.
AJR90 [15k\]: no, wait, not sente.  what's the word i'm thinking of?
AJR90 [15k\]: seki
berabo [14k?\]: i could make it seki
AJR90 [15k\]: the eye at f13.  you could've played to prevent that, so, seki.
berabo [14k?\]: i didn't realised then
berabo [14k?\]: it was a kind of a good game
AJR90 [15k\]: yes, it started very badly for me, but i managed to put in a good show of spirited fighting.  even if i did make some mistakes (like missing the cut on the lower right and letting you get it)
berabo [14k?\]: and it was decisive at last
berabo [14k?\]: i thought it was a detail, cause your upper-left is absolutely dead
berabo [14k?\]: but i was wrong
AJR90 [15k\]: you did well in making two eyes for the black group in the middle.  i was trying to prevent that :)
berabo [14k?\]: i thought it was detail too, hehe
berabo [14k?\]: but i needed it
AJR90 [15k\]: c10 was also a good move on your part.  it prevented me trying you make michief there.
AJR90 [15k\]: i was going to try and fill in your outside liberties of the d11 group to try and make another eye.  if that failed, i was going to cut at b11
AJR90 [15k\]: but your playing at c10 prevented that
berabo [14k?\]: they are all happened since
berabo [14k?\]: you made a15 group alive
berabo [14k?\]: i wonder when they got alive
AJR90 [15k\]: i got gained 9 points from that group
AJR90 [15k\]: 6 points of territory and three captures.
berabo [14k?\]: i felt like i lost more than 60 there :)
berabo [14k?\]: i shold've have killed them before you played a12
AJR90 [15k\]: if you'd tried to kill it earlier, i would've concentrated on getting a second eye in the centre, or on attacking your groups.
AJR90 [15k\]: so there's no guarantee you would have been able to kill it.
AJR90 [15k\]: try saving the game file and playing it out for yourself later to see what happens if you try and kill it at different times.]
