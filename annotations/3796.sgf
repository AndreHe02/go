C[Thanks for reviewing the game, any comments will be useful !]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[qq]C[i dont often play this opening (3,3), just decided to give it a try. What kind of opening sequence is it usually used in?

W: At our level, there isn't much to opening strategy. This is a fine opening, you are balancing your corners, not going wholely for stable teritory or outside influence.]
;W[dd];B[fc]C[W: This seems to me to be at the wrong corner, or atleast the wrong side. White is probably happy to stabilize the left side, so he can use D3 towards the bottom edge.]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[nc]C[I thought this was unreasonable by white

W: Yes, white can play on the left or bottom edge and be satisfied.]
;B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]C[I know i should have played R15, and dont know why i didnt.

W: Q15 is fine. It makes sure there is no aji.]
(;B[pe]LB[pe:A][qe:B];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[pf];W[qg]
;B[nd]C[maybe this wasnt the biggest move, K4 was big for white

W: This is very small. White cannot extract O17 since you can just connect below with O18, and if he still does, you can chase him around at leasure.]
;W[jp];B[co];W[cp];B[do]
(;W[gq]LB[cl:B][gq:A]C[W: Yes, white can play more offensive here.]
;B[ck];W[ci];B[ek];W[cm];B[dl];W[cb]C[any idea as to the best move here?]
;B[nq];W[lq];B[pn];W[qk]C[i'm surprised he gave me the corner so esaily]
;B[fe];W[jc];B[jd];W[id]LB[hc:B][kd:A]C[i really didnt know what to do here, i know i should probably extend, but which way?

W: (B) is probably better, force white towards where you are strongest and highest, and secure a base for your weakest group in the process. An alternative is to simply K15, let white have the edge, and seal off the center.]

(;B[kd]LB[hc:B][kd:A]C[lysistrata [12k\]: i know extending is the best
Murugandi [10k\]: hm];W[hc];B[ib];W[hb]
(;B[hd]C[W: This is a mistake, just play K18.];W[ie];B[jb];W[gd]
C[wasnt sure whether or not to play H15, but i think F16 was a bit better

W: F16 clearly better. You have E9 stretching an arm out for the F15 stones, while white has nowhere good to run to. The fight is right.]

(;B[fd]LB[fd:A][he:B];W[he];B[ha]C[This is a bad idea. It gains you nothing, and makes white stronger. Wait with moves like this until F17 is clearly dead, and you are in the end game.]
;W[ga];B[ia];W[gb];B[fg]C[W: White can connect his group with E18 here. This severely reduces your options against this group.]

C[was this too agressive?

W: Nah, this is fine. Just don't lose focus of why you are attacking: to gain strenght and territory for yourself.]
;W[jf];B[lg];W[lf];B[mg];W[mf];B[ng];W[nf];B[og];W[gh]
(;B[fi]LB[eg:B][fi:A]C[F11 was stupid

W: The vital point of white's formation is J13, but it doesn't much matter, as white still has E18. For the same reasons, B13 is just honte, and you might as well play E12 or F12. See continuation for how the fight for life might have happened, had not E18 been a safety valve for white. Without it, white has to be really careful to live.]

;W[cg];B[ch];W[bh];B[dh];W[dc];B[bd];W[bc]C[but in thew end i think i got a few more points here

W: Yes, not a bad result by far. White gained perhaps 20 points territory, but also lost some 10 points on the left, while you gained 10-15. You are still a bit behind tho, and must gain territory in the center.]
;B[pi]C[W: A good start.];W[qi];B[pj];W[qj];B[ol];W[gi];B[gj]
C[W: You're giving white sente over a few points. Play around L6 instead.]

;B[mr];W[lr];B[mo]C[W: This is nothing. O8 captures territory and secures weaknesses.]

(;B[pp]C[W: No reason to respond to this, O8 or E4 instead.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qm]C[W: No reason for this, just play Q7. Save it for later, when you know your liberties don't matter, or when there's a ko involved.]

C[W: Removes your own liberties, for a single point...];W[nl]
;B[op]C[Murugandi [10k\]: ....

W: This is a mistake, you are only threatening 8 points, while you could secure 12-13 points by playing P9]

W: Nah, they are about equally big.]
(;B[fp]LB[lj:B][fp:A];W[fq]C[W: White is handing you a bonus here, play M10! The order of the F4 and F6 moves makes a big difference. With F4 there, you have the threat of capture, and white can't threaten in return.]
