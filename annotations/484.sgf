C[This review was requested by white, so my comments concentrate on his moves, giving explanations for black only if common mistakes appear. General advice for white are given at the end of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd]C[If I were white, I would play the joseki shown in the variation.]

(;W[bb]LB[ch:a][hc:b][ec:c]C[Although this is joseki, I don't like this move. If black simply extends to a (C12), he has an excellent approach move at b (H17) which in turn threatens c (E17). Thus white cannot extend properly at the top since he sooner or later needs to cover his weak spot here.

Probably white remembered this joseki from the Chinese Opening. His move would be good there, since he then had an extra stone near the star point, inhibiting blacks extension.
In this position, however, white cannot hope to attack black.]
;B[ec]C[Black feels white made a mistake but trying to punish it immediatly is definitely bad as the continuation shows.
It is a very common mistake to try to take advantage of the opponents thinness immediately. It is usually much better to cover his own weak spots first and wait for an opportunity to exploit the opponents weakness.]
;W[ed]C[If black now just extends along the side the damage is not too big since the black stone still has some aji.]
;B[db];W[dd];B[eb];W[ce];B[be]C[Why does black add another dead stone? If it doesn't give you an advantage to play here then leave this position and play elsewhere. Maybe the other atari becomes valuable later so don't decide too early.]
;W[cf];B[gc];W[gd]LB[bd:a]C[Maybe a (B16) would be better. You should try to erase the bad potential in your position as thouroughly as possible so that you don't need to fix up later. You can see pros playing this way all the time so it seems to be ok...]
;B[hc];W[dj];B[pj];W[nc]LB[lc:a]C[The lower side seems more important, both black and white can expand their moyo there.
Furthermore, black is offered an opportunity to settle his weak group on the top by playing a pincer at a (M17).]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[kc];W[pe]C[This move gives very much territory away, white seems very confident.]
;B[qe];W[od];B[pc];W[pf];B[qf];W[pg];B[qg];W[ke]C[White still has to prove that this sequence later gives him enough territory.]
;B[ie]C[Hm, this lets white close his gap here or swallow the lone stone.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[id]LB[jp:a]C[Black has an advantage in definite territory but is behind in influence. Accordingly, he should try to build some influence himself as to restrict whites moyo.
A move on a (K4) seems best.];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[hq]
LB[eq:a]C[Big mistake. If white now plays at a (E3), he will get perfect shape and the whole corner as territory.]
;W[jj]C[Seems to be a fine move. However, there are many possibilities to reduce territoy in the middle of the board so a move at tengen (K10) often ends up neutral.]
;B[cj];W[cg]C[Strange shape. A move at a (B13) looks better localy.
Additionally, black gets two moves in a row with his invasion, white should rather attack him more severely.]
;B[dk];W[ck]LB[ej:a]C[White wants to attack black but this move rather helps black to make shape. Maybe just extending to a (E10) is better?]
;B[ej];W[di];B[cl];W[bk];B[bl]C[Black is too greedy. He should just run into the middle, leaving further reduction for later.]
;W[dl];B[ek];W[bj];B[gl];W[dm];B[il];W[hk];B[hl];W[kl];B[ei]
;W[dh];B[hn];W[pn]C[A lower approach at a (R6) seems better since then black cannot easily take territory on the right side. With the still vulnerable black group on the left white need not be overly cautious.]
;B[qo];W[op];B[oq];W[po];B[qq];W[np];B[nq];W[lp]LB[cq:a]C[White again gives much territory without getting adequate compensation. If black now enters at a (C3), where is white's territory going to be?]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[mq];W[ko];B[qn];W[pm];B[qm];W[qh];B[ph];W[pi]
;B[oh];W[oi];B[qi];W[qj];B[rh];W[qk];B[pl];W[nm];B[ql];W[fl]
;B[gk];W[fk];B[gj];W[fj]C[All in all white played well but he should not give away too much territory for thickness. Although thickness is very nice to play with, you need to be careful that it works to its fullest. Thus you should double check if the direction you build your wall to is as valuable as the secure territory you give to your opponent.
Generally speaking, thickness in the opening is all right but you should not build walls later on only because they are walls, this may leave you with not enough territory.]

(;W[eb];B[ci]C[Both black's and white's positions are solid now and white has sente.]
