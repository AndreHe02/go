C[
Hello there, my name is Johan Meijerink, I'm from the beautifull country called Holland :) I play Go for almost 11 months now, and my strength is around 3k.. I played this game against a 1d* on IGS

Basically I want to ask the reviewer if he can point out any big mistakes in this game that were made by me (playing with black)

please have fun reviewing the game!

Greets Johan

reid: Hello Johan.
I'll see what I can do for you here.
3k in less than a year is very good - it took me quite a few years to get there.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[ce]C[this seems agressive, but I have to tell you, I'm a quite agressive player, as you will notice many times in this game :)

reid: OK, aggression is good.  But it must be tempered with good sense too.

In go, as in life, you can win more fights if you choose your fights carefully.  In go, that means you want to fight where you have an advantage.  Usually, that means where you have a numerical superiority (or at least parity) of stones.

This fight you have chosen is in an area where white already has a move - you are a move behind.  So you should expect to come out of this fight with a slight disadvantage.

That's why pros usually grab the corners first.  

Don't worry, you'll have plenty of chances to pick fights later.  And after more stones are down, you'll have a better idea of *which* corner is the best one strategically.  Now it's too soon to know.]
;W[dh];B[ee]C[is this the best response for black ? to simply jump out ?

reid:  Jump out is OK, but this particular jump (one space) in response to the wide-high pincer at D12 is not good.  The reason?  Well, it's because...]
;W[fd]LB[cc:E][ic:H][dd:G][ed:B][fe:A][df:F][ef:C][eg:D]C[reid: white's response at F16 is too good.

So black should jump two spaces to A instead.  Other alternatives are B-G, and a pincer around H.]
;B[cc]LB[dd:A]C[reid: If white responds at A, black has a hard choice to make.]
;W[cb];B[bb]LB[cd:B][dd:A]C[reid:  Hmm, now white is going to get A for free (after the atari at B).]
;W[cd];B[bc];W[dd];B[bd];W[db]LB[de:A]C[reid: Ah!  White missed a chance here!

White should push through at A!  For black to capture C18 with D18 (in gote) is much too small this early in the game, so that means it's too small for white to defend.

If white pushes through at A, he cuts off D15 (making it a wasted move), and because of D12, he should be able to seal black into the corner.  Black would get only about 10 points (with no hope for future expansion) in the corner, while the white thickness would be useful for the rest of the game.]
;B[de]C[reid: Of course - black must punish white's oversight.  Now D12 looks a bit odd.]
;W[fe];B[ch]LB[eg:A]C[reid: Basic go strategy: divide and conquer.  Black should keep white split (and maintain his own path to the outside) by playing at A instead.

I have a phrase I like to use when I see a move like C12 (in relation to D12): "You touch me, you help me".  What that means is that white's D12 stone is all by itself - very weak, no friends.  By touching it this way, you give white a chance to strengthen that stone.

Specifically, C12 is already down to three liberties.  When white hanes, it will only have two - one move away from atari!

So when you see a weak stone that you want to attack later, try not to play too close to it.  Better to attack it from a distance.

Instead of grovelling for life with C12, black should start the splitting attack at A.  It's a good long-range plan - it keeps black safe and white seperated.]
;W[ci];B[cg];W[di]LB[eg:A]C[in my eyes that black group is alive, so I decided to play somewhere else

reid: Yes, it's alive, but black can't really consider this a success.  There are 9 black stones here, and about 10 points.  That's only one point per stone.  The 10 white stones have a lot more potential.  The only thing that saves it from being a complete disaster is that black can still get out with A]
;B[ic]LB[lc:B][nc:A]C[well.. I played this one.. perhaps a bit too positive thinking on my side, that he would respond defensively at G17

reid: Yes, go would be so easy if only our opponent would play as we expect him to,

Alas, his job is to make our life miserable.  So we need to expect him to play the move we least want to see him play.

J17 is much too close to white's thickness.  Safer would be to prevent white from an easy combination attack and extension by pre-empting with A.  Then if white tries to build up the top side with B, black can easily invade (because the upper-right corner is already strong).]
;W[kc]C[reid: Natural response.];B[ed]LB[fb:A][fc:B][je:C]C[reid: Have you heard the term "aji-keshi"?  It's an extremely important concept, and you are at the level where you need to be sensitive to it.

I'm sure you know "aji" - the "taste" that's inherent in a position.  Aji-keshi means literally "erasing the aji".

This situation is currently very fluid.  There are many ways it could go, but it's hard to know what's going to be best.  For example, black might need to play at A later to get some eye space.  But after black forces with E17 and white answers at B, black A is no longer possible.

So how do you recognize aji-keshi so you can avoid it?  The trick is that every single move should be absolutely urgent.  There is no time for extra moves.

Many players will play a move simply because it's sente.  That's a sure way to commit aji-keshi.  Better is to learn to appreciate the urgency of different moves.

Simply jumping out to C is better here.];W[fc];B[ec];W[eb];B[gb]
C[reid: Yes, G18 is forcing, but it would be better to make this move without the previous two moves.  Even better to make none of the previous three moves.]
;W[fb]C[reid:  These last few exchanges have done serious damage to the J17 stone.]
;B[ie];W[ke];B[mc]LB[fg:A]C[reid:  Does black have time to do this?  I think black would do better to split and attack with something like A.]
;W[fg]C[reid:  White gets the critical point and now the white stones are are all connected and much stronger.

Who is attacking whom?];B[kb]C[reid: black decides to meekly connect.  White can consider this a victory.]
;W[jd]C[reid: Ouch.  This hurts.];B[jc];W[id];B[hd];W[he];B[ge]
;W[hf];B[gd];W[gf];B[ef]LB[hc:B][ff:A]C[precious mistake.. would be better to play at G17 here ?

reid: No.  It's a not mistake because you lose three stones at H16, but because white can ignore it.  A and B are miai for white.

This early in the game, saving six points in gote is just too small.  That's endgame stuff.  But losing sente is serious.]
;W[hc]LB[do:A]C[now white takes my stones there :/
which slightly demotivated me in the beginning of the game, and trust me, I was already nervous playing a 1d* in an even game.. (komi is only 0.5 though)

reid: Be glad you weren't playing me :-) I would take a slightly larger move, like A perhaps.

Black should be grateful that white gives him sente here.];B[qp]
LB[co:A][cp:B]C[no need to play there further.. playing in an empty corner looked better to me

reid:  Yes, but since white has a large investment in the center strength that is aimed at the lower left corner, the other corner is bigger.  A or B looks better.]
;W[op];B[mq];W[no]C[reid: this joseki works well for white in combination with his central influence.]
;B[qn]LB[qm:B][pn:A][dp:D][ip:C]C[reid:  Is this joseki?  A or B looks better.  but then, since the lower left corner looks like the important area, something like C or even D would be even better.]
;W[lp];B[dq]LB[do:A][cp:B]C[reid:  Good idea.  Black needs to do something a bit drastic.  

However, the natural attack direction on this stone is from A which makes white's influence ideal.  B instead of D3 would help to make white's life more difficult.]
;W[do];B[im]C[this move.. I really can't describe how I felt, I just saw white centre territory getting bigger and bigger and played J7 to prevent/reduce it

reid: Hmmm, sounds like the feeling might have been "desperation", perhaps?  That's often a clue that you're about to do something dangerous :-)

Black has about ten points in the upper left, maybe ten on the lower right, and perhaps 15 in the upper right.

White has six solid points in the center and that strong wall.  One rule of thumb for strong walls is to count two points as you traverse the wall - perhaps 18 or 20 points in this case.

So black is ahead on territory, but he has to make sure that center wall doesn't get out of control.

After J7, black has 3 stones floating around, with almost no relationship to any other black stones on the board.  That's a bit like dropping three foot soldiers randomly behind enemy lines and expecting them to win the war with no help.

Go is all about making your stones work together to achieve a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts.

If I were white, I would expect to be able to win just by harrasing these three seperated stones.]
;W[fp]C[reid: Good - keep the black stones isolated.];B[ip]
;W[lq];B[fq];W[gp]C[reid:  If white hanes instead, black cross-cuts and white will have trouble holding everything together.]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[gq];W[dp]LB[hl:C][gn:B][in:E][io:D][hp:F][cq:A]
[hq:G]C[reid: now it's white's turn to commit aji-keshi.  Better to just leave this.  If white wants the corner, he should play directly at A.

For white's shape, he should play at B threatening to enlarge his moyo with C.  Black would have to worry about D or E.  If black tenukis after white B, white can play G and black cannot cut at F.

Alternatively, white can cut off one stone with F, black G, white D.  But it could be difficult to kill that one stone cleanly, so this is a bit riskier.]
;B[eq];W[hq]C[reid: But white wants more!   This looks dangerous.]
;B[hp];W[iq];B[jq];W[jr];B[ho]LB[gm:C][gn:B][hn:A][kr:D]C[reid: Urg: bad shape.  The key point is A.  If white B, C is still sente.  If white answers with C instead, there is a lot of aji for black to use later.  In any case, black still has time to play D.]
;W[gn]C[reid: white gets the key shape point.];B[kr]C[reid: But black gets to capture some critical stones.]
;W[kq];B[jp];W[lr];B[ir];W[ks];B[hr]LB[hl:A]C[I was very satisfied with this position for black

reid:  Hmm, would you still be satisfied if white played at A next?]
;W[bi]LB[bh:C][bj:B][hl:A][il:D]C[now this move.. if I ignored it, would black have died ?
I answered white's move just to be sure of life..

reid: So your answer was "yes, white can kill".

Is that the right answer?  This is local enough that it's a fairly straightforward life and death problem.  I'm afraid I have to leave this as an exercise for the student :-)

But from white's point of view, is this even the right place to play?  Looks to me like white should play at A.  If black B11, white B and black C, white gets sente again to play D!]
;B[dg];W[ql]LB[af:A][bh:B][ai:C]C[reid: Ok, if you're going to take gote here, you should take the biggest gote you can find.  D13 only saves the D14 point.  White can still monkey jump in to A later.

If instead black takes B, he will probably get C, etc. later (in sente).  So B is worth about 6 or 7 points compared to D13 being worth one, maybe two.]
;B[fm]C[reid: Woah!  Black is asking for trouble now.];W[gm]
;B[fl];W[gl];B[fk];W[gk];B[cl]C[reid: and it looks like he found it (trouble, that is).
This is another fight where black is at a disadvantage.  He needs help from white (in the way of blunders).]
;W[cn]LB[dl:B][dm:A][fn:C]C[reid:  This move is slow for white.  It looks a bit better if he peeps at A first, and then after black B, just connect at C.  Now the burden is on black to survive.  And even if black does survive, white will probably get enough profit from the attack that he still has a good game.]
;B[gj];W[fj];B[fn];W[fo];B[go];W[ek]LB[fi:C][gi:B][hj:A]C[reid: And here is that help.  If instead white A, black B, white C, white will have no problems.

White was too eager to kill the four stones here.  Instead, he should just be patient and allow them to wither and die.]
;B[ej];W[fi];B[dk];W[dm];B[dl]C[reid: This exchange (D7 for D8) is aji-keshi.  If white doesn't make this trade, it might be easier to use the aji for a connection underneath later.]
;W[bm]LB[hj:B][ik:A]C[B7 ? wasted move perhaps ? now I can use my stone on G10 to kill the white group on G8

reid: Perhaps, but apparently white is worried about living here.  But after B7, we can see that C6 isn't really doing anything.  It would be better placed at A or B]
;B[hj]C[like this

reid: Yes, this is a disaster for white.  Black got very lucky.]
;W[il]C[reid: By struggling to escape, white makes matters worse.  This is another example of aji-keshi.]
;B[ik];W[hl]C[white's answer was this.. could he escape ?];B[jl]
C[reid: No, no way out now.  Looks like a misread by white.]
;W[jk];B[hm];W[kl];B[jm];W[ij];B[hk];W[hi];B[hn]C[reid: A rather extreme example of aji-keshi by white.]
;W[jj];B[pr]C[Q2.. just like the black group in the left top corner, I wanted to be sure of life there]
;W[qd]C[so I wasn't thinking that white could invade my territory there..]
;B[pe]C[I decided to give up the corner here, and reduce white's center territory with this]
;W[qc];B[qe];W[ob];B[lc];W[kd];B[hb];W[gc];B[nb]LB[oc:A]C[reid:  Black can join his groups together with A instead.  White gets more corner territory, but black could play freely in the center and right side.]
;W[oc]C[reid: White naturally splits the black groups.  Again. this is basic strategy.]
;B[me]LB[ne:A][qi:B]C[reid: The black group at the top is already alive, but the Q15 group is not.  Better to play A or B.  It makes more sense to help the weak group instead of the strong group.]
;W[nc];B[mb];W[ne];B[mf]LB[oe:B][nf:A][of:C]C[reid: What is black's priority here?

I think it ought to be making sure the Q15 stones stay alive.  The top group is already alive, so black doesn't need to worry about them.

Black should hane at A (expecting white B, black C).  Yes, there is a cut left at N14, but the cut is not worth anything if both sides are alive.]
;W[nf];B[qh];W[qj]C[looks really troublesome for black now...

reid: Yes.  Mostly because O14 is a nice spot for white.];B[pi]
LB[oh:A]C[is this move ok ?

reid: You usually make the diagonal move to strongly attack S10, like when S8 is a black stone.  Here it's not easy to attack the white stones, so I think A would be more normal.]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[or];B[pp]LB[qr:A][ns:C][os:B][ps:D]C[reid:  It may seem natural to atari here, but it's better to simply connect at A.  Later, black has the hane at B.  After white C, black D, white needs another move.  But only if white P3 isn't there already.  Black will probably get Q4 after the B-D sequence anyway..]
;W[oq];B[pl]C[reid: white is too strong after the one point extension (R8/R10).  And black is still too weak with the R12 group.  Black would do better to simply connect at R2.]
;W[pk];B[pm];W[ok]C[reid: Ouch:  severe hurt to R12.];B[ni]
;W[re]LB[rg:A]C[Aji-keshi for white.  Later, if white manages to enclose the black group, he might find A more interesting.]
;B[rf];W[sd]C[reid: Not only is it aji-keshi, but it's gote.]
;B[ri];W[pg]C[reid: White strikes at a key eye-point.];B[qg]
;W[pf]C[reid:  Black should probably think seriously about giving up three stones here.  Keeping them could be costly.]
;B[of]C[reid: Eh?];W[og]C[reid: is P14 for P13 a good exchange?

P13 hurts black's eye space considerably.];B[qf];W[mg];B[mk]
;W[nl];B[ml];W[nm];B[li];W[mh];B[nj];W[mi];B[lm]LB[mm:A]C[phew.... I was very relieved here that I connected my weak weak group with a strong one, could white have done better to interrupt and capture it ?

reid: You mean like with A instead of N11?  It's a risky strategy for white.  It stakes the game on white's ability to kill the black group - not very clear (there is a lot of aji around for black).  White would do that if he thought he was behind.]
;W[kk]LB[lj:A][nk:B]C[reid: white should play at A instead of L9.  Now he needs another move to seal his center territory (B is sente for black).]
;B[ln];W[mm];B[ll];W[lf];B[gi];W[hh]LB[gh:A][ii:B][ji:C][lj:D]
C[reid:  Looks like white should play A here.  If black B, white connects with H12.  White can answer black C with D, so there's no problem.  And of course, white A keeps the D11 stones out of danger.]
;B[bl]LB[bp:A]C[necessary move.. very big I would say

reid: But it's the wrong side!  If black plays A instead, he'll get a pretty good size corner in sente while white gets a couple of points on the side.

Ah, but black is expecting to kill the C11 stones.  Did you read out all the possibilities?  If you did, then the life and death problem in the upper left corner must be trivial :-)]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[bq];B[br];W[bo]C[reid: White gets about 7 points and black gets maybe one (C1).  If black had played B4 instead of B8, black would get about 4 or five points and white would get three or four.  So B8 is about an eight point loss.]
;B[eh]LB[fh:G][ak:B][bk:D][al:A][el:F][am:C][em:E]C[same as this one.. I was lucky that I ended in sente and was able to play E12

reid:  Yes, black is lucky again.  What about white B5?  It looks like white could save both parts by playing A-E instead of B5.  Then white can play G after black connects. 

If white is unsure of this sequence, he can try replacing C with A6 for better eye shape and the threat to make a ko with D.

Black needs to consider all this before playing B8.];W[fh];B[ei]
;W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[bk];W[qr];B[rr];W[ps];B[rm];W[rs];B[rk]
;W[qk];B[sq];W[rl];B[ro];W[lj];B[mo];W[mp];B[nd];W[od];B[md]
;W[oe]C[reid: Despite some serious loses on white's part, it's still a pretty close game.  So that means black was pretty far behind in the early game.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[on];W[lo];B[mn];W[nn];B[ko];W[rj];B[qi];W[sm]
;B[sn];W[sl];B[oo];W[qm];B[aq];W[ap];B[en]C[another mistake, like in the beginning of the game

reid: Yes, not much significance to this move.];W[ar];B[ia]
C[and this is yet again another "sure to be safe move"

reid: Hmm, the hane at C19 is just one example of a bigger move.

If you must play here, it is better to simply connect at J18.   After J19, you still cannot play at F19 because white can throw-in at G19.]
;W[rn];B[so];W[bs];B[ds];W[ba];B[ab]C[reid: Since black answered, this is three points in sente for white (which means black C19 would have been three points reverse sente).]
;W[sr]C[reid: Strange move for white.];B[ss];W[jb];B[ib];W[sr]
;B[rq];W[km];B[kn];W[em];B[dn];W[cm];B[el];W[ga];B[sf];W[na]
;B[la]C[reid: Black loses a point here.  He has to take at K19 eventually, so black N19 is one point bigger (he never needs M19).]

in overall I think my midgame and yose are still pretty weak, do you agree ? and my opening was ok I guess..

reid:  Well, by definition, just about everything about most amateur games is weak, sorry to say.  But that just means we've got lots of opportunities to improve!

My analysis here covers a lot of ground - probably more than you'll be able to absorb immediately.  I would suggest that you go over it now and try to work on a few key points.  Then about three or four months from now, look at it again and see how you're doing.  And once more in another three to four months.

If you can harness your aggression, learn to pick your fights carefully, avoid aji-keshi, and work on whole-board strategy, you'll be able to continue your rapid improvement.

Good luck.])
