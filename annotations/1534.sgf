C[Hello thanx for taking the time to review my game, i would appreciate it if u point out ne errors i make and suggest variationbs of how it should be played out..Thank u

Hi, I'm Darrell.  I'm about 6 kyu AGA.

General comments:

1.  Generally speed games are not what you want to submit for review.  You and your opponent make too many foolish moves because of the clock and the reviewer doesn't know how to review as he explains things you already know.

2.  The main character of the game after the opening is that your opponent leaves cutting points everywhere and you cut him apart and kill pieces.  You did a good job of this.  However, this does not leave much to comment on, so most of my comments are early in the game.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.];B[pd]C[smu [18k\]: hi]
;W[pp];B[dq];W[dc];B[qf]LB[co:a][do:b][ce:c][de:d]TR[pd]C[This move is not very good.  Because your marked stone is on the 4-4 point - a symetrical point, it is not important to play another stone near it yet.  Much better would be to play any of a-d.]
;W[do];B[fp]C[good];W[dj]TR[do]LB[jq:a][jd:b][pj:c]C[White's response is not normal and leaves the marked stone weak.  Something to look at later.  For now, the big open areas are marked.  First play in any of these areas will be very helpful.  'a' and 'b' are best because they work with two of the other 4 stones you have already played to sketch out a nice large territory.

Either 'a' or 'b' also make you stronger in preparation for possibly making some kind of invasion on the left side of the board.]
;B[ce]C[This move says "I'm going to take all of your territory away."  It is an invasion of sorts.  You have dropped a stone into the very strongest part of white's formation where you can fight at your biggest disadvantage.  

Rather than fighting to deprive your opponent, why not just take a larger territory youself and make him fight to try to reduce yours.  Make the fight come to where you are strong and have the advantage.]
;W[de]
(;B[cd]C[This isn't bad but could be better.  See variation 2 for a joseki (standard line of play) for this situation.]
;W[dd];B[cg];W[hc];B[jd];W[ie];B[jq]LB[je:a]C[Maybe i should've played at N17 instead of extending at the bottom to secure the top first?

Definately you need to play at the top.  'a' would work.];W[md]
;B[je];W[kc];B[me]LB[jc:a]C[Keep white separated.  Very important.]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[jf]LB[jc:a]C[White should play here.];B[ke]LB[nq:a]
[qn:b][en:c][le:d][ld:e]C[This is an empty triangle.  It is bad shape.  You should avoid making this shape.

'd' or even 'e' would be better.  Best of all would be to stop fighting up here for now.  You have let white extend all the way across the top and get reasonably stable.  Your stones are floating without a base and without any potential at all to make eyes.  Just let them go for now.

'a' and 'b' look good.  'a' is better.  Attacks corner and extends along the bottom.  You can then follow up with 'c' and the bottom is looking huge for black.

'd' followed by 'e' would be interesting too.

'd' followed by 'e' looks good too.]
(;W[ne]C[White should not be trying to kill.  All he has to do is make himself strong and black will have a burden keeping these stones alive.  See variation]
