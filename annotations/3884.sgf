;B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[cj];W[cm];B[oq];W[qf];B[qj]C[what do you think about this move? Good or not? maybe A or something else is better?

NM: Sorry, can't see "A". But this

move is fine - as is all the game up to now.];W[rd]C[NM: Not good; W will live but too cramped. Better to jump straight into the corner at R17.]
;B[qc];W[rc]C[NM: Not good. R12 would be better.];B[mc]C[and what about this move?



NM: It's OK. It doesn't really reinforce the two corner stones very effectively - for example it leaves the weakness at P17 - but it looks out into fine open territory. However, ultimately B isn't going to do very much there, becayse of W's strong low stone at F17. Therefore my inclination would have been something like Q13, followed, if W replies Q14, by O13 - trying to sketch out a big moyo. But it's very much a matter of style.]
;W[kc]C[NM: Excellent answer!];B[pf];W[qg];B[pg]C[NM: Well, this way you end up getting your moyo. Just a shame you've let W get the lovely point at L17.]
;W[qb];B[pb]C[NM: I don't believe this is the biggest point on the board. My first choice would be R12, followd by K4.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[rb]C[NM: Not necessary, so not good.];B[jp]C[NM: Good!]
;W[hp];B[dq]C[is this invasion right?



NM: Nothing wrong with this, or C3. But there are other possibilities - I'm tempted by K6. And J17 could be quite entertaining.]
;W[ep];B[eq]C[NM: No! You must take the corner, having invaded like this. This way you may well end up pushing W into your moyo, which is exactly what you don't want.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[bq];B[fq];W[fp];B[gq];W[hq];B[hr];W[ir];B[gr]
;W[iq];B[gp];W[go];B[ho]C[NM: While this cut gives you an interesting attack, it drives W into your moyo.]
;W[io];B[hn];W[ip];B[br];W[co];B[jq]C[NM: Terrible! Just makes this single stone heavier, and only gives it 1 more liberty. The moves here are J6 or G7.]
;W[in];B[hm];W[kn];B[lp]C[now i decide to protect my territory



NM: No, you should cut at F5. The ladder works for you, and there are no very serious ladder-breakers. After that all your stones are alive, and you can continue the attack. Moreover this doesn't actually give you territory.]
;W[mn];B[pm]C[NM: Now THAT is protecting territory. It's big, but it's gote and now you're the player in the bottom left with a weak group.]
;W[on];B[pn];W[np];B[mq]C[NM: O3 better];W[nq];B[nr];W[op];B[pq]
;W[mp];B[lr];W[fn];B[ej]C[NM: Good. Keep it to just 1 weak group and you may yet win.]
;W[fk];B[hk];W[fj];B[fm];W[em];B[fl];W[el];B[hi]C[NM: If you're going to play F7 then you must finish either with G6 or by cutting at E9. Now you've just reinforced W.]
;W[ek];B[ei];W[fi];B[hg];W[gh];B[hh]C[NM: OK, you sohuld be out of trouble now. But your L group looks a bit thin, and the last 8 moves have given you no terrtory.]
;W[le]C[NM: Right direction, but I think L15 would have been better. Or even Q12.]
;B[lg]C[NM: A humiliating move to have to make, which gains no territory.]
;W[id];B[he];W[hd];B[ed];W[ec];B[ld];W[kd];B[me];W[lf];B[mf]
;W[kg];B[kf];W[ke];B[kh];W[jf];B[ki];W[nl]C[NM: Right direction, but should be bolder, such as O9 or N10.]
;B[nj];W[lk];B[lj];W[qi]C[NM: Big, but W is neglecting the absolute need to protect his big group in the bottom centre. If he does that the game is reasonably close.]

NM: I've commented on the individual points. I think that your main weakness is the classic one of not seeing where big territory can be made by one side or the other.]
