AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[I'm around 15K ; and in this game (on kgs) I play black. There were interesting moments in the game evolution, and I still have some questions about it (I made comments for most of my stones).

buckyyowza: comments by buckyyowza, 4k* on IGS (i think i was 1k on kgs last time i played there).  though i am no expert on go, i hope you find my comments of use ;-)]
;W[nc];B[oc]C[I attack the white stone];W[nd];B[pf]C[and then protect the corner]
;W[fc];B[lc]TR[nc][nd]LB[hc:A]C[I attack the two white stones by cutting them from their life base, in order to stabilize my own stones

buckyyowza: the white stones (around o17) are already crowded and aimed at the center.  you've taken away a considerable amount of eye space on the upper side, but haven't dealt with f17, a sente move.  to be sure to keep white's stones cut and to stay solid on both sides of the o17 group, why not try a pincer at a (h17).

though not settled, the simple fact that white is giving you 8 stones is enough to trust that the o17 stones will live.  better to think of letting them live small than to think of attacking and killing ;-)]
;W[df];B[ee]LB[cc:A]C[I leave the corner to white, and flee toward the center

buckyyowza: a (c17) is also a good move here.  the idea is to create two weak groups (f17 and d14) by cutting.  white can only protect one at a time.]
;W[cc];B[ge]TR[fc][jd]LB[dc:A][cd:B]C[with this stone, I link my group to the K16 stone, and attack the F17 white stone

buckyyowza:  this thinking is flawed. a (d17) and b (c16) are now miai, meaning that white has a dynamic corner base that can be used to break in to bigger areas and start a large scale attack.  white will almost certainly play d17 now, and if black doesn't play c16 he will be left with some scattered stones hanging in the center near solid white territory. see var.]

(;W[dc];B[ch]TR[df]LB[cd:A]C[I now attack the white isolated D14 stone

buckyyowza: to attack, play at a (c16) to cut d14 from the strong shape around c17. see var for the trouble with playing c12.]

;W[bd]
(;B[de]TR[dd][de][ee]C[menacing a squeeze, in order to rainforce my stones

buckyyowza: you are thinking ok, but don't forget to count your liberties and avoid bad shape.  the marked stones have only three liberties and form an empty triangle. see var on w15 for another idea]
;W[cf];B[mf]TR[nc][nd]LB[nq:A][dn:B][fq:C]C[I attack the two white stones with this boshi

buckyyowza: you are becoming over concentrated here.  remember that you are taking 8 stones.  this means that white will be hard to kill, best to seal as much territory as you can before white takes it all :-)  if you are eager to fight, just be patient, white will give you plenty of opportunity for battle soon enough.  why not try a boring moyo building move like a (o3), b (d6), or c (f3).]
;W[nq];B[oq]C[I attack the white stone, looking for a strong moyo on the rigth side]
;W[np];B[pn]TR[np]LB[ef:A]C[forming the moyo

buckyyowza: white gives you too much here, but does have a nice center game starting to take shape.  w can now play at a (e14) in sente (atari on e15 stones) and make some nice thickness for the marked stone to play off of.]
;W[kq];B[jq]C[I try to limit white's presence on the bottom

buckyyowza: good play.  white is still not making sound decisions (making good shape in bad places ;-)]

;W[gp];B[eq]TR[gp][fq][jp][jq]C[I try to put white's stones in danger (I think it were a mistake for white to take such a fragile position)

buckyyowza: never consider hane to be fragile :-) white is attacking k4 stones now, and building more influence into the center.  your play is appropriate (joseki) nonetheless.]

buckyyowza: before you peep, think "am i forcing my opponent to improve his shape?" or more importantly "can i just cut?"  in this case, just cut instead of forcing your opponent to make a strong thick shape. see var on w31]

buckyyowza: i would play a (r7). the center is neutral, but the right side is black's biggest asset.  the lower right is more important because of the potential for white play at b (r3).  you are thinking too much of killing white; with an 8 stone handicap, you are best to let white live small.]

   White = 51 territory + 27 captures + 0.5 komi = 78.5
   Black = 68 territory + 30 captures = 98
Black wins by 19.5.

buckyyowza: interesting game ;-)  white made many large mistakes, which was your saving grace in this game. your tactical reading is more advanced than white was ready to deal with, but the closeness of the final score considering  the high handicap and number of large mistakes by white indicates that you need to consider more the value of your moves.  white made two mistakes worth more than 20 points for you, one less and it is white's game.

a couple places you might have considered the score before you play:

1) at b8 and again at b26, you "leave the corner to white".  why?  such a large corner should be split at least.  it is worth 40 points left alone, and more to white that he gets such an easy base.
2) at b18, you play more thickness in an already thick center, when you could have used sente to take large points elsewhere.
2) at b74, you complicate the neutral center instead of protect your large right side.

especially in handicap play, take what points you can.  remember some rules of thumb: a) the corner is biggest and easiest to protect, followed by the side, and the center is hardest to protect and worth the least. b) when you are in sente, either keep it or take big points... if you are in gote, get sente with as little loss as possible. c) never start a fight unless you are losing, never fight over small points when there are large points at hand.  i suppose all these rules of thumb can be summed up in one: count! ;-)
