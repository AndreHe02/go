C[Hi
I was black in this game.I have reviewed it by myself and have some question.Please answer my questions and give some commensts.

Thanks

Hello,
I'm Manueler, I'll be your reviewer today. 
Let's begin...];B[pc];W[pp];B[dd];W[pe];B[dp];W[nd]
(;B[qd]C[I don't like this move much, I prefer the variation.]
;W[qe];B[nc];W[mc]
(;B[oc]C[See variation and comment.];W[md];B[nq];W[pn];B[jp]
;W[mo];B[pr]TR[pr]C[This move almost asks the split attack at circle. In mi case I would play at circle and see what else can happen.]
;W[oj];B[cj]TR[oj]C[Greedy for white. Even amidst his zone of control this 5th row stone is floating in the stratosphere.]
;W[fc];B[hc]TR[hc]C[This move looks a little stubborn. White is thick on N16-17, ''Don't get close to thickness'']
;W[jc];B[fd];W[dc]C[Variation 1 is my original game. I try to build influence on line 16 but lost h17.Is the variation 2 better?

-----------

Totally, as different as heaven and hell. In the game it was you who ended up woth cutting points, in the variation it was your opponent.]

(;B[cc];W[ed];B[ee];W[ec];B[ce];W[gd];B[fe];W[gc];B[re]C[This move is bad. It IS sente, but white stands to win a lot more terriotry on the side than you on the corner.]
;W[rf];B[rd];W[qg]TR[qj][ql][qo]C[And besides, now that you helped white in closing is territory and invasion on triangle is ndoable anymore.]
;B[qq];W[qp]
(;B[fj]TR[fj]C[This move is slow, it's too close to your own position. In the left side both players want to play at circle first, see var.]
;W[do];B[cp]C[c4 and c5, which is better at this move?

-------

This one is ok, c5 gives white the chance to make sabaki so this one looks better to me.]
;W[ep];B[eq]C[This is the mistake, by all means, when you are strong locally as you are here cut white and watch him suffer.]
;W[fp];B[fq];W[gp];B[gq];W[co];B[bo]C[I think E5 will be better.]
;W[en];B[io]C[?
H4 is the key here.  ''Connect thy stones''];W[hp];B[hq];W[bn]
;B[bp];W[lq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[jq];B[iq];W[kp];B[jo]C[Bad shape, white should cut inmediately at j4. Connecting yourself at j4 to come back and attack white on the left is the  correct follow up.]
;W[kn];B[im];W[gm];B[km];W[jn];B[in];W[ko];B[jm];W[lm];B[jk]
C[To close, to extend take the number of stones on the wall +1. So 3 stones in your wall +1=4 ie K 11]
;W[ll];B[rn]C[This move here...........
( thinking)..............
I hope that you know that s-6 can be cut by simply going descending to t5, but I think that perhaps you played this to create some aji aroun r10 is white descended on t5.]
;W[qo];B[so];W[rm];B[lk];W[mk];B[lj];W[mj];B[li];W[gk];B[gj]
;W[hj];B[hi];W[hk];B[he];W[hd]
(;B[ie]C[The correct move is J-14, see var,];W[ge];B[gf];W[ij]
;B[jj]C[I thought I did not play well from this move(move 95) to move 101,but I don't know which move is bad.Please spot it.

Already spotted, J15 instead of J14 seems to be the culprit here. As then you cannot be cut as you were in the game.]
;W[ii];B[ji];W[hh];B[gh];W[gi];B[fi];W[jh];B[kh];W[gg];B[fh]
;W[hf];B[if];W[ff];B[ef];W[ig];B[kf];W[jg];B[kg];W[jf];B[ke]
;W[je];B[mh]C[Is o14 better?

You can definitely extend further into white's territory. O 14 is nice as you can try to cut white's n16-17 stones and see what happens then.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[ck];B[bj];W[dj];B[di];W[dk];B[bm];W[an];B[bk]
;W[cm];B[bl];W[cl];B[mf]C[Too small. T8 is bigger.

As a general move in the endgame the edges are much more bigger than the center]

;W[oq];B[or];W[np];B[mq];W[mp];B[ns]C[Useless move, i think.

Well, I think that it's actually necessary, if white tries hadr enoughhe can kill, I think.  See var. 

Note: Black seems alive, but on the heat of the game I might have played as you did to put my mind to rest]

Or then again, black can sacrifice h17 and be happy with his wall. Actually, now that I see it 10C is on the third line, so with e-10 open black will have to be prepared to answer passively and then counter attack on white's invading stone.]
