C[ lakeland 23k*: hello there
 michao 25k*: Hello !

I have played michao half a dozen times and each time he has won convincingly, yet I can beat other people who beat him.  Presumably I have some stumbling block that his playing style brings out.  The closest game we have had was him winning by 12, most games he wins by around 50.]

C[I thought P3 was supposed to be better?

phi: P4 is a common kakari against the 3-4 point.]
(;W[pn]LB[oq:A][pn:B]C[ michao 25k*: You got a better rating eh ?

I've been playing 3 points in a row a lot lately because I've been finding it makes playing easy.  This move was to set that up.

phi: sometimes P3 (A) is seen instead of B (see variation).]
;B[pj]C[But not any more...];W[ec];B[dc];W[ed];B[df]C[ lakeland 23k*: Yes, I can beat most 25 and 24k players, but I don't think I've ever beaten you]

 michao 25k*: Yes, it's strange ...];B[qd]

Again, I think the side was worth more than the corner?

;B[on];W[fq]C[I decided F3 over C7 because of black's wall in the distance.
I considered O3 to weaken him but decided to save that for later

phi good idea: J3 (making a base) and D2 (slip into the corner) are miai.
Attention: the cut at O3 leads to a ladder. The ladder ends at D14 which is black. So this (O3) is not very threatening.]
;B[dn];W[cq]C[I'm not that good at this joseki

phi: i prefer J3 (making a base.) or D2.
But this move is not that bad. It is also seen in handicap plays.  The Variation shows a common Joseki.]

;W[ds];B[es];W[br];B[eq]
(;W[fp]C[I was feeling quite vulnerable, maybe J3 would have been better?

phi: yes: white has no base. If black plays around J3, white must run to the center and makes no teritory.]
;B[jp]C[phi: good: black makes territory and attacks the two white weak stones.]

(;W[nq]C[phi: this results in a ladder which white can not win (D14 is black!)
White makes better a base with J3.]

I would play one of the marked positions.
A, E: enlarge the top moio.
B try to split the two black groups.
C enlarge the white group, while attacking the black group.
D: try to make a base for the white stones.];B[pm];W[qn];B[hk]
;W[lj]C[phi: this move tries to kill the black moio around M8. But a) it is very loose and b) it does not make secure territory.]
;B[hj]
(;W[fi]TR[hj][hk]C[phi: white could separate the two marked stones by playing H8 (see variation).
White has still no base. J3 is still good.
If this move (F11) tries to connect the loose group to the top, it is a good idea. The loose group has no live yet.]

Black wins by 56.5.

phi: interesting game. White could play a bit more agressive and give up more single stones (move 180). You (white) don't have to react on each atari-play (eg. move 48).
White has 4 groups while black has just 1 single big group. White should also learn how to connect and how to cut gruops. With small groups you allways have to fight for live. With big groups you can play mor agressive.]
