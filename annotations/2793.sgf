C[[Malweth\] Hi! I am a 7-8 kyu player on KGS and have been requested to review this game. I'm being taught online by Ion Florescu (Tsurukame on KGS). I've been playing actively for just over a year, though I've known how to play (at the 23 kyu level) since the mid 90s when I learned the basics from a computer program. Hopefully you enjoy this review... :) I may have been harsh in some places, but it was a well played game with fairly good results. I think you could have won in yose, but your biggest mistake in late mid game or large yose is E7. For a game to be this close, there were no "losing moves" in the begin-game (though this is always relative to your opponent's ability).

C[[Malweth\] Low Chinese Fuseki - You can look at some pro games using this on Gobase (http://gobase.org/service/uncgi/gobase2?File=part2/sgf/4-3&p=r) but this is hardly necessary for you at this point.]
;W[dj];B[jq];W[jd];B[mc];W[qo]C[[Malweth\] Although this is playable, as is Q5, it seems a bit premature. Given that this is absolutely going to be a moyo game (or at least the threat of moyo), P9 looks good (preventing moyo on both sides) as does K10 (consistant with your fuseki). R5/Q5 is made a bit better because of the low K3 stone, but it allows black to easily make moyo on the upper right while attacking your weak group.
--
i don't want black, make corner enclosure, perhaps my stone is too deep in black territorie, Q5 would have been better i suppose]
;B[qp];W[po];B[np]
(;W[ol]C[[Malweth\] Simply running out seems best. The knight's move of O6 seems to work ok.]

(;B[qm];W[sm]C[[Malweth\] This move is wild... points on the first line are normally saved for yose or special tesuji which make use of the first line properties. If this is to be considered tesuji (or more likely, if you want to consider a point for tesuji) you must first determine what action you wish to take (namely, killing, cutting or connecting). Preventing a connection here does not harm black (especially in the state you left him).]
;B[rn];W[ro];B[sn];W[qn];B[rm];W[pm];B[ql]C[[Malweth\] This move by black seems bad. S9 gives a better wall to the UR.]

(;W[rp];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq]C[[Malweth\] Now all of black's shape is ok. T7 did not gain you anything on the side. S4 was also bad (inflexible) - it prevents a future possibility at S2.]
;W[no];B[mp];W[sq]C[[Malweth\] Black need not respond to this at this stage in the game... this is Yose.]
;B[sr];W[sp];B[rs]C[[Malweth\] Additionally, it helped B solidify shape even more.]
;W[qf]
(;B[rh]C[[Malweth\] This second line move helped you immensely. Imagine this on the 3rd line... (see var)]

;W[sg];B[si];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb]
(;W[qd]C[[Malweth\] Yes, R16 is not necessary, though it gives you an eye (so can be played later if you need to). It is better to expand your influence and fix the Q12 problem... perhaps a play at P11 (which might still invite a black attack at P13). 
---
not very good indeed,
i make him strong in the corner];B[pc];W[og];B[oi]
(;W[pe]C[[Malweth\] Good to ignore Q11 now... and Q15 makes good shape... it seems a bit slow, however... you are strong here and should be able to play P15 instead! P15 is a table shape.]
;B[oe];W[of];B[ne];W[oq]C[[Malweth\] You cannot win here... best to take P4 (sente)to make an eye. This is another point where previously having played T3 helped black. Q3 is settled so B can cut without fear.]
;B[op];W[oo];B[mo];W[or];B[pr];W[mn];B[ln];W[mm];B[on]C[[Malweth\] This move by black is bad... it's better to let this live and surround the outside than play the nakade and let white escape to safety!]
;W[lm]
(;B[lo]C[[Malweth\] L6 seems playable! black is worried about P2, but I don't see any major problems...]
;W[nk];B[pl];W[om];B[ok];W[nj];B[ph]
(;W[pg]C[[Malweth\] Prudent, but not necessary!];B[fq];W[eq]
C[[Malweth\] Bad... if you want to enclose the corner it is best to play D2/D3. After B plays F4 (natural play), his shape between F3 and K3 is perfect... if you leave it as is, you can hope to aim at H3 later.]
;B[fp]
(;W[ip]C[[Malweth\] Your first bad play is E3 which strengthened this area. If you wish to reduce here, this is not a bad play, but normal joseki is the D6 variation... F2 is if D6 is already in place (and especially if K3 is at J3). 
--
a very bad play, i think now
D7 would have been better
or K10];B[in]C[[Malweth\] This is a good indication that your reduction was premature... White is capped and doesn't have friends to help out (a wall on the D10-K10 line would make this work well).]
;W[ho];B[fn]C[[Malweth\] Now black can sense your weakness and attacks... he'll either have a good platform to invade on the left side, kill the J4 group, or both!]
;W[hn]
(;B[iq]C[[Malweth\] White doesn't have a base without this move... attacking is still stronger from above.]
;W[jn];B[im];W[hm];B[io];W[il];B[jp];W[jm];B[hp];W[jo];B[ip]
C[[Malweth\] This sequence seems very bad for black... white has done the right thing now... making a wall toward a possible moyo area.]
;W[gl]C[[Malweth\] Solid connections are better in this type of position. A solid move like H8 prevents a black peep (or the cut at K8)]
;B[jl]
(;W[km];B[jk];W[ik];B[jj];W[ij];B[ji];W[lk]C[[Malweth\] As shown before, this is not necessary... Black needs two moves to kill outright (no seki). If O11 is played, not even seki is possible! O11 also puts more pressure on K11.]

(;W[em]C[[Malweth\] This move may be the losing move... it lets black touch the wall in your territory. Try the knight's move at E9 (a Knight's move Tesuji to stay connected).]

;B[cr];W[ds];B[bp];W[ao];B[gc];W[gd]C[[Malweth\] An attachment is used to defend a group, but you did not defend K16 with this attachment! (this is where E17 would have been more helpful than C17). Perhaps a play to keep G17 and N17 seperate is best! Then you can aim to play M11 and seperate off J12 group.]
