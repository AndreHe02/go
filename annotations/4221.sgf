C[Chris: Hi Juergen,

looking through your game, it seems that greed is your biggest problem. It is the fear of letting your opponent have to much.

Learning from Pro games, in my eyes, constitutes one of the three things you need to do to get stronger the fastest. The other 2 are reading (e.g. Tsumego) and playing. I would recommend to memorise a pro game up until the middlegame is over. This way you will learn the proper shapes and joseki in a whole board context. Players who prefer natural moves, like Lee Changho, Cho Chikun, Shuusaku and so on are usually to be preferred, because of their simplicity.

Chris

JS: Dear Reviewer, I am very glad to have this game reviewed because I have braught in some new ideas I have grasped from professional games study. Please feel free to comment anything you noticed especially in the fuseki and early middlegame fighting. I also wanted to know, if I have played the endgame correctly, or if I have lost one point somewhere in the last 10 - 20 relevant moves.

Thanks in advance!];B[oc];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qd]C[JS: I am not so familiar with the variations of the Mokuhazushi so I switched to this corner enclosure. Is it better to make an approach move at one of the White stones?

Chris: Question of style.];W[pi];B[nq];W[qn];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq]
C[Chris: Understanding even this simple joseki is not quite that easy. You have build a stable group and taken away one of the preferred directions of development.
Invasions and fighting favour the player with stronger groups, so keep this in mind during the game.]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[cg]C[JS: This was the first time I played this move after I have seen in in a couple of games of Lee Chang Ho. Is thickness in the lower left corner required for this attachment?

Chris: If I remember correctly, this is played if Black has a position in the lower left corner. As I do not play this very often, I have little information to give you.]
;W[dg];B[df]C[Chris: This is a mistake. No pro has ever played this.]

(;B[cc]LB[ch:19][cg:15]C[JS: Here i didn't want to give up the corner completely by connecting to D14, but now White is not shut in and has escaped in the center. Was this a bad decision?

Chris: This is greedy. You must not let White get out. The Black group 15&19 is not settled, so white gets a strong centre position while Black needs to protect 15&19.]
;W[de];B[ck];W[cn];B[ql]LB[fq:A][qg:B]C[JS: Was this invasion right timed?

Chris: This is greedy again. Biggest point on the board is A or B preparing the invasion.]
;W[qj];B[qr]
(;W[rq];B[pk];W[qf]
(;B[rm]LB[fq:A]C[JS: This move mybe was too deep and early. Should I run into the center with this group, or even press the White stones from the left with P5 for example?

Chris: You have succeeded with the invasion. No need to overplay. White cannot connect underneath anyway (which was the point of playing kosumi). Better take the big point A.]
;W[np]C[Chris: Good defence by White.];B[mp];W[mo];B[op];W[oo]
;B[no]C[Chris: But bad followup. Black gains in this exchange a lot.]
;W[nn];B[np];W[on]
(;B[pq]C[Chris: This move is utterly pointless. It really does not do a lot. Can you kill the white group? Absolutely not! If you have the chance to attack something, attack from the side that gives you an advantage. Here you gained 1 point and the in the best case it is ajikeshi, in the worst case you will take away the vital moves for your group to escape/live.]

Chris: B59 is premature. A is still open.];W[lf];B[mf];W[mg]
;B[nf];W[ng];B[of]LB[fp:A]C[Chris: Helping white, therefore ajikeshi. Black needs to play A.]

C[Chris: All groups are settled now, the endgame has started. For the endgame I will give you this pointer: Always play sente moves! Even if the gote move worth 10 points, a 4 point sente move is still bigger, as you can continue to take points.]
