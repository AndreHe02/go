C[White should have played again in the upper right corner.  Playing A, taking the initiative in this corner instead of playing in the upper left corner is correct, but I don't like leaving the stone alone. It is too weak. An extend from A is necessary (e.g. at B or C). An attach in the corner at D is also possible.]
;B[dc]C[Correct approach];W[kc]MA[dc]LB[oc:A]C[correct extension from A, but too far extension from the Black stone X.]
;B[cn]MA[dc]C[Black should play in the upper left corner now. Black has to sanction the fact that White has not answer his approach move X.]
;W[dj]LB[fp:A][fc:B]C[The situation gets complicated and this answer is strange. I think it is too far from both corner. It's too mild. You should answer quietly at A or attack the upper left corner for example at B.]

(;W[kp]C[Once again, too far. Take an option on the corner by playing the variation.]
;B[mq]C[Black must definitely play in the upper left corner.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[pj];B[pc];W[fc]MA[pc]LB[od:A]C[At least. But unfortunately, the timing is doubtful. White must now answer to the just played Black stone X at A. Otherwise the situation is getting very paintfull on the upper right.]
;B[de];W[np]C[This is very bad. Both locally and in the global situation. White must keep the focus on what he has just started.

Locally the exchange he makes with Black is good for Black because it secure the corner while giving nothing to White.

Globally, White must answer in the upper left corner OR at least come back to add a move in the upper right corner. Black is starting to have only strong groups while White has only weak ones.]

;B[ef];W[if];B[je];W[lr]C[Very bad move. Once again keep the focus on the fight in the upper side of the board. White cannot leave the situation as it is.]
