Hello, I'm Kevin. I hope you find this review helpful.

 You frequently talk about a moyo throughout the game, but your opening is more territory oriented with third line stones, and your additional stones are often to close and overconcentrated, especially for a moyo oriented game. You leave so much open in the middle of it, white walks through an destroys your effort.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]C[In your notes you talked about a moyo. Here you are actually playing more of a territorial game. Typically stones on the third line are territory oriented, and stones on the fourth line are influence oriented.]
;W[dn];B[ip]MA[jp]C[This is a little conservative. You might consider K4 instead, It's faster and more flexible.]
;W[nc]C[Q14 was chosen becayse I taught it work with framwork at bottom. M moyo growng faster ahn W moyo. If W starts to builf his own moyo that is

 I would not consider the bottom a "framework", It is three territorial stones, none of which have much influence on the right. Although Q14 is fine, it is not because it works with the bottom. In this case I might prefer R14. It makes a stlightly more stable group should white approach from the bottom.]
;B[pf];W[pb]C[I was condodering tenuki by Q10. Dunno really why I rejected that

Playing R17 is good, He must respond to stabilize his group so you will keep sente and ensure a portion of the corner.]
;B[qc];W[qb]LB[lc:A][ne:B][rc:C][pk:D][qk:E]C[That was an endgame move so was happy I condired m17,q10,r10,and r9. LAst one picked because it seems more balanced than r10. M17 rejectdd because W played thrn endgame move I taught that any pincer against that group could end up bening counter attacked


 Yes it it good to tenuki here. M17 doesn't apply that much pressure because white can still jump out to the center or play S17 for a living group. Either R10 or R9 are fine, and if you had K4 it would produce either the high or low Chinese opening.]
;B[qk]LB[jp:A]C[The black J4 stone would be much better at K4.]
;W[kc]LB[dj:A][fd:B][go:C][mf:D][po:E]C[I was tempted to reduce at k16. BUt I choseto go for O-Moyo strategy
 C10 I rejected because my framework is bigger and we just grow our frameworks mine will bigger. I dunno if that is wise. But I  wanted to be the one that does not invade



Your stones have now turned into more of a moyo than they started with. White still needs a stone near D10 (A) or F16 (B) before he could expand a moyo, if he just comes at G5 (C), or N14 (D), he is too open for invasion to really have created a moyo.

Q5 (E) is a perfectly fine location for black to continue a moyo development.]
;B[gn]LB[po:A][mq:B]C[Do I picked a moyo pivot. Now looking at it doesn't look too smart
too close to J4?

No, this is not a pivot point. Nor does not expand territory for you. Your stones are too close and inefficent. I like Q5, but even N3 (which is not the best move) gets you more solid territory than G6.]
;W[ci]LB[fm:A]C[This is wht I wanted
Id ecided to grow it by kikashi But I got unexpetd answer

 This is good for white, it will produce more than some move such as F7 (A).]
;B[md];W[nd]C[I was expecting n17
I dont think am string enough to n17 here so..

 O16 is a good white move, and you replied as you should, O15.]
;B[ne];W[mc]C[What should I do here?
I want grow my moyo. But if I think n16 as a forcing move then my next move kinda misses the point but what I should do?

I worked out some variations for you. You could still play Q5.]

(;B[le];W[cc]LB[fd:A][po:B]C[I think that is wasy too slow now so I was happy

And decided to defend againd shouldet hit of Q16
'

Yes, this was slow for white, he should have played F16 (A), or invaded, probably Q5 (B).]
;B[je]C[But first To enlargen my moyo

You enlarged your potential, but he gained solid territory.]
;W[id]LB[hd:A];B[nl]LB[po:A]C[Not so good, Q5 is still my suggestion.]
;W[po]C[Now my "strategy" has worked fine. I got what I wanted.
The big question is where I went wrong. Apert few tactical mistakes in killing that invasion. They are balanced by W mistakes in defending against my attack. At which point I should have given a break at attack and grapped profit and where?


 I think your problem is in the statement "given a break in the attack and gained profit". You will seldom be able to attack and kill good opponents. The purpose of the attack is to make profit while the opponent is forced to defend. Attack for profit, not to kill.]
;B[qp]C[I did not want to give W easy eye space at 3-3 play

Yes, this is a good play.];W[qo];B[np]C[Good, both these moves are attacking, forcing the player to defend while you make profit on the bottom.]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[op];B[oq];W[no];B[mp];W[pp];B[qq];W[qm]
(;B[ro]C[S6 would ave been too much eye space my my taste

Black S6 would have been a good play, see the variation.];W[rn]
;B[sp];W[on]MA[je]LB[pl:A]C[q7 only move to keep attack live. BUt it gets messy. But with all my thicknes at top messy should favour me?


Q7 is not the only move to keep the attack alive. You don't have to attack to kill. Here you should attack to gain profit! Q8 (A) threatens to take away the eyespace at Q7, and makes a solid wall above! Then you have real potential for territory.

Look closely at K15, you gave white a bunch of territory above at J17, J16 in order to play K15. If you don't make territory from it then it was a wasted move and white profited.

 Look at the variation next.]
(;B[pm]C[This is it, this is your downfall you were asking about. 

 You had an opportunity to force white to live small and in gote while you built a wall, instead he walked right through your potential and destroyed your moyo.]
;W[pl];B[om];W[ql];B[rk];W[pk]C[Here he goes.];B[qi]C[Note, at this point white is fine, white trys to move out to slowly and allows you to continue to threaten him. White should not really have as big a problem as he did.]
;W[mo];B[lp];W[pj];B[pi];W[mk];B[ml];W[lo];B[ll];W[kp];B[kq]
;W[ko];B[jq];W[nk];B[pn];W[qn];B[lk]C[Now I felt that I coudl actuall y go for the kill :(

Did you kill him? No. Did he walk through your potential? Yes.

Going for the kill is a bad mentality. It is not the game of Go. THREATENING to Kill is the game of go. You THREATEN to kill in order to gain influence, thickness, or territory. And then you let your oppnent live small and in gote.]

But W should get at left side 15 point more thatn B? and top moyo is woth something 5 points?

Sure, if you fixed up some endgame, and didn't make a few mistakes you would have won the game. But the most important lession if you want to work to become a Dan player is:

DON"T TRY TO KILL! You won't be able to kill better opponents. They'll just end up marching right into your territory. THREATEN THE STABILITY OF A GROUP to gain profit, influcence, or thickness.

You have good potential, stop trying to kill groups and I think you'll jump several kyu.]
