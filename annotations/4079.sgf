C[I have included some comments at various points in the game, to convey what I was thinking at the time.  Any comments at
all are appreciated.  Thankyou.

Hi. I am Radu, player on turn-based sites like little golem and dragon go. I am ranked around 10k right now. I hope I can provide useful comments. Please consider them simple observation, a stronger player for sure would have different opinions.

Enjoy.];B[qp];W[pd];B[dq];W[op]

;B[pn]CR[dd]LB[do:C][ip:B][jq:A]SQ[pm]C[R: The corner is more or less enclosed, now look for really big moves. The most important is of course somewhere in top left corner. If this would be occupied, other points are available, before small extension from the bottom right corner. But even so, the extension should be larger already.]

[do:B]C[With this move I intended to put pressure on the stone
above and force the next move, so I could claim the right
side.

R: avoid "punch attacks" during fuseki. Exactly what W did (wrongly). Yes, this move isn't bad; but not because "attacks" 4x4 stone, instead because makes an usual kakari. The vital point is still extension from your bottom right corner, but also other moves require attention.]
;W[nd];B[oj]LB[qd:C][pi:B][qi:A]C[At this point I thought I had gained the right side, but in hindsight this move was probably too ambitious.

R: oh no. You are invinting opp to slip under your base, stealling it. If you want to make base on right, consider A or B. They are making perfect extension from kakari and also work wonderful with your enforced corner.
Yes, your formation is balanced, but far to high.]

and B and white was certain to play at the one I didn't play at, and then I would be open to a cut.
R: Stone 1 can connect to corner group, stone 2 can make a group relating to stone 3, so connect at B.]
;B[ph]LB[qj:1][ok:A]TR[qh]C[I played the marked move to pressure the marked stone
(to keep sente) whilst helping out thestones below so I
could play A
R: old saying: don't attack in contact. So, should I understand you want give up stone 1? It worhts at least 10 points only as territory, not thinking at cutting W stones.]
;W[qg]C[However when white played this move I felt I needed to
play the next move protect the marked stones
R: because attacked in contact];B[pg];W[ok]C[R: wrong cut. B has chance recovering.]

;W[pj]C[I realised it was pointless to try and save marked
stone, so instead I started building influence towards the
centre.

the left, whilst building influence towards the centre.

;W[gd];B[jd]C[I played this pincer to prevent white from gaining the top
side.

R: good move. But the aim should be other: to gain center power! (wasn't it  your main goal?)]

;B[jf]TR[jd]C[This was to settle the marked stone.
R: good thinking. Actually, if you take a quick look, this is the way of playing fuseki: light and linked.]
;W[lg]CR[oh][nj]TR[le]C[I did not know what to do about this move.  Now I feel
should have attacked at M16 to isolate the marked stones.
This move marked the start of white's invasion of the
centre, and me trying to prevent as much loss as possible.

R: if W aimed to:
1. penetrate center moyo
2. attack right B group
this move is what W needs most. The urgent matter for B is right group. There are 2 WEAK cutting points: circles.
Also, let's analyze a little the situation. B has: 30 ppoints on up side, 20 points in bottom right and 8 points on bottom left. W has 40 points on left up, 12 pints bottom and 15 points on left. 58-67. Take big moyo points.
In fatc, whenever you have the chance, count and decide if it is time for: building more points, reducing opp moyo, invading. I would say now it is time for making points.]

A and B are attacking W center group and also protect the right group. C only protects B group, but anyway this group is looking for some help.]

;B[tt];W[tt]C[Thankyou for taking the time to look at my game.  I really
 appreciate it.  Simon.

R: Let's do some math. W wins with ~50 poins. If the B right-center groups would survive, that would mean 19 prisoners + 19 teritory points + ~5 points for B= 43 points. It is almost the difference...

As conclusions, I would say that basic techniques are well applied, this is most important. The lacks are in aji management and in side play. 
Take special care for any aji left behind, and when it is possible, try not to create them. Watch for opp's aji, but more for yours.
And keeps your bases stable. The bases are actually making the influence, not 4 stones in a row! 
Never give up a corner without a proper gain elsewhere. Influence means to have a powerful (living unconditionally) group which is not boxed in.

Don't forget, always center brings you less points that expected. For center, take it as simple as possible. Remeber, for making territory in center: 4 walls are needed. If one player has at least 1, the center territory will be small. In this game, W had almost all the time 1 side opened.

To quote an advertising message: Keep playing. Soon, you'll see the ajis clearer. And side basis... you can't without them.

Hope it helped, Radu])
