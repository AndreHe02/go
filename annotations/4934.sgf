C[Hi

This game was played at KGS. I'm playing black and managed to win by half a point.

I have put in a few questions at places where I was not sure what to do. Of course comments would be welcome at other places to.

/KÃ¥re (Magix)

idigo: This seemed like an interesting game. I thought that you could have won pretty easily with the center moyo that you got at one point, were it not for a few bad directional plays (e.g. helping white get neutralizing influence). As it was, I think that White ultimately lost a marginal lead in the endgame.

I hope I give some good ideas as to how to make your play sharper/more efficient. If you find that I give bad ones, too... remember that I still have a lot to learn, myself!

Best of luck in your games.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[po]

(;B[np]LB[cf:A][pl:B][oo:C][qo:D]C[I'm not really sure what to play here. I thought that after a pincer or attachment on the inside white would be able to build a wall working to well with his starpoint.

idigo:  The game move is fine (but a bit on the peaceful side), but I think that you have many playable choices.

I maybe think that A is most natural, but I'd be able to play A-C pretty comfortably, in addition to O4. D is not my favorite idea here, but it seems to be playable, too.]

(;B[rr]LB[cf:A]TR[or]C[Black at the triangle seems to be the common move but I did not remember this during the game.

idigo: The game move leads to a pretty common pattern as well. The nice thing about playing at P2 instead is that it gives clear sente to play at A next.]

(;B[fe];W[df];B[ck];W[gd]TR[fc][fe]SQ[kc]C[If I just connect white should be able to separate the triangles from the square. Giving me two weak groups to worry about.

Mabye black should try G17 and try to connect the two stones on the third line?

In the end I figured that I should play somewhere else as white dont have any relly great follow up at the top anyway.

idigo: White's timing with the peep does seem a bit off. I think that your tenuki shows pretty good spirit. Locally, G17 looks like a better move than F16.]

C[Considering my rather loose lower corner. Mabye an invation is a bit to agressive?

In the end it turns out fine. Bit it feels like its only because my opponent did not know how to exploit the weekness.

idigo: While with the result that you got in the game, you'd probably have been better off just pressing at A, I think that it is a good idea to try to make good use of the marked stones' influence. I think that playing instead at B is the sharpest way to invade, though.


On a side note, how do you plan on answering a move around C? It's pretty big for White, and seems likely to be sente.]

(;B[ci]LB[gi:A]C[idigo: Black's huge moyo should be the subject of all the talking, but in the game sequence, White got a lot of counterbalancing influence toward it. Probably it is better to instead play something like A, emphasizing the center.]

(;B[hc]LB[ij:A]C[Mabye it would have been better to play somwhere around tengen. L17 looks hard to kill even with out help right now.

idigo: It's pretty much impossible to kill L17, so the question is how much profit white can take moving first up top compared to how much White can reduce Black by, in the center. H17 is undoubtedly very big, but I believe that a move around A is bigger.]

idigo: Maybe a small one. It's hard to know what's best here.

The game is getting into a very long endgame stage. Be warned that despite the very close end score I won't comment it all that rigorously, though I'll try to point out what I thought to be the really notable mistakes. Many of them were made by White, I thought.]

I might even play at C immediately, though.])
(;B[cf]TR[ng]C[idigo: D17 felt a bit slow to me, and now the shape feels a bit awkward for White. The most interesting area to develop is the left side, anyway, and since the F17 stone is pretty light and the L17 stone pretty safe (the marked stone helps a bit with that), it may be best to just play toward the left directly, as Black is doing here.]

(;B[cf]LB[po:1][pq:2]TR[qd][dp]C[idigo: How about this double approach?

Locally, Black can expect to get an extra good result in the upper left corner, since the double approach aggravates the weakness at the 3-3 point while at the same time frustrating the D16 stone's ambition to extend along the side; normally, one wants to respond to an approach on a 4-4 stone.
The position in the lower right corner is much easier to tenuki from, in general; if we regard it as White playing 1 first, Black 2 is in general a perfectly normal, equitable response.

So, White will probably have to justify the expense by getting a result in the lower which works extra well in global relation to the marked corner positions. Since it's a bit unclear how White will be able to do this, I think that although it is certainly still a game for both sides, it is easier to feel good about Black.]
