C[To Reviewer,

Thanks in advance. This game I felt like I started off poorly, caught up a bit, and then fell behind again. I'll try to speculate what I did wrong, and how I might have played better, but I am eager to hear if you agree these were the moves that caused my loss, and if my proposed remedies would be effective.

I played Black in this game.

Hello];B[qp];W[dq];B[do]C[Sometimes as Black Iike to do an approach move first just for variety. I always can take the other corner if White tenukis.

yes ; it's ok...];W[co];B[cn];W[cp]LB[dc:A][cd:C][pd:D][qd:B]
C[These moves are usualy expected...
see variations from pro games]
(;B[dm]C[but here, it's a mistake: if you finish now this joseki you are gote.
As black, losing the sente at move 7 of the game is not good ; don't you think so ?
Usualy black play now in the corner: see variations];W[fq];B[ci]
;W[cd]C[Shouldn't White play in the other corner as it has more room to expand from?
--
yes];B[pd];W[op];B[mq]C[I was trying to prevent White from creating a large bottom territory. Is this the best course of action  or are josekis starting from  P3 or Q6 OK?
---
N3  is not good: there is no room for territory ; this stone is weak from the begining.
Joseki starting from P3 or Q6 are better.];W[no]C[Not 100% how this should go.]

;W[nm];B[rk]C[Black's positions seem a little cramped. I feel that white has gained some advantage, though there are weaknesses.
---
Yes ; now you have 2 weak groups];W[on];B[rq]C[P6 seemed to threaten the connection between the R4 and R7 groups. This was a better way to connect than something duller(?)]
;W[rr];B[ro];W[sq];B[rp];W[nc];B[qf]C[To work toward side territory and help R4 group which is still not 100% Ok
---
yes, but painful];W[ic];B[pj]C[Gote, but big enough? Cut at O8 becomes more dangerous.
--
too slow];W[cg]C[ very good];B[ei];W[kr];B[jr]C[Should have run more to center? Did not want to disturb cut at F4.
--
no, you are behind so...]
(;W[lq]C[very bad];B[fo]C[Is this timing good, or should I go in up top first? My hope was to build up the area around E11 before going in for the invasion by attacking here. This is kind of what happened.
---
yes, good move];W[hm];B[fn];W[fr]
(;B[il]C[Is there a better way to attack this at this point? K9? J9?
--
your group is not alive so i think K8 is better];W[hl];B[jl]
C[;-) painful to add a stone here];W[hj];B[hh]C[mmh];W[ik];B[gk]
;W[hk];B[lk]C[My feeling now is this should be in the other direction, at F12. My attack begins to fizzle out at this point.

yes];W[jk];B[mn];W[nn];B[kk];W[in];B[kn];W[ml];B[ki]C[Again a misplay. L12?]
;W[ih];B[ig];W[jh];B[ld]C[He's pretty much escaped. Hope to gain profit by attacking up top and then renewing attack.]

(;B[ek]C[These are attempts to make shape, but help me secure territory.
--
yes but this last move is not necessary (see var)];W[nj]C[I had considered the O9 probe, but I didn't feel that I had the opportunity. Is there some time that I might have played that, or is it too thin to play anyway?
--
let see...]
(;B[nh];W[kh];B[mi];W[lh]
(;B[nd]C[I didn't know how to attack this stone. Q7, while securing the corner,  left M16 weak. Perhaps the move at M16 was not proper.

This is a move to attack the white group in the center, but now this group is not easy to kill...
so to attack O17 see var];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]

**************************************************
My general feeling about the game is that I was unable to recover from my early disadvantage. I made some progress toward fixing it, but there were a number of moves I could have done which would have punished my opponent more severly.

In this game it seems I also had some direction of play issues.

Well any advice you could give me would be welcome.

Thanks,
_Dave

I  think you lose this game from the very begining (move 6 and 13); white made some mistake too so the game remained payable until the end.
