;B[qd];W[dd]C[I don't know much about what a good response to opening moves is. I have some sort of intuition for it, but that's about it. Was my d16 a reasonable move?
[yes, that's perfectly reasonable. as white just keep up in the beginning taking the big areas: corners, then sides\]]
;B[dp];W[pq]C[[good\]];B[oc];W[qo]C[[now you've each got a corner secured\]]
;B[qj];W[ql]LB[dj:c][qk:a][rk:b]C[Am I being to weak with this move? Would 'a' have been better or 'b'? What about a bigger move, say, at 'c'?
[this corner was already secure, so you only made a small extension. it would've been better to play 'c'\]]
;B[ph];W[cq]LB[dj:A]C[I like to attack 4-4 stones at the 3-3 point. Is that wise? Prudent? At all advisable? I figure it can't hurt to sometimes grab a little territory right at the beginning.
[that's worth a handful of points, but there are bigger ones like at A\]]

;W[jj]LB[mk:A]C[Did I just give him too much influence in the lower left?
[not just influence, it's pretty much his territory, A would've been better, because it's supported by your bottom left corner, still pushes into the centre and doesn't need as much to connect to an existing safe group\]]

[hr][ir][fs][gs][hs][is]C[Since this game dealt with such huge swaths of territory, I was surprised when I actually won. I believe what made me win was that he abandoned his pieces in the upper left corner.
[It's possible to feel like you're losing most battles and still win the game. The winner is the one who in the process managed to surround more territory that wasn't fought over. B didn't abandon those pieces, there wasn't much chance for them to survive. What made the huge difference was when you played L17 (as a ladder breaker) then followed up with reinforcing moves to capture more of the top edge and centre. It was a bit of luck, as your motivation for playing that move was not to take territory on the top and centre, but that was the effect.
The best advice I can give is when looking for a place to move, look to the large open areas at the corners and edges, rather than where the opponent just played (especially when playing as W), unless it is more of a threat than the open area you would claim.\]
  I also get the feeling that a lot of what happened in this game that was in my favor was luck. Perhaps you could tell me about what I was actually doing right.
  (As an indication of our relative playing abilities, I played another game with him, in which I was black, and he won by almost 100 points. Our games were both somewhat chaotic in that respect.)]
