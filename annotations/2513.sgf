C[Hi all Go masters,

I'am a new guy in GO chess but I do read a lot of books about it.
I can win computer about 10 moku playing in white. However, I totally lost when facing human and lost in big range in several games.
This is one of my game.

I think I played not much problem actually in the first 50 moves but why lost so much?
Thanks anybody advise!!!

Henry Lo

white is me, black is davislee];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq]C[good   :)]

[od:12][pd:3][le:9][ne:8][pe:14][pf:10][dj:5][pp:1][dq:4]C[at this instant, the game is open but after 15 u make an error (for me)

u should reduce the black corner with R16 then to jump at R6 

u can also press with L16 or K17 then F16 (BUT ...after R16)

there are sente stones . the most important is not to loose the initiative... and ...]

;B[mc];W[nd];B[ld];W[do];B[cp];W[cq]C[am I rite? I want to protect the left buttom corner!
YES];B[dp];W[ep];B[co];W[eo];B[cn];W[dm]C[good];B[cl];W[cm]
;B[bm];W[id]C[this move seems near the three black stones, but I want to get more area in the upper left corner, rite??

NO it's forbidden playing near a wall];B[cc]C[but black do a big mistake 

white, after C17 can reinforced his two stones with D17 then G16 for ex. and do some territory and also to reduce the influence of black wall]
;W[cd]C[C16: yes why not? Because black can make also a wall to the left...]
;B[ic]C[another big mistake from black .

now u can cancel the 2 black influences and take the corner! and perhaps  to kill the game...

why not H17?...Then D17...then D17 thenC12 or C11];W[jc]C[K17 : (]
;B[hc]C[u thougt to use K17 as a sacrifice stone but if black don't fall in the trap u have to play K16 to separate black stones]
;W[hd];B[jd];W[je];B[kd];W[jf]C[u forget bases of go with K14 ...

POINTS ARE IN CORNERS!

u forget to play THE big move R16 to reduce black corner in the right and u have possibility to take left corner D17 and u don't  !

AND DON'T FORGET TO KEEP SENTE ( initiative)

 K14 doesn't answer to these rules

a move ( SENTE!) as G17 then D17 seems more interesting that K14

sorry if i anger :) but u could win this game rapidly  applying  rules of go]
;B[qd];W[qn];B[qo];W[nq]C[is it a rite move to attack the corner 2 black stones in two ways?

generally yes but here i thing that with your white group in top u have possibility to make in sente territory to the right after R6, Q6 is SENTE! so after u can play a move around R11]
;B[lq];W[jq]C[K3 : good];B[hq]C[in such manner of the buttom part, how should I do with it?
 Jump out to the center or push black H3 against your wall in the left with J4 you can also  run along with L3 then M2...

...or play O2 threating to play R3 for the corner

it seems that my 2 white stones inside 3 black stone, need to jump out?]
;W[jo]C[K5 GOOD];B[ho];W[lo]C[It seems that the thickened white stones in lower left corner and the white stones K3,K6 are cut away by the black stones H3 and H6.

am I rite with this move???
 YES

up to now I still think that I won't lost too much but the result is horrible. Please advise the main reason for big loss of this game thank you very much!!!]
;B[no];W[mp]C[N4 GOOD];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir];W[jp]C[Another time u use L2 as a sacrifice stone but black doesn't fall in the trap but another time...


...U MUST SEPARATE BLACK  ( another rule of go)

...with a move in L3 instead of K4

with L3 u isolate center black group in the bottom center perhaps to kill it later if he can't do two  eyes]
;B[kq];W[ls]C[M1: useless and too late];B[lr];W[mq];B[ms];W[qj]
;B[ql];W[rl];B[qm];W[pn];B[rm];W[rk]C[S9 : bad move u must play this stone in S6 ...


...ALWAYS TO SEPARATE BLACK


if black takes stone S8 it's not so important because he has only an eyes with this stone but two isolated group]

C[move 110 to 124 : GOOD];W[hm]C[H7 : very good!];B[lj]C[black M10 : DANGER

u must do anything to kill black group in the center to win this game ( u are in late with points)

a move in N11 for me in correct to connect all white stones but it's not so simple]
;W[qe]C[R15: too late to reduce this corner u MUST BE PRUDENT after a move as black M10

...and R15 is not sente];B[rd];W[re]C[S15 : same reason];B[lg]
C[BLACK M13 : u are loosing this game because black is connecting all his stones !!!


....and u will not be able to kill stones in the center!];W[jh]

;B[pk];W[qi];B[ph];W[pg];B[ng];W[li]C[M11: bad 
...why not connecting in P13 

if black P13 white can loose all stones in the right and  the top corner 

THE GAME SHOULD BE OUT !];B[ki];W[mi]C[N11: ?

Why not connecting in L12?];B[jg];W[mj]C[N10 :? 
why not L12 ?  

ANOTHER PRINCIPLE IN GO ...

YOU MUST CONNECT YOUR STONES];B[mk];W[lk]C[M9 : ? 

L12 ! and now it's become important to connect in J15 . THE DANDER ARRIVES]

it's you who must win this game
