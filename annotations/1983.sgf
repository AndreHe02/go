RE[B+Resign]

C[I'd prefer comments on the fuseki and early middlegame mostly, and on the direction of play in general. My games tend to either have 6+ groups struggling in a fight to the death, or me letting the opponent take profit in exchange for a cosmic moyo, then having my opponent invade it and either live and win or die and lose. Starting this game I was determined to change that for once, and try to make this an ordinary game, but as you'll see I fail misserably.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[fc];W[cf]LB[df:A]C[I'm rather horrible at white, and never seem to manage taking initiative. I thought I'd play this orthodox move (which I've rarely if ever played before). This is clearly aiming at the left, but blacks stone once it's secured seem to gain alot more on the top, and black already has alot bigger framework.

MK: This move is quite normal. Compared to 'A' it secures the corner a bit more. Black has nearly no actual territory.
Nearly any of the common pincers seem to be possible in this situation, too. But this might result in an early fight, which is a matter of style.]
;B[jd]SQ[fc]TR[hd]LB[gd:C][hc:B][id:A]C[Sure, I can play h16 later, but right now, it looks like black has twice the influence I have.

MK: The normal invasions/reductions into the marked black formation are A, B, or C. The triangled move is a (very common) mistake.

Appart from that you are right, B has twice the influence you have. But: He has no actual territory. You have the upper left corner, komi, and sente, which is very big, considering that the next move will be the eighth... Thus, the position is ok.]
;W[dj]TR[cf]C[Is this too passive? I usually play too agressively, and in this game I tried focusing on playing solid and rather attack boldly if I was behind in the middlegame.

MK: The marked stone is low, thus the left side isn't that important. When you play low in this position you want to take sente to paly somewhere else. So, this move would be more efficient placed somewhere on the right.]
;B[cn]C[I'm no good at handling stones like these; it's already pincered, but black gains a base none the less, no matter what I do. Is the fact that I have two high stones on the left what makes me vulnerable? But playing on the third line there would REALLY be slow, right?

MK: Please have a look at the variation to the next move.]
(;W[fo]C[Aiming to grab more on the bottom than black got on the top, then going in on the right. Noone stronger than me ever recommends a move like this, but what are the flaws in it?

MK: Another variation will try an answer starting in the next move.]

(;B[ck];W[bp]C[I gain quite alot of territory in the corner with this move, that forces black to protect his base. Is black c9 a mistake compared to b4, and if not, what should my reply to b4 be?

MK: see previous variation.];B[bi];W[jp]TR[fo]C[Alright, this looks bigger than blacks top, but my left corner is weak, and more settled as weak than blacks bottom right.

MK: Well, b can quite easy invade this formation. You really would like to see the marked stone one or two lines lower to make actual territory out of the corner.]
;B[mq]C[Which black fixes...];W[qj]TR[mq]C[Where else should I consider playing? R14 seems horrible as black can pincer and really exploit the right edge, and r6 feels too close to a settled black group.

MK: This seems to be the best move in this situation. You cannot protect the lower left side with only one move anyway, with the marked stone in place.]
;B[qn]LB[qh:B][qo:A]C[This seems small... I've heard that this wing formation supposedly protects effectively against a 3-3 invasion, but never seen it in action. Does it?

MK: Let's try in the variations ;-)
All in all: it is very barely dead. A w stone somewhere nearby and b might already get a problem. Thus, in most cases one wants to protect the cornver with A.
Anyway, this seems to be the wrong direction. Black should play from the upper side with B. This is bigger.]

(;W[qf];B[mc];W[rd]LB[qc:A][qh:B]C[Right here I was satisfied. Blacks bottom right corner is bigger than my upper left, but my group on the right is alot more solid than blacks on the left, and I look to get sente after we've finished corner- and edgegrabbing

MK: I would not be satisfied. The two corner- and side-grops you mention equal out. But b's upper side seems to be bigger than w's lower side. Especially when considering that b A is almost sente, because it threatens B. B should have played A immediatly here.]
;B[fe]C[Is this an attack on my corner? I'm pretty confident I can live small, but does it really block off my exit to the center?]
;W[db]C[Saving the corner looks real big here, now I feel I am leading.

MK: yes, this moves looks ok.];B[qc];W[ch]TR[ph]LB[bi:B][dj:A]
C[wrong direction?I wanted to connect to the lone stone at d10 to make it less useless, and it seems to give me a few more points in the upper left, but there is still neutral space up for grabs on the edges, especially on the right and bottom.

MK: The marked point seems to be honte (the proper move) in this position. It looks small (but even bigger than your move ;), but it is not. It secures some 12 points of territory, and most important it makes this group very solid. After that an invasion into the upper side is no problem. On the other hand: A made black to play this awkward move B. Thus, it has done its job, you should not care about A for the time being.]
;B[eb]LB[cc:A][gd:B][id:C][jc:D][lc:E]C[This seems crude. I considered just playing d17, is that ok in such situations, or does that just let black fix his skirt in sente?

MK: A would be the correct answer, to make the endgame play on the top gote for b - and to reduce the aji in the corner. It is ok to play there, b fixes not only his, but also your shape. There are still weak points on the upper side to exploit, e.g. B to E.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ld]LB[ed:A][fd:B]C[Hereabouts I forgot my determination to play for profit until I was behind, and started making risky moves. What are my alternatives? s8? l2? p6? Tengen?

After you fixed b's weakness with the A - B exchange (without fixing your own, b can live in the corner, see corresponding var. in the endgame.), invading the top became much more difficult. I do not think that this move is espacially risky. I'd say, it is a premature reduction.]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[kc];W[je];B[ie];W[id];B[jc];W[if];B[he];W[jf]
C[I'm really fond of central influence, but it always brings me ruin in the form of weak groups.

MK: Yes, the result is not really bad. The only problem is the weakness in the right-side group - and maybe the fact that you are quite a bit behind in territory.]
;B[hf];W[rc]C[I need j12 or something? Didn't feel like letting black get sente.

MK: Taking sente here is correct.];B[hh];W[qb]LB[lf:A]C[MK: This is big, but making good shape with A isn't small, too. An attack at these stones can help b gaining influence to invade the right.]
;B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[rm];B[rn];W[qm];B[dk];W[bh];B[cj];W[ci]
;B[ej];W[di];B[fj];W[ek]LB[hp:A]C[I've lost my head for sure, why do I need another weak heavy group?

MK: Yes, securing at least some lower side territory with A seems to be a good idea here.]
;B[el];W[fk];B[fl];W[gk];B[gj];W[gl];B[fn];W[gn];B[en];W[fm]
LB[ho:A]C[MK: A instead seems to be better shape. The extra point you get is totally irrelevant.]
;B[em];W[gm]C[Black is too nice

MK: Indeed. ;) And not only with this move. In the last 25 moves your territory increased nearly everywhere, whereas b gained nothing.]
;B[eo];W[fp];B[ep];W[eq];B[co];W[cp];B[bo]C[Does black have any cutting potential? k4 seems to back up the g5 point okish, and the corner can live on it's own.

;B[hi];W[jj];B[jg];W[me];B[oi];W[mi]LB[ph:A]C[Should I save this peep for later? Perhaps play q12? Or do I have to play p14 here to save my k14 stones?

LB[cc:A]C[Black is in the lead now, right? What options are left apart from a razor sharp endgame?

MK: Some general comments:

My impression is that you have to work on good and bad shape in the next future. This is strongly related to urgent and big moves. You are already good in finding big moves, but you often leave out urgent moves. This concept is illustrated in my comments to the moves # 26, 42, and 66.]
