C[Hello! I'm black in this game and my main concerns are how to preventing the opponent getting such a huge framework like he did in this game. Thanks for reviewing!

TZ: Hello. I am 6k in Poland and on IGS. This is my first review. I will try to do as helpfull as possible.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd];B[nq]C[First mistake. I think I should have played on one of the side star points.

TZ: I don't think so. If your stones would be in adjacent corners, than move on hoshi beetween would have double value. The situation now is different. It is not a mistake.]
;W[no];B[lp];W[qk];B[hq]C[was this move ok?

TZ: I think it is. I would play on H4, cause it is higher, with better options for attacking left side and center. After H3 invasion on lower side is still possible.

Q10 to punish W for playin' too close to his stones is also tempting...]
;W[pg];B[nd]C[TZ: I would play Q10 instead. W can then try to seal you in corner with O16, but now he can play O13 forming great moyo.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[ic];B[dj];W[lb];B[nb]C[I didn't really know how to answer white's approach but I guess I should have played M16 or M17?

TZ: It is never nice to play a move like this, but I think it is necesary. If you have played L17 before, W would take D10, which would be worse.]
;W[dm];B[cn];W[ch];B[cj]C[Would have pressing white down with E12 or D12 been better?

TZ: I think it would. This is too pasive];W[cd];B[fm]C[Would have expanding the framework with F10 been better than capping?

TZ: Expanding and reducing at the same time would be much better - playing E12. Then, if white tries to rescue D7 point, you can invide his framework on C14. If he secures his framework, you can catch his D7 stone, or if you like - play on big scale with tengen (K10). Big mistake.]
;W[fh];B[fj]C[TZ: Because of previous passive move, W has taken the initiative.]
;W[ln]
(;B[pi]C[I was thinking quite long how to reduce white's framework and I'm not sure if I found a good solution. Which point would you have chosen to invade/reduce?

TZ: The most important thing now is to find out if invading two times is possible. You have 3 possible invasion points: Q11/R11, RQ67, R3. I think this invasion is OK. Leaves you invasion in san-san possible. Cutting off two white stones is normally the aim of this invasion. In this position it is not the good option - it doesn't really work (see variations).

Do not play RQ67. W would secure corner first with R4 and P3. Then he would attack your stone at the same time securing upper right side.

R3 invasion is also possible.

I think what you can gain from this invasion is not reducing white's territory on right nor splitting him. What you can gain is entering his framework from center side. When you realize this - it seems Q10 is better (classic way of reducing framework).]
;W[qi];B[pj];W[qj]C[TZ: This position is the same as you would get after Q10 - R10 - Q11 - R11.]

(;B[ni]C[TZ: Too scary. Pushing on Q12 is better, cause it theatens cutting off 2 white stones.]
;W[ng];B[li];W[le]C[At this point I considered my invasion to be a failure since my corner group is sealed in and I helped white expanding it's huge framework on the left upper side

TZ: Result of invasion is not that bad. Your upper right corner group didn't have much options for development. Where would you go from there? Around M15? It is no man's land. You can still reduce W's moyo around K13 or invade it around F17. The only problem is - it is risky because of center group. That's why pushing at Q12 would be better - it would stengthen your group.]
;B[mf]C[Trying to keep the white groups separated although I'm not sure if this was a good idea since they both seem to have a base already.

TZ: Exactly. No point in separating them.
The best to do now would be around P8 - entering W's moyo on lower right and securing base for your center group at the same time. What you did instead was helping white to secure his moyo.]
;W[lf];B[mg];W[me];B[ne];W[nf]
(;B[mh]C[TZ: I think O12 is better. Keeps pressure on white stones at O13/14 (possibility for a nice tesuji later), expands the base of your center group and your stones at N13/14 can be sacrificed - they don't have any value except 4 points.]
;W[ig]
(;B[ji]C[Would have pushing with Q9 been better in order to establish a base?

TZ: I do not think your center group is in that big danger. I would keep on invading - in upper left framework or lower right corner. 
But I usually play risky ;-)
remember about P8 option - it is still there.];W[hi]
(;B[ik]C[TZ: The question now is - how to stay connected and not allow W into B's framework? I think H10 is better.]
;W[ij];B[jj];W[jk];B[kk];W[jl];B[hk]C[TZ: This is a problem - you have to secure your frawork OR help your center group.]
;W[km];B[kl];W[im];B[jn];W[jm];B[ml];W[nk]C[This move wouldn't have been possible if i had closed the side with Q9 before]
;B[pk];W[ol];B[pl];W[pm];B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[ok];B[mm]
(;W[mn]C[TZ: Probably W's mistake.];B[nn];W[on];B[nm];W[pn]
;B[mo]C[This move is definitely too aggressive at this point and even loses the game. I should have played N9 instead.]
;W[ll];B[lk]C[right after playing this move I realized the snapback...]
;W[mk]C[TZ: It is really hard to judge your play level after this game, because it is unusual (well, very different from what i have...). Both of you have build big moyo. Both of you avoided close fight. 

So here is very general answer to your main question ("How to prevent opponent from building moyo"). If you play passively and you build moyo, your opponent will also have big moyo. The only way to build your moyo without letting opponent building his is to play agressively, with initiative, pushing, getting thicknesses. In the end your strong stones will make a moyo. I know it doesn't help. Look at Takemiya's games.

It is hard to evaluate this game. There were a lot to do yet - it has ended urgently. The problem to evaluate was - you both had big moyos, with abilities to invade.

Let's try to evaluate it now, assuming there's no snapback and W's center group is alive (before your final mistake).
I usually count double points (P)

W has:
upper left big moyo - 37 P
right side - 20 P
komi - 6,5 p (single points)

B has:
upper right - 8 P
moyo - 40 P
center - 7 P

You lose about 10 point. I assumed there's invasion possible in your corner and in W's (equal value).

Until the moment you let W attack your center group and getting into your moyo, you was ahead, cause your moyo was much bigger than his (so don't worry about opponent's moyo if yours is bigger).]
