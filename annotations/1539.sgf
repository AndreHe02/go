C[Hello
I
have added some questions, but I am sure that you can find some other
weak points in my play.  Thank you for reviewing my game.
 Chamm 16k*: hello];B[pd]C[Hi,

I'll
try my best as I told the others for the last few games that I had
reviewed. I can't promise i won't make mistake, but I'm sure when we
discover mistakes we made, we would improve faster than we think. Have
fun :)];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[hd];W[jc]
;B[ic];W[jd];B[nc];W[lc];B[md]TR[nc][pd][pp]C[I was very unsure about this move, maybe I should have taken a bigger point?


From
my point of view, this move is neccessary as it strengthen your group
on the right, and ensure an expansion that later on you have played
one.];W[qc];B[qd]C[The direction is correct.];W[rc];B[rd];W[pc]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa];B[qj];W[he];B[ie]C[This move does not seem to work well

Yup, it give opportunity for white to cut through. But, take it easy, it's just the beginningof the game.]
;W[id];B[hc];W[je];B[if];W[jf];B[jp];W[ig];B[hf];W[hg];B[ge]
TR[hf][if][ie][hd]C[Extend?

Should secure your marked group first and white may gain more by attacking this group here.]
;W[kh];B[cn]TR[qj][pp][jp]C[Is
this the correct side and time to approach this corner?  I was unsure
of this move as well.  Looking back, F3 seems better to me.


Yup, you should make use of your 3 stones on the right to attack the white on the lower left corner.]
;W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]C[Your 43 can play a bit farther, like D9.]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[lq];B[pg]C[Don't
think it's the right time to play here first. Should tackle the white
at the bottom first.];W[pl];B[oj];W[nl];B[oq];W[or];B[np];W[mq]
;B[mj];W[ll]
(;B[kj]SQ[nl][ll][pl]C[Maybe I should have used this move to help my lone stone on the bottom instead of the next?

Also
can, but you can also strengthen up your group at the bottom and link
them up by attacking the 3 white stones. See the variation.]
;W[jl];B[hn];W[jn];B[io];W[hl]SQ[jl][ll][nl][pl]C[You
should not allow white to jump so many times from one end to another
end like this, this make him become stronger in the center and weakened
your influence around the center.];B[fn];W[fl]C[Again, white jump further.]
;B[en];W[cj]C[Maybe I could have approached this differently]

[ej][ek][dk][ck][bl][dl]C[E1 here instead?

Not
very sure what you mean. If you mean play at E1, then i suggest not to
do so. Play at G13 instead. Then you can connect two group together
later on.];W[gf]TR[gg]C[here I thought long about sacrificing those
three stone to create complications on the left side, but I was unsure
about how to do that, so I saved them

That's the only way you can do now. If can want to risk it out, you can play at G13 and sacrifice your 3 stones there.]
;B[he];W[ff];B[om];W[ol];B[nm]TR[mk]C[Can
play at N9 first. Then white seal at N8, u can play at N7 to further
strengthen your group.];W[mm];B[mn];W[ln];B[mo];W[lo];B[mp]

(;B[sc]C[I
have a better way to attck white, which would further squeeze down the
territory white gains at the corner. See variation.];W[sb];B[sd]
;W[ra];B[rn]C[Too conservative, can play at S7 instead.];W[ba]

;B[ap];W[bs];B[gs]TR[kr]C[Play
some where around L2 first, it's more beneficial  to play there first
before coming down to the smaller gains.];W[fs];B[hs];W[er]
;B[hp];W[jr]C[White is faster than you as he gains more by playing here.]

This
shows that he is not fit to be a Go player as he has insulted the
politeness, one of the important elements in Go. Unless you undo the
move which would affect the whole game, otherwise, he should allow you
to undo your move. Because it's obviously no people would pass at this
moment. I think he really wish to win this game, but this is not the
way to improve.];W[rr];B[ak];W[aj];B[al];W[nf];B[of];W[sr];B[sq]

You're welcome :)

To conclude, both of you do not have much close contact fight in this
game. Both of you are too conservative and did not have a fierce fight.
It's also very obvious that you'all try to avoid it and afraid of
losing the battle if play too deep into the opponent's territories.]

[lc][kh][fp][dp][cq][lq][mq][nq][or][pr]C[Something
like this to pressure two weak white groups?   It leaves me with little
on the left however

This is another way to play. But obviously
white on the left is not weak anymore. So if white really has weak
group. it should be the marked one. The 2 groups at the bottom are
still exposed to invasion. If you can tackle them well then you would
gain more territoty throughout the processes. Please examine carefully
:)]))
(;N[Way to tackle the 3 white stones];B[ol]C[Like this,
white must reply your move, otherwise, his stones might be captured, if
not, broken apart.];W[ok]C[let's say he plays here.];B[om]C[then you connect, but he ,ust also make sure you can't cut through his white stones.]
;W[pk];B[mm];W[ml];B[lm]C[If
both of you proceed like this, your black stones would be more secured.
What do you think?Don't hesitate to correct me if you find something
wrong here.]))
