C[I have put the comments and questions by the original player in quotes in order to distinguish them from what I have to say.

"Hi,

first I want to thank you for spending your time reviewing this game. There occured some situations where I did not know how to play. Maybe you have some ideas for me.

I played the white stones. I also added some questions. It would be great if you could answer them, but feel free to comment other moves, too. ;-)

Please give me your opinion: where were my biggest mistakes? Was there a "losing move"?

Thank you very much,
Jorg"];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[lp]LB[kp:A]C[This move strikes me as rather bizarre.. The Chinese opening move is at A for a reason. The space between this stone and the 4-4 stone on the left is quite wide.]

(;W[pj]C["Blacks position is similar to the chinese opening. I want to prevent him from making a moyo on the right side as just a matter of taste. What do you think?"
Hmm.. hard to say because a move like black's doesn't happen normally. It leaves too much
space on the left. I think a good approach would be to make a san-ren-sei at K16. Have a look at the variation.]
;B[dj];W[fq]C["I invaded because I thought that this side offers the most space to maneuver.   But..."
The correct move for an invasion and correct reasoning. There is nothing to be afraid of.]
;B[hq]C["Black 9 looks really good. It is a pincer and an extension from M4. So my kakari was probably wrong. Where would you have played White 8??"
Let's look at some variations starting from here.. After putting in the variations, I have to say I like the double approach move at A best. It seems from your comments that you didn't think of this move, so this is a good time to add it to your arsenal.]

(;W[cq]LB[dn:A]C["Maybe a one-point jump to the center is better?"
As said before, I think the double approach move at A is best but the jump is also playable. The corner invasion is definitely inferior here.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fr]LB[eq:A]C[Very bad move. Black should play at A instead.]

(;W[bo]TR[fq]C[Black's bad move has left a lot of bad aji around. I think you could try the variation and get
more territory here.]
(;B[cp]C[Vulgar. If you have to play here, try the variation.]
;W[bp];B[dn]C[Now black has to take gote and his left side is open at the bottom..]

(;W[op]TR[fq]LB[io:A][ip:B]C[Playable. But what about making some territory at the top first? Black won't get that much at the bottom because the marked white stone is still lying around supporting a move at A or B or so.. Have a look at the variation. If you make a sanrensei now you will have a better game.]

(;W[mq]LB[ip:A]C["I tried to make a base, but I found myself in trouble later on.
Where would you have played? Is the invasion at P4 ok?"
I think the first sentence should answer the second question. If you can't settle yourself, you either invaded at the wrong point or too deeply. I think you should try reducing around A.
Apart from that, I think you should still attach at R3 first.. at least you will get an eye.

;W[os]LB[oj:A][ni:B]C[I was not able to save half of the white stones around Q11 anyway, so I decided to give him four addidtional stones in order to life."
that's not "four additional stones". you lose eight connected stones (if black A, white B)]
;B[nm];W[dc];B[jc]LB[lr:A][np:B][mp:C][oo:D]C["How to handle this invasion?"
That invasion is a complete overplay, white is way too thick around there.. Black should have reduced lightly. By the way, black A is sente and should be played immediately. (if white doesn't answer, black B white C black D]

Well, you asked in the beginning whether there was a losing move. I'm not sure. Black made a lot of endgame mistakes and lost the entire left side. The two really bad moves where 22 and 48. 22 failed to make any eyes and gave you a harder time running away. And as for moves 48 and 58, you have to accept that you deserved some punishing on the right for these tenukis.. You lived on the right side only because of black's mistake.

If you asked me about weaknesses, you neglected your defence in this game. Defensive move make points too, that is points you do not lose by losing your stones. The second weakness is that at the outset of a fight you should try to slow down a bit and think about your responses longer. As shown in the endgame, it is not always appropriate to just draw out of atari, sometimes you have to show more fighting spirit.]
