C[Dear reviewer. First, let me thank you for spending your time on helping me in this game. I play black in this game.  

At the beginning, I had no problem keeping up(I think), but I may have some problems with the opening, so please tell me if i do. To me the problem arise when the game progress towards the middle game, where I became clueless on where to play next, could you please give me some suggestions? Also at end game, I had problems keeping sente. These problems of keeping sente and knowing where to go during middle often arise during my games, so tips on playing during that could help too. :)  

I think I have caught some of my simple errors, but please show me where I played wrong.  

Thanks again for reviewing this game.  

cheers Kevin (fifthdawn)];B[pp];W[dq];B[co];W[ep];B[pd];W[dn]
;B[ck]LB[cn:A][cm:B]C[Here the answer for white is A (c6) so black stones awill be cut then the corner will be white. So your stone 7 (C9) is too far from stone 3 (C5), you'd better play an ikken tobi at B.  So it is the way to be sente next. a weak play like 7 (C9) makes you gote next as you will have to answer to white pressure.]
;W[cn];B[dd]LB[ch:A]C[I think here, as your stone 7 (c9) is weak , a play like a (c12) protect for white at  a (c12).
yes you will not have big points with C12 but you will have a base. so next you will be able to attack]
;W[cf];B[ce];W[df];B[fd];W[hc];B[ch];W[ff];B[he]C[i think h15 is good as he threatens H17 and cut white in two groups]
;W[kc];B[mc]TR[cf][df][ff]LB[pj:A][jp:B]C[as white L17 give life to white, a play like A (Q10) or B (K4) is better   your two first plays Q16 and Q4 needs help now . A (Q10) is better as he give more points : you have either north or south for bulding moyo. An other way is to look at three stones white delta at C14,D14 and F14 and plan to eat them with G13. But here also Q10 is a good way to look at three stones delta]
;W[pn]C[as your answer to white L17 let Q4 alone, white take the sente]
;B[pj]C[this a not the good time to play here];W[qf];B[qd];W[np]
C[white plans would be the south];B[oo];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[on]
;W[oq];B[mn];W[jq];B[jn]LB[qh:A][pg:B]C[Would this be better at K5? or should I have played somewhere else? ------ i think here, i try to keep sente playing to frighten R14   a move like Q13    
--
K6 or K5 doesn't give a big move, they plans to invade south , but keep in mind right corner and left corner are safe for this time, so B (Q13) is better than K6 , and A (R12) better than Q13. With R12 white has two choice either save R14 either save Q6. So it is the way to be sente.]
;W[of]C[I was trying to think of a way to attack the R14 and P 14 groups, should I have attacked it? if so where will be a good place to attack?  

my next move is what i did, but i dont think it helps much.... ----------- to answer to P14, i would play R12  

white will the go n14 ,but with no points  

and after you can stabilise north-east corner
so the good idea is to take points on east];B[me];W[fb];B[ec]
;W[pm]C[as you have not given help to R10 before , white can run out]
;B[ol];W[ng]C[At this point, I had no clue where to play, where will be a good place to play?  

white can play R11 next];B[kf];W[mf];B[qh];W[ph];B[pg];W[oh]

;B[il]C[This was a mistake right? it should have been at j9 i think.  

J9 is not a good idea, it plans atari on K10 and the issue is complicated but white will run out]

;W[gn];B[gm]C[the right way for white is to eat i think a play like white E6 would be hard . So to be sente, again : don't play weak , don't let you weak stone under attack]

yes too late and almost to near white wall
