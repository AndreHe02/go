C[Hi:

I played White in this game and lost by about 40 points.

The final point count is a little deceptive, though - most of the game wasn't so lopsided. About move 90 I felt like I was ~15 points behind and tried an invasion - which didn't work and led to the larger loss.

So, while I'd like to hear how to better handle my failed invasion, what I'm really interested in understanding is how I could have improved my play before that point.

I can't see where I had made outright mistakes, but I consistently fell behind. So I'm figuring that there must have been missed opportunities along the way that I'm just missing.


Hi Bob,

My name is Darrell.  I'll do my best.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ec]
;B[qk]C[D:  Black starts with Chinese opening.  We can expect him to try to make a big moyo.]
;W[mp]C[D:  Interesting move.  Starts flattening out black's moyo.  Influence oriented.]
;B[po];W[jp]C[D:  Interesting opening.  So far, it seems reasonable.]
;B[jc];W[de]LB[jc:B][cd:C][de:A]C[D:  My first reaction is that I don't like this move.  But, I'm also not familiar with it.  So I looked on GoBase.org.  

It has been played a lot.  But in every case I looked at, B is not there.  Also, in every case I looked at, the response was a move at B.  And a final observation -- In most cases, the corner gets successfully invaded.  

So -- A move at A does not capture the corner.  It radiates influence along the top of the board.  But, on this board, influence in that direction is already of very small value because B is already in place.

A move at C would have been better in my opinion.  It takes some territory and radiates it's influence along the left side where it does some good.]

;B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[nc];B[nd];W[mc];B[gc];W[md]C[I wasn't clear on the long-term benefit of this move. But it seemed like it avoided being sealed in, which would have given Black a large double-wing moyo.

Was there something more productive to do at this point?

----------------

D:  Seems right.];B[og]
(;W[me]LB[ok:A][co:B]TR[gc][jc]C[D:  This seems too slow though.   Unless you think you can actually kill the marked black stones, this move does about nothing.

"A" looks big.  A black move around here makes the whole right side look very strong.  I think black will answer A or much of his right will go away.  Then white can play at B and start to make a little territory while pressuring the black stones on the left.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[co];W[cp];B[ok]C[D:  White has bad shape on the bottom.  Another move is required.]
;W[je];B[fd];W[ed];B[ff];W[do]LB[gq:A]C[D:  This is clearly very bad.  You cannot hope to hurt this black group.  Your whole bottom is wide open.  You MUST close that gap.  I would say this is the losing move.]
;B[gp]C[D:  I would say the game is over now.  White suddenly has two weak groups and will get very few points on the bottom.]
;W[iq]C[I'd be interested in knowing if there were better ways to respond to Black's invasion?]
;B[gn];W[in]LB[eq:A]C[D:  This is pushing from behind.  You cannot catch up with the black stones, so this just makes them stronger and does nothing for you.  Just settle one of your groups.]
;B[hm];W[im];B[fq];W[eq];B[em];W[hl];B[gl];W[hk];B[gk];W[hj]
;B[nn];W[ll]LB[jg:B][fh:A]C[D:  I think white's only hope now would be to cut black off at A.  I have no idea if this would be possible, but I would try it.  You eventually start this fight, but not until black moves into the area around B and it is much harder then.

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you have any questions.

;W[qp]C[Was this the right invasion?

And, as you'll see in the next few moves it never gets a foothold.

D:  I don't know how to invade this.  Sorry.  Just too many black stones and no weaknesses to work with.]
