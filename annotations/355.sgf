C[I played white.
I'm very interested about your comments on the beginning :
I think I have played to softly on the side and that I have had to fight hardly in the middle game to recover in the center. I took great risks ...]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[di]LB[ce:A][cn:B]C[TH: Black is planning a large scale influence game perhaps so white should watch for opportunities to disrupt this strategy.  Possibly play at A or B now.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[jp];B[jd];W[qj];B[nc];W[pf]LB[ce:A]C[TH: At this point I think A at C15 would put Black well ahead. Both white corners can be invaded and the black framework is thicker.]
;B[jj]C[At this point, as white, I felt I was back and I had to  do something about the upper left corner ...]
;W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[dg];B[gc]LB[ec:A]C[TH: There is a possible flaw at A however it is not immediately obvious how to exploit it.  So wait, something may arise or B may be persuaded to add
another move to fix it.];W[ci];B[cj];W[ch];B[dk]LB[dj:A][gn:B]
[pb:C]C[TH: Perhaps D11 is better at A, D10 for thinkness.

At this point there is a line of influence along B & C all the way across the board.  Moves anywhere along this line enlarge and reduce potential territory for both players.]
;W[pc]LB[fo:A][ne:B][ik:C][jh:D][pb:E][ld:F][fm:G][hh:H][hq:I]
C[TH:  Q17 is good in that B has no follow up here but it is relatively small (15 pts?) compared to A,B,C,or D.  Look at both the size of the move and the followup moves that it creates (F, G, H) , and at the followup moves that it eliminates such as E or I.  Then ask whether Black responses will also generate important followup potential - this is one problem with invasions that are too deep or allow responses that attack two or more groups, perhaps D will fall in this category.  Since A prevents black from playing here with the threat of invading at I this is bigger - reverse the logic for B.  C & D are in a different category - break up opponents influence before enlarging your own.]
;B[go]LB[fo:A]C[this hurt me badly, maybe I should have played at A as white]
;W[hp];B[in];W[cq]C[was it right ?];B[dq]LB[dr:A][cp:B][br:C]
[bq:D][cr:E][bp:F][er:G][bn:H]C[TH: sequence A-E is expected.  B is reduced and F is gote for White.  If B cuts at G after A then White gets a larger corner with H after C or E]
;W[cr]C[TH: D2 is more common than C2];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[dr]
;B[pn]LB[or:A]C[TH: this is large, perhaps A is better since left side is larger.]

(;W[mq]LB[qn:A][on:B]C[TH: I would play either A or B instead.  The white stones to the left are alive if B invades around N3 so make it hard for B to settle this stone.]

(;B[qp];W[qq];B[qo];W[rq];B[op];W[oq];B[pk];W[qk];B[pl];W[pj]
;B[ne]C[TH: White has more secure territory, about 60-70 pts to about 40 for Black.  But I prefer the black position because of much greater potential territory.]
;W[ei]LB[gf:A][gi:B]C[I regretted it later. May I'd better play A, but then Black closes with B]

LB[fd:A]C[TH: F16 looks like a good move for B.];B[mh]LB[og:A]
C[another blow ...
TH: A may be better in this area];W[nk]LB[nj:A]C[maybe A was better, to be connected
TH: White should be feeling desparate so extreme measures are called for]

;B[rk];W[rj];B[sl];W[mo];B[on];W[no];B[jl];W[ob]C[Then I try desperately to reduce black : it is so big in the center]
;B[nb];W[na];B[ma];W[oa];B[mb];W[nf];B[mf];W[ng];B[mg];W[ec]
C[TH: W has 85 (50 across bottom, 30+ in upper right
B has 60 in top center and 30 in lower left so B should be trying to wrap up the game]

;W[al]LB[gf:A]C[In the end white managed to invade the center from A, taking advantage of a black mistake, and reduced black's right side, threatening to disconnect it and kill (just threatening)]
