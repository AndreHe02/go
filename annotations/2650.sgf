C[This is a game my brother and I played against each other.  He is Xif on KGS and I am Bruinfix.  We are both 11k on the KGS server.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk];W[jq];B[de];W[ci]LB[cg:A]C[All pretty reasonable up to here.
This move is perhaps a little slack "A" would be the usual move here.]
;B[ge]LB[ge:9][ci:8]TR[cp][jq]CR[dc]C[This is probably not the best response here. If the triangled stones were black then 9 would be a good move because it would be attacking 8.
In this situation black should settle hmself by playing in contact with the circled stone]
;W[gc]CR[dc]C[OK - althoughthe circled stone is probably safe enough to et away with playing again from below and building white's moyo.]
;B[ep]TR[de][ge]C[It seems a bit premature to create another weak group when you already have one on the board - best to settle the triangled stones first.]
;W[eo]C[Teh contact play here is not good - as it allows black to settle his weak stone.]
;B[fo];W[en];B[fp]LB[io:C][hp:B][cq:A]C[This move looks heavy to me - when in your opponent's sphere of influence you don't need to hang on to every stone  so connecting is not top priority. Trying to build a base in the corner with "A" looks better. White now has attacking possibilities around "B", "C" etc.]
;W[po]C[Which he strangely ignores in facvour of making a weak group of his own...]
;B[op];W[no];B[lq];W[oo];B[lo]TR[jq]SQ[fo][ep][fp]CR[no][oo]
[po]C[Now it is white triangled stone under attack and white has another weak group - the circled stones - to worry about also.
Black only haad to play some obvious moves so it is white's own fault]
;W[gq];B[np]C[A wasted move];W[qm];B[jc]C[why tenuuki when you have two weak groups on the run?]
;W[om]LB[nk:A]CR[pk]C[This just make the group heavier - better to play in contact with the circled stone or run away properly with something around "A"]
;B[nk]LB[nk:A]CR[om]C[Now black gets "A " see how weak white's stones are and how useless the circled stone is.]
;W[qi]C[this just makes another weak group which black can attack!]
;B[qj];W[qf];B[qe];W[oj];B[ok];W[pj];B[pi]C[An awful move - just connect]
;W[qk]
(;B[qh]C[This just has to be a blunder - see variations for  better line for black - letting white capture here and settle his weak stones is terrible.]
;W[rj];B[ri];W[qj];B[pg];W[rh];B[rg];W[si];B[pf]CR[nk][ok][pk]
[gq][jq]C[You are both scrabbling around for fairly umiportant points here - leave this for the endgame - both players have weak groups to attack and defend (circled)]
;W[jo]C[OK - white defends his weak stiones];B[mm]LB[pf:45]
C[and black defend his but he could have attacked white and helpedhis own stones by playing K5 instead of 45 (which is unnecessary )]
;W[gn]CR[fo][ep][fp]C[Now the circled stones are weak again - and this time white attacks them - better late than never...]

(;B[go]C[ugh - empty traingle  see variation for a better way]
;W[hp];B[fn];W[fm];B[gm];W[ho];B[em];W[fl]LB[gn:A]C[Just capture "A" now!]
;B[do];W[dn];B[co];W[cn];B[dp];W[hn]C[why didn't black capture one of the white stones - I don't understand these moves...
The black group should struggle now];B[bn];W[cm]LB[dl:A]C[No play A much better shape]
;B[cq];W[hl];B[eh];W[ej]LB[id:D][cf:C][ej:68][el:B][em:A]C[The white stones are strong - if you are worried about A getting free - just capture it now with B.
Otherwise build some side territory and undermine black with C or split him with D.

68 - is a half measiure move  it doesn' kill the aji of A properly  -but it doesn't do much else either - apart from takign a couple of points of territory.]

You are both too ready to make weak groups by invading early on - and don't seem to know how to attack/defend them so the paly becomes rather undirected. A number of move seem to be blunders - allowing weak groups off the hook. or giving stones away needlessly.

I ahven't commented on the endgame - because if either of you had played the middle game properly it wouldn't have been needed!]
