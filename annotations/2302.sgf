C[No problem.  Some general comments on how I approach this.  

I'll address all the questions you pose and leave your question at the bottom for your reference.  

I also tend to set up alternate examples to exemplify my points, so look for the variations. I'll mention they are there in my commentary.
 
Besides commenting on your game play, I will also comment on errors by your opponent which essentially gets you a two for one review.  :)

If you have any questions please email me at salvor7@yahoo.com

(Thanks for reviewing this game for me.)];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp]
;W[pd];B[iq];W[ck]C[One step to close to black?  I would suggest going back one to C10 as it is more standard. Its subtle but black's corner could expand at E4 and it feels like C9 would need some defence should black do that.  Black almost gains a sente play with E4 which is very efficient for him and thus bad for you.

Also think about a less contentious play at K16 or 17, a mirror play.  Keep things reletively even till a really good opportunity appears.]
;B[qf];W[nc]C[Your after two things in the opening: efficient influence of the board with coordinated stones and disruption of the opponents attempts of the same.  The best moves are therefore those that drastically enhance your  great degree of influence or drastically reduce your opponent's.  

With that in mind it would appear that a pincer might be better to keep a black play at Q10 from being really useful to him.  J3 Q4 Q10 would form a "double wing" for black a highly efficient moyo shape.  One must remeber the pincer is contenious; in other words, you had better be capable of close fighting because it will be unavoidable.

O16 would allow for a slightly easier invasion of the black moyo on the right side then does O17.  The corner, however, suffers from a higher degree invabality :)  

All in all, style can be more important in these desicions.  If you don't like close fighting pincering could be your worst choice.  Like wise you might just want the base the O17 provides and use black's Q10 move to shift the play to somewhere you want it to.  

(Perhaps this is too conservative? Better to pincer at r12 or play at o16?)]
;B[pj];W[ep]C[Memorize the double wing formation.  It strength comes out here for black very nicely.  
In addition to that focus on how groups develop.  Invasions and attacks inspire building and fortification, so when you consider the fact few groups should ever die 
during a game, those groups get fortified and exert influence for the remainder of the game. 
Looking to this position J3 and C4 will both get fortifiied and neither is likely to die.  It is particularly bad for white here as J3 is facing Q4 across a wide area.  White is actually building a huge moyo for black along the lower side by playing here.  This is the essence of thinness and thickness.  

In short this is a bad play, but thats due to black's ability to capatilize on it to a degree that far exceeds whites gains.  I'll explain further as this develops.  

(Correct timing?)];B[dn]C[Another problem with E4 is shown here.  It is "out of step" with C9 and they are close enough to each other to allow black to play stones that prevent connection and attack both simultaneouly, such as this.  

Remember as aa opponents group gets pressured it gets stronger as more stones are added around it.  So as you try to save E4 black's corner group will add further stones making itself stronger.  What will follow is that all your efforts have been focussed on E4 and C9 will be left defenseless to the now strong black corner.  Strong against weak.  Advantage black.]
;W[cq]C[This feels like the wrong direction.  4th row stones are better at running to the center then building a living shape.  I would suggest G4 followed by an F7.

Alternatively, if this stone is meant as a sacrifice and it is used to help E4 develop then this is a very viable play.  I show a variation after black's response to this.]
;B[bq]
(;W[bp];B[co];W[br];B[dq];W[cr];B[dp];W[aq];B[eo]C[Consider the number of points that corner is worth.  Compare that to the space between D3 and J3.  Black has a decided advantage in the tally.  E4 also doesn't have that much potential (aji) being smushed against black's strength as it is.  

Black is also coordinating across the whole lower side from D4 to Q4 due to the thickness of the D4 stones and the lack of approaches to Q4.  Your manuver for the corner has helped black build wider coordination of his stones.  In fact an argument could be made that the D4 stones are so strong that they are forming a connection with the Q10 stone, making for a massive area of black influence.]
;W[nq]C[4th line invasion here.  You don't want life in the area, you want to escape and divide black,s right and left side stones by driving to the center between them.]
;B[lq];W[qq]C[The very worst thing you could do.  Black will end up with the strength at D4 facing strength in the bottom right corner and will have the coordinating stones in the center already.  You continue to build black's moyo for him.]
;B[pq];W[pr]C[Look at this again.  Do you really think black is making the error here?

(I know I made an error in the sequence herel Black ought to have played r4, I think.)]
;B[or];W[qp];B[po];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn];B[pn];W[qm];B[pm]C[Black's moyo radiates strength and does not have many really viable approaches for you to reduce it.  I don't feel white has been compensated for this advantage adequately with the two corners that were secured.]
;W[jd];B[cf];W[ch]
(;B[ef]C[I am sensing a over estimation of the corners importance in your play and commentary.  In this position invading the corner would be the very worst thing for black.  See variations.

(I was thankful he played here. I think B would have done better to invade the corner.)]
;W[fd];B[bd]C[This is an error on black's part.  Should play develop that the C14 series of stones gets really strong C17 would be an excellent end game move for black.  Here black removes that potential and gains nothing for it.  B16 to C14 is not really a viable eye space and besides this style of play isn't set on building a living shape there, but running out to the center and connecting or living in the center.]
;W[cc];B[gf];W[jf]C[Why?  This merely encourages F11 which puts pressure on C12&8 and K14 makes no gains for white.  Namely, it is not coordinated with O17 or Q16 to form a moyo shape.  See variation.]

(;B[ie]
(;W[je]C[Very worst move possible!  Why save a worthless stone in place of building a massive side territory?  See variation.]
;B[id]C[so painful for white.];W[bc]C[Your trying to ensure life.  J16 would have prevented the need for this.]
;B[cd]C[There is no need for black to respond to this.  B16 is a minor stone.  Black should turn to bigger matters like P14 say.]

(;W[ed]C[Needlessly conservative.  See variation.];B[de]C[Needlessy conseervative as well.  You give sente back to black and he wastes it needlessly.  E8 strikes me as huge for black also.]
;W[bm];B[ic];W[jc]C[You have to choose your direction so as to build territory.  The K16 series of stones is facing O17 alone (Q16 is too close to R14 for it to help build a moyo).  However, G17 seems to build more territory and prevent the massive reduction move of F18 or the like.]
;B[dl];W[er];B[dr];W[ds];B[eq];W[fr];B[fq];W[gr];B[hq]C[Too little too late and as predicted E4 didn't have enough aji to really allow for a good invasion of black's moyo.]
;W[ej]C[Perhaps to late to really achieve anything.  Learnign to invade this is uselsss I think, learning to prevent it is more pretinent.

(I wanted to get inside his moyo, have a place to reduce.)]
;B[rd]C[Black goes for a small move?  F9!! P14!!  Something worth the effort.   Even R17 doesn't threaten the life of that white group.  Not sure why black bothers.]
;W[qc]C[Nor am I sure why you bother :)  O17 to K17 provide a wide enoguh eye space that white needn't worry.  Additionally white has P14 in response to R17.  None of this is really urgent while F9 is and F9 is sure ot get a response so you can come back to the top right corner later.]
;B[rc];W[rb]C[Good you recognize it as small because it is. White is not at risk of dying here by any stretch.  While I don't like K9 myself due to its disconnection from the other white groups, soem reducing move is drastically needed if white is hoping to pull through this game with even a potential for a tie.  

(I think this was small. Better to play at k9?)];B[qo];W[ro]
;B[ql]
(;W[qh]C[I feel you need to get some grasp of how 3rd line stones can be developed and how 4th line stones can be.  

3rd line stones are generally used to try and create a base for a new group or to secure a base for an existing group.

4th line stones are meant to influence the center or attack with the option to run to the center.

It is quite plain that the area around R12 is not optimal for an attempt to make life, suggesting that a running attack in the area is better then trying to make life here.  Thus R12 should likely be Q12.  Additionally the very stable white corner group is right there for Q12 to run to.  See variation.

(Again, I don't think this is the biggest point.)];B[og]C[Black ruins the potential territory you could have built with the K17 wall here.]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[rl];B[rk];W[qk];B[rm];W[pl]C[Scanning ahead you are very lucky.  It looks like you should die on both sides.  This is very messy.

(I got myself in trouble here. Luckily, I survived.)];B[rn]
;W[ql];B[rp];W[rq];B[so];W[os];B[nr]C[Yup.  White should die.

(Black could have killed me by playing at q1, correct?)];W[ns]
;B[ms];W[ps]
(;B[mq]C[Again black misses the opportunity.  See variation.]
;W[rs]
(;B[ol]C[Hmm I think black has a chance to kill this group.  Lets see in the variation if its possible.]
;W[rj];B[qi];W[ri];B[ok];W[sk];B[rg];W[rh];B[pg]
(;W[gj]C[Probably.  E7 looks interesting.  See variation.

(Too conservative.)];B[gl];W[hk];B[hl];W[ik];B[il]C[This is too easy on Black.]
;W[kj];B[jk];W[jj]C[Your not building any territory white.  You make a wall of stones but they face black stones so the wall has no potential for making territory.  At least not to make this sequence worth while.]
;B[kk];W[lj];B[lk];W[ni]C[This is a threat for later.  Ko threat maybe, aji to be saved for later at least.  J14 looks interetsing.]

Major points
Your opening theory needs filling out as black had a decided advantage through most of the game mainly due to mistakes by white.  

Black didn't bring it all together with a number of small mistakes later and not making the kill of whites lower right corner group or whites group on the right side.  

An opening advantage does not always guarantee a huge win, or a win at all, but it is far better to come through the opening with a more balanced situation so your, in this case, superior end game skills would gain you a win instead of close lose.

Points to study
Opening theory and the ideas of thickness/thinness to help with an understanding of why the corners aren't quite as important as I think you feel they are.  

Also some study of life and death problems to fortify your understanding of how to use 3rd and 4th line stones and their situational appropriateness.

Hopefully this will be useful to some small degree.  If anything is unclear or vague email me and I'll try to give a clearer explanation.]
