C[Alex: This was a strange game: my opponent played the Chinese fuseki, then made no attempt to build a moyo, so that we both ended up with lots of little groups!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]LB[jp:A]C[Black A is the usual move to develop the lower side.]
;B[cn]LB[cc:C][dc:D][dk:B][fq:A]C[Alex: isn't it more usual to approach from F3?

In this position, personally I would prefer White A to secure the corner or B to develop the side.

If White play B, when Black enter at C, White can block at D, pls study the variations at move 10.]
;W[dj]
(;B[bp]C[Quite an unusual move.];W[cq];B[cl]LB[gq:A]C[White G3 is better.]
;W[fq];B[bj]C[Responding at D12 is not that good.

With the marked Black stone around, it means there is NO potential for White to develop the top left side.

Pls look at the variation at move 15.]
(;W[ch]LB[cc:B][cf:A]C[I don't agree with White C12 as there are still invasions around A or B.]
;B[fc]LB[eb:C][dc:A][cf:B][jp:D]TR[ch]C[This invasion is too early, Black should choose to develop the lower side at D.

If White play A, Black can invade  B...

If White play B, Black can invade at C...

This means White can't get much at top left corner.

Now you can see how inefficient is White C12 (the marked stone).]
;W[ec];B[fd]
(;W[df]LB[cc:B][bh:A]C[You placed to many White stones on the top left corner, resulting in inefficiency if you don't get enough points to justify.

There is still Black A (yose) to reduce and Black B aji to destroy the corner later when the group outside is safe.

You should play H16 pincer, to balance the force :)

Pls look at the variation at move 19.];B[hc];W[jc]

Pls study the variation at move 22.];W[jf];B[hg];W[jh];B[hi]
;W[jj]LB[eb:B][hk:A][jp:C]C[I think Black should still play A to be safe.

Even though White can get B to secure the top left corner, Black can have C to develop the lower side

The game is still even.];B[cc]C[Risky move.];W[eb]
(;B[bd]C[Bad move by Black, pls see the variation at move 30.]
;W[bf];B[ce];W[de];B[cf];W[cg];B[be];W[hk]C[Good move by White.]
;B[gj]
(;W[gk];B[fj];W[fk];B[eg];W[dg];B[ff]
(;W[ek]C[Alex: A shame to take gote like this, but what else is there?

Even though Black has snatched the White corner at top left as well as got a living group in the middle...  

In return, White got a nice influence in the center, still not as bad as you may think.

Looking back, Black should play H9 instead of invading the corner.]
;B[bg]C[This is unnecessary, a very slow move, when White play B13 or B12, Black can play B18 for survival.]
;W[bh]C[Well, a very slow move by White also...

Black can choose to tenuki to play the variation at move 49.]
;B[af]TR[bh]C[Alex: what's the best way to use white's central influence?

You got lucky, Black A14 to reply White B12, all this are end-game moves.

Pls see the variation at move 49 for the answer to your question above.]

(;W[mp];B[kq]C[Good move by Black, look very flexible.]
(;W[iq]C[I am not satisfied with White J3.

Pls look at the variation at move 51.];B[ko]
(;W[po]LB[oo:A]C[I think this is an overplay, you did not correct Black to play at A next.

Pls look at the variation at move 53 for the correct move for White and also variation at move 54 for that of Black.]

(;B[mr]C[A rather weak move by Black.];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[nq]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[qm];B[ok]LB[qc:A]C[Alex: I expected Q11 or R11 instead.

Black Q11 will be more solid, however White can enter top right corner at A.

White Q10 look like an overplay.

Pls look at the variation at move 63.]
(;W[pj];B[pk];W[ph];B[ri];W[nh];B[qg]TR[nh][ph][ri][pj][pk]
C[Compare the efficiency of the 3 marked White stones and that of Black.

White played dame while Black got some points...

Pls look back at the variation at move 63.];W[qc];B[pc];W[rd]
;B[qd];W[qb]C[Alex: the joseki books I've looked at seem to say that either Q18 or S18 is right here, but it seems to me that either of those moves makes it easier for black to build a wall and later invade around M18.

White S18 can't work, the corner will be dead after Black R18 then P18.

If White Q18 then Black R18.

Your actual move is correct, you always have to examine at the situation before you apply any book moves.]
;B[re];W[pb];B[nd];W[mc];B[md]LB[lc:A]C[White A better, more solid.]
;W[ld];B[rl];W[rm];B[rc];W[rb];B[sd]LB[bq:A]C[White should play this move which worth at least 15 pts.

N9 is losing move of this game.];W[mk];B[bq]LB[dm:A][em:B]C[Point A is sente for White (Black need to play C7), better to play it before Black play at B.

Pls study the variation at move 87.]
(;W[cr]LB[jr:A]C[Alex: I think I was a bit too cautious here.

Black should play A in sente and then N14.];B[mf];W[le]LB[cm:B]
