All my comments begin with RR:

This review will be directed towards the white player.

Please contact me with any questions.

C[RR:  I don't know many Joseki, but I believe that White should extend along the left side here.  Somewhere around the marked location.

The actual move by white is a good local move, as it captues the corner.  But black can play on the left side, and remove the base of the lower two stones.]
;B[cj];W[cl]C[RR:  I think this is the right move in this situation.]
;B[cf]TR[ch]C[RR:  I think that black extends 1 too far.  White can now split black by playing the middle (marked) location.  This would be a very good attack for white.]
;W[qf]TR[ec]C[RR:  Good direction.  Since the marked white stone is on the third line, there isn't much room to extend or make territory in the upper side.]
;B[pf]C[RR:  By the reason stated above, this is the wrong direction.  Black will get a big wall facing the upper left, but there is a white stone there on the third line.]
;W[qg]TR[pg]C[RR:  I do know this Joseki.  The correct response is to play up on the 4th line.  And then continue by extending down the right side.]
;B[qe];W[ld]C[RR:  This is not a big spot to play.  A bigger spot is on the right side.]
;B[nq]C[RR:  Black now plays the wrong direction.  By playing on the right side, it would be both an attack on the two white stones, and trying to extend to the stones in the lower left.]
;W[pn]C[RR:  Good move by white.];B[dd]TR[ch]C[RR:  Black is trying to protect its weakness at C-12, discussed before.]
;W[dc];B[de];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo]C[RR:  This is a good exchange for white.]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[kd];W[le];B[ke];W[lf];B[gc]C[RR:  Interesting exchage.  White seperates Black from the upper left, and black gets power towards the upper left.  I think this exhange favors Black.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[nc];B[pg];W[qh];B[nn];W[oe];B[pe];W[oj]TR[pk]
C[RR:  This is an important stone for White, as it trys to connect the upper and lower group.  But I think it is a bit weak, and black can exploit some weaknesses.  I tend to play more conservative, playing at the marked Q-9 location.]
;B[qb]C[RR:  Black now makes room for life.];W[hc]TR[fd]C[RR:  Interresting attack.  I didn't see this when I looked at the previous board position.  However, I don't know if I like it, because of the weak group in the corner.  I think I would have tried to keep the black group un-connected by playing F16.]
;B[hd];W[gd];B[fd];W[ge];B[fc];W[id];B[hb];W[ic];B[ib];W[be]
TR[cc]C[RR:   The white corner group is now a bit stronger (but the cut at C17 still exists) but the black group can still be connected.]
;B[bf];W[ed];B[oi]TR[fe]C[RR:  Black should not play elsewhere here.  The urgent move is F15.  White would then need to choose whether to keep the two groups dis-connected by playing E15, or capturing the H15 stone.  Perhaps this is a ladder breaker that I don't see right now.]
;W[pi];B[ni];W[kf];B[fe];W[gf];B[jf];W[li];B[he];W[if];B[ie]
;W[je];B[jd];W[hf];B[jc]C[RR:  Oops, this is very good for black.]
;W[jg];B[ee];W[ej]C[RR:  Better to make life in the top left corner right now.]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[dl];W[jp];B[jq];W[nj];B[ng];W[re];B[rd];W[rf]
C[RR:  This move is gote, and not important at this point.  If black caputres the white stone, it will be in gote, and not many points exchanged.  It would be best to play elsewhere now.]

;B[fo];W[em];B[ep];W[el];B[gm];W[hk];B[hl];W[il];B[im];W[gl]
;B[hm];W[jl]C[RR:  Now white is obviously playing for center territory.  Black  can use this information to push at white, reducing the territory.]

;B[go];W[io];B[bc]TR[cb]LB[cc:1][ea:2]C[RR:  What if black attacks from the C18 position first?
White 1, then black 2, connecting out to the H18 stone?

There are many variations here (and I don't know how to use this SGF tool to show them) but I think that the white stones are very unhappy.]

;W[hh];B[hg];W[ig];B[gh];W[gi];B[eh];W[hi]C[RR:  No more moves past this point, so I suspect that Black lost on time?

A quick look at the approximate score:

Black = 17 on the bottom right,  5 on the bottom left, 16 on the left/top, 14 on the top right,   + 12 prisoners = 64 pts

White = 64 in big group, 7 on top left, and 2 prisoners = 73 pts.

So, depending on komi, white was 10~15 points ahead anyway.


Things I think that white can do better in future games:

1)  White's style seems to be:  play fast and loose, and clean up an problems later.  Since White was a better fighter in this game than Black, white came out with a win.  For White to improve, I suggest learning how to create good shape in the beginning part of the game, and using these shapes to expand in the middle game, rather than getting to the middle game and then starting fights.

2)  Next time white asks for a review, some comments as to what the player was thinking or doing really helps.]
