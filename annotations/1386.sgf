;B[ic]C[Per:

Black could also play R17];W[qc];B[fc];W[ec];B[qd]C[Per:

Black should answer at F16. 
R16 is only making it easy for white to attack at Q12 latter.]
;W[rb]C[Per: 

White should take advantage of blacks mistake and play F16. The upper right corner group is safe.]
;B[fd]C[Per:

Good];W[df]C[Per:

Now the game is even again.];B[cn];W[cl];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq]
C[Per:

This is an overplay from white. See variations for ways to exploit it.]

(;B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co]C[Per:

So far good play from black];B[bn];W[ap]C[Per:

White should play D6];B[aq];W[ao];B[ep]C[Per:

Good];W[eo];B[fp];W[er];B[dr];W[gq];B[gp]C[Per:

Good move allthough you should play D6 first.];W[dn]
(;B[fq];W[hq];B[fr];W[kq]C[Per:

This turned out OK for black.];B[nq];W[io];B[ci]C[Per:

Black shows a good sense of direction.

In a situation where you move into the opponents area it is where important to keep several options open.
I would have played C12.  This leaves 3 options open C15, E12 and C10.]
;W[ei];B[bf];W[ce];B[be];W[bd]
(;B[bk]C[Per:

In a thight situation like this contact moves is best.
Again the direction is good but D9 would be better.

Go back and see variation];W[bl];B[ck];W[dk];B[dj];W[ek];B[ng]
C[Per:

The black group on the left is still open for attacks.
For example B12 looks very nasty.];W[le];B[dm];W[em];B[al]C[Per:

This is small.];W[dl];B[an];W[do];B[am];W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[jd]

;W[ok];B[om]C[Per:

When you attack you should'nt touch the opponent stones. This will only help white.]

C[Per:

Good sequence.];W[gi];B[li]C[Per:

Playing F12 is very important !!!!

It secures the left group and aims at C17 in the corner.
Black dosn't have to worry of white's center. It is open at G6 and M4.]

As a final comment i would like to say that you showed a good sense of direction, but your fighting skills could be better.

I will recomend that you read 'Attack and defence' , by Ishida Akira and James Davies.  It is a very good book on the subject.]

In the normal joseki E3 and E2 would be on the board.
So the downside for white is that the the C5 group have lost a liberty and H3 is no longer sente.]

Now black can cut here because there will be a cut at D5.];W[fq]
