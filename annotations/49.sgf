;B[dp]C[Hello!  I hope you enjoy the review!

I'm going over it now and I realize I just made comments on black/s move, since you are Black....(next time i will comment on both )]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[cd];B[jq];W[fc];B[jd]C[Generally speaking, if you want to invade here, the third line is better...for example, if you invade at L17, you can make a nice extension for a base to either o17 or h17...coming in on the fourth line makes it harder to make a base here]
;W[oc];B[mc]C[now watch what happens in the next few moves, up to the next comment:]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[ic];B[jc];W[ne];B[me];W[nd];B[md];W[pg]C[now you have made maybe 8 points, life is still not absolutely assured, and your opponent has made himself strong on both sides...this is to be somewhat expected, because you did go into the area where he was stronger, so you cannot come out ahead, but still,if you had started on the 3rd line the situation would be somewhat better]

;B[lq];W[lp];B[on];W[nn];B[nm];W[nj];B[ok]C[this move is too small,,,,,there are lots of bigger places on the board to play, for example c10 orh3 or 4 or j16 ....always try to make the biggest move on the board....keep the whole board in mind,,,,a common error is to keep playing in an area even when it is time to leave and go on to bigger things]
;W[mn];B[jp]C[nice move!!! very big!
compare this position to one with a White stone here!!!];W[mm]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[mg];W[fq];B[gq]C[IMPORTANT GENERAL RULE: do not attach to a stone you are trying to attack...it just makes the stone stronger..here h3 is enough...of course, W could treat the stone lightly and then jump into the 3-3 point at c3, but then you got the h3 move for free]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[eo];B[do];W[go];B[ep]C[this does not do much...h5 better]
;W[en];B[dn];W[ho]C[. now W gets h5.....see the difference between W getting this versus B getting this]

;B[eq];W[fo];B[dr];W[ko];B[kq]C[not as big as something on the left side...maybe c8 or d8 or c10 or...]
