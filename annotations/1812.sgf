C[Hi, my name is Martin, playing now 6 months go. I hope i maybe around 10 kyu now (even so some games as 19kyu player which GTL reviewed aren`t that long ago..).

At the moment i try playing better player to improve my own play.

I`m black and start the game. Thx for the review.];B[qd];W[dp]
;B[pq];W[od]C[Is it better to defend black here ? I thought gaining another corner could be bigger, black isn`t in trouble yet.

Defending is okay, taking the empty corner is okay :)];B[dc]
;W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[fd]LB[ec:C][fc:B][ed:A]C[Is F16 good ? Or is F/G17 or J17 better ? (my Joseki is poor..*g*)

A, B and your move are usual moves here. B is the most commonly used move (and good in this position). The move played leaves a weakness at C.]
;W[jc];B[di]LB[dj:A]TR[fd]C[Good! White didn't finish the joseki with A, so attacking is natural. It makes also use of the high position of the marked stone.]
;W[ck];B[oc]LB[bi:A][ej:B]C[I think you should continue at the left side with A or B instead.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[pf];W[fb]C[Too low!];B[fc]C[Good answer.]
;W[gb];B[eb]
(;W[bi]LB[ci:A]C[Too low again. If White wants to play here, he should play at A (see variation).]
;B[fq]LB[qk:A][cq:C][jq:B]TR[pf]C[The marked stone is high, which means he says something like "please continue from here, with my help, you can build up a nice framework" to you. Maybe you should listen to him and play A. If then WB, you can invade at C. But B F3 is okay, too :)]
;W[er]C[I had to play C3 now, or ?

W E2 is a good move. C3 would be a bad answer.];B[eq];W[dq]

;B[np];W[qq];B[pp]LB[ql:E][qp:B][or:D][qr:A][rr:C]C[Bad idea, joseki is BA, WB, BC or BD, WE.]
;W[qp]
(;B[qn]LB[qr:A]C[Most likely the worst move of the game! Black forces White to build a strong , unvulnerable group by connecting his stones, and gets nothing in return. Avoiding such moves will make you a stone stronger! BA is much better! (see variation)]
;W[qo];B[kp]LB[qr:A]C[A is still better.];W[pr]C[Good.];B[or]
;W[qr];B[oo]LB[nq:B][nr:A]C[This leaves a weakness at A. B is the proper move.]

A looks fine.];W[ph]C[Good move.];B[oh];W[pi]LB[oi:A]C[A is better. White should avoid building a weak group.]

C[This is pure endgame & much too small!];B[rf]LB[pl:A]C[Again only an endgame move. If Black wants to continue to play in this part of the board, A is much better.]
;W[pl];B[me];W[ld];B[md]LB[lb:A][nb:B]C[This (and the next move) is nearly as bad as R6! Black gains nothing, but he solidifies the white position and destroys many interesting possibilities, for example A, which threatens to connect at B, or to cut with B N16, W N17, B M16, or to play L17 or even K18, depending on how the position has developed in the meanwhile.]
;W[mc];B[le];W[kd];B[hc];W[hb];B[ic];W[ib];B[dm]C[A good move!]

[rs:w][ss:w]C[Now Black has sente. There is no local fight going on, so this is a perfect moment to estimate the score.

White has:

24 points in the lower left
13 points on the upper side
26 points in the lower right (including two prisoners)
6  points of Komi

that makes a total of ~ 70 points. 

Black has:

13 points in the upper right
19 points in the upper left
18 points at the bottom
5   prisoners

that makes a total of  ~ 55 points.

In order to win, Black has to transform his outer influence  into 20 points of territory. This should be really no problem!

(Note: I am not that sure about my counting of the black territiory at the bottom, it would be interesting to ask a strong player about this.)]

(;B[ff]LB[fi:B][jj:D][nl:C][os:A]C[This is a pass (well, more or less). What should Black have done instead? If he has no idea where to play, simply taking a big point like A would be a good idea. This is worth between 10 and 15 points, which would  mean that both players have nearly the same amount of secure territory. Then, for Black to transform his thickness into 10 points should be very easy .
If Black wants to go for a big center territory, he should play B or C or D (see variations).]
;W[jf]C[Please compare B F14 and W K14! Which one is better?]
;B[ie]LB[jj:A]C[Is attacking or save play here better ? K14 was a perfect move, from my point of view.

B J15 is almost worthless, too! A would still build a huge territory in the center.]

(;W[ke]LB[kf:A]C[Very bad shape :) A is better. White can also jump into the center, which is maybe best. (see variation)]
;B[kg]LB[jh:A]C[Better at A.];W[jg];B[ki]LB[jh:A][jj:B]C[Is this move correct ? I`m very bad at center play...

You are strong in the center, so you should not  fear any fight. A is better. And B is still possible, of course :)]

SQ[lf]C[From the triangled to the squared stone, neither side has taken any territory worth speaking of, but Black lost sente! White O2 instead is a move with a lot of substance.]

C[After the game i remembered the bad left bottom corner play... Anyway, what you think are the reasons for the loss?

Solid endgame by both players.

You lost the game because of your consecutive passes around move 100. But don't be too disappointed, making a center territory is by no means easy :), and using the whole board is a skill you must be 1d to achieve. Maybe you should analyse the game around this point! And please try to avoid such aji-destroying moves like N16 and R6.

Thanks for sending your game,
