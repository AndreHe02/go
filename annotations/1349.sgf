C[I played B.

I've been told previously that I'm lack of focus in the games I play.

I don't understand much about focus, so do you think in this game I still showed that kind of weakness? What should I do to reduce or maybe eliminate that weakness?

I was outplayed in the beginning, the opponent managed to get way ahead, and also around mid-game, I lost two stones, which I think were quite important.

Just need suggestions if can you make a come back once left with a huge gap?

And also I would appreciate if you can comment on my style of play in general (weakness, etc.).


samtregar: Hello.  I'll be reviewing your game.  I play on KGS at 14k and at the New York Go Center at around 7k.  You didn't mention your rank, but I hope I'm good enough to make useful comments on your game.  However, please realize that I am not an expert and that better players would likely disagree with some of my statements.  If you have questions for me, please write me at sam@tregar.com, or find me on KGS under the name samtregar.

samtregar: In this game both players made many mistakes, particularly in the midgame.  My sense is that white had a better plan, but had a harder time implementing it.  In contrast, black seems to not have a very good plan, but black's tactics are usually better.  It is interesting to see that this results in a win by white.  Maybe Go requires a plan after all!

samtregar: as far as a lack of focus, I think that might be what I'm calling "not having a plan".  Your plays sometimes look like they don't have a goal, you're just reacting to your opponent even when a reaction is not required.  While playing, always keep in mind what you're trying to gain.  If you are attacking a group, focus on the attack.  If you are trying to build territory then do that.  Mixing moves from different plans won't work.

samtregar: To answer your other question, whether it is possible to come back from a bad openning, the answer is yes but it's not easy.  You must find bad plays by your opponent during the middle game and exploit them.  But once the middle game is over, coming back during end game is almost impossible.  I'll try to point out some moves that might have turned the tables on white.]
;MA[ab]LB[dd:A][pd:B][dp:D][pp:C]C[(GTL ed.: there was a move at the marked position (A18) - this seems to be an error and the move has been removed. Please keep this in mind when reading samtregar's comments.)

samtregar: this is a very unusual move, and not something I've seen before in the opening.  Usually one plays on the first line only during the endgame.  The reason is that a play on the first line doesn't secure any territory and doesn't produce any useful influence in the center.  A more usual move would be at or around a corner star point at A, B, C or D.]
;B[qd]LB[dd:A][pp:B]C[samtregar: why did black play twice in a row?  Is this a handicap game?  In a 2 handicap game black starts with stones at A and B.  Then white plays first.  I've never seen Go rules that allow a player to play twice in a row, under any circumstances.]
;W[qp];B[dc]LB[dp:A]TR[ab]C[samtregar: this move shows why the marked move was no good.  You need another stone here to get anything in the corner.  Imagine if your first move had been here, then you could have played this move around A.  That would give you three corners to white's one.  Corners are very important in Go since they are the easiest places to make territory.]
;W[cp];B[qm]LB[jd:D][dj:E][pj:C][jp:B][jq:A]C[samtregar: I like A or B better.  Splitting your opponents stones is a good way to start an attack.  Even if you don't capture, you'll gain influence.  Of course, this early in the game many moves are possible and your move cannot be considered bad.  Other possibilities are around C, D and E.]
;W[ce]LB[ab:A]C[samtregar: the standard approach, ignoring A.  Notice how your initial play is not helping you much now.]
;B[fc]LB[gc:A]C[samtregar: too slow.  On the third line, a two point jump to A is the usual move.]
;W[oc];B[pf]LB[kc:C][lc:B][mc:A][qg:D]TR[qm]C[samtregar: Ok, but a pincer at A, B, or C might also work here.  Also, D could be good, but might be too low.  On the other hand, this move works well with the marked stone, so it cannot be considered a bad move.]
;W[oq]LB[lc:A]C[samtregar: very strange move.  I would expect him to take the natural trade of A for your last move.  Your next move should punish him for this mistake by playing around there yourself.]
;B[fp]LB[cj:B][jq:A]C[samtregar: I still like a play around A better than this.  Also, a play around B looks attractive.  The star points are always important.  Janice Kim (1d, author of a good series of books) says "rush to plant your flag".  This means that if you aren't in immediate danger, be the first one to play in the biggest area you can find.  In this case, I think that means a play around A or B would be best.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[kc]LB[md:B][nd:C]C[samtregar: I think this is too far.  A reduction around A or B should be somewhere in black's future, although it's too early now.]
;B[ic]LB[mc:A]TR[ga][ha][ia][gb][hb][ib]C[samtregar: this looks like a small territorial play to me.  It aims to secure around 6 points of territory.  And since it's on the third line, it doesn't exert much influence on the center.  In the opening, a six-point play is much too small.

samtregar: on the other hand, if you followed up with a play at A, this might work to your advantage.]
;W[kq]LB[dj:A][pj:B]C[samtregar: white takes a big point.  You must respond with a play around A, or possibly B.]
;B[dq]C[samtregar: I like this move, even though the star points are still calling.  It puts presure on white and starts to build a base for your weak stone at F4.  Moves that serve multiple purposes are the best kind.]
;W[dp];B[ep];W[ci]C[samtregar: Imagine if you'd played in this area first.  The game would have been very different, and much better for you.  This is why it is important to "rush to plant your flag".]
;B[iq]LB[mq:A]C[samtregar: this move is also good.  It builds a base and threatens an invasion around A.]
;W[br]C[samtregar: useless move];B[dr]C[I think here I should have put a stone on the left side, because W group here look very strong.

samtregar: yes.  White's last move was a waste of time, but you made up for it by wasting on of your own.  White now has sente again to play where he wishes.]
;W[cm]LB[dg:A][dj:C][dk:B]C[Now it's very hard to attack the W group.

samtregar: no, you can still attack.  You can't capture, but capturing isn't the only reason to attack.  You can also attack to reduce.  When you reduce, you play to limit the size of your opponent's territory even though you know he will get something.  In this case white is very low, all on the third line.  This means you can expect to play on the forth line and get a good result.  For example, a play around A or B will likely lead to black having a wall facing the center and white being limited to third line territory.  I also like the shoulder hit at C.]
;B[cd]C[samtregar: this move helps white build a huge territory.  This is called a "thank-you" move because white is happy you played it.]
;W[ef]LB[de:A]C[samtregar: the usual response is A.  You should play there now.]
;B[no]LB[mq:A]C[samtregar: this is a wild move, and I can't see where's it's going.  It's too far from R7 to be an extenstion but too far from white to be an attack.  Maybe you meant to aim for A?  Why not just play there then?]
;W[po];B[om]C[samtregar: if this was your plan, you could have just started with this move.]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[mq]LB[mp:A]C[samtregar: no more invasion opportunity.  White is playing very conservatively here.  I don't know why he didn't play A, since that would also be secure but would ahve better future potential.]
;B[ko]LB[jo:A][lo:B]C[samtregar: This is another strange extension-that-isn't.  The knights move at A or a one-space jump at B would most be better.]
;W[qb];B[ro];W[fm]C[samtregar: big move.  White's territory gets bigger, but you don't seem interested in doing anything about it!]
;B[qf]C[samtregar: terrible move.  There is absolutely no reason to connect here.  Compare white's last move with your response.  This is probably what is meant by "lack of focus".  Your opponent just made a huge move but you responded as though you didn't see it!]

[ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[samtregar: This is a good point at which to pause and take stock of the game.  Black has basically three areas of secure territory, totalling around 42 points.  Notice that I'm not counting the large area on the right side.  That's because it isn't enclosed!  Amazingly, neither player has played around the star point at Q10.  As a result, this territory is undecided.

samtregar: White also has three territories, totalling around 72 points of mostly secure terriotory.  This means white is leading by 30 points.  Black needs to do two things to win the game from here.  First, black must secure the right side territory.  Just doing this will probably even the game.  Then black must reduce whites left side territory to prevent white from taking even more.]
;W[li]LB[jj:A]C[samtregar: overplay by white.  This aims to make all the territory to the left of this stone into white territory.  I think a play a tengen (A) would be a good answer.  It's too far from the right side to threaten an invasion.]
;B[ni]C[samtregar: very submissive.  You are playing white's game now.  If this ends up being the dividing line between white and black territory then you will lose.  But it does help secure the right side, which isn't bad.  However, like all single-purpose moves, it must be considered somewhat inefficient.]
;W[hj]C[samtregar: huge move!];B[lk]LB[mj:A]C[samtregar: this is a minor territorial move at best.  You might hope for 10 points with this move, although since you left a cut at A I don't see even that much.  And it doesn't threaten white at all.  Right now you must do something to reduce white on the left.  If not, you cannot win the game.]
;W[jk];B[cq];W[lj];B[mk];W[bq]C[samtregar: tiny move.  White should be securing his territory along the top left, but instead he's playing endgame moves on the edge.  you should punish this mistake.]
;B[lf]LB[be:C][de:A][gg:D][en:B]C[samtregar: This is ok, except that it invites white to expand his huge moyo on the left.  Instead, you must dive in and fight.  It's probably too late, but you can't win otherwise.  You might start with a play at A, B, C or D, for example.  I'm not good enough to read out the results of fighting on this scale, but they all look like possible reductions to me.]
;W[ig]C[Here, W had quite an advantage already.

samtregar: yes, that giant moyo on the left is almost complete.  But white has had quite an advantage for many moves now.  He was 30 points ahead 10 moves ago.  Now he has added to that lead and your chances to invade his territory are almost gone.  You have gotten some territory on the right since then, but it is much smaller than white's on the left.]
;B[je]C[samtregar: a good move generally, this works to separate the two white groups.  However, they are both strong enough to live on their own, so this can't accomplish enough.]
;W[km]C[samtregar: a good dual-purpose move.  it expands white's vast territory and threatens to reduce yours further.]
;B[gn]C[samtregar: the right idea, but much too late.];W[kl]
C[samtregar: wasted move];B[ln];W[he];B[jn];W[md]C[samtregar: another very defensive move.]
;B[nf];W[rc];B[rd];W[jg];B[kg];W[kk];B[il]C[samtregar: a good dual-purpose move.  You get some territory and you threaten an attack.]
;W[jp]C[samtregar: this is a sharp cut.];B[ip];W[bd]LB[cc:A]
C[samtregar: you should answer this.  If not, white can play A and you'll lose the corner.]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[co];W[ap];B[do];W[dm];B[gf]LB[fe:A]C[samtregar: I think you got the right idea here - invade white's territory - but a bit too late.  By now white is strong enough that he should be able to kill any invasion.]
;W[gh];B[fe];W[gk];B[gl];W[bb]LB[cc:A]C[samtregar: bad move.  Just playing at A would have stolen the corner.]
;B[bc];W[be]C[I think I should have placed a stone at H14.

samtregar: yes, that would have captured G14];B[ac];W[cb];B[cc]
;W[hf];B[kh];W[ji];B[ik];W[fg];B[fl];W[ej]LB[ek:B][el:A]C[samtregar: terrible move!  Why not A or B?  White is letting you chip away at his territory without putting up any real defense.  Imagine if you'd invaded earlier!]
;B[em];W[cn]LB[el:A][en:B]C[samtregar: again, what is white thinking?  A move at A or B would be a nice counter.]
;B[en];W[hd];B[hc];W[io]C[samtregar: ???  I don't get it.  White played well up to this point, but these last few moves have been terrible.]
;B[jo];W[mh];B[nh];W[ek];B[ki];W[kj];B[mi];W[lh];B[mg];W[jh]
;B[lg];W[bp];B[cs];W[el];B[hk];W[ij];B[fk];W[is];B[hs];W[ke]
LB[js:A]C[samtregar: you should ignore this and play at A.  From there I think you can get a Ko which will be dangerous for white.]
;B[jd];W[db];B[eb];W[de];B[gj];W[ab];B[da]TR[bb][cb][db]C[samtregar: this is a wasted move, the marked stones are dead as they stand.]
;W[gd];B[gc]LB[fd:A]C[samtregar: of course the correct move is at A.  When your opponent plays a "double peep", be sure you are defending the one that really needs defending!]
;W[fd]C[Here is where I lost the two stones (75 and 77).];B[ed]
;W[ee];B[hg]C[samtregar: You just gave white one point for free!

samtregar: at this point, the game reaches endgame, which I don't have any useful comments about.  As you can see the major territorial frameworks are all complete and now it's just a matter of settling the borders.]

Thank you.


samtregar: The reason you lost, in my opinion, is that you waited too long to play on the left side.  You let white build a huge territory without any interference.  Now, later in the game white played some terrible moves and let you invade a bit.  If he hadn't, you would have lost by much more.  Actually, white made a similar mistake by not playing on the right side for so long.  You ended up with a very large territory without doing much to defend it.

samtregar: I recommend you study fuseki to get a better feeling for how to gain advantage in the openning.  Also, I recommend you read Janice Kim's series of books which helped me a great deal.

samtregar: I hope I've helped you with my amateur analysis.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at sam@tregar.com.  Thank you.]
