C[Dear Reviewer:

I guess my main problem is to attack weak groups. I would greatly appreciate your advices. Thank you in advance, Juan]

;B[jp];W[jq];B[di]LB[ko:B][lo:C][kp:A][kq:D]TR[dl][qp]C[J: Should I play this or L4?

I understand you want to take sente to play the game move to attack the marked white stone, but playing at A(L4) is more urgent.  If white plays A, followed by black B and white C, white can severely limit black's strength.  When black plays A, a move at D later goes well with the marked black stone.]
;W[hn];B[ho]LB[fl:B][kp:A]C[Now black is bad shape (empty triangle).  If black has a stone at A, black can contemplate counter-attacking at B.  The four stones from H4 to L4 are strong and black won't be afraid of white's cut.]
;W[fl];B[fi]LB[fd:B][cf:A]C[Exchange black A with white B first, giving black's group a base.  Then play the game move.]

[fg:C][gg:D][fh:A][el:E][dm:G][em:F][fm:H]C[A is the power move.  This move gives black a lot of center power.  Don't be afraid of helping white to solidify his upper left corner.  If white gets to play A first, you can see his upper left corner gets even bigger.  Besides, his upper left 3-3 point is still invadable.  When black turns at A, the proper move for white is B.  If white resists at C, black enjoys the hane at D.  In either case, black builds up the power at the center to prepare for the attack of white's 3 stones.

Also, the game move strengthens white's stones.  If black doesn't peep, later he can wedge in at E.  If white ataris at F, there will be two cutting points, G and H.]

[ij]C[J: Something better?

Yes.  A is good.  Black will take territory in the upper left, but the resulting white's strength isn't all that useful.  Black has center power and it will negate white's strength.

When one attacks, one should have an aim of what the profit will be.  Does black want to kill white's group?  I don't black needs to kill the white's group to win.  Besides, black already gains upper right territory during this attack.  Black is making some profit at the center with the marked stones, but this area is small because white can reduce it easily.   Besides, the two marked stones are not completely dead.  Definitely there is aji in them.  If black is interested in continuing in attacking, play B instead.  This is big from a territory standpoint (image white gets there first).  This also puts pressure for white to respond.  Otherwise, the hane at C might kill white's group.]

[fs][gs][hs][is][js][ks]C[J: Here my opponet had to go and resing. But I am not sure I am better.

Let's see.  Black has 24 ponts in the upper right, 24 points in the lower right, 4 points in the lower left, 3 points in the left center, 4 points in the right center, and 4 captured stones, yielding 63 points.

White has 13 ponts in the lower side, 2 points in the middle, 46 points in the upper and left sides, and 1 captured stone, yielding 62 points.

Black has a small lead and sente.  Playing at A would open up the lead to about 10 points, althougth white will play next.  Black also has the B to D sequence to capture two white stones to increase the lead further.  E is also quite big.  Black can also play F to reduce white's territory.  Overall, I like black's position at this stage and black should win this game barring any major mistakes.]
