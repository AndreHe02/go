shaip: tell me my mistakes

[ This point is called "komoku" \]];B[dd];W[pc];B[oe]C[was this a good move

[ I won't say this is a bad move, because it depends on what your goals are, but what I usually see is a "kakari" (a corner approach move) at Q15 or R15.

P15 has the advantage thats it is "high" (far from the edges) so it is hard to attack, but it is also not a very strong attack against the Q17 stone. \]]
;W[pd]C[shaip: and do you know the moves names

[ This move - called a "nobi" or in English a "stretch" - is very slow, and seems like a mistake.  If I were white, and I wanted to make a move in this area, I would probably choose R15 because it puts a stronger claim on the corner and also escapes your attack easier.\]]
;B[nd]C[what could i have done to stop white here

[ It depends what you mean by "stopping him".  If you want to stop him from growing, you should probably play R14 or Q15. 

Anyway, O16 is not a good move because you let white get Q15.  If white gets Q15, he gets a *LOT* of area in the upper right corner... 

This move is called a "kosumi" or in English a "diagonal" \]]
;W[pe]C[[ Now that white has Q15, he has plenty of territory there, and is very hard to stop.  If you try to "hane" (skip around the corner) by playing Q14 here, white can cut at P14 and create a fight.

But if you *don't* play somewhere to block white from growing, he can be happy to keep playing moves on the Q line, building very large territory...  This happened because of the mistake of playing O16, I think... \]]

;B[dj];W[df]C[hi id like to know whats the best move here

[ A good next move for black is to play C14.  This can get black good territory in the upper right corner, while putting the pressure on whites stones.  If white then plays D15 or C13, black should follow up with C15. \]]
;B[ce]C[[ D14 is already there, and could have been a good move for white to make against your two stones at C15 and D15...  So you played into a good situation for white.

Now white can make his stone strong and weaken your stone by playing C14. \]]

[ "Kogeima" (also called just "keima") is the shape made by black K14 and M15, a "knight's move" (from the chess piece, I guess).   Near the edge, a kogeima can often be considered to be connected.  However, a kogeima from in the center of the board can often be cut, so be careful! \]]

[is][jq][jr][js]C[[ You wanted to know where you lost pace, and in my opinion it was this move.

White is a little bit ahead on territory, and it will be hard for you to make up for it by taking territory in the center, especially if you give white the left side as a trade...    Basically, I think you needed to fight white's C11 stone here, instead of running from it.

White C11 is working on building life for that group, but also aims to dive under D10 stone and make it run.  The right way to play here is probably to take C10 instead of D8.  This can drive white towards the center, and the two connected stones you would have would be an "iron pillar" from which you could extend down the left side.

See the variation I have included for this. \]]V[-12.3];W[bk]

In addition, it does not do a good job of blocking white from advancing into the center, since he can play J13. 

Maybe H13 would be a better move here, both in terms of shape and keeping white out of the center. \]]

;B[lq];W[jr];B[lr]C[[ One nice thing to remember here is that it isn't absolutely necessary to protect your stone at L1, by playing M2.

If you leave this stone by itself, and instead block white with a move like L5 here, then white can play M2 to capture your stone, but when you play N2, you force him to finish capturing, then you get to play a move somewhere else.

This tactic of leaving one or two stones behind to get "sente" (the advantage to play first somewhere else) is very important to learn.  Just be careful that the stones you are leaving behind are not important stones. \]]

Also, notice that wherever white staked out territory, he got almost everything he wanted, but where you staked out territory (with the exception of the lower right corner) white managed to reduce it or invade it very effectively.  You may want to experiment with invading enemy territory, since experimenting (and repetition) is probably the best way to learn what you can and can't do.]
