[dk:D]TR[pd]C[phi: later I like to play around A, B, C or D. I Was a bit afraid of getting the marked black stone enclosed. But I will enclose the whte stone in the left bottom corner.
tanguy: why not... but answering to black seem urgent for me]

(;W[nc];B[pf]TR[qf]C[phi: try to escape...
tanguy: wrong direction:
By touching a stone you increase its strength.
The delta stone is facing its power: black is offering white a nice moyo.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[og]C[tanguy: now white is happy of his wall facing a white stone.]
;B[oc];W[fc]LB[rd:A][qe:B]TR[dq]C[phi: The black corner is still open at A. I thought, there are bigger points?
tanguy: A is a yose move at this point: it does not steal black's eye base.
escaping delta is also urgent.
(locally i prefer B because A is easy to break)]
(;B[df];W[jd]
(;B[qn];W[pk]LB[cj:A]TR[fq]C[phi: thats not what I wantet. How could I (black) have reduced the white influence on the right? Or was it better to play around A?

tanguy: r6 is NOT a reducing move (it is too deep),
 it is an invading move, Q5 is a reducing move.
I think the invasion is a good ideas as soon as delta is possible for black.





A]

c14 would be more solid.];W[eh]C[now white cuts !!];B[fe];W[fj]
