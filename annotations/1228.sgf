;B[pd]C[I was black in this game.

I was trying to focus on space control rather than being controlled by small  fights that seem to lead all over the board.

I feel like i did pretty well--though i definately see my weakness in local  fighting--i feel like this player (who i beat) is a better fighter than me and  would appreciate any comments on specific plays where i have gone wrong--played  too close and gotten sucked in or played too conservatively when i could have  pressed the attack or attempt at reduction more forcefully.

Thanks in advance.

Dan Sweet];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qn];W[nq];B[on]SQ[pj]C[Usually, running out like this is a response to a pincer move by white.  Generally, black would extend up the right side at this time to make a base for his stones.  This move isn't bad, but it misses an opportunity to stake out some territory on the right side.  The gap between these stones and the upper right corner stone is too great to consider them connected.  White can invade around the square and Black's two stones here will have no base.  Later in the game, these stones actually do get surrounded and captured.  If Black had played around the square instead, the right side will be much closer to being actual territory.]
;W[qo];B[fq]TR[qj]SQ[rn]C[This is a bit soon to play away from here.  White has made a contact play.  In general, don't leave a contact fight until your groups are dead, or have more than 4 liberties.  The square is a nice, safe response, since White will probably play just below it.  Then Black can play around the triangle and have a secure group.]

(;W[hq]C[See the variation for a possible White attack on the right side.]
;B[fo]SQ[kq]C[Now, this extension into the center is a better choice.  A counter attack at the square is also possible if Black wants to fight a lot.]
;W[dq]SQ[ho][dn]C[seems like white is playing some really heavy shape here--and
throughout the game.  ?? Is this true?

This is rather heavy, but not really bad.  It does defend the corner, but doesn't gain much for White.  I think that both of the squares are better choices.]
;B[dn];W[co];B[cn];W[bn]
(;B[ho]C[Again, I think that this is too soon to leave the left side. Black is leaving too many weaknesses behind.  Even if the left side was secure, this is too close to Black's other stones for the opening.  See the variation]
;W[eq]SQ[jp]C[W should have played more like L3?

This is a poor move.  It makes an empty triangle, which is bad shape unless you are making an eye.  I like the square for White's response.  L3 puts all of White's lower side stones on the third line.  In general, during the opening, it is good to have some of your stones on the third line and some on the fourth line.]
;B[fr]C[Splitting White's groups is good];W[er]SQ[eq]C[White could have accomplished the same thing by just playing at E2 for move 18.  The marked stone doesn't add anything to White's group and so it is essentially a wasted move.]
;B[kq];W[lq];B[lp]TR[hq]SQ[kp]C[Playing at the square instead will surround the marked White stone and not leave weaknesses for White to attack later.  This move is a bit greedy.]
;W[mp];B[lr];W[mq]
(;B[jo]TR[hq]SQ[kp]C[This again leaves some weaknesses in Black's shape.  Playing at the square fixes Black's shape and still surrounds the marked White stone.  See the variation.]
;W[lo];B[kp]SQ[jo]C[somewhere in the development of this group i screwed up as will be  revealed later--or maybe i jsut made a mistake later--any suggestions for  betterplay in thiese last 5 moves or so?

First, since Black was forced to play move 29 at L4 anyway, the marked stone is now redundant and too thick.  Overall, this is a lot of stones to play to capture one White stone and make 16 points of territory.  There are 9 Black stones around this White stone, so Black has averaged less than 2 points per stone played. This is way too small for the opening.  Black should have played move 23 at L4 and then probably moved on to another part of the board (depending on White's response, of course.)]
;W[qf];B[pf]SQ[qj][qi]C[This is not a good response.  Contact plays tend to strengthen both players.  So, in general, only play contact when your group is weaker than your opponent's.  Here, Black is stronger due to the stone at Q16.  Black should probably play a pincer at one the squares to attack White while securing some right sided territory.  O17 is also an acceptable play for Black.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[rc]
(;B[qe]C[This is too greedy again.  Black is leaving too many cutting points.  See the variation.]
;W[rd];B[rb]C[Again, too many cutting points.];W[qb];B[pc];W[re]
;B[pb];W[pe];B[oe]
(;W[qe]C[White should not connect here.  White chose to save one stone by connecting and in the end the whole group died.  See the variation.]
;B[pg];W[sb]SQ[qg][dj][jc]C[This is a small, endgame move by White.  Black can ignore it and play elsewhere.  The squares are all worth more to Black than the remaining points in the upper right corner.]
;B[qa];W[sc]C[White doesn't need to play this now.  This is a wasted move.]
;B[mc]SQ[jc]C[This is too close to Black's wall.  The square is better.  A rule of thumb is to count how many stones tall your wall is. Then extend that many spaces away from it on the third line. So, you would extend 4 spaces over from a wall 4 stones high. Don't extend more than 6 spaces from a tall wall in most cases, however.  The square is 6 spaces over from the base of your wall.]
;W[fc];B[cf];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec]
;W[be];B[bf];W[ad]SQ[ic]C[White has invaded the corner, but Black has another large wall. If Black plays around the square, the upper side will be secure.]
;B[ae]C[stupid

Yes, even if it wasn't in Atari, this is a small endgame move and has no reason to be played this early.]
;W[af];B[ag];W[ae];B[bh];W[pj];B[qj]SQ[pl][nl][qn][on]C[A contact play is not the best choice here.  Black is stronger here and so should not play next to White.  There is enough space here to allow White either life on the side or a run out into the middle.  Black should not expect to kill White here.  Instead, aim to contain White while securing more territory.  The two marked stones are weaker than the wall in the upper right corner. So, Black should play to strengthen them while reducing White. The squares both would be good.]
;W[qk];B[qi];W[ql];B[rk]SQ[rn]C[Black plays a hane too often in this game.  The square is better. If White plays on the square he can connect the three stones on the side to the lower right corner.  See variation starting next move]

(;W[rl];B[rn];W[ro];B[oj]TR[nl][on][qn][rn]SQ[pi]C[The square is a more solid connection to Black's other stones and still keeps pressure on White.  Even better, the triangle helps the three marked stones get out into the center while still pressuring White.]
;W[pk];B[oh]TR[rg]SQ[ic][nl]C[This is small and doesn't accomplish much.   The squares are both worth more and the triangle kills White's corner group.]
;W[ic]
(;B[jc]SQ[mc]C[First, this move makes the marked stone unnecessary.  Black should have just played here initially and probably avoided this whole invasion.

In my opinion, this White invasion between two huge wall is unreasonable and deserves a very severe attack.  See variation for one attack option]
;W[id];B[jd]C[By playing like this, Black has chosen to let White live and instead build up the right upper side territory.  Once you decide to let a group live, generally avoid deciding to attack it later when it is stronger.]
;W[if];B[jf]C[This isn't bad for Black since he gains more territory on the upper right than White does on the upper left.]
;W[rj];B[ri];W[sk];B[rg]TR[sd]SQ[sf]C[This kills White's upper right corner stones.  White can make one eye at the triangle by playing just below it.  Black's stone makes the square a false eye, so White is dead.]
;W[si];B[sh]C[Black could ignore this small endgame move and take Sente.]
;W[sj];B[sf]SQ[jh][nl][bm]C[This isn't needed to kill White.  The squares are all better choices.]
;W[mr];B[qg]C[This is also not needed to kill White.  It is an endgame move worth about 1 point.  There lots of more valuable moves still available.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[ls]
(;B[mo]SQ[mo][on]C[This is bad.  The two marked stones are seperated by a small knight's move.  The small knight's move can be cut apart, so don't rely on it to save your stones here.  See variation]
;W[no]
(;B[mn]C[Black should sacrifice the stone in Atari and try to save the three stones instead.  see variation]
;W[nn]
(;B[nm]C[Again, the hane is too insecure.  See variation.];W[om]
TR[mm]SQ[on][qn][rn]C[White has cut the small knight's move.  The marked Black stones are dead.  Give up on them now and secure your other stones here by playing at the triangle.]
;B[oo]C[mistake?  should i just decide now to sacrifice these 3 stones to the  right?

They are dead.];W[np];B[pm];W[ol];B[dj]TR[bm]SQ[mm]C[This stone doesn't do much.  Secure your stones on the right by playing at the square.  Once you have done this, the triangle is the best way to secure the left side.]
;W[mm]C[this is where i started to lose control

White is starting to take advantage of the cutting points Black has left.]
;B[nl]TR[mj][ig][bm]SQ[ln]C[The square is better.  It saves two Black stones and kills one White stone.  An even better option is to write off three more stones on the right side and play one of the triangles.]
;W[ln];B[km]SQ[jm]C[This isn't bad, but the square would be more secure.]
;W[nk];B[ml]SQ[nm][nl]C[Again, you should probably write off the two marked stones and play a bigger move elsewhere.]
;W[ll];B[lj]SQ[nj]C[This doesn't save the stones in Atari and doesn't block White from the upper right side.  The square secures the upper right side better.]
;W[mk];B[nj];W[mj];B[mi];W[dl];B[cl];W[ck];B[cm];W[cj];B[dk]
;W[em]SQ[dn][fo]C[Here again is a small knight's move that can be cut by White. Remember way back at move 17 when I suggested playing at D5? Now is when that would pay off.]
;B[ci]TR[ck][cj]SQ[do][eo][en]C[Any of the squares would connect the Black stones.  Move 129 does capture the two marked stones, so it is fine.]
;W[en]
(;B[eo]SQ[cl][cm][cn][dn]C[You can't connect, so don't waste a stone trying.  See the variation for a way to save the four marked stones.  Your last move at C11 attacked the two White stones there.  Don't start an attack, then abandon it before it is done.]
;W[do];B[el];W[is];B[js];W[fs];B[gs];W[es];B[gr];W[kk];B[ff]
TR[fe]SQ[kj]C[is this a vital point i should have played earlier?

Not really.  Black's move does help make territory on the left side against the wall.  Here I would play at the square and hope White would let me run a wall across the center of the board. The triangle is better for making territory against the upper left wall.]
;W[fe];B[ee];W[gf];B[gg]SQ[fg]C[Too many hanes in a row.  Black is making cutting points again. The square is better.]
;W[fd];B[fg]C[Good connection.];W[he];B[gj]TR[il][dl][em][en]
SQ[bm]C[The square is still a good move.  Playing around the triangle cuts the three marked White stones off and secures territory around H7.]
;W[hj];B[hl];W[ik];B[il];W[jl]SQ[km]C[The marked stone is about to be cut off.  It only has a small knight's move connecting it to your other stones.  Remember when I suggested playing the marked stone at K7?  This is where that move would pay off.

You must decide to save it or sacrifice it at this time.  I would probably save it by playing at K7.]
;B[li];W[jg];B[kf];W[hg]
(;B[ii]SQ[jb][bm][ga][hk]C[This is an aggressive move to cut White apart and reduce his center territory.  Is it necessary?  To answer this question we have to know who is winning.  Black's huge upper right territory including the dead White stones is a bit bigger than White's lower right corner.  Black's territory below H5 is worth about as much as White's lower left corner.  Black's terriotry on the left side is bigger than White's two upper left groups.  So, Black is winning currently by a comfortable margin. Thus, Black should play Sente moves that secure what he already has.  The squares are all Sente moves.  See the variation]
;W[jb];B[kb];W[ia]
(;B[kc]C[White can't cut here, so this isn't needed.  See variation.]
;W[ea];B[fa]SQ[fb]C[The square also reduces White's territory but keeps Sente for Black.]
;W[da];B[fb];W[gb];B[hb];W[hc];B[ha];W[ib];B[ga];W[gc]C[This reduced White nicely in Sente.]
;B[fm]TR[bm][bk]SQ[em][en][dl]C[This is bad.  The marked White stones are dead.  Black does not need to play here.  If Black wants to secure this area better the triangles both do more.]
;W[op]C[Now White wastes a move, so you are both even.];B[bm]
C[should have played at k10? right here?  which is bigger?  this play does seem important

This move at B7 is much better than K10.  The center area around K10 will mostly be dame points, so playing there doesn't help either side much at all.]
;W[bo];B[an]C[This is a Gote endgame move worth three points.  Look for Sente endgame moves first.  Then play to Gote move worth the most points.]
;W[ao];B[am];W[jj]SQ[jm]C[This gains about one point for White.  The square is better for White.]

;B[ed];W[ef]C[To play here means White assumes Black is likely to make a major error defending this area.  In a low kyu or Dan level game, this would be rude.  At high kyu levels, however, White might be able to pull something off...]
