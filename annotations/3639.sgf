C[I feel as though this game was a loss.  My position in the opening was so much stronger that failing to take advantage of that was so dissapointing.  I just don't know how to decide direction of play.  Help!]

C[Question 1:  This position HAS to be superior for black... I have sente... outside influence... there aren't any cutting points and the stone at R6 is weak.  I feel like taking territory at R12 isn't big enough and invites attack at P16 which will keep me low.  Starting a joseki by playing at f16 or 17 will probably lose me sente and just beg to have my moyo reduced.  So I kinda responded with a half and half not so good move here.  What should Black do?  And is my thinking correct?  What should I be most concerned about here?]

(;B[od]TR[qn]MA[nr][nq]C[P16 is too defensive. During fuski, concentrate on playing where you can get the most
In this case, you should play in the top or left side. The right side is okay for the moment.
Of course, R12 is too small.
Note that R6 stone cannot cut your group

White playing P16 is not a probem at all. You don't even have to respond White P16 ! You can be strong elsewhere.

Another possibility is to extend your O2 wall. 
This way, White will have a hard time reducing Black on the right side

To conclude, never play a half-half move: it's seldom good.]

(;W[qh];B[jc]TR[qh]MA[od][qd]C[Question 2: This is probably wrong.  The two white stones are weak.  Playing at R10 seems overconcentrated, but I don't know what move to make to put pressure on White.

R10 is awfully overconcentrated, considering the opportunity to play on the left and top side
White is already pressured, as he can't extend propoerly with a "two-space" extension

K17 puts little pressure on White, as your group can easily be cut or invaded. But, with R12 weak under your group, I think your move is not bad]
;W[on]
(;B[ol]C[Here is a far worse move. You should have played S6 to link. White's group shape is so bad after this !]
;W[oh];B[mm]C[This is also bad : Don't try to kill, try to reduce his moyo ! Go is not a game of killing]
;W[nm];B[nl]C[At some point I am sure this turned into a bad sequence, but I can't figure out what I should have done.  This destroys my thickness that I worked so hard to build.]

;W[kn];B[kp];W[jm];B[kk];W[jo];B[mh];W[rf]C[Question 3:  White is very weak here and black is quite strong. What should black do?  What questions should I ask myself in order to decide what to do in these situations?

The end of a very bad sequence for Black. Now you should let White struggle in his little space on the right side, because it is still fuseki. You don't care, as long as your P8 group lives. If you re in danger, play S6 to join

Instead of pressuring White's group, play on the left side right now

Later (in the midgame), you can come back to pressure White]

;B[mf];W[rd];B[rc];W[kd];B[jd];W[sc];B[rb];W[nj]C[Look at the overall game now. You've both played only on the right side. Not normal, don't you feel ? 
Black and White are losing themselves in a not-so-important midgame conflict, instead of playing the fuseki]

(;B[fd]MA[jc][jd]C[Question 4:  I think playing high was a mistake.  The following joseki hurt me by allowing him to get too much out of this.  Would a play at F17 be better?

I think Black should avoid the one space high attack if he has support (marked stones). F17 would probably be better.

But why play here ? L16 can't hurt that much, so why extend a group which is already settled ?
Play on the left side instead];W[fc];B[gc];W[ec];B[gf];W[dg]
;B[cl]C[Question 5:  Whenever I don't know what to do... I just end up plopping down a stone in open territory to get a foothold.  There has to be something better, but what?

This is a correct move here. It allows Black a nice two-space extension

Playing a joseki on the corner is also feasible, I think];W[ci]
;B[co];W[eo];B[iq]TR[dq][eo]C[The marked stones scare me.  I played this to ensure life for my group which I feel was too strong for me to have to back it up like this.

This move is ok];W[cd]C[yes, White takes many points here]
(;B[el]C[There is still a nice extension in F3, which seems more important than E8]
;W[gq]C[White takes it instead of Black];B[hp]C[Nice try, you have to push more to get the maximum out of this fight. White will probably connect, but it must be painful for him. Try to gain points in the center during the fight, for instance]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[jl]
(;B[lk]C[Useless, as a connection in S6 is still possible
K9 seems better, for instance];W[hn];B[gp];W[fp];B[ke]C[I'm sure this move would have been better served at G12 or something... but I'm a horrible chicken, and I feel like I'm ahead.]
;W[gh];B[bq];W[cr];B[bj];W[cj];B[bk];W[ih];B[if]C[I feel as though this was a mistake.  Too little.

[ab][ba][aa]C[Finally, you lacked an overall analysis sense during the entire game.
You played at the same locations as your adversary, even when there were far better moves. 
In addition, one attempt in the beginning of the game to kill one of his group on the right side was very bad 

1) Take initiatives and don't always follow your opponent. 
In the fuseki, the overall situation is more important than a local fight, so be greedy with your moves

2) Don't try to kill during the fuseki when it is not obviously possible.



I hope my commentaries will be helpful, and my english is not too bad.
Have a nice day !
