C[Dear Reviewer,

      Here is a game in which I played black.  I won by resignation, but I felt like I got away with something.  I'm interested in general comments about my game, including strategy.  In particular, I tend to be a little reckless, and I'd like for someone to point out where I left a weak group exposed and a superior player would have punished it.
    Also, the invasion at move 73 was probably a mistake, although it just barely survived.  I'd be interested in comments about how that would have better been handled/timed.

I would say your worry over the invasion is valid. It does give white many opportunities that he missed, and it exposes the weakness of your "wall" that is at that time still a weak group. But, having gotten away with it, Black wins handily.

White misses some simple connecting captures that black should not have left. But, he ends up fixing them in time.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[pj]C[}san-ren-sei, how can it ever be wrong?]
;W[ec];B[jp]LB[cj:a][dj:b]C[} Some would say this is the 2nd best move, after C/D 10 (a/b). The reason is that the 2-stone shimari looks down this left side stronger than the 4-4 stones on the bottom. Still, your move at K4 is of the same class (important side to both corners) so cannot be criticized.]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ic];B[md]C[} This appears to strengthen his weaker group. Playing toward his strength to the left might better help your stone gain strength that overshadows his weaker group.]
;W[nd];B[me];W[qb];B[rb];W[nf];B[lg];W[pc];B[qd]C[} Black is looking pretty good, I think. Your weak group has running room, and his is still under pressure, and you're making territory while he only survives.]

;W[nh];B[oi];W[ni]
(;B[qi]LB[oj:a]C[} Because of the force this leaves at P10 (a) for white, I like connecting there myself as in the variation.]
;W[oj];B[rh];W[ok]C[} This seems aggressive, leaving the cut undefended. for the weak group.]
;B[mg]C[} This looks heavy and slow, but I'm not sure. Stabilzing this group, invading the left side and chasing his weak group all seem the important ideas right now.]
;W[ng];B[nj];W[pl];B[mj]C[} very good, exactly what I watched for. You each have 2 weak groups, but I like Black's position better.]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[mc]
(;B[ob]C[} I like the variation better. Seal him in first, then worry about killing. Sealing in has value no matter what. Unsuccessful attempts at killing can be dangerous to the aggressor.]

(;W[oc]C[}This seems a wasted move. Better to move out immediately. There is only one eye here for white, even with this move, and White can still cut of the stone if black tries to connect.]
;B[ke]C[} Defending that cut. Good.];W[mi];B[li]TR[oj][ok]LB[lj:a]
C[} This looks dangerous with White's marked stones in place and the cut at a (M10).]
;W[lj]
(;B[ml]C[} This looks good for shape, but the variation shows how this loses the two black stones and helps white get out of this problem.]

(;W[lh];B[ki];W[mk];B[kh];W[mh];B[lk];W[nk];B[mj];W[kj];B[jj]
;W[kk];B[ll];W[pn];B[no];W[kl];B[ln];W[dj]C[} very big.];B[gc]
LB[fq:a]C[} Here is the invasion you questioned. Now that you have the big wall, it seems very reasonable. However, a (F3) seems a bigger move.

Also, your wall still has defects that makes this invasion more dangerous. The whole left side is so open that this smaller invasion seems wrong.]
;W[hd];B[gd]
(;W[he];B[ge];W[hf];B[jc]C[} This seems to help his group. But, if it feels necessary, it may be because this wall is not so strong as it first appeared.]
;W[ib];B[gf];W[hg];B[ih]C[} Either this is playing from the wrong side (from strength, rather than pressing white toward strength) or it's a defense that means your wall is not so strong. if the wall was weak, then the invasion was not warranted.]
;W[gg]C[} Ouch!];B[ef];W[fg];B[dd]
(;W[dc]C[} This looks very passive. White has the advantage here, and should make it hard on Black.]
;B[ce];W[ed];B[ee];W[de];B[df];W[cf];B[cg];W[be];B[dh];W[eg]
;B[dg]
(;W[ci]C[} I wonder if this leaves white's surrounded group too weak. Playing on the outside might help white connect, and still keep the black group surrounded, and weak.]
;B[di];W[fj];B[ej];W[fi];B[cj];W[dk];B[ck];W[bi];B[dl];W[ek]
;B[el]
(;W[ei]C[} Strange. Similar to earlier move by black. Why not just connect at f9?]
;B[fk];W[ej];B[bh];W[cl];B[bl];W[cm];B[bj]
(;W[ff]LB[fl:a]C[} Strange. What about f8? (a)];B[fe];W[bm]
;B[ak];W[am];B[al];W[bg];B[ai];W[gk]TR[am][bm][cm][cl]C[} odd. f8 still seems to work, althought it's a bit trickier with the 4 stones short on liberties. This move seems to treat those 4 stones very harshly.]
;B[fl];W[gl];B[en];W[gn];B[co];W[dn];B[do];W[em];B[fm];W[fn]
;B[dm];W[eo];B[cn]C[} I'm not sure if this move is necessary. The variation shows a possible attack by white that has probably existed for some time. Looking all the way back from here, the invasion was probably best not made, since the "wall" turned out to be weak. playing the big move on the bottom or a stong defending move for the wall before invading any of the left sides seems better in hindsight.]

(;W[gm]
(;B[id]C[} This is a very odd move. it turns out to be a reasonable sacrifice defense, but I still like the simpler K14 better.  But, I could find no fault with it. It seems you read it carefully.]

;W[dp];B[er];W[ep];B[gq];W[iq]C[} much of this is moot. The bottom right corner is where the real territory is, and White is pretty hopeless.]

(;B[mk]C[} It's very ugly, but this move might keep the stones alive and White split.]
;W[lk];B[ml]C[} This actually looks better for Black than White, which may exonerate the M11 hane.]

(;W[ld]C[} This seems to work fine for White, and why I think Black must first defend here before diving into White's innards.]
;B[le];W[kd]TR[lb][lc]C[} White will probably capture the 2 black stones and connect his groups, but Black will probably connect his two group as well, leaving white with a very weak group below. Tolerable for Black, but not as severe as keeping this big white group  on the run.]
))
(;B[kd]C[} This seems safer to me. White may still need to make moves inside his own territory, but you've made some shape for your group.]
;W[mi]C[} If white proceeds as in the main line...];B[kj];W[li]
;B[lj];W[ki];B[jg]TR[kj][lj][mj][nj]C[} A possible outcome. Black is strengthening the top group, and running into white's potential moyo (not yet formed) and white's group on the right is feeling the shadow of the marked stones (K-O10).]
;W[ob]C[} If later, White is sealed in, he'll need to defend to keep his group alive, giving you a "free" move.]
))
(;B[oj]C[} This would prevent him from forcing you and is a stronger shape to keep pressure on his running group.]
