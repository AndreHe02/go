C[Erik:
I played this game at KGS agains a 1 kuy and lost by resignation.
I am uncertain about where my big mistakes lie and feel less than pleased with the game as a whole.
Please Review.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp]C[kyurukyuru [1k\]: hello]
;W[dq]C[Erik [2k\]: Hi];B[oc];W[qj]
(;B[ql]C[Erik:
Is this too wide?
Too early/miai ?

Christian: Well, if you want to play on the right side (which is a normal strategy), the checking extension from above is more normal. The reason is that if white just plays the "normal" move at R13 now, you have to add another move if you want to secure the corner territory. 

So, yes, this is too wide. 
And no, it is not too early to attack the white stone, just the wrong direction.]

(;W[nq]C[Christian: This is a strange move. If black answers at Q6, whaite cannot defend both of his stones at the same time.]

(;B[lq]C[Christian: I don't see the point of this pincer. What if white enters the corner? On which side are you planning to block? 

If you block at R4, you're stone at R8 is too close. If you block at Q3, you are hurting R8. So why did you play the pincer?]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo];W[qg]C[Christian: White played an overplay (O3), but you failed to take profit from this move. On the contrary, you got outplayed. At dan level, I would say the game is already as good as over.]
;B[fc]C[Christian: I would prefer a kakari in the lower left corner - it is more urgent to prevent the white shimari. If the shimari in the upper left would be directed to the left (i.e. Q17 and R15), this kakari would be right since it would also serve as an extension (and you would just play K16 after white C14).]
;W[cf];B[db]C[Christian: Just K16 looks more promising than this. This move forces you too play the low extension at J17, so if you ever try to build a moyo on the upper side (the only position you have), white can flatten it with the shoulder hit K16.]
;W[cc];B[ic];W[co];B[eo]C[Erik: Premature?

Christian: Usually, you play this move when white already has a double-wing formation (i.e. extension on both sides of the shimari) to get sabaki.
 
My first impression was that this is the wrong move since the shimari has no extension at all and you should just play a checking move on the lower side. 

But just playing H3 looks not very promising - white plays a move like D9 and is satisfied. So actually this move might be an idea because it threatens both E3 and C4. 

Actually, it's already very hard to find a plan for black. For example, if you just try to use your shimari by playing P14, white can counter at K16.]
;W[fp];B[cn]C[Christian: Good! The left side is important now.]
;W[bo]C[Christian: This quiet move is a very good answer.];B[dn]
C[Christian: I don't see a better move, but black gets heavy.]
;W[cj];B[dk]C[Christian: Wrong direction. If white has a weak spot, it is C12. By leaning on C10, you are helping white to defend it. Don't lean on weak stones! Your only option is to play G6 and wait for a chance.]
;W[dj];B[hq];W[gq];B[hp];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn]C[Christian: White should just play G5 if he wants to continue locally. The cut looks dangerous, and white has no reason to take chances.]
;B[fm]C[Christian: Well, cutting looks like the only option in this position.]
;W[go];B[in];W[hm]C[Christian: There is no point in keeping black separated as long as white didn't play C9. This move is very likely to be a neutral point.

K16, C9, P10 would all be good points for white.];B[gk]C[Christian: Strange shape. For a defensive move it looks a bit too loose. If you want to defend, E9 looks more solid.]
;W[pl]C[Christian: Again a dangerous move by white. I cannot read what happens if black cuts.]

(;B[pm]C[Christian: You are trying to make 12 points with 5 moves!]
;W[pk];B[ef]LB[lc:D][fe:G][oe:C][ej:A][ck:B][im:E][hr:F]C[Erik:
This is where I feel my greatest(save forgetting to throw in at move 107) mistake lie.  I played this move because I felt I was behind and this was the deepest I dared go.
Looking at the game now I suspect that my esstimat was overly pessimistic.
Is one of A-F better?

Christian: First I don't see the point of playing Q7 if you're leaving the big cut at R7 now. If you wanted to take sente, you should have played R7 instead of Q7.

E14 looks like more like an attempt to build up the upper side than a reduction to me. This looks like the most promising strategy. Just playing C would be not good enough if white counters at K16. The only move I would consider from A-G would be G.]

(;W[hd]C[Christian: This is a strange move. If white wants to reduce the upper side, K16 is the move. If he wants to cut, F16 is the move.]
;B[hc];W[fd]C[Christian: This would be good if E14 were not already there. Here it looks a bit thin.]
;B[fe]
(;W[gd]C[Christian: This looks greedy - E16 should be good enough.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[ee];W[dc];B[gc];W[hf]C[Christian: This is a difficult fight. White is giving you a chance.]

;W[jh];B[jg];W[ke]C[Christian: Now white has two weak groups and black only one - all because white started an unnecessary fight. Now it's hard to tell who will win.]

(;B[jm]C[Christian: Have you read out the cut? If not, you should consider K8.]

(;W[ld];B[kc];W[ne];B[lf];W[le];B[kl]C[Christian: This is an important move. You were lucky that white didn't cut. But still you have a weak group.]
;W[mj]
(;B[lk]C[Christian: This is the wrong direction. You should take care of your weak group.

(;B[kj]C[Erik:
This was a mistake.  I had read with the throw-in.
Since it was a brain-fart and not a misclick, and my opponent had stated no undoes I did not request one.

Christian: You see how easily a game can be turned around if you start unnecessary fights. White's trouble already started at H16.]
;W[ji]C[Erik:
The game is essentially, over since I can not match white's territory along the left side.  And I still need to spend moves getting the center group alive.]
;B[mf];W[od];B[gf];W[eb]C[Erik:This seems to me like a bad move since saving the 3 stones would force me to build a second eye for the center group.

Christian: Yes, white should connect and capture D18 and the J17 group after you lived.]
;B[id];W[nl]C[Christian: This move re-activates the cut at R7 since P7 is no longer sente.]
;B[fk];W[ck]C[Christian: R7 is bigger.]
(;B[dh]C[Erik:Mis-read this, c13 might be better.];W[ch];B[dg]
