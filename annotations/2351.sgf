C[Hi, I'm white in this game.  I win by 2 moku, but I was unsatisfied with the result.  I especially didn't like what I did, or did not do, with the thickness I had.

N: I think you have to learn to be more patient (and I have this same problem) as shown by moves 30 and 80.  There were mistakes made by both sides but yours were less costly in the end.]

;B[ei];W[dk]C[This seems okay to me, but I'm not really convinced of it.  I think skipping lightly down to c5 maybe better.]
;B[co];W[cm]C[now white is a bit cramped on the left...though not a terrible position

N: At least your group is solid for when fighting breaks out.  B's four stones above are a potential target for attack.]

(;W[pi];B[pn]TR[qo][mp][np][op][pp][rp][oq]C[this sequence left me a little unsatisfied.  There's a better way to deal with this and use the strength of the white stones.

N: the problem is the marked stones are not as strong as you think and have some bad aji which Q6 exploits.  Thickness means no weaknesses/strength and there is a big weak point at Q5.]

I think B get the better result out of this but the game is still early.]

Keep up the attack on B's upper left group.  This move is wrongly timed.

True. B should keep the pressure up, make sure his (marked) stones are connected, then he can attack W's upper left corner.]
