C[Hi there,
my name is Rainer and I would like to have this game analysed. I played white in this game. Please give me hints for advancing my play.

Thanks

Rainer

Hello Rainer,

I'm Bommel (3kyu KGS) and I will try to write a review you can gain from. You didn't ask any special questions about the game, so I'll try to point out the things I think you need to understand.
I put the focus on Opening and Middlegame.

enjoy :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[oq];W[dd];B[cn];W[qo]C[R5 is good when the outer side is more important than the corner. More common in this situation is playing R4, but R5 seems ok to.
Usually R5 gives B a secure corner and you gain on the side.

Maybe you should answer C6. A pincer around C9 would utilize D16.]
;B[qp];W[po]
(;B[ql]C[reinforcing the corner seems better for black

(see variation)];W[pp]C[Good, your 2 stones seemed weak before, but now they can get a base easily (capturing at least one black stone)]

(;B[qq]C[Sacrificing R4 would give black a better result.

(see variation)];W[pq];B[pr]
(;W[rp]LB[or:A][qr:B]C[this is wrong!
You must cut at R2 or P2. If Black answers at S2 your chance is lost to punish him for R8. If you think Black wants the corner, cut at P2. That way Black doesn't get a ponnuki. If you think outside is more important, cut directly at R2. Again this avoids a ponnuki.

(see variations)

Go over the variations a few times. Try to understand why A or B is better in the different situations. Such choices appear very often, study them carefully.]
;B[rq]C[Black missed his chance to secure his cutting points.]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[or];B[ps];W[nq];B[nr];W[op];B[os];W[mr];B[ns]
TR[nr][pr][ns][os][ps]C[Very bad for Black. He gave you outside influence and put worthless stones on the board. The marked stones do nothing.]
;W[mp];B[qi];W[om]LB[nc:C][jd:D][dk:A][fp:B]C[Very bad. There's a proverb: "Play away from thickness".
This is true for your own thickness and true for enemy thickness. Your shape in the bottom right corner is very strong, adding this stone at P7 doesn't make it much stronger.

Try to find big points on the board. I like moves like A, B, C or D. Claim unclaimed land.]
;B[mn]C[Same mistake from black. N6 seems worthless the same moment it hits the board! one single stone against that mighty thickness. Pityfull...]
;W[jp]LB[dn:A][en:B][fp:C]C[Again, too close! If you want to develop the bottom, try A, B or C.]
;B[fq];W[cp]LB[dn:B][eo:A]C[Here you shouldn't try to live locally. Escape and split the 2 weak Black stones. You can escape into the center and launch a double attack later.

A or B are the 2 best moves for this, you can look up the different follow up moves in a joseki book.]
;B[iq];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr];B[ip];W[fp]TR[io]C[The proverb says: "Hane on the head of 2 stones"
Here we have 3 stones, but it is still the same. F4 is not really a bad move, but I prefer the hane at J5 here.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[gq];W[dq];B[er];W[dr]LB[ck:A][dk:B][cl:C][dl:D]
TR[cp][dp][ep][fp]C[Too small. Black is already as good as alive and can escape in the center if neccesary. You should utilize the power you gained in the fight. Attack the weak C6 stone. Pincering weems fine (somewhere around A-D). This would also help D16.]
;B[in];W[kn];B[ml]C[Running with this stone is wrong. If it gets eaten, black loses nothing. What does this N6 stone do anyway??]
;W[jd]C[Good, finally a big point.];B[cf];W[cl]C[C8 is ok, but this pincer seemed better before C14.]
;B[em];W[fn];B[el];W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[dn];W[en];B[dk];W[bl]
;B[ck];W[bm];B[bn];W[bo];B[an];W[bk];B[cj];W[ao];B[bj];W[do]
;B[ak];W[co]C[Good, the 5 stones are dead, and your group is connected therefore. The fight was strange, but analyzing this special situation in detail wouldn't help you much. You should study tesuji, tesujis come in handy in such figths.]
;B[ek];W[gm];B[gk];W[nc]C[Good, Black also wants to take that point.]
;B[lc]C[bad!
This is only joseki without K16. Here M17 is much to weak. Q14 much better.]
;W[ld]C[Good move again, M17 already is a burden for Black.]
;B[mc];W[md];B[nb]
(;W[oc]C[here a double hane would be a severe move!

(see variation)];B[ob];W[pc];B[kc];W[jc]LB[kd:B][nd:A]C[There are 2 big weaknesses in your shape. If Black wants to cut you into pieces, he will get a good result.]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[pb];W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[qf];W[pe]C[You want Q16 badly, didn't you? But why. Capturing it gives you 2 points. Go for the big points first, Black doesn't want to save Q16 anyway.]
;B[pf];W[ne]C[Protecting this cut doesn't help you, Blackk cannot cut anyway.]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[gf];W[jg];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[hi]
(;W[ji]C[This is a move into nomansland. In this center, there is not much to gain. You have already entered the endgame. The big endgame-pointers are on the first and second line. Try to find big sente moves there.

A16 would be a big double sente (double sente is a move, which occupies a point, that would allows a sente move for both sides) for example.

(see variation)]
(;B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[ok];B[mj]
(;W[he]C[This move makes a few points for sure, but there are still bigger sente moves on the first and second line. Take S15 for example.

C[Why not atari at M1? M2 and M1 are both gote.];B[il];W[kl]

[fs][gs][rs][ss]C[(counting is wrong, Q13 is not a point for black)

I will try to sum up the most important things for you:

1) try to look for big points, try to find unclaimed land on the board, especially in the opening.

2) study tesuji, this will improve your figthing style.

3) Endgame was bad from both sides. At your level it may be too soon to study endgame, but you should try to find the doublesente moves in your endgames. These moves often decide the result of a close game.
Also try to avoid answering Endgame moves from your opponent directly, if they are supposed to be gote.


You played a good and thick game. You didn't have weak groups to look after and your play is solid. This is a good base to build on. Try to avoid playing near your already strong groups, better reinforce weaker ones, or if all your groups are strong, try to think of an invasion if this is a good option.


I hope the hints I gave you were usefull, feel free to ask if there are still questions that need answering.

best regards,
Bommel])
