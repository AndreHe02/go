C[Dear Reviewer, this game was played between Esse and myself on KGS. I played black and lost the game.

I have added some questions, where I am interested in special aspects of the game. But any comments you have for me would be greatly appreciated. Would you be so kind and review the game to find out my mistakes, please? Any idea which topic of Go I should especially train would be helpful. Thanks. Yanshou

KKMD: I think you (and your opponent) need to get a better understanding of the notion of weak/strong groups. You'll find out that sometimes I'm not sure of my suggestions, relying only on a weak intuition ; but I tries to make it clear when it was so. I hope I'll help you improve your play.]

C[Yanshou: I am not sure about this opening. ItÂ´s better than A, but what about B?

KKMD: B occupies a big point, but is low. Since black and white played the san ren sei, a power-oriented fuseki, it is more coherent to play high, so C feels better than B, and is quite playable.]
;W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr]C[KKMD: This is not  joseki, since you lose the possibility of invading the sansan, while not making a sound base. Not a big mistake though.]
;W[cq];B[ho];W[kq];B[mq]C[Yanshou: It was my hope to attack the white group while securing territory at the right and securing my left group too. Do you know a better way to realize these objectives? Or are there a better strategy at all?

KKMD: Choosing the direction of play is always hard ; I think you're doing well here.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq]C[KKMD: The joseki is O2, but in this situation it could be too risky, because of the white stone at L3.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[nr];B[lr]C[KKMD: Interesting, but now with L2 white can threaten to connect in sente, so it should be easy for him to stabilize his group. For this reason, N2 would be better.]
;W[ko];B[ip]LB[jp:A][kp:B][ir:C]C[A standard sequence in this situation is A-B-C, but since white has the possibility of playing L2 it would not be so effective here.]
;W[iq];B[mn]LB[jp:A]C[A is the point.];W[lq];B[mr];W[gp];B[eo]
;W[do]LB[go:B][cr:A]C[KKMD: White is nice to answer this peep, he could have played A or, worse, B.]

(;B[jq]LB[jp:A]C[Yanshou: I am not sure about this move. May be there ist a better to attack.

KKMD:  Black will capture something with your move, but I think A is even better (see variation), because if you let black play A himself, it will give him good shape.]
;W[jp];B[jr];W[kr]
(;B[ir]LB[ks:A]C[Yanshou: Wrong, probably I should have played at A.

KKMD: Yes (see variation).];W[hr];B[hp];W[js];B[gq];W[is]C[Yanshou: As a result of my mistake white now lives without any problems but my own group is still weak.

KKMD: Why do white take those three stones now ? Because he wants to be certainly alive.]
;B[fr]LB[lp:A][jr:B]C[KKMD: This useless move does not make black alive, and is not too frightening for the white group. There is no way for black to make an eye on the edge.]
;W[jd]LB[cc:C][kf:B][km:A]C[Yanshou: A big move. White gets a great moyo. Please tell me some good moves at this position.

KKMD: The logical followup of F2 would be something like A, sente against the white group, then maybe something like B and you build your center. Or invade at C right after A, then decide how to continue. What I say is by no means absolute, I would be very indecisive in this position.]
;B[dl]C[Yanshou: This move startet a risky way to destroy white territory.

KKMD: You still have a lot to build before thinking about destruction. This is extra-dangerours, considering the fact that your bottom-left group is not yet alive.]
;W[em];B[ek];W[ej];B[fk]LB[gk:A]C[KKMD: A is a lighter shape.]
;W[gm];B[cs]LB[es:A]C[KKMD: If you want to live the move is A. Now if white can kill you locally with A.]

;W[ar];B[bo];W[bp];B[ap];W[aq];B[ao]C[KKMD: No. You should try to make your group alive, instead of playing this kind of endgame moves.]

C[Yanshou: My hope was to stabilize the weak g10 group in sente and then to switch at A.

KKMD: This move is worth a try, but don't forget simple things like B : it won't make you live, but you can take muchos points in sente.]
;W[il];B[ik];W[jl];B[hl];W[hm];B[hk];W[in];B[nd]C[KKMD: You call that "stabilized" ? You're still eyeless !]
;W[md];B[oc];W[ne];B[od];W[nb];B[ob]LB[me:A]C[KKMD: This is just (big) yose. I think it's better to cut at A instead.]
;W[lc];B[pf];W[oa];B[hg]C[KKMD: Good. White is wrong, this is not yose yet.]

KKMD: I don't know for sure. Personnally I would play A, but B and C at least also need to be considered.]
