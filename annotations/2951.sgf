AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, I'm Archimedes (Eric in the real life) and I played black. I won by resignation. I want this game commented because I changed my style lately and feel I need to correct some mistakes that would probably look evident to a more advanced player.

Points I would like you to comment especially :

1- Taking big points in opening
2- Good and bad shape making
3- Middle game tesujis
4- Endgame moves (sente VS gote, order of the moves...)
5- Anything you see are my current weeknesses and keeps me from progressing

Also, I often suggest alternative moves (A or B), if neither is good, please say so... those are only guesses or after thoughts I had while reviewing my own game.

Thank you in advance for your time and knowledge!
Archimedes (A-- in the comments)

A-- After reviewing this game myself, I see I have lots of questions! If you review the game in depth, it will surely take you quite some time. However, I wanted you to know that your work is greatly appreciated as well as required for my progress. I assure you that I will spend a good deal of time studiing your review, so dont hesitate to give me lots of material to study!

Thanks again!];W[dd]C[B: Hi, I am Andy, and since you have already taken A, I will preface my comments with B: so you know it is me.

My first comment is that this is not the best game to send in for review.  You should send in games where you lost and you don't know why.  This is particularly the case with the Go Teaching Ladder, where the games are reviewed by higher ranked players, but not necessarily teachers or masters.  I am a 5-6 kyu for example, and it is very, very hard for me to accurately criticize the winning side in a game, saying such and such a move would be slightly more efficient, or another approach would do well against a better player than you played.  It is much more straightforward to answer the questions "what went wrong?" or "how could I have beaten the person I played?" than "what is the optimum way of playing in this game?"]
;B[pp];W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[jp]LB[dj:A][pj:B]C[A-- Is that one good, A or B better?

B: The stone you played is fine, as is A.  B seems a little less compelling as yet.  If you were going to try to reinforce the corner, do R11 rather than Q10, I think.  White can still invade and you have spent two stones setting up a position in the corner that will get chased around.  R11 at least makes a claim on the top right.  That said, B is a big point so not terrible as far as I can see.]
;W[cn]C[B: The pincer here is ok and stops white from making a moyo, but it also stops you from making one.  I would be tempted to try something else like an attach and extend joseki. [see variation\], which works well with the sanrensei formation.   You can invade and reduce later.]

(;B[dk];W[em];B[dh];W[bp];B[cq]LB[fp:A]C[A-- I'm attacked here... A better?

B: This is one part of the problem with a pincer.  You have two groups and can only work on one at a time.  You decided to strengthen the left group so white attacked the lower left group.
C3 is fine.  If you play A, he takes the corner with C3 and you need to play more stones anyway.  He keeps sente either way.]
;W[eq];B[ep]C[B: E3 is a lousy attack, I think.  It gives you back the initiative and as you say, you were ok with the result.  In any case, your first response  should be B3, which gets you an eye in the corner and the threat of a second eye by playing B5.  Then you are safe in the corner.  Of course, then he gets to turn the corner on you, but one way or another, he gets to wreck your sanrensei so you might as well do the thing with eyes.]
;W[fq];B[fp]C[B: I think white could have played G4 here and made more of a mess for you.]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[jq]C[B: Your strategic idea here is not strong.  You confine white and get outside influence, which is fine, but your group as you point out continues to lack eyes which hurts later and the value of the influence is reduce by the C6 group of white's, which, while not safe, is going to be hard to kill off.  You want to let white go up and build your influence facing your K4 and Q4 stones, open area where you can really develop.  B3 makes your invested stones safe-ish, then try to cut white off from the right to develop the lower right, then, lastly, try to get out from the corner to interfere with white. So, instead of J4, try this variation...]

(;B[ip];W[iq];B[hq];W[hr];B[hp];W[kq];B[dq];W[fr]TR[dp][ep]
[fp][gp][hp][ip][jp][cq][dq][hq]C[A-- Here, I thought I had a pretty good result, outward thickness facing a weak white group, but I had to fight for my group later...

B: B3 is still a good move, and would obviate some of the need for fighting later.  Meanwhile, I don't quite see the point of O3.  The white group is not attackable.  The other white group is attackable, though probably not killable.  B3, then G7 to attack while making some more usable influence.]
;B[nq]LB[kp:A][lp:B]C[A--  Play A or B instead?

B: Neither, see previous comment.];W[kp];B[dn];W[dm];B[co];W[bn]
;B[fl]LB[gm:B][en:A]C[A-- This is where my trouble with my F4 group begins... A or B?

B: Your last two moves just strengthened white while not getting you territory or eyes.  They also put paid to B3 as a good move. Just B3 then G7.  Your move at F8 just has the effect of pushing white along the top of your thick position, robbing it of egress and eye potential.]
;W[en];B[do]C[B: So the two moves at C5 and D6 were wasted.  No eyes and white has a better position.]
;W[gn];B[im]C[B: Finally.  How much better G7 would have been a few moves back.]
;W[in];B[jn];W[hm];B[io];W[hn];B[ko];W[il];B[jm];W[gl];B[lp]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[mq];B[op]C[B: You learn later about the cutting point at M5.  Perhaps if this move had been at O5, you could have covered the cutting point and accomplished whatever else you wanted with it.  Which wasn't much come to think of it.  52 seems an inefficient move, not getting much done, including not covering the cut.  How about N6 or, indeed, Q9?]
;W[pk]LB[lo:A]C[A-- Later, I let my group cut at A... my fault]
;B[qm];W[qh];B[ph]C[A-- Good direction?

B:  I don't have a good sense of this.  You'd need a better player to tell you about the direction here.  I do think it was a mistake to touch this stone.  Don't touch weak stones ... it makes them stronger.  Instead, try something like a leaning attack on the the O17 group to build up a little strength.  Then you can attack at R10.]
;W[pi];B[qg];W[oh];B[pg];W[qi]C[A-- What do you think of this sequence?

B: You touched a weak stone and now it is a strong group.  Your lower group is safe, but it was already, I think.  Your upper right group has an inefficient shape and the corner is still open to a 3-3 invasion.  Not a great sequence.  I hasten to add that it could easily be something I would do too, so I can't really criticize too harshly!]
;B[rk];W[pm];B[pn];W[om];B[ql];W[ni];B[md];W[mc];B[ld];W[lc]
;B[nd];W[od];B[oe];W[oc]C[B: This sequence strengthened white's top and weakened your corner, as well as giving white a bunch of forcing moves againtst your N16 group.  Because of this, white has taken a slight lead.  You had to do the move at N14, but that gave white the initiative. White should have Q17 and follow up, then K16 and follow up. Then it is a little bit of a difficult game for black.]
;B[mf]LB[lo:A]C[A-- I seem to get the advantage here, but at the same time, my lower groups have become VERY cuttable at A, a source of trouble latter in the game...

B: I don't think you got the advantage here.  White has a good position on top and a good reduction on the right.  But then he leaves a cutting point at L17 ...]
;W[ke];B[jc];W[kc];B[fc]C[A-- Good exchange?];W[nf];B[ne];W[pc]
;B[qd];W[qc];B[rc];W[cc];B[fe]LB[cf:A]C[A-- Wrong direction? A instead?

B: No, this is ok.  It helps your thin, weak group on top and threatens to connect to your weak group on the left.  Both groups needs help.  I don't think A strengthens the left group enough to warrant abandoning the other.  But this is part of the problem of having a winning game reviewed; I don't really know if 88 should have worked the way it did.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[cf];B[df];W[dj];B[ej];W[cj];B[di];W[ek];B[fk]
;W[el];B[fi]C[B:  This was a very successful sequence for you.  White let you do exactly what you needed to, which was to link up your two weak groups.  K17 is starting to seem more useful and your new group is strong enough to actually get some territory.  Both of you successfully destroyed each other's territorial potential enough that a good potential chunk like that could be the game.]
;W[gj];B[fj];W[gk];B[fm]C[A-- The archetype of the "Thank you move"!]
;W[fn];B[ci];W[ck];B[bi];W[bk];B[af]C[A-- Is it too early to go to this monkey buisness?

B: I think so.  Not by much, but there are things worth more than 10 points around.]
;W[ag];B[bg];W[bf];B[ah];W[ae];B[ag]C[B: By the way (and this is not virtuous go thinking, but gutterish poker thinking) it is not such an error in my opinion to do endgame too early if  (a) you are not wrecking potential attacks you could do later and (b) you have a strong sense that your opponent is going to respond even though it is too early.  In this case, your opponent answered and you weren't going to kill or collapse the corner so ... no harm done.]
;W[bd];B[de];W[ce];B[ed];W[rh];B[rg];W[bq]C[B: Grrr.]
(;B[ng]LB[lo:A]C[A-- Small or big? I thoutht i gave me acces to the center a bit. Or would that have been the perfect timing to cover the cut at A?

B:  Miniscule.  You won a single stone in gote.  Your group is all safe and connected through Q15 and N15 and you had access to the center through N14 and K7.  (L9 and, hmm, M12 miai for reduction?)  You're not making territory there, just wrecking, don't forget.  It's not an appalling move, but S18 is there, if you want big, and, as you point out, there is that cut, which, B3 not having been taken, is a slight threat.]
;W[on];B[po];W[lo]C[A-- Alas, I feered this for some time.]
;B[ln];W[mo]
(;B[np];W[mn];B[lm];W[mm];B[br];W[dr];B[cr];W[ar]C[A-- You can see how I lived in the next moves, however, I am convinced that there is a more efficient way to do it... Could you suggest any?]
;B[jl];W[ll];B[kl]C[A-- First eye, the easy part.];W[lk];B[ik]
;W[hl];B[jj];W[kk];B[jk];W[hh];B[jh];W[ki];B[ji];W[kh];B[ig]
;W[hg];B[hi];W[gi];B[hj];W[ih];B[ii]C[A-- Here I get to make my second eye... very bad sequence for me...

B:  Hard to say who this was worse for.  You got your turf wrecked, but so did he.]
;W[fh];B[hd]C[A-- I'm not sure I like this move. Any alternatives?

B: I can't see one of the top of my head.  You need eyes for this group now, come to think of it, so there you are.  K18? Can it be cut off?  I can't read it out at the moment.]
;W[eh];B[ei]
(;W[ec]C[A-- Wonder why he played there...];B[eb];W[dc];B[db]
;W[cb];B[kg];W[kj];B[lh];W[li];B[mh];W[jf];B[kf];W[id];B[ic]
;W[if];B[rb]C[A-- Here beggins the endgame. I need much comments on my playing in this stage. This is definitly an area of the game I have too work on.

B: S18 is a great endgame move.  Endgame is important and you have to work at it, but it is also very amenable to work.]
;W[qb];B[bo];W[ao];B[pl];W[ol]C[c];B[mi];W[mj];B[nj]C[A-- This move is to make my next one sente...]
;W[nk];B[nh];W[oi];B[gg];W[gh];B[ie];W[jd];B[he]C[B: Why this gote move?  With H16 in place, you could do somthing like K18.  Your oppenent is compliant and would play at L18 and you'd have eye space.  Then you could keep sente and play O2, then C19, then D1, and see if he just keeps answering.]
;W[jg];B[le];W[ff];B[gf];W[ef];B[ee]
(;W[nr];B[or];W[ms]C[B: O2 a mistake, I think.  See variation.]
;B[kb];W[lb];B[jb]C[c];W[pr];B[os];W[pq];B[oq];W[rq]C[A-- White later died in this corner, but scared me a little. Have I handeled him ok?

B: Yes.];B[ps];W[qo];B[rn];W[qp];B[qn];W[qr];B[rs]C[A-- I was happy with myself for finding that move, but can white live still?

B: Good move.  No, white seems dead to me.]
(;W[rr];B[ro];W[rp];B[qs];W[qk];B[rj];W[so];B[je];W[nb];B[hf]
;W[ig];B[fg]C[A-- This was useless. Another "Thank you move", and it reduces my liberties, which makes me lose a move latter.

B: Yes.];W[eg];B[qa];W[pa];B[ra];W[ka]
(;B[hc]LB[eg:B][fg:A]C[A-- Here I lose a move because of the A-B exchange... though I'm not sure it was necessary.

B: I don't think it was necessary, but I could be wrong.  Sorry.]
;W[ja];B[ia];W[la];B[oa]C[A-- Was there a way to kill?

B: No.];W[pb];B[na];W[ma];B[qj];W[pj];B[ri];W[si]
(;B[sk]LB[sj:C][rl:B][sl:A]C[A-- Very strange shape... But I couldnt find why i didnt like it and decided to try it. Is it bad? A or B better? Or even C... See variation.

I can't see a big difference.];W[sg];B[sf];W[sh];B[rf];W[og]
;B[of];W[sj];B[rl]
(;W[fb];B[gb];W[da];B[fa];W[ca];B[sm]C[A-- This is a chicken move on my part... Where should I have played instead?

B: Chicken moves are ok on one condition, that you count and know whether you're ahead or behind.  Investing a stone in making sure you can't get taken by surprise is a good idea, if you are nicely ahead.  If you can read it out and know that you are safe, that is better, but you can't always.  It ain't chicken to win the game.]
;W[ea]C[B: Filling at F18 is one point reverse sente, since it is not a ko to retake, and it is only reverse sente, instead of gote, because of the follow up atari of F19.  Consider doing other things instead.  D1 is two point sente.  That may be the only one, but with the take two-take one exchange, it is often worth looking elsewhere.]
;B[fb];W[aj];B[bj];W[ak];B[an];W[am];B[ap];W[aq];B[ds]C[B: Finally.]
;W[er];B[bs];W[an];B[ai];W[es];B[ch]C[B: Good, take the point instead of the half point.]
;W[cl];B[sn]C[A-- Yet another chicken move...

B: This move was quite unnecessary, as you saw later, and there are one point moves available at O1 and O5.]

[gs][hs][js][ks][ls]C[A-- Useless move (292), but i didnt wanted to pass yet... White resigned after this move, but I was not so much in advance. The game was over, so I suppose he didnt wanted to see the score?!? I won by 11.5 points.

Once again, I would like to thank you for your review. Your time is greatly appreciated and I will study the material you give me intensely!

If you have any suggestions as to what book could help me progress, please let me know. Christmas time is comming! (I have already read "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" by Kageyama and "The Second Book of Go" by Botzulich, please nothing else from this author!!!)

Have a nice day.

B: I am not sure about a book.  There is a nice book of proverbs, which I think you would get something from, along the same lines as the Kageyama book.  Yilun Yang's "Whole Board Thinking in Joseki" might also be good for thinking about the whole board consequences of local fights.  Also, "Life and Death" and "Tesuji" are good books by Davies, though you know some of that stuff as it is.  There is also a good book on the endgame by Ogawa and Davies.

Can't get too many go books, in my opinion.

Overall, I would urge thinking as much as you can about the direction you play in and the direction you push the opponent to play in. With a few small changes of direction, you could be getting a lot more result from the fights you are having, and winning.

Hope this helps.
