C[hello, my name is hoang, i'm 14k on KGS, 18k* on IGS.  thank for your review and comments!  i'm black.

[wallace\] Hi, I'll try to give you hints on what to work on. However if some of my input is not clear, please don't hesitate to ask me...]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cq];W[dd];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci]C[[wallace\] A first, not so important point, Black is very low on the left side... I would have approached the upper left from the top side. But it's not a big deal.]
;W[id];B[do]C[[wallace\] there is still plenty of room on the left... may be approaching the lower right is bigger.]
;W[fq];B[nq];W[iq];B[qq]TR[fq][iq][pq]C[[wallace\] not really a good choice: W can separate and build a nice framework on the bottom side thanks to the marked stones.]

(;W[qp];B[pq];W[qm];B[op]C[[wallace\] yes! W should have P4...]
;W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[kq];W[mp];B[nn]C[[wallace\] Why not simply connect?]
;W[mq];B[lo];W[np];B[oq];W[mr];B[lr];W[kp];B[lp];W[rq];B[rr]
;W[rp];B[om]C[[wallace\] dangerous... better playing the vital point of T2]

(;W[pm];B[pn];W[po];B[qj];W[nr];B[or];W[sr];B[qs];W[nm];B[mm]
;W[ol];B[nl]C[[wallace\] this is small... the corner is still not settled!]
;W[om];B[mo]C[[wallce\] good];W[ps];B[pr];W[ns];B[os];W[rs]

;B[dq];W[dp];B[eq];W[go];B[gn];W[fo];B[cp];W[dn];B[cn]C[[wallce\] connect! You might want to re ad the book: Lessons in the fundamentals of Go. It has a very interesting point about playing the proper move (which here is the solid connection).]
;W[co];B[bo];W[cm];B[bn];W[em];B[dl]C[[wallace\] What is B trying to do? Just connecting underneath with B8 would be safer and enough...]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[bm];B[bl];W[an];B[ap]C[[wallace\] Now B is split and has to live...]
;W[br];B[cr];W[bq];B[ao];W[am];B[bp];W[er];B[dr];W[fr];B[bs]
;W[ds];B[ar]C[[wallace\] B lives but loses the initiative and only makes 6 points :(
Expanding the center or the upper right would have been much better...]
;W[es];B[kc]C[[wallace\] good];W[hn];B[in];W[hm];B[ib];W[hc]
;B[hb];W[gb]SQ[ke][qf]C[[wallace\] all these moves are very small. Expanding your framework around L15, closing the corner at R14 and such are more important.]
;B[qe]C[[wallace\] yes, but B was lucky that W answered everything on the top border...]
;W[mc];B[nc]C[[wallace\] two points:
- direction: better to split and help your stones (around L15)
- shape: a contact move is not an attack, it will reinforce N17 and O17... locally P17 is a better attack.]
;W[md];B[ke];W[nd];B[oc];W[mf]C[[wallace\] because of O17 W could play O16 and thus he could jump out further...]
;B[kg];W[kd]C[ahh i dont know what to do....];B[jd];W[ld]
(;B[ie]C[[wallace\] This is the wrong move. Connect solidly and there is no problem. (see vars)]
;W[jc];B[je];W[ic];B[mb];W[lb]C[i kinda hurried...];B[pg];W[nb]
;B[ob];W[ma];B[mk];W[nk];B[ml];W[oj];B[nj]C[[wallace\] both of you like this shape, but it leaves a weakness and ends up worse than the simple connection...]
;W[ok];B[ni];W[im];B[jn];W[mh];B[pi]TR[ki]C[[wallace\] getting the center group out is more important]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[nh];B[lj];W[kh];B[jh];W[og];B[ph];W[ki];B[ji]
;W[kj];B[kk];W[jj];B[jk];W[ij]C[[wallace\] now W is chasing...]

;B[dg];W[df];B[cg];W[bh];B[bi];W[ce];B[be];W[cd]C[[wallace\] uh oh... it is better to sacrifice a few stones on the left that to get that big center group split...]
;B[bf];W[dk];B[fk];W[ik]C[maybe i should win the capturing race here.... b13, a12, c10, c9...  during the game i was thinking it was won........

[wallace\] yes you win: B has 3 liberties, W 2... that's all.]
;B[jl];W[lg];B[gd]C[if w h16 my middle group is dead.... i believe

[wallace\] yes, h16kills];W[gc];B[hd];W[fd];B[ge];W[jg];B[jh]
;W[hj];B[il];W[hl];B[fm];W[fn]C[[wallace\] you remove yourself 1 liberty... so now 2 vs 2, B must thus capture right now (b13)]

;B[sl];W[qk];B[rk];W[ql]C[s11....  geez i dont know i think i wanted to end this game quickly, if you look at the time i used up most of my time while w didnt use up much, is it a sign that i'm really inferior?

[wallace\] no: using all your time means you did think about what you played, which is good. Being in time-hurry wouldn't be good, but using the time allowed is a rather good sign.]

At that point the games is still quite close...];B[qh];W[sh]

[ls][ns]C[that was horrible!

thanks..!

[wallace\] Well, the ending was bad, but the game was balanced until you made three consecutive blunders (lack of concentration?).

The main problems I identified were:
- direction problem: don't leave a weak group get split and surrounded. It happened twice (lower left and upper middle) and you lived in both cases (quite luckily!!) but it had a big cost in letting White chase you all over...
Note that at the end you have 5 groups, white has 1
- shape problem: you refused almost each time you had a chance to connect solidly. This often lead to weaknesses, cuts or loss of initiative. Don't be afraid to play the "proper move" (honte). Being solid is a good base for attacking.

So to sum up: connect your stones (and connect them well) and split your opponent! That should be a good thing to remember while playing.

Good luck, and enjoy the game!])
