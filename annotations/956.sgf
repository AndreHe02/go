AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Kevin-

My name is Barry Willey and I live in Galveston, Texas, US.  I am a 10k on KGS (bconwil) and I have been playing go for about 3 years.    I will try to hit what I feel are the biggest errors and let you know what I think you have done well.  Keep in mind that the advice you are receiving may not be best, compared to what a dan level player would give, but it is the best I can do.

I will glad to answer any questions you  might have on the review or review any other games you would like me to comment on.   Overall you played a good game  but failed to take advantage of a few opportunities that could have sealed the game for you.  Your opening turned out well and you had a strong lead going into the middle game.

I think you would benefit the most by studying some life and death problems.
Keep playing and best of luck.

(;B[qe]C[This would be considered an unusual move.  The typical move for black 4 would have been at q14 or s15.(see var.)]
;W[pg];B[mc];W[pj];B[ql];W[qn]CR[qo]C[r5 was blacks next move.  I believe that was too defensive.  See the variations to follow.]

(;B[qo]C[I think this move is too defensive.  But it could have been very strong if white does not handle properly.
q6 is one possibility.  q7 would have been a strong attacking move against the white stone.]

;W[nm];B[om]C[???  Should have been at p5.  However, white backed down and you got a very good result from this exchange.  You built up good thickness that can help support future attacks.]
;W[pm]C[The four stone shape that white has formed is called a ponuki.  It is a very strong shape.]
;B[pl]C[White responded to this move by plainy at q9.  I think white could have given you more problems by following the variation below.]

;W[dq];B[jo]C[k5 is not a bad move, but I do not think it was the most urgent.  By not playing in the lower left you are giving it to white.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[dm]C[Black is in bad shape now.];B[hb]C[Poor move.  Black should be reaching to the center.  This is an end game move.   This move just helps white make himself stronger.  c11 might have been a good move or k14.]
