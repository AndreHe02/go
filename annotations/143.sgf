C[bene : A game played at CyberBaduk, which is operated by Korean Baduk Association. Both players are 2k there. I think Kyu strength of the site is about the same as that of igs. Requesting player is black bene :. My id here is in korean, and means 'big stones always die', a parady of the famous proverb, 'big stones never die'.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[ec];W[pp];B[kc];W[de];B[ee]C[bene : with l17 stone in mind, more battle-oriented move seemed appropriate..]

(;W[dd]C[HK:  White 8.  Maybe not good.  One move back and refer to the joseki variations.]

(;B[ed]C[HK:  Black 9.  If black moves at D17 instead, he can return to the popular joseki.  One move back and refer to the variation.]
;W[dc];B[df];W[cf];B[cg]LB[dg:a]C[bene : playing simple seemed to loose, so i double-hane..]
;W[dg];B[ef];W[ch];B[bg];W[bf]
(;B[dh]C[bene : i seemed i cannot win here, so i give up two stones and make influence.

HK:  Black 19.  Black can't sacrifice the two black stones.  He should try to save them.  Let's try some variations here.  One move back.]
;W[eg];B[di];W[bh];B[fg];W[eh];B[fi];W[fh];B[gh];W[ag];B[ei]
C[HK:  Black should uchikaki at C13 for future opportunity.]
;W[cg];B[gg]C[bene : i thought this results was playable for both..]
;W[gi]C[HK:  very bad position already for black.  The four black stones group with little liberty is a heavy burden on black.]
;B[fk];W[gj];B[gk]
(;W[ii]C[HK:  White 36.  J10 is better to apply pressure to the left side black group.  One move back and let's try a variation.]
;B[ij]C[HK:  Black 37.  Maybe overplay.];W[hi];B[dl]
(;W[jj]C[HK:  White 40.  White should hane at H9 instead.  One move back and refer to the variations.]
;B[hk]C[bene : i considered even discarding this stone (j10), but it would allow white make an eye, and possibly build influence..]
;W[ji];B[fp]C[bene : this move was to make the upper group settled..]
;W[fq]C[HK:  White 44.  White should move at D6 instead.  This move strengthen the black group.]
;B[gq];W[eq];B[hp]C[HK:  Black 47.  Black should connect at G4 to aim the invasion at C3.]

(;W[cn]C[HK:  White should move at K16, K15 or L15 instead.  Let's try some variations.]
;B[pj]LB[jf:a]C[bene : here i considered k14 and q10. if i played near k14, white would play near q10. k14 seemed a good move, because k14 is making territories in upper side, and exercising some pressure on the center white group. but, if white's move near q10 played, the center group would settle...

HK: Black 49.  K14 is better.];W[jd]C[HK:  Good.];B[kd];W[jf]
;B[id];W[ie];B[ic];W[ge];B[gf]C[HK:  Black 57.  Black should move at G16 instead.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gc];B[gb]
(;W[jc]C[HK:  White 62.  Bad move.  One move back and refer to the variation.]
;B[jb];W[gd]C[HK: I can't understand the meaning of this move.]
;B[fb];W[pg]C[HK:  White 66.  White should connect at K15.]
;B[je]C[bene; if white connect here, it would make the upper black group fairly weak. so this move seemed imminent.

HK:  Right bene.];W[ke];B[jd]C[bene : not to allow white's eye, and making aji at j14]
;W[le]C[HK:  White 70.  White should connect at L14.];B[kf]
C[HK: Black is fighting very well.  He seems to get back in game.]
;W[if]C[HK:  White 72.  White should move at K13 instead.];B[lf]
;W[me];B[mf];W[ne];B[mi];W[pe]LB[mk:a]C[bene : now, it seems that playing near n9 was thinkable..

HK:  Right.  N9 is the best point.  The right upper corner is less important.  Let's try a variation.]

(;B[oc];W[oi];B[mk]C[bene : aiming at the center group..];W[mh]

(;B[lh]C[HK:  Black 83.  M11 is better. One move back and let's try some variations.]
;W[li];B[lj];W[lg];B[ki];W[kh]LB[kg:a]C[bene : i thought black has littel ko threat..]
;B[nq];W[li];B[qn];W[oj]C[HK:  White 92.  P5 or Q6 is better.]
;B[pl]C[HK:  Black 93.  P5 is better.];W[ok];B[oo]C[bene : making territory in center, and settling the right group..

HK:  Good.];W[or]C[HK:  Here Black can resume the center ko.  Refer to the variation.]

(;B[nr]C[bene : more severe attack possible?];W[ro]C[HK:  Here also Black can resume the ko.  Refer to the example variation.]

(;B[qq];W[po];B[pn];W[op];B[np];W[pr];B[rn];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp]
;B[jk]C[HK:  Now Black can not defend against the cut at P6.  After the cut, right side black group is very thin.  So Black cannot afford to play the big hane at D18 or C3 invasion.]
;W[nl];B[mm];W[kj];B[kk];W[on];B[no];W[nm];B[qi]C[HK:  Black 117.  After exchange of black O6 and white P7.  Then Black can block at M8 against White N8.]
;W[ml];B[lm];W[ll];B[km]LB[kl:a]C[bene : L8 better?];W[nn];B[mn]
LB[rf:a]C[bene : too submissive?];W[qh];B[ri];W[rk];B[pk];W[rh]
;B[rl]C[bene : i was not sure about 'death or life' of this group..]
;W[nc];B[od];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[rd];W[nb];B[oe];W[nd];B[of]
;W[nf];B[og];W[pi]C[HK:  The exchange of Black141-White142 is definite cause of defeat.]
;B[ob]C[bene : unnecessary?

HK:  S18 is better.];W[re];B[rb];W[rj];B[qj];W[si];B[sj]
(;W[sh]C[HK:  White 150.  White should play at T9 instead.  One move back and refer to the variation.]

(;B[sl]C[HK:  Black 151.  The last big mistake.  Black should play atari at R9.  Refer to the variations.
