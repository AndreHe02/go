C[Thanxs for reviewing my game!

Overall I felt very content with my play, as I usually make more mistakes than usual ^_^()

Of course, maybe theres more than I realize. There are certain weaknesses in my stones that caused me to lose this game. Considering how close it was, it was a little depressing.

Anyways, any suggestions on how to improve my play would be really helpful to me at this point. Any particular kinds of problems, etc. That would be helpful.

C:  Hi,
I'm crhohmann from KGS. I used to be a moyo player like you and it went allright up to 10k.
Now I'm shifting toward a more mixed strategy.  The trouble with moyos is this: After
paying the total cost for converting them into safe territory, one may end up 1/2 point behind.
In your game, the cost was the loss of the M4 group and the relative ease with which White could make
extra territory at the top with just 3 stones (K13, G13, M13).
    It can help to download other player's games and look at how they treat their own and opponent's
moyos and territories. One other thing I did was creating a second KGS account named "mymoyo" to encourage
opponents to invade early and thus lose my fear of invasions and learn how to take advantage of them if they
are unreasonable.
Anyway, you show a sound command of tactics and should become stronger fast.]

(;B[lp]C[C:  The invasion is OK, allthough I would prefer N3 (variations)]
;W[iq];B[nq]C[C:  This move does not strengthen you much, but it strengthens White.]
;W[oq];B[qf]C[Would it have been better to try to secure the M4 group than to do the long knights enclosure on the upper right? Or are there any other moves that would have been better?

C:  At this early stage, the M4 group does not seem in danger, so R14 looks good to me.]
;W[nn];B[om]TR[mc][ld]C[C:  Attacking White's group and building a moyo, but at the same time pushing White against your own weak group.
N17 or M16 look bigger to me:
1) corner moyos are harder to invade than side moyos
2) you're also reducing White
3) you can still play around P9 later];W[mc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne]
;W[cc];B[ee];W[ed];B[ef]C[I wanted to create what I believe was good shape ^_^()

But perhaps this was small, what do you think?

C: Since White has invested an extra move here, it was perhaps a good idea to play
     stable (White D15 has troublemaking potential). Moreover, you threaten further
     expansion to G14.];W[fe]
(;B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[gp];B[go];W[hp];B[ho]C[At this point, i was thinkning about the possible inherent weakness that the two stone extensions/wall, might have, but I didn't think too much of them.

But later, that inherent weakness cost me alot.

Something tells me that I am missing something fundamental when it came to those.

Any suggestions?

C: This is about the right way of expanding one's moyo, and it was successful since you could have escaped.
     Had White played stronger, he could have captured the M4 group, and then the moyo doesn't outweigh giving
     White so much safe territory in return.];W[io]
(;B[kn]C[Would J6 be a better move?

I was thinking that having this group escape (or at least try ^_^() ) was better, but it died anyway.

C: Escaping was the right idea. I would prefer M6.];W[mm];B[ll]
;W[ml];B[ei]TR[gg][nk][in]C[C:  Play O9 first: It renews the pressure on Whites group and may turn out sente. This E11 is gote and purely defensive.
Compare it to G13, which expands and reduces (White) at the same time. I understand you prefer safe territory,
but White's next move is really big. 
J6 is probably the biggest move - both in terms of moyo expansion and threatening to connect the M4 group.]
;W[jg];B[ni]TR[nk]C[Was this too long of a jump? Just a little insecure...

C: Now with White K13 in place, it is tougher to decide where this move belongs, but I might still prefer O9.]
;W[mk];B[nj]C[I thinking perhaps P9 might have been better. The reulting sequence seemed to put alot of weaknesses in my stones.

C: P9 is much better.];W[ol];B[pl]C[Or perhaps there might have been a much beter response?

C: Yours looks OK to me.];W[ok];B[pj];W[oj];B[oi];W[pk];B[nl]

(;B[jn]C[C:  Here you give away the M4 group (worth some 20 points) in exchange for center territory. 
Perhaps that strategy is OK since there remains a slight chance of making life. Compare my variation which
saves the group in exchange for center territory.];W[ko];B[lo]
;W[ln];B[lm];W[mn];B[kq]C[Was there a way to make this group at M4 live?

C:  I don't  think so. At least, this L3 variation seems dead, but you could have played stronger, see variation.
     K2 or K3 instead of L3 look interesting, but White might try M2 and then it looks pretty much dead, too.]

(;B[bm]C[I forget what I was thinking at this point. I know I was afraid of something. But now that I see it, It was a pretty bad move at this point. I could have simply captured that stone at C6, right? Perhaps C7 would have been better for me?

C:  Of course. Your fear is not quite irrational, though. In similar situations where capturing isn't possible, the sequence
of ataris at D6, then B7 is disastrous for Black (variation).]
