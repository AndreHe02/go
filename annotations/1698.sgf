C[Submitted for review by Bjørn Ingmar Berg.  (Ingmar on DGS.)

This game was played on www.dragongoserver.net between RABi (black) and myself (white) during a few days in may 2003.

Even if I was ranked several stones stronger than my opponent I had a really hard time with this game, and I especially felt I flunked the opening stage badly.

Joonas Tyystjärvi, 7k: Interesting game. I will first give a short summary.
First, I don't think you were ever really behind. It seems that you consider a few loose stones on the fourth line territory. While stones on the fourth line may eventually make territory, they are most often used for developing and making influence in the center. You should also remember this when you have a weak group (maybe just one stone) on the fourth line - a stone or two on the third line adds a lot of stability. Also, it seems you were going for central territory. While it is sometimes possible to get territory in the center, you need a lot of thickness in more than one place to be able to get any.
Second, when you play the keima slide under the star point, you MUST get either the 3-3 point or an extension on the side. If you're opponent gets both, you are stuck with a heavy, weak group that's not really doing anything.
Third, running with kosumi is in general bad shape. Remember, with a weak group, you are running, not crawling - you must be bold enough to jump to the unknown. In general, the one-space jump is the best move for running - it can't usually be cut profitably and it gets you quite a good distance.]
;B[dp];W[pq];B[dc];W[pc]C[So far so good.];B[pj]C[This was a small surprise.

JT: it's not that odd. You must now remember one thing: this stone is not making territory, and it doesn't have very good potential for making any.]

(;W[de]LB[qf:A][fq:B]C[Attack is the best self defence...
Or maybe not???

JT: this is fine (I like this more than B, as this prevents a strong shimari) . Another move I'd consider is A.]
;B[pe]
(;W[mc]LB[fd:A]TR[nd][pg]C[Would O16 be better?
Or Q13?

JT: I'd tenuki here and play A, to get influence on the left side. Locally, I think Q13 is good. This move is too low, O16 (as you suggested) is better.]
;B[po];W[pm]C[Already I'm forced into a very defensive position with black controlling the play.

JT: a pincer is an odd way to defend :) Anyways, he isn't really. You need to be more optimistic :)]
;B[dj]LB[cc:A]TR[dc]C[JT: this is an odd move, and doesn't work very well with the triangled stone. I'd take A now - white will be a bit cramped but get some territory (and a base) in sente.]

(;W[fq]C[I am uncertain about 12.
Should I have played elsewhere?
Should I have followed up in another way?

JT: this is good too.];B[cn];W[dr]LB[jp:A][cq:B]C[JT: I'd prefer A, to keep the invasion at B open and get a balanced formation on the lower side, however, this is playable.]
;B[kq];W[mq]TR[pe][pj]SQ[po]C[Black plays solid and "too" well.  It doesn't look as if I have territory at all.

JT: neither does black - in fact, black is behind in solid territory. The two triangled stones aren't really doing anything here. This move is good - the squared stone is weakened even more.]
;B[hq];W[gp]LB[cq:A]C[On the run...

JT: no need to. This one push is okay as long as black is weak, but you really must get A to stabilize. It may seem slow, but is very big (and urgent).]
;B[fd];W[dh]LB[cc:A][ci:B]TR[ic][jc][cf][cg][dj]C[Perhaps K17 or J17 would have been better?

JT: A is usual. After that, the triangled stone looks badly placed. This move looks too high and too thin (it has weaknesses at the marked points). Remember - stabilize with stones on the third line. The upper side is not really that interesting - both sides have some potential for territory there, but it is only territory.]
;B[jc];W[id]LB[hc:D][qg:B][cl:C][cq:A]C[Black has too much territory in the edges, so I think I'll try for controlling the centre.

JT: black still has very little on the edges. There are good invasion places around B and C (and D, if you leave this area as it is). Controlling the center sounds like a dubious plan at this point, since you lack influence. This "shoulder hit" is usually played to limit black's moyo lightly (normal variation shown), but here there isn't one.
  The important thing is, this move isn't urgent. A is the most important move on the board - it stabilizes your group in an area where you're outnumbered. Don't leave weak groups like this to burden you.]

(;B[ic];W[hd];B[hc];W[ph]LB[cl:B][cq:A]C[With support (?) from H16+J16 I might put Q15 in danger.  I thought...

JT: right - divide and conquer. However, A is still a must. After that, if your opponent plays here, B is looking good.]
;B[qh];W[qg];B[pg]
(;W[qf]C[JT: well, this is the usual follow-up of a crosscut, and I can't say that it is bad. Check out the variation, though.]

(;B[pi];W[oh];B[rh];W[qe]C[JT: this sequence is good for white.]
;B[ql];W[qm]LB[pd:B][og:A]C[Have to box in black.
Now I considered Q13 and Q15 to be in effect prisoners.

JT: they both still have some bad aji left (think A and B), but you are right to think that you don't need to worry about them right now. In any case, this move is a must. Since black has his own weak group here, he can't afford to attack your lower left group just now.]
;B[rm];W[rn];B[rl];W[qo]LB[cc:A]C[The forced stone on S6 lets me threaten Q5.
Not sure if this was the best thing to do.
Here I considered black to be solidly ahead.

JT: he certainly isn't. White's solid territories are bigger. Black only has actual territory on the right side (about 9 points) and the upper side (about 15 points if white gets A) - no match for white's two big corners.]
;B[no]LB[cq:A]SQ[po]C[JT: this move creates you a target for attack, but you shouldn't attack it just yet. Now's the time to take A - the marked stones aren't doing anything.]

(;W[pf]LB[of:A][cq:B]C[JT: if you want to remove black's aji here, take A instead - since you can't capture black with this move, it only makes him stronger. In any case, this move is not urgent. B is.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[cq]LB[gn:A]C[JT: can't tenuki here. You should take A to ensure that black won't get territory on the left side by attacking this group.]
;W[bd]C[Black has kept pushing me a little back on several points, so I think it's time to do the same.

JT: much too small at this point. The lower side is "hot".]
;B[bc];W[dd];B[cc]LB[be:A]C[JT: A is gote for black now. You shouldn't take it either.]
;W[be]LB[cj:A][cl:B]C[JT: much too small, doesn't really make your base larger. At A is better locally (and that too loses the potential for invasion at B). Neither are interesting - this side is strong.]
;B[cr];W[er]LB[gn:A]C[JT: shouldn't answer - this is small, and you still don't have any eyes on the edge. Your shape is strong enough to prevent black from connecting his weak groups here. I prefer simply A.]
;B[gr]C[JT:no eyes here, and black is making eye shape for himself.]
;W[nm]LB[gn:A]C[JT: mustn't tenuki now. Black is strengthening his own weak group and weakening yours - you must do something. Also, this is the wrong direction to attack since it pushes black's weak groups together while not doing much in the center. A is absolutely a must.]
;B[lo];W[cj]C[Trying for more territory on the edge.

JT: the lower left is much more urgent. This group is in no trouble.]
;B[ck];W[ci];B[ej]LB[gn:A]C[JT: the lower left side is now looking like a huge black hole with a tiny white speck of light trying to escape. A is too late, but still a must.]
;W[jj]LB[ke:B][nj:C][gn:A]C[I had NO IDEA where it would be good to play.
Tengen has often been nice to have, so why not.

JT: it doesn't help you here. A is a must.  If you're aiming for central territory, B and C are better - but they are also sort of miai for black to take the territory away.]
;B[lb];W[mb];B[lc];W[ld]LB[md:A]C[JT: Locally, A is better. Both are small, even if leaving A is bad shape.]
;B[kd];W[le];B[bj];W[bi];B[bk];W[gd]LB[gc:A]C[Now I was guessing that black would not want me to snake into his mojo on the top.   So I wanted to exploit this to build a stronger wall.

JT: this is too small, should be spared for endgame or as a ko threat. It is sente, though - black can't allow A.]
;B[gc];W[ed];B[ec];W[fe]LB[ke:B][fh:A]TR[hh][jh]C[So far my guess was right.  I was hoping this would let me get a chunk of territory from 11 or 12 and up to my wall.

JT: the territory you can make here is too small, and open at both A and B.]
;B[fc]C[JT: black shouldn't of course respond here.];W[ke]LB[fh:B]
[gn:A]C[JT: this is too slow. Black still has B. A is a must.]
;B[fo]LB[gn:A]C[Panic!

JT: this move gives you a chance. Black should have taken A himself - after that, it will be very difficult for white to escape.]

(;W[ho]LB[go:A]C[Only one solution possible I think...
Crawling out towards the centre.

JT: moving out with kosumi like this is bad shape in general. A is better.]
;B[gm]C[It seems clear black wants to capture my diagonal chain of stones.

JT: The actual problem here is that black is making territory on the left and solidifying his lower side by attacking your group. It can't really be killed like this.]

(;W[in]LB[hm:A]C[Crawling on.
I did not dare make longer jumps.

JT: much too slow. Should be at A.];B[il]C[This looked very dangerous.

JT: it isn't, since there are weaknesses on the lower side.]

(;W[jm]LB[kn:A]C[But I try on....

JT: a string of kosumis like this is horrible shape. All white is doing here is running (or actually, crawling). At A is a better way to defend.]
;B[hj];W[jl]LB[nj:A]TR[ke][jj]C[Black has gained access towards my planned territory, but the diagonal chain is safe for now.
I have to reconcile myself with black moving out towards the wall, and start looking for other possibilities.
I was still believing black would win this.

JT: yes, now the lower side black group is weak. Anyways, even if black lives on the lower side (and he should have), I don't think you are really behind. With the marked stones in place, a move at A is looking pretty promising.]
;B[eh]
(;W[lp]LB[kp:A]C[Desperate times.  Desperate means.
Perhaps I can cut black in two.
I had no idea if this was a right or good move, but felt I had to try.

JT: the right idea. At A is better shape. Pushing through a keima like this is generally bad.]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[mp];W[lq];B[kn];W[jo];B[mn]
(;W[np]LB[lm:B][nq:A]C[JT: bad shape. Simply at A is better. You should peep at B first, though.]
;B[om]C[This looked bad.

JT: no problems here. Cutting through a one space jump rarely leads to good results.]
;W[on]C[JT: the right side.];B[ol];W[pp]LB[nn:A]C[JT: should connect at A.]
;B[ml]C[I thought black was going to survive now,
and he could possibly make life for the group around K3 as well.]
;W[nn]TR[no][po][mp]C[Thinking capturing a little is better than nothing.]
;B[mm];W[nl]C[P8+P9 looks a little weak, so perhaps that can be used.

JT: they're horribly thin. I don't really see a way for black to survive here - now the center is very white.]
;B[nk];W[oo]C[JT: black shouldn't answer this - but you know it :)]
;B[mo];W[ok];B[pl];W[mk]C[It seems it worked...

JT: yes. Black is doomed now.];B[nj];W[lk]LB[nq:A]C[JT: game over, although black has a tricky sequence on the lower side starting with A.]

;B[or];W[oq]C[Keeping sure he won't get room for an eye.

JT: right.];B[np];W[ms]C[JT: could tenuki here too.];B[nr];W[pr]
;B[ns];W[jp];B[di];W[dg];B[ef];W[eg];B[fh];W[fg]C[Very unsure if I handled this well.

JT: this is OK. You made some (small) territory in the center and all black really did was to crawl (there was no more territory to make in the lower left).]
;B[gh];W[gg]LB[ng:B][rg:A]C[JT: A and B are bigger.]
(;B[ih];W[jg];B[jh];W[kg];B[ig];W[if]LB[rg:A]C[I don't think I can stop him both ways so I try to prevent him from getting further up.  Perhaps I should have blocked him from getting to the right instead?

JT: yes, A is very big.];B[kh];W[lg];B[lh];W[ng];B[mh]C[JT: well, you did get a nice result. Black has only made a string of stones in the center.]
;W[ik];B[hl];W[hk];B[gk];W[jd]C[Wanting to push black back a little, make my structure stronger, and keep sente.

JT: yes, this is good.];B[kc];W[rg]C[JT: I think this is the biggest point on the board.]
;B[ij]C[I lost sente soon enough.

JT: well, you have the game won already, and anyways, while this is sente, it isn't very big.]
;W[jk];B[lj];W[kj];B[mj];W[hg]LB[ac:A][sh:B][cs:C]C[But gained it again.

C[I want to keep everything conected, just in case.
Too thick?

JT: no, you must keep the kosumis connected. This last move isn't really necessary, though.]
;B[hm];W[hh];B[hi];W[sh]LB[ac:A][cs:B]C[Was this my best move now?

JT: I'm not strong enough in endgame to know that :) This, A and B are all sente, so I think you should play all that your opponent lets you.]

;W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[ba];W[si];B[sj];W[sg];B[rj]LB[cs:A]C[JT: still A left..]
;W[ai]C[After white 182 on A11
black resigned the game.

Even if I won I had the feeling that black was stronger than me and had played better, and that I had been lucky with capturing O1.  Without that I think he'd won.

JT: there is no luck in go :) After you got out with your weak group, black's lower side groups were very weak. You were right to cut and attempt to capture at least one of them.]
