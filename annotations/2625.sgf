C[Dear Reviewer:

I (black)  loose this game by 2 points and a half (komi 0.5). I thought I was better at the begining but somewhere I loose control. Could you please point out my mistakes?

Thank you in advance, sincerely yours, Juan];B[pc]C[JuanLopez: hi

;W[cj]C[So far, everything looks OK to me.  White has the left side, and black has the bottom, and it is blacks move.]
;B[op]C[This is a fine move, taking territory on the bottom side and maintaining blacks territorial lead.  You might also consider something like Q11, making a large moyo on the bottom and right sides.  Just another way to play.]

The H16 stone is weak.  When you are defending your weak stones, there are three different plans you can chose.  You can run out into the center, you can live in place, or you can sacrifice the stones.  You don't really have enough room to make a base here, so I would recommend running out into the center immediatly.  If white wants to connect the K3 group on the second line let him.]
;W[eb]C[You still don't have a base and white is stronger in the corner.  I don't think this was a good exchange for black.]
;B[hf]C[Good.  Run out and make strength.];W[jf];B[hh];W[jh]
;B[hj];W[jj];B[hl];W[jp]C[Now white tries to build some strength on the bottom, while giving up territory.  I think the H16 group is pretty strong, so I don't think this will be a problem.]

;B[gm];W[fn]C[black has made significant territory on the bottom, while white has two weak groups, J5 and K17.  I think black should try to separate them.]

(;B[jk]C[This may not be the best way to attack this group.  I think the white stones are stronger than the black stones, and black could end up with two weak groups.  Since the white stones have become strong around K16, black should probably defend the H16 group by running away as in the variation.]
;W[kp];B[kq];W[lp];B[lq];W[ij]C[Black needs to worry about connecting his stones.]

(;B[ik]C[This leaves a cutting point at H11.  Black should play to keep all his stones connected.]
;W[hi]C[Now black is on the defensive, with two weak groups.]

(;B[pm]LB[om:B][pm:A]C[Better p7?

I think Q7 is OK.  I don't think black needs to kill J5 to win.  White has about 40 points in the upper left and about 15 in the lower left.  Black has about 40 on the bottom, and a few in the center, So all that is needed it about 10-15 in the upper right. If black can get S15 that should be enough to win.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[in]C[Unless you think you can kill J5, I don't think you should respond here.  Maybe take S15 now and if white takes H6, just conect at G8.]

;B[oj];W[ok];B[mi]C[Maybe n12?

It looks like black is trying to kill the J5 group.  I don't think that is going to work, and if black doesn't kill, then he won't have made very much from his attack.  Better to take territory with S15 before white has  time to play it.  Right now, white still has 40 on the top, 15+ on the left bottom and about 10 on the right center. Black has about 40 on the bottom and a few in the center, so he needs about 15-20 to win.   S14 or 15 should be enough to win.]
;W[re]C[White gets the big point.  I think white is ahead at this point.]
;B[ke];W[je]
(;B[do]C[this is too small. at most you can get about 15 points when you capture F6, and you have to fight a KO to get that much.  White has a LOT of 15 point KO threats.  white has increased the right side from 10 to about 15, while reducing black on the top left.  Black need to secure the upper right corner to have a chance to win.]
;W[co];B[en];W[em];B[dm];W[eo]C[J13 is better.  Black get 2 threats rather than 1.]

Yes, that is probably bigger.  M13 is only worth about 8 points.  T18 is worth at least 8, and is forcing, too.]
