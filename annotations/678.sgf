C[Dear reviewer: I palyed black in this game and i lose by 2,5 points.   I'm 19k in KGS and my opponent is 18k in KGS. I put some comentaries in   the game. Thank's for advanced.

Hi!

My name is Miron BREZULEANU. I'm currently ~5kyu. I will mark my comments by
starting each comment line with MB:

Please don't forget that I am a weak beginner myself. I may give foolish advice,
even though I'll try not to :)];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc]
LB[de:A]C[
MB: This move is steady. However, I would prefer a move at A. This is just personal taste, I don't particularly like
MB: big moyos.];W[ce];B[fq]C[
MB: I think K16 or K17 is very big now. It's not only an extension, it is also taking a good point away from the opponent.
MB: But your move isn't bad. However if I were white, I would now counter with K16.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[jq];W[jd];B[pj]LB[nj:B][ok:C][qo:A]C[
MB: nice sequence. You both built large areas of influence, but Black started with sente and ended in gote. This
MB: isn't too good. Now I think white has the choice of protecting itself with a move around C10 (which is very
MB: mild, it gives sente back to black), or he can attack the black area by entering at one of the indicated points (A, B or  MB: C).
MB: The suggested moves are just some hints, there are probably better ones. The idea behind B, C is to mildly reduce
MB: the black moyo while building some center influence for white. A enters deeply into the Black moyo, but it doesn't  MB: build anything for white.]
;W[qo];B[qp]LB[pn:A][qp:B]SQ[fp][fq][jq]C[When I revised the game I think Q5 more is best. What do   you think?

MB: You can play the P4 kosumi (diagonal play). It extends towards the marked black stones while keeping some pressure
MB: on the invading white stone. You can later play at A to build a large moyo on the lower side of the board  MB: or you can play at B to protect the corner.

MB: I don't like Q5. It would lead to some tsuke-nobi like joseki and black will end up with a low position, while white
MB: gets a settled group. tsuke-nobi: attach and extend, see variation for a short description (the difference is that  MB: the tsuke nobi is played when the black (or white :) stones form an ikken-tobi (one space jump) with one of  MB: the stones on the star point and the other extending towards one of the sides of the board; the tsuke-nobi is
MB: usually used when there is a supporting stone like K3).]

(;W[po];B[nq];W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[nj]LB[ok:A][rk:B]C[
MB: this is a bad move. It should be a hane (proverb: 'hane at the head of two stones'; hane - diagonal play
MB: in contact with the opponent's stones). A or B in this position. The idea of pressing from above is good here,
MB: so I would have played A. Black 21 in the game is just half-hearted, it doesn't put pressure on white, even though it
MB: seems to mean so.];W[nk]C[
MB: this white move seems ok. white shows he's not under pressure here.]
;B[co]LB[oj:E][ok:C][rk:A][ol:D][rl:B]C[I want to invade in   the left side but I think playing directly in C10 is dificult then I   played C5 for  probe.

MB: you left the right side unfinished. there are still ways to get an advantage here.
MB: A is a hane; white should answer or his group may loose his base when black continues at B.
MB: C creates cutting points. After white D, black E, white has two cutting points to worry about (at O8 and O10)
MB: Anyway, you should try to do something about the white group. It's not neccesary to kill it. Just enclose it.

MB: probing (yosu-miru) is a difficult concept. I have little knowledge or understanding of it. Anyway, it is very advanced
MB: for >10kyu. Your mentioning it hints overstudying :)) I think you should spend your studying
MB: time solving elementary tsumego (go life and death problems). Another good way to study in the beginning is to
MB: play over professional games. Fast, don't try to understand. Just look at the shapes and try to imitate them. But
MB: playing (fast, but while trying to understand what's going on) is the best way to improve until you reach 10-12 kyu.
MB: Reviewing your games should also help :))

MB: I don't like C5. You can always take some of the corner by playing at C3 in this corner position. If white doesn't
MB: defend, E2 links the C3 stone to the outer group. If he defends, you can run towards the other side and try to live
MB: in the corner.   MB: But again, the urgent area is on the right side. If you _have_ to play on the left side, maybe C5 is playable.]
;W[do];B[dj]C[
MB: it looks a bit too high. Why not C10?];W[cl];B[cg];W[bf]
;B[cj]SQ[cj][dj]C[
MB: your stones are a bit overcrowded. the efficient distance from an iron-pillar (a formation like the marked stones)
MB: is three, not two as it is here.

MB: Instead of C10 now I would play C9 (with the possible follow-ups of B8 or C7). If you have the high stone
MB: at D10, white will have a harder time enclosing you, so you can run towards the center.

MB: But C10 is playable.];W[bh];B[ch]C[
MB: I would attach at B8 instead. White can attack that stone at B7 or B9. If B7, you play B9 and white has to defend
MB: at C7. If B9, black B7 and living in the corner looks possible with an extra C3 stone (which also threatens connecting
MB: via E2 to the lower side.];W[bi]C[
MB: nice, completely taking away the base and trying to force black to float.]
;B[eh]C[
MB: this looks like good shape.];W[mc];B[ne];W[gd];B[cf];W[be]
;B[lc]C[I think M17 is bad after the next   plays

MB: well, I think white bit the bait here :)];W[md];B[mb];W[nb]

;B[kf];W[jf];B[kg]LB[ic:A]SQ[nb][mc][nc][md][me][lf][mf]C[
MB: your last stone puts the marked white group in a bad position. Your group doesn't look bad, it can make  MB: at leas one eye on the upper side with a move like A (J17) and it also difficult for white to enclose it.
MB: i think this sequence is very good for black.];W[od];B[pc]
;W[pd];B[pe];W[oe];B[of];W[nd];B[qe]C[
MB: why not connect at R17? that way you are very strong in the area, white has half an eye at O15 (he has to play
MB: one more move to get an eye there) and he is almost enclosed.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[rb];W[ob]
(;B[qg]C[
MB: this is terrible! what is this move good for? it is _far_ too slow. white made a mistake by playing P18
MB: instead of Q18. You can give atari at R19 and he has one eye. if you play O14 next, his only chance is
MB: escaping into the center. Maybe he'll make it, but you'll get a lot of moves that will indirectly strengthen your  MB: E12 group. See variation.]
;W[nf];B[ib]C[
MB: J17 is possible.];W[gb];B[jc]LB[ki:A]C[
MB: this is too slow, again. L11 (A) would help both the L13 group and the E12 group.]
;W[oj]C[
MB: white gets this move. you should have played at P9 before he played at P10 :)]
;B[oi];W[ok];B[ni];W[rj];B[ri];W[qi];B[pi];W[rh];B[qh];W[si]
;B[rk]C[
MB: this is agressive and big. Even if you lose the ko, you should get two moves in a row somewhere else.
MB: And it's worth winning, too :)  Nice!];W[qi];B[pb]C[
MB: playing R19 is bigger on points.];W[pa];B[ri];W[rl];B[sj]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[pp];B[qq];W[sl];B[sh]C[
MB: this is way too small. you can always connect at S10 if necessary.]

C[
MB: this is nice. but what if .. (see var).]
(;W[cm];B[dl]C[
MB: white played submissively and you strengthened your group. these last two moves were good for black.
MB: the only problem is black lost sente.];W[cn]C[
MB: this is a bit cowardly. if black cuts there, white can play C4. This move really helps black.]
;B[fn];W[ef]C[
MB: playing E14 was nice for black too.];B[fl]C[
MB: Good shape, but maybe a bit too slow.];W[ic]C[
MB: this is a  very small white move.];B[jb]LB[jm:C][km:A]C[
MB: it's not worth answering. A move like A or C is worth many more points.]
;W[hc];B[jn]C[
MB: the previous white move was small too. You can afford to play this move at, say, L7, because you have a very strong
MB: wall on the left.];W[kk];B[lk]C[
MB: this is the wrong direction. N6 for instance is much much bigger. M9 doesn't do anything in terms of points
MB: compared to N6.];W[kl];B[ll];W[lm];B[km];W[jm];B[kn];W[mk]

;B[dk];W[hj];B[gk];W[gj];B[fk]SQ[fk][gk][fl]C[
MB: this (the marked stones) is the infamous empty triangle. Very ineffective shape. Why not play F10, for instance?]
;W[bj]C[
MB: this looks big, but it isn't quite so. some 5 points _gote_.]
;B[er]C[
MB: good.];W[dr];B[ep];W[dq];B[fr]LB[gh:A]C[
MB: bad. A (G12) is much bigger. if white wants to capture E2 he will end with gote, which makes it quite small.]
;W[mp]
(;B[mq]C[
MB: you're strong here. fight a bit. why not O4? see var.];W[oq]
;B[or]C[
MB: what are you afraid of? Why not grab the white stone with P4?]

MB: some points, but gote.];W[np];B[lp];W[lo];B[ko];W[lq];B[kp]
;W[lr];B[nr];W[ln];B[fj]C[
MB: this is too slow. G12.];W[mi];B[mj]C[
MB: why answer N11? If M11, N10. If N10, M11 and if white cuts at N12 you can live with L19. if you played
MB: the slow K18 move then get some benefit from it :)];W[ml]
;B[ng]C[
MB: this is painfully small. D1 is bigger (absolute sente), G12 is still bigger.]
;W[mg];B[mh]C[
MB: again, unnecessary. it is only three points. you can counter with D1 instead of answering N12. If white answers
MB: D1, you end up with sente and you can return to play N12 (or you can play somewhere else, which would probably
MB: be bigger :). If he plays N12, you don't need to connect, because if
MB: white cuts you can live with L19. You can instead continue D1 with C2. White loses some points in the corner :)]

MB: white helped here by playing small :)];W[gi];B[fi];W[fg]
;B[fh];W[gg];B[hi];W[ij];B[hg];W[hf];B[eg];W[df];B[dg]C[
MB: this last move is very small. why not D1 (or H19, B13) ? I think they are all bigger. Not necessarily in points, but if  MB: they are sente (H19 prepares a sente move, B13 threatens to do more damage and D1 is quite sente) white answers
MB: and you can play one more move, taking some more points away (or making some). Keeping sente in the endgame
MB: (yose) is essential.];W[ig];B[hh];W[ra];B[rd]C[
MB: not exactly necessary. D1 is bigger.];W[sk];B[rj];W[kc]
;B[kb]C[
MB: you can always connect at L19 if white pushes one more time. If you keep answering in the endgame you'll  MB: end up losing the game. You need to constantly look for ways to counterattack.]

MB: Nice game. You should be more careful in yose (endgame). You play many small moves (they gain a little number of
MB: points). Try to keep sente and do not answer automatically to the moves of the opponent. Maybe some of his  MB: threats are idle :))

MB: You were lucky to get some big yose moves, but your opponent was luckyier overall and won this game. There were  MB: many opportunities to get ahead, but you missed too many of them :)

MB: One final thing. You have two groups and white three. Theoretically if you have less groups your stones are more  MB: effective (proverb: "If you only have one group in the end, you've won"). But white manages to win by 2 points  MB: (without komi). This is another result of playing small moves, I guess.
