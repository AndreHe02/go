AB[pd][dp];W[qp]C[Hi, I'm white in this game.  After a disastrous beginning=
, I was able to turn this game around partly due to a few wasted moves by m=
y opponent.

Thanks for reviewing.];B[cd]C[shmolex [17k\]: hi]
(;W[qj]C[Should I be attack=
ing earlier in a handicap game? I normally play pretty passive in the first=
 couple moves for even games.  Since this was only 2 handicap, I thought it=
 would be okay.

Hi,

i think it is to much passiv. w must fight. black must play save.

if b play the same style, hi is the winner.];B[cj]
(;W[oq];B[qc]C[seems pretty small for the beginning...

it is a very big move for b. but, if i were b, i think i win the game and i must not play big moves.]
;W[jc];B[jq];W[qf]
(;B[jj]C[does this really achieve anything?

it is to big for a moyo. the moyo is to weak. better is to close the corner or attack the w side to example.]

wrong...


i think it is better, b live little in the corner
you canÂ´t kill him.(normaly)];B[de];W[df];B[ee];W[ff]C[so this gap ended up in the demise of th=
is killing attempt.  Should I have simply let him run and live small, while=
 I build influence in the process instead of trying to surround him?

it is better to close the b in the corner, bat now you play " i will kill the b corner"]

black shape is bad];B[dq];W[dr];B[er]
(;W[cs]C[I'm playing much more aggresively than I no=
rmally do.  here, I should connect at c2 and then clamp at f2 or escape at =
b5 depending on what he does right?

i think soo.];B[br];W[bq];B[cr];W[bo];B[bp];W[ao];B[ap];W[aq]
;B[cp];W[bm]C[So I thought about resigning at this point because I thought I was way be=
hind.  Then I thought if i could expand into the top right middle area to p=
revent him from getting territory there, I might have a chance.  I would al=
so have to hold on to almost the entire right side to have enough territory=
 at the end, so I wasn't expecting to really succeed much.]
;B[gi]C[Here are the wasted moves I'm talking about.  He tries now to seal =
in my top group and again later.  Even if I try to expand that group, all t=
hat does is give him more influence facing the right and left, and that's t=
he last thing I need.  Plus there isn't much territory to be made around g9=
 anyway.];W[fr];B[ds];W[of];B[qq]C[bad for b. s4 or p5 or r7 are better ideas i think]

1.  Preventing black territory in the middle.
2.  Obtaining the entire right side.

And I got some territory in the middle too, which was surprising.

Anyway, thanks again for reviewing!!])
