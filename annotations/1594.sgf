C[
Thanks for commenting my game.

This was my first game vs. a 2k* on IGS. I am playing black.]
;B[ed]C[
op 2k*: Hello];W[qc];B[dp];W[qq];B[pd];W[qd];B[pe];W[pc]C[I do not know this variant. I expected White to play P18. What is the correct response?

Jay: This seems w's intention to gain third line ground to counter b' E16 and Q16 combination.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[ob]C[This turned into a big ugly fight for both of us]
;W[od];B[nd];W[oe];B[mc]C[Jay: It looks that b is giving up the two Q15 stones.  If so, play O15 first to stari w's P15 stones is better than directly capture O17 stone.]
;W[ne]C[Jay: Now, w plays the important O15.];B[nb];W[md]C[Jay: W should capture b Q15 stones.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[qg];W[rf];B[pg]C[Jay: Q12 better.];W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[Jay: B should play at M16, threatening to eat the whole group at O16.  W will have to defend it, then B could get some territory, which combines well with E16 stone.]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[ri]C[Jay: See, if B had Q12, w's S11 would not be a threat.]
;B[qh];W[ng];B[pj];W[sh];B[rk]C[I felt I came out somewhat ahead, having secured my groups, and white's group floating in the center. Is this a correct impression?

Jay: It is hard to say.  B's right group still weak. W's middle group is also weak.  B's weak group come out ahead a little, but it is against the solid R3 stone.]
;W[kf]C[Jay: W should'v played at L16 or L15.];B[sg];W[pb];B[rb]
;W[rc];B[id]C[Jay: Now, B's J16 is big, due to earlier mistake by W at L14.]
;W[cc]C[I am only familiar with a C16 response. I improvised.]
;B[ce];W[dd];B[de];W[ec];B[fd];W[fc];B[gc];W[gd];B[ge];W[hd]
;B[hc];W[he];B[cd];W[dc]
(;B[fg]C[Again, this result seems Ok for me...

Jay: F13 does not protect the double stari...

G14 is better. See the variation.];W[gf];B[ie];W[fe];B[ee];W[if]
C[Jay: B lets W go too easy.]
(;B[dj]C[Jay: Q4 is more urgent now then D10.];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp]
;B[cn];W[jp];B[pp]C[Jay: Now Q4 is a bit too late.];W[pq];B[op]
;W[qp];B[qn]C[Try something new here. Also have other stones backing me up.

Jay: Now, B playing P3 is less meaningful, because of K4 stone.  R6 is the best local play now, still with weakness, while W has taken R4 and entered lower left.]
;W[qo];B[on];W[rn];B[qm];W[ic];B[jc]C[This cut was fairly big. I misread the loss of two top stones.]
;W[ib];B[jb];W[gb];B[ia];W[hb];B[ke];W[le];B[kd]C[This seemed small, but I was looking to cut at L14 at some point. Also a push at K14 would expose many cutting points.

Jay: More importantly, this gives B eye shapes B needs for the upper group.  Thus, it's a must play.]
;W[en];B[dm];W[rm];B[rl];W[sf]C[Did not understand the timing behind these white moves.

Jay: W tries to remove eye shape of B's group, aiming at the cut as W plays later.]
;B[oq];W[po]C[This was a good move. I had no wat to maintain my connectedness.]
;B[oo];W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[nm];W[ol];B[pk];W[nl];B[lq]C[This gives me eyespace

Jay: N8 is much better.  It applies pressure to W P8 stones and helps the right B group.  
 Why easily give up O7 stone.];W[mm];B[nj];W[lj];B[mh]C[Right side group must now work on living; cut is taking its toll.]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[oh];B[ph];W[mi];B[sj];W[si];B[qj];W[sl];B[ni]
;W[nh];B[mk];W[nn];B[lk];W[kj];B[kk];W[jj]
(;B[kn]C[Jay: B M5 is the shape. If w L6, B can push at M6 and cut to fight. L6 could not connect the two groups. See variation.]
;W[lo];B[jr]C[Thought L5 too risky. W M4, L4, N3,L3 and black P3 group is dead.

Jay: Now B still has two weak groups, under W's attack.];W[ko]
;B[il];W[hk];B[hl];W[fk]C[Jay: Now, B's large dragon is under attack, this is how B lost the left side, because W slowly enters b territory by attacking the large dragon.]
;B[jf];W[jg];B[je]C[Couldn't believe he'd left all those cutting points open to his moyo

Jay: W's next move is questionable, though overall thinking to continue the attack on B's middle group is correct.]
;W[gl];B[in];W[mr]C[Jay: Severe attack by W.];B[nr]C[But he keeps sente

Jay: W tries to kill.];W[mq];B[mp];W[lp];B[nq];W[np]
(;B[pr]C[I should have been a goner here. O1 creates a bad ko (?)

Jay: Yes, O1's ko is too heavy for B.  It is hard for b to play here anyway, there is always a ko (see variation).  Also, the middle large group does not have two eyes yet.]
;W[no];B[ms];W[lr]
(;B[ls]C[Jay: B should'v played L2.];W[kr];B[ks];W[kq];B[iq]
;W[hr]C[This seemed another white mistake. Allowing my groups to almost hook up seemed bad.

Jay: W should'v play at J4 to separate the two groups to keep attacking the large middle group.  One of them would end up in danger.]
;B[ip];W[os];B[ns];W[io];B[ho];W[jo];B[hn];W[qr];B[ps];W[cq]
;B[er];W[fr];B[gp];W[dr]C[Jay, B continue to pay price for the weakness of the middle group.]
;B[es];W[bp];B[cp]C[White pulled off a nice invasion here. Was there anything I could have done?]
;W[br];B[em]C[This was my compensation - more than adequate I thought]
;W[dk]
(;B[ck];W[cj]C[Jay, B c9 is not right.  It causes to much trouble for B.  See the variation.]
;B[bk];W[di];B[ej];W[ei];B[fj];W[fi]C[It seems this sequence was  an overplay for me.

Jay: Yes.  The trouble started earlier.];B[gj];W[ch];B[gi]C[And then it became VERY complex. Any suggestions welcome.]
;W[gh];B[bg];W[ek];B[ik];W[hi];B[ij];W[hj];B[bj]C[Jay: A10 is better at connecting the upper group.  But, at this point B's left is broken in.  W is winning.]

Thanks again!

Jay: Nicely played game.  There are lots of nice local plays and good fightings.  There are many opportunities for B to build advantages and win.  When learn to recognize them, you will improve fast.  
Thanks for allowing to review this game.])
