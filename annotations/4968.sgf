C[Hi,

This is a game between me and a 5k IGS player.  I played as black with a reverse 5.5 komi.  Although I'm 17k, I'm not really sure of my exact strength since I don't play online go often.  This game ended in a 5.5 loss for me, but I'm not exactly sure where I went wrong.  Sometimes, I didn't know whether to defend or tennuki for an attacking move.  Also, some missed sente endgame may have cost me the game.  Any comments would be very helpful

Thanks,
Charlie Pan];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[oc]
(;W[qn]C[This white move is ok but not the most oftenly played.

See variation for usual continuation];B[qp]C[correct];W[qk]
;B[do]LB[fc:1][np:3][qi:2]C[If you want to play on the right side again, the pro move will be R11(checked on gobase).

Your move is not bad at this stage because it prevents a white shimari here, but pros advise to the following :

1) play the biggest extension
2) play on your side
3) invade

To that regard, I would play F17, then R11 to put pressure on white.
or O4.];W[dl]C[I don't know any joseki for this pincer, so I just went with a one-point jump, is that correct?]
;B[fo]C[Yes, this is a joseki];W[fq]
(;B[fc]SQ[dd][dl]C[The joseki has a follow-up (see variation)

This is the wrong directon anyway, because you should lay between D16 and D8.

Though you play a big extension, you will help those stones, and they will possibly hurt your lower left stones]
;W[df];B[id];W[hp]C[Now white takes advantage of the unfinished joseki, and his somewhat stronger position above.]

(;B[em]C[In hindsight, white solidified a lot of his left territory by attacking my D5 group.  I probably should've spent more moves protecting it.

I have commented this a few moves ago, before I saw your comment :-)


Also, this move is somewhat cramped.
You could either sabaki on the corner, or play a larger move.]
;W[el]C[ouch.];B[fm];W[dm];B[dn]C[Ok, white helped you a lot here to make a very nice shape]
;W[gk];B[kq]SQ[ch][qi]C[I didn't want him to get more territory on the bottom, but maybe something like H6 would've been better?  I considered K3, but didn't want to give white two weak groups to attack.

This is not too bad, but this white group is very stable.

So your move at L3 is a pure territorry move. Besides, you will need an other move to make it territory.

You should try to look for attacking moves before this, or move that have a double purpose.

To that extent, R11 is such a move.

Also, because you left gorup is now fairly strong you can now invade the left side. C12 is a good point for this.]
;W[hn];B[hm]SQ[cq]C[Ok, getting out is a good option.
But by doing this, you will make white strong around you, which is bad for you because of the left side turning big for white, or because of your lonely L3 stone.

I would play C3];W[im];B[hl];W[hk]
(;B[il]C[J6 also possible.
Is often good to create aji buy cutting];W[jm];B[jk];W[gn];B[fl]
;W[fk];B[ep];W[eq]
(;B[eg]C[I thought about this move for a while.  In the end, I went with this reduction, but I can't help but feel there's a better move.  Any suggestions?

you can possibly invade deeper, but you would have to prepare this with a kikashi move (see variation.

However, your move could be ok if white lets you build a moyo at the top ...]
;W[fn];B[en];W[dg];B[eh];W[fe]C[white tries to separate.];B[hg]
;W[hi];B[gf];W[ji];B[lk];W[lm]
(;B[li]C[You MUST play E10 to separate white.

The essence of go is attack.
Territory is a 'by product' that you cash in on your way.

If you don't do this, white will connect at D11 or D12 by making territory.]
;W[di];B[kg]C[correct];W[jh];B[jg]C[Considering white's next move, I think I should've played something like R11 or R12 instead of K13.  That might've won the game for me.

Yes, obviously (and from the beginning), R11 was a move.

It would not have given you the game, because white has plenty of options, but it's better than K13.]
;W[qe];B[pe]C[White's attachment surprised me, I expected something like R14.  I went with the hane on the outside, but that was exactly what white wanted.  Maybe R14 or some other attacking move around R12 might've been better.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[rd];B[qc];W[qg];B[oh]C[good

You could possibly play a big sente move at D18 before this]
;W[pi];B[ko]SQ[cc][cp][db][rc]C[hmm, not the biggest.
S17, D18/C17, C4 are now bigger];W[db]
(;B[pn]SQ[hc]C[you can play E18 (threatens the white corner), because the classic invasion point at H17 becomes expensive.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[po]C[Inefficient shape....

No  problem at this stage.
The shape is 'inside' your territory];W[hc];B[gd]C[I overlooked this invasion, but I probably wouldn't have played a move top anyway.]
;W[fb];B[hd];W[gb];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb];W[ja];B[kb]C[I've always extended in this sort of position by convention, but is a double hane better?

Sorry, you should make this out by yourself (you'll learn more by exploring than by my telling) ...]

P10 is better];W[kn];B[jo];W[dp];B[kl];W[fp]C[This is a big mistake by white]

(;B[eo]C[Would L7 in exchange for white E5 be ok?  I think it's about even, but I'm not good at reading ahead.

This is not 'reading ahead'.

At any rate, E5 is ko !
So you MUST cut at L7

The point is :
White will gain 10 points (E4, F5 G5 H5 + G4 andG3) IF (and inly if) he wins the ko

Ok, to sum it up :

You did not make any bad mistakes in this game, but you merely missed a couple of opportunities (49,167)

Also, your yose, if improved, would earn you at least one stone in level.]
