AB[pd][dp][pp]C[My name is Greogr, I'm 17k on KGS and doing my second review. I'm at the beginning of go too, so take my hints as suggestions, not as truth :)
I will start every comment with "Gregor:" and refer to the moves with "bn" or "wm" for the nth move of black and the mth move of white.
Thank you for allowing me to review your game!];W[dd];B[oi]
C[Gregor: I think b2 at p11 is too high, I'd prefere c14 or c10 or r10.]
;W[pn]
(;B[on]C[Gregor: the usual answer for b4 is O4 or O3 or something in this area. Perhaps a squeeze at Q8 may be good. Kontact play for attacking is not recomended. See variations]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[lp];B[lo];W[pl];B[pk];W[he];B[pm]C[Gregor: I think bQ7 is too small at this stage of the Game. Black should pla around C10, H3 or K17]
;W[qm];B[om];W[qk];B[ol];W[rj]
(;B[ql]C[Gregor B18 at R8 is too small! better protect the upper right corner with R12. See variations]
;W[rh];B[ri]C[Gregor: B20 at S11 is again too small! the Big points at the left should be played!]
;W[rl];B[pl];W[ii];B[qi]C[Gregor: B24 at R11 again is too small. the left side is to be occupied!]
;W[si];B[qj];W[cn]
(;B[rk]C[Should I have payed more attention to the left here?
Gregor: sure. at W27 the answer sould be at F4 or F3. see variations:]
;W[rf]
(;B[sj]C[Gregor: again too small. better protect the upper reight corner. See variations]
;W[ck]
(;B[sh]C[Gregor again too small. the left side becomes entirely white! Invasion is difficult now. See Vvariations]
;W[sg];B[si];W[qo];B[po];W[qp]C[Gregor better expand into the corner or attace W twoo stones at the bottom. See variations]

(;B[oo]C[Would a capture at R6 have been better?];W[ik];B[gp]
C[Gregor: B40 at G4 is good!];W[ld];B[kd];W[cf];B[dn];W[bp]
;B[co];W[bo]
(;B[bn]C[Was this a good move? Should I have connected my stones?
Greogor: perhaps B48 at C7 is better. See Variations];W[cm]

(;B[cl]C[Gregor: B50 at C8 does not work. perhaps it's better to take the corner with C3. See variations]
;W[bm];B[an]C[That was a bad move, since the stone was dead anyway
Gregor: you are right.];W[dl];B[am];W[bl]
(;B[ge]C[Gregor a good idea to invade here. Perhaps better at a distance - contact play at attacke is not recomended. See Variations]
;W[gf];B[gd];W[hd];B[ff];W[fe];B[gc];W[hc];B[hf];W[ke];B[jd]
;W[ec];B[gg];W[qc]
(;B[gf]C[Gregor: B70 at G14 was a lost move, sorry to say. better play in teh upper right corner. See Variations.]
;W[rd];B[qd];W[eh]
(;B[jf]C[Gregor: good idea to connect. Perhaps better to play at K15. See Variations.]
;W[je]
(;B[ie]C[Should I have tried to save the two stones to the upper right of where I played?
Gregor: I thik to play at j17 instead can work. See variations.]
;W[id];B[kc];W[if]
(;B[ig]C[Gregor: i think it's better to connect . See variations.]
;W[jb]
(;B[ie];W[kb];B[lc];W[lb];B[mc];W[mb];B[md];W[lj];B[le];W[kf]
;B[kg]C[Gregor: again B92 is too small. There are much bigger points on the board. S7, c3, K4 or in the lower right corner.]
;W[rm]C[Gregor: now w plays one of them!];B[lf]C[Should I have played at the lower right?
Gregor: Yes, there seem to be bigger points in the bottom of the board.]
;W[cq]C[Gregor: this is a very big one!]
(;B[ep]C[Gregor: better to play at d3 to protect the side. See variations.]
;W[pq]
(;B[np]C[Gregor: I'd prefere p3 instead. See var.];W[jq];B[kq]
C[is L4 a better move?];W[kr];B[kp];W[mr]
(;B[mq];W[gr]C[Gregor Now the openness of the bottom left becomes clear! instead of b104 at n3 perhaps d2 would have been better. See var.]
;B[lq];W[fk];B[ic];W[nc]
(;B[ke]C[Gregor: no need for b110. See var.];W[oe]
(;B[re]C[Gregor B112 at s15 cannot work. Better perhaps at r14. See var.]
;W[qe]
(;B[se]C[That was a bad move. Would Q15 have been a good move?
Gregro: I think it's too late to save the two stones qr16. I tried a var. but I don't know if it really would work.]
;W[sf];B[pe];W[sd];B[qf];W[pc];B[re];W[od];B[rg]C[Here, I just put myself into atari, and the stone was practically useless]
;W[pf]C[Here, I don't notice that the three stones (Q16, R16, and Q15) are dead.]
;B[se];W[qe];B[nd]C[Gregor: Too small. better take with h18. Or play in the lower left corner.]
;W[hb];B[nb]C[should I have played K17 instead?
Gregor K17 would have been better. o18 is no gain.];W[oc];B[ob]
C[Gregor: and p18 is loss.];W[gb];B[if]C[Gregor: no need for j14! one point loss! No point gain!]
;W[nr]
(;B[or]C[Gregor p2 cannot work now. better m2. See var.];W[oq]
;B[nq];W[lr]
(;B[pr]C[Gregor: no gain in q2. better e2 or l9. see var.];W[qr]
;B[op];W[qq];B[jr]C[Gregot: k2 cannot work. better e2. or k4. or somewehre in the middle.]
;W[ir];B[jp];W[iq];B[hr];W[im];B[io];W[hq];B[hs]C[Gregor: no gain, but 1 point loss at least!]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[gs];W[hp];B[ho];W[go]
(;B[fp];W[gn]C[Gregor: now the whole black group is in big troubles. where schould it make two eyes? better safely connect ! See var. (b158 at g3)]
;B[fs]C[Would F2 be a better move?];W[fr]
(;B[is]C[Here, I should have played D2
Gregor: d2 would not have worked either. see var.
better play elsewehre, f.i.m8. see var.]
(;W[ki];B[ip]C[Pretty useless move, I think. I should have played G3
Gregor: no need for g3, no gain. better at l8 f.i.. see var.]
;W[gq];B[dr];W[hn];B[es]C[K1 would have allowed me to take the group I was trying to take
Gregor never think you can play two stones at a time:)];W[js]
;B[fq]C[I should have played D1];W[ds];B[bq]C[Gregor: no gain with b166, better play elsewhere, f.i. l8.]
;W[cr];B[cp]C[Gregor: I think the group is lost already so dont't waste moves here.]

;W[sp];B[sn];W[sm];B[tt];W[mn]C[Gregor: as a resumee: I think, you should play bigger points in the beginning, don'd loose yourself in small battles. keep connected in the middle and try to reduce the opponent's territory in the endgame.
