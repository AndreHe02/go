;W[dp];B[oe];W[dd];B[ip]C[white must certainly invade];W[pq]
C[maybe not the best place.  Q4 looks
good to me];B[qp];W[qq];B[np]
(;W[qo]C[I think white is already secure enough
in the corner, so should work elsewhere
to reduce black's excesses.  The
obvios spot (to me) is q10 instead
of r5.  R5 is slow and makes black
thicker for small gain, and probably
is gote too.];B[rp];W[pp];B[po];W[ro];B[qn];W[rq];B[rn];W[sp]
C[so white has secured blacks over
large corner, but has lost sente];B[pm]C[unnecessary for black to do this.
Black gives sente back, which
makes white not look so bad.];W[pj];B[ph]C[compare this to the previous
variation. which is better for
white?];W[qh];B[qg];W[qi];B[qk];W[rg];B[qf];W[rf]C[there probably isn't room for 2 eyes 
against the wall, so it's pointless
to squeeze it out now.  White should
escape and leve the final resolution
of the side shape for later.];B[re];W[rj];B[qj];W[pi];B[rk]
;W[ri];B[oh];W[nj];B[sh]C[black is very unlikely to be able to kill
white given the current situation, so 
this eye-stealing move is just a gift of
sente.  Better strategy would be
to leave the bad ajii implicit - white will
have to play cautously knowing that
his second eye could always be stolen.]
(;W[sg]C[white plays along, so black won the
exchange.  Given the openness of
the situation, black has to make
several more gote moves to get
any profit and both eyes, and most
of white still escapes.  See variation.
Even if all the white stones died,
white would still come out ahead by
ignoring black's attack.];B[id]C[black has overreached again, but
white has to be cautios because of
the side group's status.];W[md]C[this is a little curious.  If black
just caps at  n15 or n14, n16
looks very weak, and the side group
is starting to look very shakey.

I think white shoudl do something
designed to definitely leave some
thickness in the center for o10 to 
run to.  Perphaps j6.];B[oc]C[this makes thinks easier for white]
;W[qc]C[this looks like a mistake to me.  White
will at best get a very small corner, or
more likely will not get the corner at all,
and black will end up with a thick position
which challenges both n16 and the side
group.]
(;B[mf]C[tactical error, black should
protect the corner. (see variation)];W[pd];B[od];W[qe]C[white cashes in on black's error.]
;B[pe];W[qd];B[cf]C[Black should approach from the other
side, to help j16.]
(;W[ch]C[I thiink the direction of play
is wrong here.  Black will run
out, which makes life difficult
for white at n16.];B[fc];W[dc];B[ef];W[be];B[ce];W[cd];B[bf]
;W[bd];B[eb];W[cb];B[cj];W[eh]C[this sequence really helps white, because
black acquires a weak group, and white
gets to run and ruin the potential black
center.];B[ej];W[gh];B[cn]C[black should really aim to keep
n16 and h12 separated and eyeless.
Trying to make this little side group
just trades white for a bigger corner.];W[fq];B[gf];W[ke];B[if]

(;W[kg]C[I think running here isn't necessary - white
can still live inside, without putting 
the stones at g12 in a worse 
situation.  See variation.];B[ih];W[hi];B[ji];W[hk];B[bp];W[mh]
