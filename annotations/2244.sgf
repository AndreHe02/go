Not great, but G16 isn't too great
either.  G16 and K16 are likely to
be split from Q16 and have no base.
I might have tried F17];W[np];B[pn];W[oq];B[pq];W[dj];B[ff]
C[Strange looking.  The natural thing
to do at this point is to split white at
C12];W[fj]C[
This is an odd looking position - black
and white are both playing for influence,
and seem unwilling to approach each
other.];B[dg];W[cf];B[cg];W[cj];B[jj];W[mj]C[This is very strange.  Black's side
of the board is still invadable almost
anywhere. N17 N16 R13 Q13 come
to mind.];B[pg];W[mm];B[ol];W[nl];B[mg];W[qc]C[Isn't it a bit premature ?

No, I would say "finally!"];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]C[can't play this close, R14 is the right move]

I think so

No, white has a solid eye at A
and easy opportunity to make
another at B or by extending at C];B[qk];W[rk];B[rl];W[qj];B[ql]

T12 is good, but just barely.  White
runs out of liberties.];W[qh];B[ph];W[sh];B[jl];W[gl];B[gp]

This is a key point in the development
of the game.  I wouldn't have played
this way, but I can't definitively say
that it is wrong.  To my eye, the white
area around A is hard to invade,
even without F5,  and G4 is too high
to live if cut off at B.  So I would cut black
off.  It gets complicated, but black
is being given an easy out in this
line of play.];B[ho];W[go];B[ip];W[jo];B[hm];W[gm];B[im];W[iq]

(;W[ir]C[its still possible to cut black off and
(if played right) force a biig Ko.  Black
can't afford to lose the ko, so white
has to be given something.  See
variations.];B[hn];W[nc]
(;B[qb];W[kc]C[Same question here: how to kill that ?

First move was wrong.  The situation
in the corner was locally stable.  You
should have responded to the invasion
by pressing from the outside.];B[ld];W[lc];B[jc];W[jb];B[ib]

another gift.];B[lo];W[mo];B[lp];W[lq];B[mp];W[mq];B[km];W[hh]

Tactics were not bad, generaly, but the
opening was questionable.  Both
players played big influence moves 
and timid reducing moves, which kept
the fights simple.  It's not bad, actually,
for weaker players to play this way against
each other.  But you'll get clobbered in
handicap games because all these
open areas will be invaded.])
