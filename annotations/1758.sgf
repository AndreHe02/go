C[Hello!

I am a 2nd kyu from germany. I hope you learn from my comments, but they are only hints of course, because i am not so strong myself.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[jq];B[mq]LB[cn:A][dj:B]C[how about the move?

The idea of the chinese-opening is to build a moyo and to force white to invade it. This black move is against this general idea but not necessary bad. I would prefer to play at A or B.]
;W[oq];B[qq]LB[mo:A]C[This move is questinable. It does not use your first move in this area, because you dont threaten to connect. Better simple at A.]

(;W[pq]C[This move is bad shape ( i am shure you know this allready). Better play for white, see variation.]
;B[qp]
(;W[mo]C[you should first force black to live in the corner. See Variation.]
;B[po];W[oo];B[pn]C[now black has a much larger territory at the right side.]
;W[ql];B[qj]C[is the pincer right?

it is playable, i think.]
(;W[pk]C[Better to force black in the corner to gain some shape. White attack the weak stone. It is better to attack the strong stones to gain strength and shape.]
;B[qk]C[bad move. black makes white strong.];W[pl];B[on];W[no]
;B[pj];W[nl];B[ol]C[aji keshi. you cant cut now. you should leave this for later possibilities. it is at least a lost ko-thread.]
;W[ok];B[om];W[nj];B[nm];W[ro];B[rn];W[rm];B[sn];W[sm];B[qm]
;W[rk]
(;B[lm]LB[pg:A]C[you are still alive in the corner, so it is maybe better to do something for your weak 3 stones at the edge and play around A. If you want to go out in the middle with your cornergroup it is better to play like in the variation to force white into bad shape.]
;W[ml];B[mm];W[ko];B[lo]C[another cut, that simple does not work. leave the aji of the N3-stone for later.]
;W[lp];B[ln];W[mp]LB[lq:A]C[should be at A to protect both cuts with one move. The white move protects also both cuts, but leaves more aji.]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[kq];W[lq];B[kr];W[jo];B[lr];W[mr];B[nr];W[nq]
;B[ms];W[or];B[mq];W[jr];B[dj];W[dm]LB[co:A][ed:B][ph:C]C[better to play one of A to C.  White builds a moyo, which is to small and has a huge weakness in the corner.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[bm];B[dr];W[er]
;B[cr];W[eq];B[cl]C[aji keshi again. this erases much of the endgamepotential of moves on the edge and does not gain much.]
;W[cm];B[ch]LB[ed:A][pg:B]C[better at A or B. C12 is a single-purpose-move, which makes only territory and not much of it, because white is allready at the second line at B7.]

(;W[qh]C[i would prefer a 4th-line approach (Q12) because white can gain strength in the process which should be useful to invade the upperside or make profit bye capturinig the 3 stones.]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[pg];W[rd]
(;B[qc]C[maybe better as in the variation...];W[rc];B[qf];W[rf]
;B[qe];W[re];B[md]LB[kd:A]C[this is really to short to your wall. overconcentrated. maybe around A.]
;W[dc]LB[ec:A][ed:B]C[I did not like this invasion-point. it gives black a possibility to make white havy. I think A or B are more flexible.]
;B[cc];W[db]
(;B[cb]C[Black has not to answer this move in the corner. See variations.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[fd];B[hc]C[H16 is better shape without cuttingpoint.]
;W[ge];B[gb]C[better answer the atari at H16. White has many cuttingpoints to worry about.]
;W[hd]C[this ponuki is to much. black gets only a few points at the edge for exchange.]
;B[fb];W[fc];B[id];W[ie];B[je];W[if];B[jf];W[df];B[cf];W[de]
;B[ce];W[mg];B[nf]LB[ig:A][qd:B]C[submissive. black can ignore this move and play elsewhere. A or B looks good]
;W[ng];B[mf];W[lg];B[ig];W[hf];B[hg];W[gg];B[jg]
(;W[gl]LB[qb:A]C[what's white intention?

i dont know. maybe you should answer white? ;-)

maybe white trys to secure and enlarge his territory in the center. but this move is to small. lokally maybe like in the variation... but i think A is the largest move here]

possible.];W[fm];B[gm];W[gn];B[hm];W[el];B[fk];W[hn];B[in]
