;B[pd]C[Hello,
Me and my opponent liked this game a lot
We feel af if we both made serious mistakes though.

I have added some comments at crucial point in the game. It is partucularly at those points I like you to give youre thougts about the posistion on the board. Furthermore I am curious at your comments

Thanks for the effort

Dowue Meijer

Hello
I like this game too it is tense and the lead is shifting back and forth. My comments begin with MM:

Manfred Minnebusch];W[pq];B[cd];W[dp]LB[po:A]C[MM: In this situation, a Hoshi (4/4) facing a komuku (3/4) a kakari (appraoch move) at A is high desirable.]
;B[cn]C[MM: Black tries to play the Kobayashi-Fuseki which usually continues as in the variation.]

(;W[cl]C[MM: This pincer is unusual to prevent  the Kobayashi-Fuseki because.... (see move 15)]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq]C[MM... the resulting wall wants to be developed towards the left top but there is no suitable move to do it.]
;W[qf];B[nc]LB[qh:A][pi:B][po:C]C[MM: another idea is to pincer at A or B. If White then enters the corner Black will use the resulting sente to approach at  C.]
;W[qk]LB[ec:D][ed:C][cg:F][cj:E][po:A][np:B]TR[dp]C[I (black) didn't know quite what to do against this minichinese opening pattern.

MM: Usually the mini-chinese is a black weapon, working together with a stone at the triangeled marked place. The idea is to make White (in this case Black) to come in at A answering at B, in which case the circled stone hinderes the invader to develop in a natural way. By attacking the invading group on the right side, the bottom is designed to become territory. In this game the bottom is already played out because of the low black stone at F3. Since a kakari or a shimari (corner enclosure) is always on top of the list of valuable moves in the fuseki, let's consider the pros and cons of A, C and D for Black. Black C is a good shimari to counter the white influence on the left, but doesn't work very well together with O17 which is low. Black D seems to be better, it finishes off the upper right in one move.  Both shimaris have a very good continuation at E so White may play around F in answer to a black shimari. In this case Black can switch to A.]
;B[po]TR[fq]C[MM: A kakari in the fuseki can not be bad, so this is a good move too which works together with the marked stone. The variation shows one usual contuniation of the mini-chinese.]

(;W[qo];B[pp];W[qp];B[oq];W[qq];B[pn];W[or]LB[qm:A]C[I thin White A would have been better.]
;B[qn]C[I played here because this way I can make a nice invasion at or around R 12 later but maybe it is batter just to play O3 instead ?

MM: R6 and O3 are some kind of miai (points of roughly equal value, if one takes the first, the opponent takes the other). R6 cuts and weakens the upper white stones. If White O3 now, Black can ignore this because the bottom is not importand. if White makes a ponnuki (capturing P3) Black pushes up at F4 countering the white influence on the bottom right.]
;W[rd];B[qh]C[MM: Good move. The variation shows the usual coninuation for White which is not suitable in this game.]

(;W[ok]
(;B[qc]LB[qe:A]C[MM: I would like to play at A instead as in the variation. This way White is ahead in the struggle to get into the center.]
;W[of];B[oh];W[pi];B[ph];W[mf];B[pf]LB[mh:A]C[MM: A is mandatory. Believe in the proverb "Never cut a one point jump". (Although there are rare exeptions)]
;W[pe];B[pg];W[oe]C[I see the mistake, I cant cut at R15

MM: Yes this was a bad action. Black has build two empty triangles and has strengthened White.]
;B[rc];W[od];B[pc];W[qe];B[oi]LB[rg:B][mh:A]C[MM: A is better. In running fights like this the first who gets into center is at an advantage. The goal is to bend around one of the enemy groups with a capping move at some point. The one with only one running group is usually at an advantage because he has to run only once, while the opponent has to jump twice. In this game moving with the Q12 group has top-priority for Black. If there is time every move with the top means profit. But the situation is not really bad for White either. First White is ahead in the center-struggle, second the black Q6 group has to move sooner or later. Richard Bouzulich gives the following rule to evaluate such position (from "501 Opening Problems): "for every weak group with no eyes count minus 20 points, for a weak group with one eye minu 10 points". According to this rule Q14 was a loss of at least 10points, because White can make an eye at B now.]
;W[mk];B[mi];W[md];B[mc];W[nj];B[mh];W[kj]LB[lj:B][mj:C][kk:E]
[lk:A][ll:D]C[The promblem is I am weak myself as well. When I jump out I recon my opponent has the more weak groups on the board.

MM: Meanwhile the Q6 group is weak too, so everybody has two weak groups. 
But I don't like the last move of White. The knights move is always shouting: "Cut me!" Not now, but there is a future possibilty to cut with A to E. And, by the way I don't like white O10, which is peeping a bamboo joint now, which is considered as bad shape. Simply jumping to E would have been better for White.]
;B[kh]C[MM: the only move];W[kd]LB[rg:A][no:C][nq:B]C[MM: Since Black has strenghtened White with the failed attempt to cut the one point jump (A makes a sente eye now) White should now attack Q6 with B or C]
;B[nq]LB[ih:A]C[MM: very good. The other urgent move is A but White would take the lead by attackin Q6.]
;W[no]C[MM: Good. A vital point.];B[nr]LB[mo:B][np:A]C[MM: Connecting with A (maybe B first )seems better. White could cut now.]
;W[pr];B[np];W[lo];B[kp];W[eq]LB[go:C][fp:A][hq:B]C[MM: Bad. Aji keshi (wasting future possibilties). This erases the potential of moves like A, B or C.]
;B[er];W[gr];B[fr]C[MM: The last two moves were pure profit for Black. White has gained nothing.
Now we have a text-book fuseki problem: White to move, where to play. There is only one point. Remember what was said about running fights.]

(;W[ed]LB[ih:A]C[MM: Wrong. The only point is A. White A and Black is completly on the defense while White will take profit on the top and in the center. The variations are given to illustrate what is meant. Black has to play on the inside while White will play on the outside.]
;B[hd]LB[ih:A][ij:B]C[I played this pincer because I still plan to atack the N14 group

MM: This is a bit overoptimistic. Black's N12 group is too weak for this attempt. H16 puts another group on the board, which Black has to look for (there is a proverb "If you have six groups, one is dead"). I recommend playing the calm move of A which makes miai of bending around at B and a move at the top.]
;W[jf];B[ih];W[hf];B[df]LB[ji:C][hj:B][ij:A]C[MM: This move is not urgent. A (or if you fear the double peep at C, B) turns the balance of power in the center.]
;W[ff]LB[fe:F][ef:H][ci:G][ji:D][ij:C][jj:A][jk:B][lk:E]TR[hd]
[pf][pg][ih][kh][mh][oh][ph][qh][mi][oi]C[What is the propper plkay now for black ? It looks as If my plan faild and it is black who has the most problems at the moment

MM: The n12 group is bigger than H16 so the latter has to abandoned for the time being. I would play A, White B, Black C makig an eye at D, although this makes White stronger too (the cut at E disappears). Then Black can look forward to cut at F or extend to G. By the way: I don't like the last white move at F14 as it leaves a weak point at F. H would have been better.]
;B[fe]LB[gh:A]C[MM: Locally a very good move but there is a danger that Black's center group will come under an even harder attack. White A now looks forceful.]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[ge];B[fd]LB[fg:A][gh:B]C[MM: Shows good fighting spirit, but with Black A, White F16, Black B Black would have been able to get rid off his center problems and can look forward to attack the white N9 group.]
;W[ec]LB[hi:A]C[MM: Shows fighting spirit too but I would prefer to fight in the center with A. Anyway there seems to be an agreement between both players to ignore the bigger center and to play out the upper left first.]
;B[fc];W[cc];B[bc];W[fb];B[gb];W[db];B[kb]LB[ea:B][fa:A][lb:D]
[gc:C]C[MM: In this position the first move that comes to mind is A. White is forced to play a ko with B. Now White has possibilties at C and D. The variations are given to show some of the aji of this position.]

(;W[lc]LB[lb:A]C[MM: Bad. Aji keshi. Never strike at the "waist" of the knights move. The first that one should consider when trying to cut the knights move is cutting by jumping through (A in this case) see previos var.]
;B[lb];W[ic];B[hc];W[gd];B[gc]
(;W[bb];B[ib]LB[fg:A]C[I was happy being connected, It feels as if white let me escape here........

MM: my reading is that White was correct in first securing his own group (see var)

But before j18 you should have ataried at A.];W[fg]C[MM: good move. Threatens left and right]
;B[be];W[ac];B[ad]LB[cj:A]C[MM: A is bigger];W[gi]LB[bd:A]C[MM: good but astonishing. Reflex must be capturing at A attacking the left side, but suddenly White shifts to the bigger center fight. The agreement is over now.]

(;B[ig];W[if];B[ij]LB[ji:B][jj:A][rj:C]C[attaching at A, making an eye at B in sente, then looking for the second eye with C seems safer.]
;W[ji]C[MM: This is a forceful move. The black group is in great danger. Note that Black can not make two eyes on the right side (as will be shown later). Black now must escape through the center (see variations)]

(;B[ab];W[ca]LB[ii:A]C[Trading the upper right against the center black group with A would have give White a won game. First matchball White missed.]
;B[dd];W[dc];B[ea]LB[ba:A][fa:B]C[MM: Bad move although there is a two stage ko at A left to kill White. But at the moment Black is to weak at he right side to do so. Better not to play here at all (the center is more important) and leave the possibility of a direct ko with B.]
;W[fa];B[pj];W[pk];B[qj]
(;W[rj]LB[rk:A]C[MM: This attacks in gote and gives Black two eyes. With White A there is only one eye at the right side (see varitations). Second matchball for White]
;B[ri];W[rk];B[rg]C[MM: Black lives now.];W[sh]C[MM: but white wants Black to live big.]
;B[rf];W[si];B[re];W[lp];B[lq]LB[kq:A]C[MM: Failure. Has to be at A. (see varation)]

(;W[oo]LB[ch:A][kq:B]C[MM: Aji keshi. There is no eye at P4 anyway. This is wasting liberties for the fight. Biggest move is A. Then B is a threat.]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[mp];W[nm];B[om];W[nn];B[op]LB[ch:A]C[MM: A is very much bigger.]
;W[ko];B[jp];W[jo];B[cj]LB[ba:B][ch:A]C[I think playing at jy once more is makes my terretoru at the bottom safe this is probably an overplay for black.

MM: C10 is a good move. Not only it forestalls the big white A but prepares for the ko at B. This prepartion is necessary because if Black would loose the ko his whole group would die without an extension on the left.]
;W[dh];B[dk]LB[ch:A]C[MM: This is an overplay and could have been the losing move. Connecting at A is mandatory. Now White takes the lead.]
;W[ch];B[bg];W[bh];B[bf];W[de];B[ce];W[ip]C[I was afraid to lose the A 18 group, that is not good I think I made croward like moves and it cost me a lot of points

MM: After White C12 Black has to play this way to live. D9 was the mistake, but it smacks greedy not coward.]
;B[fp]LB[jr:A]C[sophrosune [4k\]: brb

MM: I don't know what brb means but this is a mistake. Black has to defend at the vital point at A.]

(;W[iq]LB[jr:A]C[MM: A is the correct point to attack (see variations)]
;B[jr];W[ir];B[lr]
(;W[fo]LB[js:A]C[MM: Better to continue the attack at A (see variation).]
;B[go];W[fn];B[io];W[in];B[ho];W[hn];B[gp];W[gn]C[MM: This was a big gain for Black. Now the game is even again. The variation shows how Black can get into a close endgame.]

(;B[gk]C[now black has loads of trouble making a living group in the center
