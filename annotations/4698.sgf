C[Thanks in advance for the review.  I know the game isn't close, but there were a lot of points in the game where I really didn't know what was going on.  I played white and I let black get a really big side.  I looked over my moves and tried to state was I was thinking, but I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement.

- Nick

First of all, this is my first game review for the GTL, so please excuse the bad language and maybe the uncompleteness.
Most of my comments are at the beginning, because there was the most to comment
In the end of the game there where neraly no comments, since this was jose (which I'm not too good at anyways xD)

The game was interesting to watch, what I want to mention about the way you play is, that you sometimes seem very affraid of your opponent.
Also, i want to say, that you have very weak groupd standing around on the board, that you should take care of.

There are some general tips i want to give you:

First: You have good ideas, but kind of miss them during the game, so make some tsumego and train reading out situations. The strategie would work fine, but you don't achieve what you wanted.

Second: Keep track on your ideas, you sometimes are inconsequent, you sacrifice something or let groups of you become weak in order to do something, but you forgett to do so in the end, which leaves you a weak group.

Third: Winning with 0.5 points is enough ^^ So let your opponent have a bit if you get the bigger one ^^ and don't always play on the 4th line.
There's a proverb, which says: The fourth line is for development and the third for completion, so try to complete your territory more often ^^
Otherwise your opponent will destroy you incomplete territory.

Fourth: Just keep on playing, there's lots of potential, since you've got good ideas
Just try to strengthen your groupd more often and play alot, because most of your mistakes were just because of missing experience.

Fifth(Last ^^): Your opponents move's are not always forcing for your response, so take sente.]

(;W[iq]LB[hq:A]C[I was thinking that I should split up black by playing here.  I played here instead of A because I thought that having a base on the bottom side was important.]

(;B[de]
(;W[cd]LB[ce:A]C[I wasn't really sure what the right response was here.  I thought about attaching under the stone at A, but I couldn't figure out the right sequence to play so I figured I'd go the simple way.]

(;B[oq];W[eq]LB[pj:A][lq:B]C[In retrospect it looks like playing the start point on the right (at A) might have been better.  My thinking was to make white heavy so that I could attack and build influence in the center.

As you said in the beginning, you though it was important to have a base on the lower side.
That's why you played J3.
So maybe B would have been good as well.

Also i dislike this E3 move totally ^^]
(;B[fp];W[lq];B[qj];W[dj]LB[nc:B][cj:A]C[I chose playing on the fourth line because black has two weak groups that I am hoping to attack.

That move is good, but as you saw before, the Black F3 group is not that weak.
I think I'd have played either this move or O17.];B[ce];W[cg]
;B[cn]LB[cl:A][dn:C][cp:B][cq:1]C[This move seemed kinda wierd to me.  I figure if I keep black split I figure to do well here.  Would a move at A, B or C been better?

Hm, this move's very hard to answer, it hit the key weakness in you position i think. Maybe Black C would have been even better.
Your position has got the problem that this Black move
 splits your two groups, that are both still open for invasion and even for getting attacked, since both groups end with a stone on the fourth line.

Normally I'd answer at B to save the corner. but the corner wouldn't be save at all here, because Black can play 1.
I think C would have been best.]
(;W[en]C[Splitting was the only response that made sense to me, I didn't think letting black have a settled outward wall was acceptable.

If you want to split Black D6 would have been better, as you probably know, you can'T kill both groups, so you can attack one to gain strength for killing the other.
E6 makes it too easy for Black.]
(;B[bp];W[cq]C[Black can also split your groups, which could get very dangerous.
That's another reason why D6 would have been better.]

(;W[fo]C[I think I should have played the nights move and instead of trying to kill, just attack.]

(;W[dr];B[nn];W[jd]C[I didn't want to let black get a wing formation here, but black was quickly getting lots of territory.]
;B[fe];W[gc];B[lc]LB[nd:A][qf:B][qg:C]C[This seems like lots of trouble to me.  I considered A, B and C to try and plit black up and prevent him from getting too much territory, but with R17 still open I decided to just cap, building my moyo and increasing the pressure on the heavy black group at F15.

You play alot of stones on the fourth line.
K17 would look alot beter to me if it was on the 3rd line.]
;W[le];B[nd];W[lj]C[I felt this was an overplay, but I thought it would pay off.]
;B[eh];W[eg]C[It seemed to me that black was in serious trouble here and I was thinking this would be the best way to get my central influence.]

Black hasn't got as much on the right as you think ^^
It's all open for invasion right now and as you said before, R17 is stll open ^^]
;B[nh]
(;W[mi]C[This move seems almost wasted.  I didn't want to let black's weak group connect out.

Black won'T be able to connect out anyway, you would probably have to sacrifice something if he tried, so this move would have been good in the endgame i suppose.]
