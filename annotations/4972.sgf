AB[pd][dp][pp]C[K- hi, thanks in advance for your review.

This game was played at my local club between myself and another member, Phil. We had a brief discussion after the game, and I have included some of these comments in the SGF, prefixed K or P as appropriate.

[Rich\] - Hi, I'll make comments as I go and then summarise at the end.]
PL[W];W[dd];B[pj]C[[Rich\] - I'd prefer an approach in a handicap game, but this isn't bad. You're going for influence.]
;W[cn];B[fq];W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[[Rich\] - Your stone at Q10 was played for influence; with this stone in place, a pincer at M17 or L16 is usual. This way, you're playing for territory in the same direction as you've already chosen for influence. See var.]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[qn]C[K- playing a deliberately territorial style

[Rich\] - It's a fair choice to make, but in this case Q10 is now almost a wasted move. The black stones are bunched on the right side, the white stones are spread around the board. 

The joseki black plays here is usually only played if black has a stone at K3 or K4. Otherwise a white play there is too good. Also, with a stone at Q10, move 10 should be a line higher at Q6.]
;W[iq]C[P- over-extended due to being behind by handicap

[Rich\] - A play at K3 is perfect here. With a handicap, you should play the best shape you can, it will pay off later. Now you have a weakness and black can push your group around.

A weak group can end up costing points rather than making them.]
;B[cl];W[bp]
(;B[cq]C[[Rich\] - You can let him live small in the corner in exchange for influence here. See var.]
;W[bq]
(;B[br]C[[Rich\] - Again, you can let him live small in the corner in exchange for influence here. See var.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[do];B[eo];W[en];B[fo]C[[Rich\] - it's a good move, but white's made a stable group and taken the initiative this way.]
;W[ci]C[[Rich\] - A good move, surrounding the black stone and extending from the top left!]

(;B[el]C[[Rich\] - you can use a forcing move here to jump out further. See var.]
;W[dk]C[P- mainly played to strengthen the nearby stone (C11)

[Rich\] - It's a good move, but not because it strengthens C11! A play at E10 or 11 would be more effective there. This is good because it makes black's stones heavy, taking away eyespace.]
;B[dl];W[bm];B[gl];W[jd];B[cc]C[K- not sure this was the right thing to do.

Didn't fancy knight's / 1-space approaches to star point because didn't want to get into a running fight with a weak group that could make complications all over the board

[Rich\] - It's not a move you often want to make, but in this case you have to grab some territory at the expense of influence, or white will play D17 first and get both.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[db]C[K- I played this because I do not like the usual continuation (ending in ponnuki at B14) with white having stones at C11 and D9

P- how should white respond?

[Rich\] - Hmm, good question! I think going for the ponnuki in this case would be best for white, although it's a little close to the stone at C11. You can't have everything with a 3-3 invasion... I wouldn't have played the double hane, a standard extension at C14 would have worked perfectly well with K16; a good result for white.

However, black's move makes this complicated. Complications are better for white, especially in a handicap game.]
;W[bd];B[bc]C[P- passive, black gets best result by cutting at D15

[Rich\] - yes, it's a good kikashi.];W[ae];B[fb];W[cb];B[bb]
;W[eb];B[ca];W[fc];B[ea];W[gb];B[fa]C[[Rich\] - Should be at E17, that's what move 46 threatens. White has to defend, and there's the bad aji of G17 and cutting into his space with a ko.]
;W[ga];B[ec];W[ed];B[da]C[[Rich\] - Cut at G17! you have no need to make this, it gives white time to defend.]
;W[fd]C[K- obviously ended up small, but I have sente and my group is bomb-proof... I am trying to avoid having weak groups

So I am not totally disappointed at the outcome

P- this move should have been at G17];B[lq]C[[Rich\] - I think I'd play one space left. The single white stone is weaker, if you chase it out you'll build up power to attack the two to the right.]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[kq]
(;B[nr]C[[Rich\] - After a cross-cut, either an extension or an atari is almost always the most urgent move. This is a territorial move, there are stones to settle first. See vars.]
;W[jp];B[lr];W[ko]C[[Rich\] - This ponnuki is perfect for white, black's attack solidified the group and made it thick for only a few points at the edge.]
;B[fn];W[fj];B[bl];W[bo];B[ek]C[K- not a good plan

[Rich\] - indeed, good that you see why. A few points, and white gets strengthened. Contact plays like this are for the endgame or for making your own groups secure, but this group is fine.]
;W[ej];B[dj];W[di];B[cj];W[bj];B[ck]C[K- small and gote :-(]

(;W[ji]C[P- overplay, should have played H11

[Rich\] - Black's still ahead in real territory. I think invading the right side is possibly bigger; in any case, a play like this that turns thickness into territory is usually small compared to using it to attack, especially with that stable group below. Attack or threaten to use it to fight... See var.]
;B[hi];W[hj];B[ii];W[ij];B[jh]
(;W[gi]C[[Rich\] - this is overly cautious for white. Even if black cuts here, white can escape down below. Black's group is weak; either extend at L11 or double hane. See var.]
;B[ki];W[jj];B[lh];W[ih];B[ig];W[hh];B[jg]C[[Rich\] - this shape is a wonderful result for black. Good use of sacrifice stones.]
;W[ql];B[qk];W[ol]C[K- I was pleased with the sequence from here until I play O10]
;B[nd];W[pb]
(;B[qc]C[[Rich\] - The sequence is good, but here you're responding to white. You're attacking; the move you'd expect is at N16, so punish him fo not playing it! A few points in the corner here and there are a small price to pay for getting a move at N16 - see var]

;W[nb];B[me];W[ld];B[nj];W[rk];B[rj];W[pk];B[qj];W[mf];B[le]
;W[ke];B[lf];W[mh];B[mi];W[qo]C[K- not sure what is the best way to deal with this, but feeling that the game was close I chose a cautious response rather than risk a potentially difficult fight in the corner

[Rich\] - Keep your stones connected. It's a very basic move, but Q5 should be your first instinct in situations like this. Of course, time pressures or the threat of stronger players make us all nervous. :) See var.]

(;B[qp];W[po];B[ro];W[op];B[pr];W[rp];B[rq];W[rn]
(;B[hf]C[K- I wanted to get this point before he defended here

[Rich\] - T4 was bigger. You came back to defend the group after he played there, and he'd have to respond to your play there. See var.]
;W[so];B[qr]C[[Rich\] - white's effectively taken that stone and got an extra point for free.]
;W[hg];B[ie];W[gf];B[ge];W[hd];B[he];W[fe];B[gc];W[hc];B[gd]

[Rich\] - yes, the ponnuki at N6 was more valuable.];W[mn];B[nn]
;W[lj];B[mj];W[li];B[kh]C[[Rich\] - this is a small move. S18, H2, S8, L2, B2 are all bigger points.]
;W[rb];B[em];W[dn];B[hr];W[rl];B[in];W[gr];B[gq];W[hq];B[fr]
C[[Rich\] - extend at J2 first, the white stone will stay captured.]

;W[kr];B[oo];W[qm];B[mo];W[ln];B[mp]C[white resigns

P- estimate black ahead by about 18

[Rich\] - Interesting game, a good mix of territory and influence, fighting and position.

I think important points to remember are
1) don't worry too much about making small territory early in the game; getting good shape and keeping your opponent weak is more important.

2) If you have thickness and influence, you can play aggressively. Attack, invade, threaten to make huge moyos, bully. Don't try to turn it directly into territory; it costs a move and your opponent will be able to start reducing it. 

3) Don't underestimate ponnukis! They're strong, robust shapes. It's something you should be itching to play, almost all of the time.

Good luck!])
