C[yayoyi [1k\]: hi

Dear reviewer,

Thanks for helping me in this game. In this game, i thought a lot, but finally i don't see where i lost the game (i won because of a big white mistake).]

;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[SGF: Nothing really wrong with this move but given the formation of the B stones you might want to consider the joseki shown in the variation.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[ng]LB[kd:A][ph:B]C[SGF: This is very questionable.  It encourages B to secure the side and really does not add enought to the outside attack as compensation.  Playing A is normal.  After black plays at B white must pincer.  If he plays a narrow pincer the potential territory is small. If he plays a wide pincer then he can expect B to jump out and a fight ensues.]
;B[ph];W[qc]SQ[lc][ng]C[SGF:  This contradicts W's previous move.  It encourages B to cut it off, connecting to the marked stone, and so making the marked W stone ineffective.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[pa];W[qb];B[oc]LB[nb:A]SQ[lc]C[SGF:  'A' is better.  It provides a secure connection to the marked stone without leaving any weakness of immediate concern.]
;W[rf]LB[nb:A][oc:B]C[SGF:  W has gone badly wrong here.  The outside stones are weak (they would have been effectively useless had B played 'A' instead of 'B'.)]
;B[rg]LB[qf:A]C[SGF: This does not do a whole lot.  If B takes sente all it has succeeded in doing it strength W and still leave potential for W to encroach the side and it would be better left unplayed.  Joseki is to play A.]
;W[re];B[ic]LB[nb:A][fc:B]C[SGF:  This would be so much more effective if B were connected at A as previously mentioned.  In fact, B could extend all the way to B without worry.]
;W[qg]LB[pg:A]TR[rg]C[SGF:  This is exactly why the marked move was bad.  But it is probably too early for W to play this.  At this point B can easily play 'A' to attack the W group to the left, whereas if he made that group safe W has other options here.]
;B[pg];W[rh]C[SGF:  Bad gote exchange for W]
(;B[fq]C[SGF:  This is big, but not urgent.  The 3 W stones at the top are weak and need to be attacked before they have the chance to make shape.  Look at the variation.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[gq]C[Hmm, this cut is not very usual, i played a joseki i learned once, but is it favourable to me ? (i am black)]
;B[er]C[SGF:  Good shape.];W[eq];B[fr];W[dr];B[cq];W[dq];B[fo]
;W[ep];B[hq];W[go];B[hp];W[fn]C[SGF:  B played this sequence perfectly.]
;B[mi]LB[mf:A][gq:B]C[SGF:  This is the right spot but, as shown earlier, the sente move of A first is better.  However, B really should not have had a chance at this attack.  There were lots of ways for W to take sente in the lower left.  The cut at 'B', however, was not one of them.]
;W[kf]LB[ld:A]C[SGF:  This is a little dangerous.  'A'  would be better.]
;B[le];W[lf];B[me];W[mf];B[of];W[nf];B[if]C[SGF: Nice attack, but the result will be judged by the extent that it allows B to secure the bottom or invade the left while attacking.   With luck, both might happen.]
;W[kh];B[kj];W[ig]
(;B[pn]LB[hf:A]C[Here i played q6, i suppose it was a bit greedy. Shoud i have continued the attack ? How ?

SGF:  'A" is better.  Keep up the attack.  W is hardly likely to invade at this point as it would just give him two weak groups to be attacked.  And if W is not going to invade then it is too early for B to protect.  Also, because B is undercut on the top right it would be better to play this move on the third line.]
;W[pq];B[oq]C[SGF:  It is hard to know which side to play hane here. This move allows W to live easily and so B is essentially committed to make a large territory on the outside.    If B plays hane on the other side there is no guarantee what will happen, but there is a small chance that W will die because of all the outside thickness.  Personally I would play the other hane, but I cannot criticize this move.]
;W[or];B[op]LB[qq:A]C[SGF: Play A first.];W[qq];B[nr];W[ps]
;B[rp];W[rq]
(;B[ns]LB[qp:A]C[SGF:  Pointless.  W cannot play here anyway without creating damezumari for himself.  Just block at A.  If W ignores that he is dead.  See variation.]
;W[qp];B[ro];W[qo];B[qn];W[po];B[oo];W[on]C[SGF: No chance. W has to live.]
;B[mp];W[rj]
(;B[ql]C[SGF:  B can kill the corner.  It is a standard shape.  See the variation.  This move is very timid.  It protect nothing and gains little because W cannot get too far into the middle.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[qj];B[oj];W[jj]LB[ii:A]C[SGF:  This is a good move which is pivotal.  B"s moves to the right we not so big.  There would have been a big difference had B got to play at 'A' first.]
;B[jk];W[ik]
(;B[jl]LB[ji:A]C[SGF:  I cannot argue with this move, but it seems a little timid.  I would be inclined to play A with an eye on cutting off the group above.  I don't think W would have time to play K8 himself.]
;W[il];B[im];W[kk]LB[kl:A]C[SGF:  This is unreasonable.  All B has to do it respond at A]
;B[kl];W[hm];B[in];W[ki];B[lj]C[White's moyo is becoming big, could i avoid this result ?

SGF:  Well, don't forget, the W lower right corner is not alive so B also has a big territory - and a big territory is worth more than a big moyo.]
;W[hf];B[pr]LB[cf:A]C[White's big mistake.

SGF:  Maybe, but this is gote, so it is not the biggest point right now.  B needs to play A]
;W[ec]LB[be:A][ch:C][cj:D][cn:B]C[But here, i did not know how to invade : you will see i tried many things, but nothing really good happened.

SGF:  There are a number of potential invasion points.  Any of A through D can be expected to live.  Personally I would play B, in anticipation of it not disturbing the future invasion at A.]

(;B[cg]SQ[hf]C[SGF:  This is definitely wrong.  I is a compromise which achieves nothing.  It is not close enough to the top to threaten it but has no effect on the bottom.  Because the marked stone is on the board B cannot expect to escape and so much live independently.  This move has nowhere to run to.]

(;W[bf]C[I guess i missed this tesuji..

SGF:  Sure it is a tesuji, but it is not really necessary.  B is going to have trouble living anyway.]

Boris (this my last question)

SGF:  Two main points:

1.  The attack in the middle was not pursued.  It gave W a chance to counter attack and make a moyo.
2.  The invasion point on the left was the wrong place. It was also left too late.]

SGF:  This might be a little ambition. After W cuts at 'A', black is stuck for a good move.  B is hardly likely to secure all the moyo at the bottom so he should probably cut back a little on his aspirations there in order to prepare for an invasion on the left.  See the variation for an example.]
