C[Dear reviewer,
Thank you very much for your time. I seemed to get a lead in the opening but reversed it through a poor middlegame. It ended up being very close at the end.

I have questions sprinkled throughout this review, but I would be grateful for any other comments you may have.

Thanks!

(;B[oc]LB[pf:A]TR[cn]C[Maybe a pincer would be better? This move fits with my overly territorial style, but maybe something more aggressive would relate with my left side better

SGF:  I think that if you were planning on playing this in response to the expect W move then you should have made a keima shimari at the top left instead of approaching the lower left.  Given that you have played the marked stone I would follow up with a pincer in the lower left.  The upper right is not critical and the resolution of the lower left might help you decide how to play in the upper right.  If you must play in the upper right then A is also an option.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jd]C[SGF: I would prefer to play this low because of B's position in the upper left.]
;B[fq]LB[ci:A]C[Maybe the mini-chinese formation at A would be better?

SGF:  No.  I think this is correct.  The only issue is the timing - it would haved been better to play before settling to top right.]
;W[eo];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[dm]LB[go:A][hq:B]C[SGF:  This is rarely good.  It almost always leads to an overconcetrated position.  'A', followed by an extension down the left is better.  If B stops the extension W gets an excellent position at the bottom with 'B']
;B[ep];W[fp];B[eq];W[do];B[bp]TR[cn]C[Maybe this is aji keshi for the marked stone?
Would moving out with C7 be better at move 19?

SGF: Yes is it.  B does not need this to live so it is a yose move.  However, the few points gained in the corner, albeit in sente, loses the possibility of activating the marked stone later.  And if that stone lives then W does not have a base.]
;W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[ce]LB[cf:A]C[This seems obvious.

SGF:  I would also consider A but you need to play in this corner.]

(;W[ch]LB[cg:A][hp:B]C[SGF: This is too vague.  It does not threaten the corner but leaves no follow up.  A is better locally, but I would play B.  Black cannot gain by playing atari to the left of B]
;B[gp]LB[dk:A][hp:B]TR[dm]C[This seems like a bad kikashi.

SGF: No. It is essential. Without it W can threaten a central moyo and a lower territory.  If W connects it just emphasizes the fact that the marked stone should be at A.  Imagine the central moyo if B gets to play at 'B'.]
;W[fo]C[Now white is thicker, and the hane does not help too much.

SGF:  On the contrary, W is over concentrate and B as got up onto the 4th line with the distinct possibiltiy of territory on the lower side or reducing the W moyo above. This is definitely good for B is you consider that the cut is highly unlikely to ever work because of the solid W position.]
;B[qq]LB[hc:D][qn:B][kp:C][nq:A]SQ[gp]C[I know that this is not usually joseki, but I planned to keep sente and reduce whatever thickness White gets.

This is kind of unbalanced in the whole board situation, however-- all of my stones are postioned low and White has a lot of thickness.

A seems very attractive.

SGF:  This is defintiely wrong.  With the marked stone on the 4th line B should approach this stone at A and expect to make some territory along the bottom side.  Because of the B thickness in the upper right W must respond to 'A' by playing B, after which B can get a good position at the bottom.  B should also be aiming at playing 'D' pretty soon.]
;W[qp]LB[gq:A]C[SGF: Wrong direction.  W does not want to make thickness in front of the strong B position at the top.  W has at least a chance of aiming at the cut at A to make something along the bottom.]
;B[pq];W[oq]C[SGF:  WHat does W hope to achieve by this hane?  B is strong in the lower left so W should just extend.]
;B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[rp]TR[qf][gp]C[SGF: Very timid of W.  The 2 marked B stones completely nullify the thickness.]
;W[ro];B[rq];W[qn];B[qi]LB[hc:A]TR[qf][gp]C[SGF: Awful.  Never play close to thickness.  Neither player should be looking to play on the righ in the near future as there are two strong position facing one another.  This is actually a difficult position.  The main issue is how much W can use the overall thickness to get enough territory in the center to overhaul B's 4 corners. My assessment would be that, becasue of the influence of the two triangle stones, W cannot get enough and so B should play at A.  It could also be played high, in an extra effort to counter the W potential.]
;W[gc]C[Now I wish that I had played in this area earlier.

SGF:  Which is exactly where I said you should have played the previous move.  Now B's advantage is not as clear.]
;B[di]LB[fi:A]C[Maybe something lighter is needed?

SGF:  Yes.  W should never respond submissively to this because of all the thickness, so a better move would be to play at 'A' and effectively reduce all thickness in one go.]
;W[dh];B[ei]LB[eh:B][fi:A][ii:C]C[SGF:  Too heavy.  B must jump to 'A' and, if W plays 'B', B must jump again to C]
;W[ci]LB[gh:A]C[SGF:  Very cowardly.  'A' is the only move.]
;B[dk]LB[eh:A]C[SGF: I would play at 'A" to create some thickness. B has 4 corners so it is not as important to prevent territory.  Much better is to build strength to counter to W thickness.]
;W[cj];B[fl]LB[eh:C][hi:B][dk:A]C[SGF: A little on the heavy side.  Treat 'A' as kikashi and jump to 'B' or turn at 'C']
;W[gi]C[SGF:  Exactly the direction I thought B should have played.]
;B[fh]LB[eh:A]C[SGF: I prefer 'A"];W[gh]C[This exchange seems crude by Black. What would be a better sequence?

SGF:I had answered this in the previous comments.  This is just helping W get thickness.]
;B[fg]C[Heavy!

SGF:  But necessary.];W[de]C[SGF: Nice leaning move.];B[dd]
;W[ee]C[This effectively splits me, but makes my corner more solid too.

SGF:  B has been outplayed.  He has a weak group and has nowhere to run to.  W is thick everywhere.]
;B[gk]LB[ck:B][ik:A]C[Double threats at A and B.

SGF:  For whom?  B now needs to play 'B" so that he is simultaneously attacking the side and the lower group.]
;W[cf]LB[ck:A]C[SGF:  'A' is more urgent.  If B plays there the lower group may come under attack. B does not need to answer this move to live in the corner so it is not sente.]
;B[be];W[fi];B[ck];W[eh]C[This capture is bigger than I realized.]
;B[cm]TR[fg][fh]C[SGF: Nice for B.  If B can getting an attack going below then W's two gote moves to cut off the marked stone will have been a poor exchange.]
;W[go];B[hp];W[ho];B[ip]C[SGF: B needs to hane];W[io];B[ek]
LB[ik:B][jp:A]C[This is a terrible move. As White is already connected, these stones are only worth 4 points in gote!

Extending, taking territory, and keeping White disconnected seems much bigger.

Jumping to B looks big too.

SGF:  Yes, B is very good, but B can probably get away with a 2-pt jump]
;W[jp];B[jq]LB[jo:B][hr:A]C[SGF: This just invited a double hane.  Answering at A is the defensive move, but B could also consider cutting, although that could be tough if the reading ability is not there ot back it up.]
;W[kq]
(;B[kp]LB[ir:A]C[Cutting at the other side and fighting might be better?

SGF:  B has to go back to 'A' anyway so it is often better to play it directly and leave peeps for later.  In this position this cut seems to serve little purpose.]
;W[jo];B[ir]LB[jn:A]C[This gives up points but ended up being sente

SGF:  What purpose with the atari serve?  Now B does not have a kikashi at 'A']
;W[jr];B[iq];W[kr]LB[ik:A]C[SGF:  Microscopic.  W must play 'A']
;B[ik]C[This seems very urgent.

SGF:  Which is why W should have played there.];W[ih]LB[fd:A]
C[But this white move is very painful.

SGF:  Not too bad.  W does not have a good answer to A];B[ic]
LB[ng:A]C[Extremely deep, yes, but I hoped to gain something on the outside. This was supposed to be a probe...

SGF:  This bad move is a result of not counting the game.  B does not need this.  I more gentle reduction around A is called for.]
;W[jc];B[lb]C[but ended up being a deep invasion.

SGF:  Premature.  The center is bigger.];W[nb]
(;B[hb]C[Very bad.

SGF:  B needs to treat the previous moves as kikashi and exploit the aji they have created.  See the variation.]

(;B[ib]LB[ic:A]C[?! And I am being too greedy. The game-losing move.

I seemed to take a territorial lead in the opening, but lost my lead by my 3-3 invasion and the failed invasion on top. I almost regained it in the endgame.

Any last comments?

Thank you very much for doing this review!

SGF:  B played much better in the opening and early middle game and had a comfortable lead.  The invasion at the top was the turning point.  It was totally unnecessary.  B needs to learn to count the game so as to know when to play safely.  A gentle reduction, as indicated, would have resulted in an easy win.  I would recommend going over my counting lessons (info in SL) - they should help.
After the middle game there was a lot of bad yose played by both sides. It did not seem worth commenting on extensively because the game was not lost there.  If you want some comments on the yose look me up some time on KGS.]
