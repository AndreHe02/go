C[From here on up to move 22 both players take the border. It is like this: i don't really know where to play these moves, so i am playing anywhere. In this game i was quite satisfied, but i guess normally it can not be that easy...Could you tell me if there are some principles violated, which moves are really bad ? (If a move is 2nd. best, but ok in general, save your time and leave it uncommented.)

Reviewer: Openings (Fuseki) are certainly one of the hardest aspects of Go. I can give you some principles that should help you out though.

Generally the order to be followed is: -
a) Corners
b) Enclosures
c) Sides

Also worth mentioning is that: -
The 4th line is the line of influence
The 3rd line is the line of territory
The 2nd line is the line of safety

3rd/4th line plays are usually good in the opening.];B[dp]LB[cn:A]
[bp:E][cq:C][fq:D][dr:B]C[Reviewer: The 4-4 point in the corner is a good start. It is a 4th line play.

The idea is that it can take the corner with 2 more plays (A and B), or used to build up influence in the centre if you opponent invades (at or near C).

The corner could also be taken with D and E due to the symmetry of the position.]
;W[pq]LB[qo:A]C[Reviewer: A 3-3 play would take the corner with one play, but have little influence in the centre.   This is a 3-4 play and can take the corner with one more play (at A). It is a 4th line play - influence, and a 3rd line play territory.]
;B[pd]C[Reviewer: You should be aware that playing diagonally opposite corners will lead to a more complicated game,  though this might be your intention :-).]
;W[fq]LB[dd:A][cn:B][dn:C][hq:D]C[Reviewer: Either White is feeling very confident or a bit lost :-)

This is a standard approach move on a 4-4 point stone. 'B' and 'C' are usually the best local answers. But the biggest move on the board (in my opinion) is the final corner 'A' (white would normally play there first (instead of F3). NB: 4-4 or 3-4 or even 3-3 all of theswe are bigger than a local answer to f3.

The pincer at 'D' may mix things up even more.

Please see variations]
(;B[cn]C[Reviewer: You chose 'B'];W[dd]LB[fc:D][cf:C][po:A]
[qo:B][hq:E][iq:F][jq:G]C[Reviewer:  And W got the other corner anyway. You have the initiative though
so you need to attack.

I'd probably pick 'A' or 'B' in this situation (because I think I'll be OK with the 3-4 joseki). 'C' and 'D' are also possible.

E-G are possible pincers on F3. The location of C6 improves the effectiveness of this pincer

I'd recommend sticking to 'C' or 'D' , most proably 'D']
(;B[kp]LB[hq:C][iq:B][jq:A]C[Reviewer: I think I see what you're thinking here - you're stopping W from making this formation.

Probably better to pincer F3 with a move like A, B, or C];W[iq]
LB[jq:A]C[Reviewer: W made a good extension - L4 wasn't quite a pincer. Generally a pincer stops W from making a 2 space extension on the third line (usually considered to be settled).

'A' would be the widest possible pincer];B[np]C[Reviewer: 3 space extension on the 4th line isn't considered settled.]
;W[po]LB[qm:A]C[Reviwer: Nice enclosure by W A further play at 'A' is required to complete the enclosure. You can't attack from the left now, and your last 2 plays look wasted.

It is usually a good idea to prevent W from making an enclosure like this by playing Q5 or R5 directly.

Note how the strength of W's enclosure is facing towards your weak 4th line stones
it would be easy for W to scoop out your base and detach thes stones from the edge with a play like O2 or L2 (or even a point in between those two).

Usually W would want his enclosure to face empty space up the right hand side of the board, so that he can extend away from it and expand his territory]
;B[nn]C[Reviewer: You knew you were in trouble - I guess these stones will become a burden later on in the game.   See alternate position.]

(;W[qf]C[Reviewer: Nice play by W. Starting in another corner.]
;B[nc];W[qh]LB[fc:A][cf:B][qk:C]C[Reviewer: W should have moved back to R11 ( 2 space ext on 3rd line) or Q10.

'A' Through 'C' are all big moves];B[df]C[Reviewer: This is also a good move - attacks the upper left and extends from C6/D4.]
;W[fc];B[di]C[Reviewer: Possible - but C11 is more resilient to cuts - 3rd line / 4th line balance.
C14, D10 would have been nice too]
(;W[dl]LB[cl:A]C[Reviewer: This is a little tentative by W, 'A' would be more agressive.]
;B[jc]LB[ld:A][qd:B][rd:C]C[Reviewer: D8 weakened the d11 / c6 link and worked with F3 to surround d4, c6.   K17 was good - attacking F17, and expanding O17. W wouold have liked to play there. Ignoring W's threat and making territory is a good attitude *if* you are sure you can weather the coming storm (when W makes a second attacking move).

NB: The top still needs 'A' and ('B' or 'C') to be complete.]

(;W[hc]C[Reviewer: This is OK, but W should really take advantage of being able to play 2 stones against your bottom left area, perhaps d2 is bigger]
;B[dr]TR[an][bn][do][dq][ds]C[Reviewer: Nice - protects against 3-3 invasion, and threatens F3-J3. Good timing

Your bottom left enclosure is now complete. Imagine this as a solid connection as marked - for 15 points]
;W[cj]TR[bd][qm]SQ[ld][rd][ci][kr][nr]C[Reviewer: The threat was a good one - now e6 or f6 looks like it might shut you in the corner and make influence on the outside.

Looking at the first 22 moves I think you need to know the following: -

* 4th line is for influence (in the centre)
* 3rd line is for territory (at the edge)

* 3 space extensions on the 3rd line are good - considered settled
* pincers that prevent the extensions are also good - in fact if they also act as an   extension from another point then they are fantastic.

* Extensions that mix and match the 3rd and 4th line can be longer than on one line only.  So F3-K4 would have been possible.

* When you make an enclosure like Q3-R5 (if it happened), then it has a primary direction of influence (towards K3-K5 making a rectangular framework), and a secondary direction (towards R10-Q11 making a flatter framework).


Also lets take this opportunity to review the weaknesses remaining in the positions established

Squares are your weaknesses and triangles are your opponents. These are areas that can be aimed at with invasions. Notice how the weaknesses are where stones are on the 4th line, or where the gap on the side is too big.

You have more weaknesses than W at the moment - see alternative position]

(;B[ci];W[bj];B[bi];W[dn]
(;B[co]C[Reviewer: This is letting W push you around - reduced your 15 points to 14 points]
;W[cm]SQ[dl][cm][dn]C[Reviewer: This is nice shape for W];B[ce]
LB[cf:A]C[Reviewer: Good - but remember that b6 is a real threat

Also imagine if you'd played at 'A' instread of D14 then  you could have played this move at B16.]
;W[cd];B[be];W[bd];B[fo]C[Reviewer: Good intentions - keep white split into 2 groups and attack them both]

;B[el];W[hn];B[hm]C[Reviewer: This is an automatic atari and will only hurt you in the long run. H4 and 5 are as good as dead now. Also you have a weakness at F7 that will require patching up]

;W[ek];B[fm]
(;W[fk]C[Reviewer: Notice how W doesn't rush to play F8 - he realises his stone needs some strength. If he had played at F8 then you'd have to play at G7 and would be strengthened.  You want to play at G7 anyway don't you, so W playing at F8 would only help you]

(;W[nj]
(;B[pj];W[mn];B[lo];W[no]C[Some tips for attacking groups.

* If you make contact with a stone your opponent will strengthen it increasing its liberties
     This makes the group you are trying to kill harder to kill - strange but true
* If you can attack with out making contact then it is less likely your opponent's stones
will gain strength
     If they make contact with you, then you become stronger.

So ... while attacking don't make contact moves

When you're being chased - run away, don't turn around and try and hit your attacker
you might get caught out  by another group coming from the other direction

Don't assume that just because you've done enough to capture a group that the stones are dead.

Count liberties - always  make sure you have more than the group you are capturing.

Obviously if you've got 2 eyes then you don't need to count liberties any more (for that group).

If you are given a choice of losing 1 group or another group: -
   If one group is a cutting group (cutting a large eyeless group from a group with eyes). Save that one first.
   If both or neither are cutting groups, then save the biggest.

Big tip - the best way of making territory is by surrounding empty space on the board
not by surrounding your opponent's stones. Your opponent can bite back, empty space can't. After all the way to win the game is to make more territory than your opponent. The best way to do this is by securing territory whilst attacking.]
