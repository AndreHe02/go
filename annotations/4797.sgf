C[This game was a part of simul (10 boards). I've won, but I think I made many mistakes. Please, show me where and why. :)


Hello Flieg. I'll try.
Pierre (5k fr)];B[qd]C[Flieg [12k?\]: yeah :)
Flieg [12k?\]: good luck :)];W[dc];B[qp];W[dq]
(;B[pj]C[P: Strange. With the komoku we try habitually to enclose the corners (shimari) before take position on the edge.]
;W[od]
(;B[pb]C[P: I don't know this joseki. You'd better go to your stone at Q10. (var)
With this, you let white confine you in the corner.];W[qe];B[qg]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[qc];B[qb];W[pd]C[P: White is happy. The corner isn't alive, and white have a strong group facing the edge.]
;B[sc]C[P: and white heve sente.];W[np];B[pn]C[P: Okay.];W[jq]
;B[dj]C[P: Good, it's a big point now];W[cf]
(;B[cm]C[P/ it's not severe. You let white taking a shimari. You are late in territory now. (var)]
;W[co];B[ch];W[jc]
(;B[mb]C[P: You are crawling on the second line. not good at all. (var)]
;W[je]
(;B[jg]C[P: use less. there is no point on the center. you'd better reduce the White framework.]
;W[qq]
(;B[rp]C[P: Normally at S3 (var)];W[pq]
(;B[fg]C[P: not effective. if you want a moyo, better at O6 (var)]
;W[ee];B[hf];W[hd]
(;B[en]C[was creating that shape ok?

P: a shape is necessary when you want to live. here your group i already alive. Better to reduce, or invade (var)]
;W[fp]C[P/ White say thank you.  He strenghtened this position.]
;B[no];W[mp]C[P/ Again a thank you move. Your contact play strenghtened his position. Better to invade at M3 for example]
;B[lf];W[pl];B[ol]C[P/ Contact play help the invasion (var)]

;W[nm];B[ml];W[mm];B[ll];W[gn]C[P/ If I count, white wins by forty points. Black don't make any territory by playing in the center in comparision with the points made by white on the corner and on the edges.]
;B[fm];W[gm];B[gl];W[hl];B[gk];W[hk];B[hj];W[ik]C[P/ Bad shape for white.

On the nozoki (K8 - H10), you have to respond in keima. (var)]

(;B[jj]C[P/ Bad shape for black (see var 64)];W[ij]C[Must it happens?]
;B[hi];W[ii];B[ji];W[hh];B[ih];W[ig];B[if];W[jh];B[kh];W[gh]
;B[gi]C[P/ Bad shape (better at F10)];W[fi];B[gj];W[fj];B[fl]
;W[fh];B[eh]C[Houston, we have a problem ;)

Yes a big one.];W[ff];B[gg];W[eg];B[hg];W[ih];B[ei]C[P/ Now if white play K14 you lost everythings]

;B[ej]C[Flieg [12k?\]: sorry, I lost connection :(

Is his group (j12) dead now?



P/ J12 is dead. If white don't make this mistake, you lost the game.
I stop the review here.

You have to remember that the corner is gold, the edge is silver, and the center is a desert (no points, or finding oil is hard).]
