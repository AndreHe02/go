*** Start of the review ***

Hi, my name is Rainer and I did the review of this game.

Black played too aggressive in this game. You don't have to attack all the time to win a game and you should protect your groups when there is danger. Play urgent moves before attacking. Don't touch your enemies stones, it makes them strong. When playing defense stones, play them further away. That way you can assemble more strength to repel the attack.

I hope my comments help you in your future games.

Best regards

Rainer];B[pq];W[cp];B[pd];W[dd];B[eq]LB[qk:B][qo:A]C[Rainer: Consider making a corner enclosure yourself (A) or trying the chinese opening (B). The game has just begun, don't hurry things.]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[eo];B[fo];W[dq];B[fq];W[en];B[jp];W[ck]C[Rainer: Black and White are settled.]
;B[cf]LB[fc:A]C[Rainer: Wrong side, (A) would be better.];W[ch]
C[Rainer: Now Black has to run or jump into the corner.];B[ef]
;W[fd];B[cd]LB[de:A]C[Rainer: There is a weakness at (A)];W[bg]
C[Rainer: Not a good move...];B[dc]C[Rainer: ... now Black is in the corner...]
;W[ec];B[de]C[Rainer: ... and has protected the weakness.];W[ed]
;B[db];W[eb];B[bc];W[be]C[Rainer: Blacks connection can't be broken, so settling the white group at the top is more urgent.]
;B[bf];W[af];B[cg];W[bh];B[bd];W[dg];B[eg];W[eh];B[gg];W[nc]
;B[ic]LB[lc:A]C[I tried to attack from J17 with the potential of supporting Q16, but it failed.  How should I approach this without strngthening white?

Rainer: A black play at (A) is better. You squeeze the white stone and he would have to run out or jump into the corner to save it. The way it was actually played gave White the possibility to settle his stone and attack.]
;W[id];B[gc]C[would K16 have been better here?

Rainer: The mistake was Bj17. Now Black ought to try to pull back into the upper right corner.]
;W[gd];B[kc];W[jd];B[kd];W[jc];B[jb]C[big mistake.  should be at L18]
;W[ib];B[hc];W[kb]C[Rainer: Now White is settled and Black should try to protect the upper right corner.]
;B[lb];W[ja];B[he]C[Rainer: An unnecessary peek.];W[hd];B[me]
LB[lc:A][mc:B]C[Rainer: How about a play at (A) or (B)?];W[mb]
;B[lc];W[la];B[mc]C[Rainer: Black strengthens Whites position.]
;W[ob];B[oc]CR[qb][ne][qj][po]C[Rainer: Avoid contact plays when possible. There are bigger moves.]
;W[nd];B[ne]C[Rainer: Black pushes White against his own weak stones.]
;W[od];B[pc];W[oe];B[pe];W[of]TR[lb][kc][lc][mc][kd][me][ne]
C[Rainer: Now Black has produced a weak group and a weak corner.]
;B[pf];W[oh];B[ph];W[nf];B[kf];W[jf];B[jg];W[if];B[ig];W[hf]
;B[lg];W[hg];B[hh];W[gh];B[fg]LB[fh:A]C[Rainer: Why not a play at (A) instead?]
;W[fh];B[pb];W[oa];B[oi];W[nh];B[ni];W[pa];B[qb];W[qa];B[rb]
;W[ra];B[mh];W[mi];B[li];W[mj];B[lj];W[pi]C[Should I sack the P11 stones here and defend the right corener?

Rainer: You can save the P11 stones and the corner.];B[oj]LB[nk:A]
C[Rainer: Bad shape, better at (A)];W[pg]
(;B[qh]LB[qg:A]C[Rainer: Bad move. Now the way into the corner is open. Better play at (A).]
;W[qg];B[qi]SQ[pi]C[Rainer: The marked stone is not as important as your corner group!]
;W[re];B[qf];W[rg];B[rf];W[sf];B[rd]C[Rainer: The corner is dead. Moves here are wasted.]
;W[qe];B[sd];W[se];B[qd];W[sg];B[rh];W[og];B[mk];W[sh];B[rj]
;W[si];B[sj];W[ke];B[le];W[je];B[qm]C[I lose the corner, but I get a huge moyo on the bottom right.

Rainer: But you still have to convert that moyo into territory.]
;W[mg]TR[lb][kc][lc][mc][kd]C[Rainer: Very clever play by White as this initiates the snap back on the marked black stones.]
;B[lh];W[lf];B[mf];W[md]C[again, my weak attack on the top costs me more points]
;B[hi];W[gm]C[Rainer: Here White starts to reduce Blacks moyo from the outside.]
;B[fn]C[Looking back this seems to be a bad move.  H6 would have been better?]
;W[fm];B[em];W[dm];B[el];W[gk]C[do those stones give me any aji?  or are they just waisted moves?

Rainer: There is aji in those two stones, but not very much.]
;B[hl]CR[jm][mq]C[I get greedy overplay.  where would be a better play?

Rainer: Black plays too close to the white stones. The moyo is still wide open for invasion. The marked plays would be better.]
;W[fk];B[hk];W[hn];B[ho]C[Rainer: Again much too close.];W[in]
;B[io];W[gj];B[hm];W[gn];B[jn];W[hj];B[ij];W[im];B[il]LB[jl:A]
C[Rainer: Better at (A)];W[jm];B[kn];W[jk];B[ik]C[Rainer: Not a good move.]

C[Rainer: Why not taking the marked stone?
