C[Hi there !

I
would like to have this game reviewed, to have an idea of what could improve
and what not. The result is close ( white wins with 5.5 points ), and we
both made some mistakes ( otherwise we would be high ranked professionals
). I hope it is a game me and other people can learn from, so I look forward
to your remarks...

Thanks in advance,

Florreke];B[pd]C[Hi Florreke,

I'm Darrell.  I review with the move numbers turned on so I can refer to stones by their move number.]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[cn];W[cl];B[en]C[Florreke:
e6. Well there are a lot of possibilities here, but with the black stone
on d16 I choose not to run into the lower left corner, to try to squeeze
the c8 stone later.

D:  This is fine.  Gets a fight going.];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[cj]
C[Florreke: Here is the pincer.
Maybe a bit too close and too early in the game, I don't know. Maybe black
c11 had led to an easier game for black.

D:  Perhaps, but either one seems completely reasonable.  I personally would have played C11.]
;W[el];B[gn];W[hp];B[dm]C[Florreke:
I think d8 was not really necessary (yet), but I don't have experience with
this sort of games where groups run out

D:  I agree.  You are making white strengthen his weak group without helping your group.  In effect, you are hurting 11.]
;W[dl];B[ej]C[Good.];W[gl];B[hm]C[Good];W[hk];B[gi];W[df]C[Florreke: Well white has a good move here, I think.]
;B[fd];W[ff];B[ii];W[jk];B[jm];W[hf];B[hd];W[jd]C[Bad move for white.  Black can split 28 and 30 and white has lots of trouble.]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[jg]LB[ie:a]C[Rather than 33, I would have split white's two weak groups with a move at 'a'.  This also, very importantly, keeps your black group from being surrounded.  This is the biggest lesson to learn from this game.

*Don't let your groups get surrounded*];W[ie]C[Now white's group is connected, free from threat of being surrounded, and has surrounded your top left.  This was a very big move.]
;B[op]C[Florreke:
Black p4 is not the move I would replay if I could restart the game from zero. The idea was to form a link between p4 and the k7 stones, but sometimes
groups don't come together so easily. Anyway, p4 leads to another weak black group, for which I will have to look for till the end of the game.   Maybe
k4 was a better idea, just reinforce the k7 stones.... .  Or n12 to strengthen the k13 group...

D:  This move is fine.  If you ended up with another weak group to defend, it is not really the fault of this move.]
;W[mp]C[Florreke: of course];B[kp];W[in];B[im];W[jn];B[kn];W[km]
;B[kl]LB[jo:a]C[Force at 'a' before moving at 43.  This strenthens 41 and 37.  White can't ignore or you capture 38 and 40.

*Look for opportunities to make helpful forcing moves before making an obvious defending move.*]
;W[lm];B[kk];W[jj];B[li];W[ji];B[ih];W[jh];B[ig]LB[if:a][he:b]
C[Defend the cut at 'a' and you threaten to cut.  White must defend 'b' and you get an extra move, which would be helpful just now.   *Look for moves that defend and also attack.*]
;W[lh];B[kf];W[kh];B[jl]C[Florreke:
The balance turned in favour of white. White's groups are safer than black's
groups, and black still has that p4 stone to look after ....]
;W[mn];B[mq];W[nq];B[np];W[lq]
(;B[mr]LB[mo:a]C[At this point, a play at 'a' seems much better.  See var. 2.]
;W[lp]C[This is a good move for white.];B[on]LB[ko:a][nr:b]
C[Florreke:
I saw no other possibility than p6 to strengthen the p4 group. I'm not too happy with the fact that white gets to built his corner group around r4 pretty easily.

D:  Yes, this is ugly.  At white's leisure, he can move at 'a' to connect his center, or at 'b' to capture 57, 61 and own the bottom.  Your group threatens nothing and captures no territory, but instead is just running for its life.]
;W[mk];B[lj]LB[jo:a][ko:b]
(;W[lr]C[Wrong side for white.  White should have captured these two stones.  See variation 2.]

;B[om];W[qg];B[qd];W[cc]C[Florreke:
nice move from white. Not only white takes the corner, but threatens also the f16 stones...

Yes, this is the penalty you pay for letting white move at 34.  Now you must fight to live.  Letting a group get surrounded is something that will haunt you sooner or later in a game.]

I made a reading error here. Due the cutting points in the black group  (m14 and l15 ), n13 is no ko threat, but I didn't realize at that moment.

D:  It happens.];W[aq];B[lg];W[ng];B[of];W[nf]C[Florreke:
the white group has only one eye now, and has two possibilities to make a
second one. I didn't notice the m14 point.];B[sk];W[rj];B[rl]

I should have connected long time ago. This leaves a ko fight, which is,
of course, very interesting for white. But white makes a mistake and  lets
me live .];B[fm];W[em];B[fo];W[if]C[Florreke: not too happy here]
;B[jf];W[kd];B[ke];W[hi]C[Florreke: white's mistake. White  looses sente here, so that I can end the ko fight.]
;B[fn];W[as];B[ka];W[aq];B[id]C[Florreke:
mistake from white. The game is pretty much over from here on. The rest is
endgame play.
   Although I could catch up something ( I was far behind )
I loose the game.
   Reviewer, I hope you found it an interesting game, bye.]

[kq:c]C[White gets a big corner, but black becomes very strong in the middle, which will create a real problem for white's big middle group.  Plus black still has aji (potential) in the bottom unless white plays another move there.  For example, 'a' followed by 'b' or 'c' followed by a variety of reducing moves.  White's lower left side could actually come under a very severe attack.]
