GC[After gaining the upper hand on the right
side black fails to strike home in the upper
left, letting white narrow the game, but then
white fails to take advantage of some oportunities
during the yose.]

;B[pd];W[qo];B[dd];W[cp];B[pq];W[qf];B[nc]C[Q10 instead of O17 would show a more positive approach.]
;W[op]C[Good.];B[oq];W[np];B[nq];W[mp];B[lq]C[Too mild, black should either jump before or, probably better, play now to
reduce white's ramework at Q10 or Q13.];W[pj];B[ok];W[oj]C[N9 can also be considered.]
;B[mk];W[nk]C[I would prefer P8, Q9 or R8, O9 helps black making shape.]
;B[nl];W[nj];B[om];W[lp];B[kq];W[cf]C[- should i have continued in lower right? how?

I do think so. Black's shape is quite resilient and Q5
is now a very weak point. May be with a peep at Q8  followed bye R7.]
;B[fd];W[dj];B[pk];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[qm];W[rk];B[re]C[Pretty big, but just a yose move, I think S7 is more
important, black could then move towrs white moyo
on the left while attacking the dragon at M4.];W[eq]C[Ditto.
Anyway, because of the presence of L3 stones de lower side
is not very urgent, I think that white can expect to build up
the left moyo if black insist on taking 10 points of territory
around H2.];B[qi];W[qj];B[qg];W[ml]C[Again connecting at S7 feels better, and safer.]
;B[mm];W[ll];B[lm];W[kl];B[km];W[nn];B[nm];W[kp];B[rf]C[Bad.
Black should keep the pressure.];W[jq]C[Instead of K3 I would play M10 (or K8). That would settle the group,
gain strength for a future invasion in the upper side and K3
and S7 could be regarded as miai.
Of course K3 and the nice double hane are very big, but K8 is
too good a point to let black have it in sente.];B[jr];W[mq]
;B[mr];W[ir];B[kr];W[iq];B[jl];W[lj];B[jk];W[mj];B[jn];W[hc]
;B[dk]C[Strange. Black can aim at reduce the moyo without
reinforcing the 2 white  upper stones as this contact play
would do. Reinforcing them would have an effect on the
upper corner, thus on H17 and then on the upper right.];W[cj]
C[I prefer E9 or E10.];B[ej];W[bl]C[there are probably interesting alternatives?

Yes!
Letting black play at E11 is no good! This helps the upper
corner, thus creating problems for H17, I think E11 is a
must. Here is not important if black becomes strong,because
of the K8-9 stones it would be redundant and the lower
corner is already secure, so this strength would be useless.]
;B[ei];W[bd]C[Maybe D13 is better. If the side stones are safe, then
entering at C17 remains as an option.];B[cc];W[ef]C[this move or next one seems to be very dubios, so what should I have played instead? D12?

D12 does look better, but the problems do arise because of all
the low moves at C10, B8 and B16.];B[dg];W[cg];B[df];W[dh];B[ce]
;W[be]C[What about playing E13 instead of B15 ?
(And connecting at E12 if black D15)
If black cuts at B15, white has peeping at J7
 then cuting at E9 as follow up, and a pincer  against H17 would'n be very severe.]
;B[eh];W[eg];B[de];W[ch];B[gc]C[Instead of G17 a pincer attack looks more severe.  At K16 maybe.]
;W[gb];B[fb]C[Instead of F18 I would play H16. I think black loses
a good oportunity to wind up the game in this area,
letting it become close.];W[gd];B[fc];W[lc]C[Dangerouse. Black is strong at both sides, L17 would be
safer. Or J15, trying to link to M18 while keeping an eye
on E13-14.];B[hd];W[ic]C[Good, black helps white settle the group, but ...]
;B[ge]C[... very good move, calm and steady.];W[dl]C[Big, but not as big as it seems,
first a peep a J7 would look good, but if black
swalloes the 2 stones at E14 in a big scale ...
Something around K12 or K13 seems more
urgent, or cutting at E9 after the peep.];B[el];W[dm];B[kh]
C[Too hasty maybe. Playing first K15 is almost
sente, then L12 or even K12 looks good for black.
Instead of K15 L16 would also be severe.];W[je];B[if];W[io]
C[Small, this connection and S7 are miai.];B[in];W[em];B[fl]
;W[ho];B[is];W[hs];B[js];W[hr];B[rm]C[Small, black should applie pressure on the upper white group,
M15 or N15, and get points around P14.
B17, S4 or G6 are also bigger than S7.];W[ri];B[mb];W[jf]C[K14 helps black, removing the possibilities of
playing K13 or K12, O16 instead or M15 look
better.];B[jg];W[lf];B[bc];W[rq];B[qr];W[ie];B[hf];W[gm];B[fm]
;W[fn];B[gl];W[hm];B[hl];W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[ba];W[lb];B[rr]
;W[nd];B[od];W[mc];B[ob]C[Mistake.];W[ma];B[nb];W[ki]C[Better at K10, white can afford to sacifice the 3 stones
after S11 gives eyes  in echange for reducing the center.
( if black answers K10 with L9, white K11 makes miai
of M9 and destroying all black center thanks to the weaknes
on J13.];B[ji];W[lh];B[lg];W[mg];B[kg];W[jj];B[ij];W[kj];B[ii]
C[J11 is not yet necessary, H18 or P13 look big.];W[im];B[hn]

;B[of];W[qh];B[ia];W[jb];B[rp];W[ro];B[qp]C[Should be T3.];W[pp]
C[No need, Q13 or Q8 are better.];B[ck];W[bk];B[rh];W[ph];B[pg]
;W[sp];B[qq];W[sh]C[Q8 is worth 6 points, most of the last 10 moves are less than
4 points in value.];B[rg];W[oh];B[sq];W[so]C[Last chance of playing Q8, even if black connects at P8 then captures at
T5 is only a ko to save the 3 cuted stones (by white Q8-Q7.
White has big ko threats at E9 (follows F9) Q18 (follows P19)
B18 (another big ko) M1 (with more threats begining with
O2 after black connects).  Even if white loses the ko it's compensate by taking away the
2 points at Q8-P8, so white loses nothing.];B[pm];W[ja]C[Small, P6 is bigger.]
