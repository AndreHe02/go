C[Gabriel Lui: Hi, dear reviewer, thank in advance for your comment. I am black, 2k, I feel I play the game quite well but how can I widen the wining score as now I won only 3.5 points.

Actually, you were losing until white made a mistake near the end.

The most important thing to do to know whether you are ahead or behind is to try to count the score. There are two benefits to this:

1. The obvious one, if you know whether you are ahead or behind, it is much easier to plan your strategy. 

2. The less obvious advantage is that as you try to estimate the score, you have to think about where the boundaries between the black and white areas are likely to end up. If you do this, you will find that in some areas, the boundaries are relatively settled, and playing the next move there does not change anything. However, in other areas, who plays the next move makes a big difference, so that is where you want to play. So, trying to count the score helps you to find the big engame moves, and so helps you to change the score in your favour.

It does not matter if you are not very accurate at estimating the score at first. Some approximate knowledge is better than no knowledge, and as you practice you will get better at it. If you count the score during the game, compare your guess with the final score, and see how accurate you were. Being able to estimate the score more accurately and from earlier in the game gets more and more important the higher up the dan grades you move. You need to start developing these skills now.

You don't have to estimate the score every single move. Just do it occasionally, for example, when a local sequence has just finished, and now you have to decide which part of the board to play in next.

A good aim is to be able to count all the territory of one colour in one minute. That means that you may be able to count while your opponent is thinking about there move.

And if you ever observe other player's games, that is a very good time to pracice counting, becuase you are not distracted by having to choose where to play next.


The other comment I would make realtes to earlier in the game. You do not seem to undertand the difference between playing in an area where you are strong, and an area where your opponent is strong. In particular, in this game, you make two very dangerous moves in your opponent's area. I am referring to the three-space extension on the bottom edge (move 27) and the deep invasion on the right (move 33). Where your opponent is strong, you have to be a bit respectful, or you will get into trouble. In this game, your opponent let you get away with it, but you probably won't be so lucky in future. 


I hope this review is helpful to you.];B[dd];W[pp];B[qd];W[cp]

Another possibility is to approach the bottom corner around F3]

C[Gabriel Lui: Should black continue on L13 or play as the game was at R6.

L13 is not right locally. See the variaton for the normal continuation. However, playing elsewhere is probably right here.]

(;B[qn]C[This is a good move. You could also consider playing around F3.]
;W[pn];B[pm]C[Good.];W[qo];B[on];W[po];B[om]C[Gabriel Lui: I chose P7 instead on R7 to maintain the center influence. Am I right?

This move is fine. It is simple and you finish in sente and there is a big move to play at the bottom.]

(;B[hq]C[I think it is better to approach the corner.];W[fq]
C[White is happy to make a corner enclosure.]
(;B[lq]C[This is dangerous. White is strong here, so you should be cautious and make a 2-space extension.]

(;W[nq]C[Gabriel Lui: White O3 is a bit out of my expectation, I thought it should be at N3 then black M4 to temporary settle there

White should really invade at K3.

For white to play N3 is really bad.];B[ho]C[This is good. You can also consider K4, which makes a strong group that you don't have to worry about.

This move leaves your group a little weaker, but helps limit the white area to the right.

Both are good.];W[fo]
(;B[cm]C[This is a very deep invasion in a place where white is strong. I think it is too deep.]

(;W[ck];B[co];W[dp];B[bp];W[bq];B[do]C[This is very slow and heavy.]

(;W[eo];B[em];W[gm];B[bl]
(;W[bk];B[bn];W[ap];B[bo]C[Gabriel Lui: Is black success in the invasion without giving white too much outside benefit?

Yes, you were lucky. White played a couple of slow moves and let you live too easily.]

C[This is an endgame move. Why is white playing it?];B[ql];W[rn]
;B[rm]TR[bd][nf][eg]C[Gabriel Lui: Latter I founf S8 is better than S7, is it right?

S8 does make a stronger black shape, and as the white corner is solid, there is no advantage to S7.

However, both of these are endgame moves. Admittedly quite big endgame moves, but there are better places to play on the whole board. I have marked a few possibilities.]

;W[fk]C[Before playing your next move, it would be a good time to pause and try to estimate the score. That would help you to understand what is happening.

Black:

Top: 15-
Left: 5-
Bottom: 5+
Right: 20+

Total: 45


White:

Bottom left: 15
Bottom right: 20
Top right: 5
Top left: 5
Komi: 5

Total 50

So you are a bit behind, but you have the next move and there are good places to play, so that is OK.]
