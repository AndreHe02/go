C[Review by John Rae IGS 4k* for Joel Dehlin ( black)];B[pc]
;W[dp];B[op]C[[joel\] oops. i clicked the wrong spot on that one. i meant q4. :)]
;W[dc]
(;B[de]C[[joel\] i intended to build up influence toward the right but i don't know any josekis that build influence to the right

[JR\]

Are we talking about joseki which force a result with black having influence across the top or joseki which may have that outcome if White chooses?

Off the top of my head I can't think of an approach which will  force influence to the right. There are joseki which will give that result if white plays the way you want. I show some examples on the next move

A more fundamental question - why do you want influence across the top at this point? If you really want the top you could simply play at k17 or approach at f17 or G17.

The standard order for a fuseki would be appraoch corners than play the star points on the sides. so black's options are D15, as you played, C15, R4 or Q15

Since P4 was a mouse slip R4 would repair anything you perceived as damage. Q11 or Q10 is a good follow up for black so often white will play there first (probabably on the third rank). black then gets to expend from the bottom corner and attack this white stone at the same time. (Or possibly extend from the top but only if white comes too far down the side, r9 , r8 etc.)

Your move is fine, although perhaps not for the right reasons :)]

(;W[pe];B[oe]C[[JR\] This joseki intends to give black the top. however white can always extend from the D17 stone with G17, so it does not feel good to have a high wall facing across the top at the moment.

I would have played R15, O16 or a pincer at Q12];W[ce];B[cf]
;W[cd];B[dg];W[fd]C[[JR\] Now P15 looks like a mistake, white can nullify anything black was hoping for on the top.]
;B[ck];W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[[joel\] would p16 and then somewhere on k have been better?

[JR\] OK white does not seem to me to have played joseki. (NB Don't assume I know every joseki - I'm nowhere near strong enough for that. You might want to check up a joseki dictionary, online Kogo's joseki dictionary is pretty good.) 

So what does black want to achive now?

P16 is too defensive, white can simply play to live in the corner and black will have to play to defend his group, so white will get sente again.

Q16 moves into the avalanche type joseki except black is a move in front. That ought to turn out well

Your R16 move is emphasising the corner territory, it looks like that is your main objective and that you are no longer thinking about the top?]
;W[pd];B[rc];W[qb];B[pb];W[qe]
(;B[od]C[[JR\] But now you seem to change your mind and want a wall facing along the top, happily giving up all that corner territory.

You could have got this wall without sacrifing those stones, and white would not be so strong.

This was not a good change of strategy. Far better to stick with the idea of taking the corner.

Some of your later problems come from this mistake];W[rd];B[jc]
C[[joel\] i know i have a weakness here but i took a chance with k knowing that if i didn't the group would be in more trouble. it turns out this was a bad move, i think.

[JR\] White is thick to the left so it is not a good idea to approach too close L17 would be far enough at most. I would even consider the very safe O17 first]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[md];B[lb]C[[joel\] i should have gone to the top first since m18 isn't that great a move for white, given p17 and q18, right?

[JR\] White is not interested in playing around M18 white has made a quick hit at the weak point in your shape and intendes to run away to safety as quickly as possible.

Equally white has cut off the K17 stone. It does not want to live small on the top so it wants to run into the centre as quickly as possible]
;W[nb];B[mf];W[kd]
(;B[ie]C[[joel\] is j15 too close? maybe g17 instead or h16?

[JR\] The question is are you attacking the white group or are you running for safety? distant moves like this are generally for attacking, contact plays like white's for defending.

A knights move jump like this can be cut. If white can cut safely then black is in trouble on the top. If you are running something with better connecting strength is more advisable

White L16 was intended to push you to the left leaving room for a jump towards the centre. white is planning M14 next

If you are attacking the variation looks better];W[lf];B[me]
;W[le]C[[JR\] I suspect you played the exchange of the last 2 moves to strengthen your connection and escape for the Q18 group.

The triuble is they also strengthen white's connection to the escape route outside. White is not in immediate danger any more.

I think you would have been better not exchanging N15 for M15. you would like to have the option of threatening to play M15 yourself sometime in the future.]
;B[og]C[[JR\] This shows the problem. you need to take a move to make this group safe. 

This gives white the time to turn to attack the top];W[id]
(;B[hb]C[[JR\]  If you're aiming to live on the top J17 would be better.]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[jd];B[lc];W[kc];B[ld];W[ob];B[oa]C[[joel\] i'm giving up the group on the left to catch the W group at o18. was that a bad move?

[JR\] you effectively decided that when you played M3

Making the black stones alive on the top would have been worth a bit more]
;W[kb];B[nd];W[mc];B[na];W[pg];B[of]SQ[cn][fq][qk]C[[joel\] i wanted to protect black group but i realize this is unnnecessary. maybe i should have gone r9 or f4? or c6?

[JR\] Yes any of the other moves would have been much better.

C6 would be my favourite since it extends and stops a white approach from C7. If white gets C7 the black shape can be vulnerable to an invasion at C12. Therefore C6 exands, protects and approaches a corner.

R4 would be another point to consider];W[ph];B[qj]C[[joel\] too close? maybe r9 instead?

[JR\] Yes too close. No r9 would not be much better. both invite white to invade behind

You can't expect to stop white getting anything. Think of the game as a set of exchanges, white may get a big territory on the right side, can you play elsewhere and get something worth just as much, or even a little more?

Again what about R4. after this R9/10 look good so white probably has to extend down the side. OK white gets the side, black extends across the bottom. K3 or even all the way to F3]

(;B[pk];W[pi];B[qk];W[pl];B[ok];W[qg];B[qp];W[rl]
(;B[rn]C[[JR\]  This move is thinking far too small

OK it stops white making a base down the sdie. But white has plenty of room to run so it is not a huge threat. It makes only a couple of points of territory.

Therefore it is not doing much

I do not see an immediate attack so I would look elsewhere. Try to develop in an other area of the board while at the same time gradually building a position where a direct attack works for you. Leave white to worry about these stones.]
;W[nh];B[mj];W[ml]
(;B[lh]C[[JR\] S6 was supposed to be attacking white and already you are playing a purely defensive move to connect to your group at the top. 

You cannot afford to give your opponent time to play as he likes.]

[JR\] They can live at the side so there is no benefit in catching them. Take the left corner instead]

C[[JR\] Again take the corner.

If you are not sure that your group in the bottom right is alive play to make it alive. If you are unsure if the connection to the M11 group is solid making it alive fix the connection.

This is a reunning away move. White is alive below so at best you are attacking 2 stones at N8.

;W[ld];B[ie]C[[JR\] Now it looks a really good attacking move, white cannot jump to safety very easily]
;W[je];B[jd];W[ke];B[jg]C[[JR\]

a thing about attacking - dont worry too much if white eventually manages to escape - so long as you have been able to build up strong positions during the attack you still benefit. The kill is not necessary.

For example here white might still escape. But a few moves ago white was running free in-between two black groups which looked faily unsafe yes?

Now the black stones at the top look OK, they ought to be able to get out into the middle and/or connect to the group on the left. 

The Q18 group is also much stronger. It has more liberties. It is looking to play around Q13 to push white down on the side and develop influence towards the centre. 

This works well with the P4 stone. it is waiting for white to invade at R4 or R5 and develop more outside influence when that happens. 

Black can look towards a large centre moyo while white is running for his life with no safe haven in sight anywhere. Let him run and build up a strong position !]

(;W[pj]C[[JR\] Equally white might extend from his wall to develop on the side]
