;B[pd]C[Hi this is the first time I submit a game.
I have only one question, it is about
my invasion into whites moyo.
was I right to do it ?
Thank you

I'll try to answer that, though I'm not 'that' knowlegeable about invasion theory.

I'll also spread some comments around when I think they might be of any use.]

1) you don't create a base for your M16 stone (like, say, triangle stone)

This is 14 points : only !

14 points is something you can catch up.

But if you compare, B has more "certain" territory than W., and even if shape is bad (triangles), it can coombine nicely with a severe reducing move at E11.

Game is seriously impaired, but not lost.
