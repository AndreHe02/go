C[hi, i played black in this game. it went terribly for me... maybe you can see some of the things i should work on?
thank you so much!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[jd]LB[de:B][pk:A]
C[looking back on the game, this is a silly move, with 2 4-3 stones on the board..
should be at A i think

Tanguy Urvoy : Yes I prefer "connecting" my stones around A. K16 seems not that urgent.
around B is also possible.];W[qo];B[qm];W[oo];B[np];W[op]C[this is an unusual response from white, i thought for a while, but i couldn't figure out how to reply.
my response at p3 felt docile];B[oq]LB[pl:A][lq:B]C[TU good news for you : p4;p3 is a VERY bad exchange for white.
A or B seems better.];W[no];B[mp]C[TU o5;n4 is also a nice present for christmass : black is happy to gain solid territory]
;W[qk]C[TU Q10 or Q11 seems less easy to split];B[om];W[rm]
LB[qm:A][rm:B]C[TU :  now white realize that he must connect : it is better to ignore this move and play somewhere else.]

(;B[rn]TR[qk][no][oo][qo]C[TU : it is a mistake to thing that a cut is possible here : the folowing sequence is a "mid game joseki"
you should remember];W[qn]C[this is troublesome, but copable]
;B[rl];W[pm];B[ql];W[pl]
(;B[rk]LB[pk:A][rk:B]C[TU: A is dangerous but may be more interesting than B]
;W[qj];B[ro]TR[rm]C[TU :  It is better to capture immediately]
;W[qp]LB[ro:A][qp:B]C[TU : A;B exchange forces white to destroy black corner territory : it is a christmas present :)]
;B[qq];W[rp];B[sm]LB[no:C][mp:D][op:A][oq:B]C[white ends up very connected, and my stones are not working together

TU : indeed, and the corner is open to future invasions.
But the game is still ok for black because of A;B and C;D exchange]
;W[fq];B[ce]
(;W[cd]LB[ci:A]TR[dp][fq]C[TU: wrong direction, A is both pincer and extension from delta stones.]
;B[de];W[fc];B[bd]C[TU: this is yose move : keep it for later !]
;W[bc];B[dd];W[cc]LB[bc:B][cc:D][bd:A][dd:C][ci:E]C[TU: the A;B;C;D sequence is "ajiikeshi" it remove any chance for black to attack
white corner. Beter play directly around E to make a base.]
;B[be]LB[be:A][di:B]C[i was thinking all wrong here should have just gone straight to C10, or something like that

TU: YES ! A is endgame move
around B is more urgent];W[ck];B[ci];W[co]LB[fc:D][mc:F][jd:E]
[ej:H][qj:I][ck:G][rk:J][pl:A][dp:C][mp:B][rp:K][rq:L]C[TU: it is time to evaluate the situation (please do it yourself before reading this)


1) The A group is quite thick but its influence is poorly used because of B iron pillar which radiates over the whole center. 

2) The 3 stones around C count 15 point of solid territory

3) There is approximatively 5 points under B stones and 5 points under D stones.

4) The low D stone is erasing any potential territory in the top border. But It can be capped around G16.

5) E is not well situated, it would rather be arount F

6) the G extension is well placed for an attack around H and a moyo with C stones.

7) I and J deny any potential in the right top part of the board.

8) K destroys black's corner territory.
A move at L would be gote and small : black will never find the time to play such move.


Conclusion :
=> It is urgent to prevent a move around H
=> white is ahead now];B[dk];W[cj];B[dj];W[dl];B[cl]LB[ce:A]
C[this didn't work

TU: at last is helped A stones to become strong];W[bl];B[cm]
;W[dm];B[bi];W[bm];B[pk]C[now i'm looking at the board and feeling desperate, attacking these stones doesn't get me much of anything

TU: good idea !];W[pj];B[ok];W[ol];B[oj];W[qf];B[nl];W[pn]LB[qh:B]
[oi:A][mn:C]C[TU: looks like there is something starting with A]

(;B[nm];W[mn];B[pi];W[nk]
(;B[oi];W[mk];B[lm]C[this is dumb i think...
my stones are a heavy liability, i hoped white's 2 weak groups would be hurt from this split, but it just made them both strong]
;W[ll];B[mm];W[ln];B[km]LB[ll:B][km:A][ln:C]C[TU: A, B and C is atypical "tear" shape : B and C are brutaly split in two by A iron pilar.
this is locally good for black.];W[ko];B[kj]LB[kj:B][jl:A]C[these white stones i surround are not important, but i need to play like this to finish what i started.

better probably if i had sacrificed O7 and played Q14 or something

TU: I do not agree you have to do someting with O7, maybe a hi scale move like
A woul be better than B but nothing sure.];W[rd]LB[gd:D][qe:A]
[re:B][pf:C]TR[kc][pc][ee][fe][he][pe][pg][ph][fj][gj][hj][ij]
[jj]C[this hurts

TU: not so much. look at the center.
Imagine the sequence A,B,C,D and look at the center.]

[oe]C[TU: now it is a violent fight, hard to control (hard to comment).
the delta shape is bad for black, the fight should be ok for white.]
