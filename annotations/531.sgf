C[Dear commentator,
This game was played in a turnament, i am 5kyu in germany (gomasch 8k* on igs) and played white.
In general i felt this was an interesting game, i knew my opponent is a plays a solid
style and i tried an unusual approach to make the game different and not so easy, so that the probably better joseki knowledge of my opponent should not become decicive.
On the upper side both players did not make best moves, but black was much more solid (again).
During fuseki i tried to play for influence, but didn't really get it, i feel i am missing some very basic principle here and i hope you can put me on the right track.
In the middle game, after i invaded the lower side and established the right and left side i thought i was quite ahead during the game and was suprised at the end that i lost so clearly with 7.5 points including komi.
i included some comments on several moves to illustrate my motivations.
thanx very much in advance, martin.];B[qp];W[op]C[i played this to prevent a shimari and make the game different

This sort of play is playable, but it is more complex than typical fusekis with each player staking out space.  What sometimes happens in these games is a fire that starts in one corner and burns across the whole board.  The other thing to consider is to have a plan - and be willing to change it in response to developing conditions.  Again, this sort of move tends toward a fighting game with very difficult stragetic and positional judgments to be made.

This is exactly the wrong approach if you do not know josekis as well as your opponent - because your opponent will gain an immediate positional advantage if you make a mistake in the joseki.

You said you wanted to play your fuseki for influence, but started out looking for a fight - it is harder to play good influence moves in a fight.]
;B[pd]C[Black could have played out a joski here to get the position he wants - but playing elsewhere is not bad either.]
;W[pn]C[i thought taking one of the other corners was miai and wanted to take outside influence

If you want influence, it matters which corner.  So I think you take one corner or the other.  I think the right move here would have been either e4 or d4.   Then if b q6, w n6 is the influence (though non-standard) move.  Better would be the simple joseki starting with r3 - both groups settle - and builds strength for influence.]
;B[pq];W[dd]C[i chose this corner as a kind of "ladderbreaker" for the lower right and to prevent black to go for influence with taking the upper side, if he would take this upper left corner

If you were playing 4 for influence, you must play 6 at p3 for influence - keeping b hemmed in the corner.

The correct corner would be lower left - but with the opening underneath at p3, it is not so big yet.

But it is early and still if you are going to play in a corner, the lower left one is the correct one.

In influence games,all of the stones must work together.  6 does not affect anything except that corner.]
;B[dp];W[oq];B[pr];W[qo]C[Ok, now what does this do for you?  where is your influence now?   In both cases you stones are facing solid black stones on the corner star points - those stones have influence and power as well.

You have 4 stones crowded in one corner - b has 3.  B is alive and peeping out under the skirt of your wall facing left.  So your stones are not working efficiently.  They are also not very flexible or strong yet.

It is hard to build true influence two directions in a corner like this - if you were playing an influence game, you would play something like p2 (really!) or f4  or q9.

Or really what would be best would be to leave your strong right position and drive b toward it - the influence here is to keep b from getting much on the bottom and right sides.  So now, to make sense of the stone in the upper left, you need to either approach the b star point stones or extent from the upper stone.  In this situation, I would play something like d6.

Unusual and difficult but interesting and playable is e5.  But I wouldn't recommend it here.]
;B[ro];W[rn];B[rq];W[pp]C[Well, now you are settled and strong, but where is the influence?  The two black corner stones reduce it tremendously.

B should now play away from your group and keep your upper white stone from developing . . .

let's see.];B[mq]C[Too small.  If you are now playing an influence game, you descend to p2 or you look to have your influence be toward the upper side.

Since you can't really attack 15, I would leave it for now and play elsewhere until I could see whether descending or capping or pincering makes more sense.

Do not pincer yet.];W[or];B[rr]C[well, i (white) was quite satisfied with having black confined to the corner and have a strong group outside

B 15 was a mistake - your influence now makes that stone look lonely.  So now what?  How do you use your influence?  and when?]
;W[pj]C[OUCH!!!

This is the first truly poor move you have made.

Memorize this:  influence is used to attack, not build territory.  Territory is the result of attacking.  And usually the territory shows up somewhere remote from the influence.

So 18 is a territory building move.  Absolutely typical of 4-6 kyu players - unheard of for 2d  + players.  (I know better than to do it, but I still do it sometimes.)

Your group is strong.  Play away from strength.  18 is not away.

Attacking the b stone on n3 looks best.  I think a pincer, making it run, works best here.

e.g., something like l3, b either leaves it or plays n5, w l5, b n7, w l7, b n9.

b is running through empty space - w is building influence on the outside - by using the old influence group to chase b.  Now w can play around f4 or on the right to take some profit.  A play on the right also keeps some pressure on the running b group.

That is how you play influence - use it in one place to build it again elsewhere.  This result is so horrible for b that b should abandon the stone for now.]
;B[jq];W[cj]C[i played this to take the left side and prepare silently for attacks to the lower side, i didnt like the kakari C6 for white here, because i thought black has strong counters

B is stong on the lower side - and the two point extension plus the star point stone make a shambles of your influence group.  There is no harm in making b stronger where b is already strong - as on the lower side.

But wanting to prevent b from playing here is wise since that would give B a huge valley of influence.

I would probably have approached high at d6 or d7.];B[cf]C[i felt this was wrong side for black, but, hmm

This invites w to make a mistake. and sets up for b to use his influence from the bottom to attack the w stone on the side.

It is an aggressive move.  A quiet move here like k17 works nicely.]
;W[df];B[ce];W[de];B[bc];W[jd]C[i felt this was ok

Well, you are still open at the bottom and trying to use influence to build territory.  I like o16, b responds, then d 12 -  huge influence and deep, albeit not yet strong, valley.

Also, don't you wish c10 were on d10 - the influence point?]
;B[fc]C[oh, i didnt expect this one, i thought black would not do this because white can attack him good, but i didnt find a good move and decided to press from upper side

Tough call on what to do with this overplay - proper move is d17 for b 27.

I think playing the influence game  is the way to go here.  Descent to d17 and see what happens.

The other alternative - what I would probably do as w would be to concede the small territory at the top and take the outside influence by playing at g16 or f15.  I like g16 here.]
;W[cd];B[bd]C[i thought this exchange, although it strengthens black, could help against black D17 as an answer to my next move

No.  This just settles b without helping you at all - takes away your options.]
;W[fd]C[Still, the shoulder hit or cap is better here.];B[gc]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[ec]C[OOPS.  Wrong way - if you are playing influence, play influence - you are playing attack and territory.

B lives.  Period.  So what is the best you get out of this?  keep extending one more, then descend if b pushe again  - then b must connect back and you get to protect the defect and have great shape and influence inthe center.]
;B[jc];W[id];B[ic]C[i expected black L17 and took the chance to shut him in

Well, now you will be leaving lots of defects behind.

Also, where would you rather have a stone to block this group?  e17 or k17?  Which gives you power and influence?]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[lc];B[lb];W[mc];B[hd];W[qf]C[i thought after white H15 there would be still too many defects in whites shape and that i should take the initiative on other places first before deciding, what to do with the upper side

Wrong.  Must seal b in here or your influence is gone with the perferation.

You have defects and b has none, but they can all be handled.  You just can't ge everything every time.]
;B[rd];W[oe]C[Meaningless if b can push from the top and can still play from bottom and it is all so open everywhere.]
;B[rf];W[rg]C[i thought white R15 prevents good black shape but feared white to crawl in my left side]
;B[qe];W[qg]C[hmm, good shape for black (again), but i felt good now]
;B[od];W[ne];B[jj]C[Notice now how you have no good response here - 53 can run to the top or bottom because the top is not sealed.

Count points now.  B has on in upper r corner, 10 in lower r corner, 10 on top side 10 in top left corner, and good prospects on the bottom.

W has what? 25 points on the right?

Where can w get points to make up the difference?

No where unless b makes a huge mistake and throws a group.  B can play connect -the-dots now and win.]
;W[cn]C[i wanted the left side];B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[co]C[Which is now bigger - w on left or b on bottom?

Which is stronger?

B plays simply here because he is 20 points ahead.];B[cp];W[em]
;B[gn]C[yes, this was actually a huge spere of influence for black now, but i took the left side first and then invade or reduce black lower side later.
 this black move looked strange but i decided that i would take later advantage of this

This is correct because b is looking to connect with 53 and looking at a big space on the bottom.  It isn't all territory yet, but if b gets to play here, it can become territory in a hurry.

Actually, 61 at f7 is better  perhaps or even f6, but this is in th right general area.]
;W[cg]C[B should cut at d13  since  b is not sealed in on top.  But since b is still ahead by about 15 points, b can play more simply.]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[be];W[bh];B[af];W[dg]C[i knew one should in general not do this sacrifice since it give black too good shape but i was afraid of black D13  in other variants (which would attack my upper left stones very strong)

OK.  But then why the hane in the first place?  Gote is very bad here.]
;B[he]C[Ouch.];W[ob]C[that may be too small , but it looked too big for black and i was still on search for ideas for the lower side

This is sizable, but you must leave with sente and find some points in the middle - which is very hard to do.

Not that w does not have effective influence anywhere on the board.  W can only use the strength to make territory - which is the worst way to use influence.  And that territory will be too small because b can enter any  potential center territory from the top, bottom and middle.

Alternative would be n10 - which looks to expand the right side and maybe steal some points in the center.

Or the shoulder hit at j4 is the only real invasion point here.]
;B[pb];W[oc];B[pc];W[nd];B[nb];W[oa];B[mb];W[nc]C[hmm, my play there didnt had the effect i hoped for]
;B[ke]C[i was satisfied that black in my view overestimated that area and i was able to reduce his lower side

This is nothing.  It is just what was always there.  you have the follow-on of q19 later.

But look what happens in the middle now.  B gets at least three free moves which take away any chance for w points.

79 is the first and most obvious one.];W[jn]C[B should play h4 here because so loose still.

80 is not severe enough.  the best you could have hoped for was to get b to respond underneath, then attack the center stone and build territory inthe center.  But with the lack of sealing b in on the top, and with a friend at g6, w cannot do much in fact.]
;B[io];W[ip]C[at first i thought that this could not work but after a second look i found white can with this move break through blacks wall and played it, it worked ;)

Yes. Which is why the right move was h4, not j5.

B should recognize the mistake and crawl and push at k4 and then crawl along the bottom for a couple of lines.]
;B[jo];W[jp];B[kp];W[iq];B[jr];W[ho];B[in]C[the bad aji at L5 and L3 enabled me to escape and thought to have blacks main territory destroyed.
i hoped that blacks strong center group would not be able to make much territory later on]
;W[hn];B[jm];W[im];B[kn];W[gm]C[i thought i can easily sacrifice the J4  stones and build more influence in the left center]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[hq];W[gq];B[hr];W[fn];B[eq];W[gr];B[bo]C[a bit of bloody reduction, but it worked ok - but still, where is the chance for w to get points?

B is even stronger now toward the middle and right.];W[hs];B[ir]
;W[bn];B[bq];W[ao];B[bp];W[cr]C[i thought i could not kill black but made a testmove anyway, maybe in endgame i'll get a second chance]
;B[dr];W[sf]C[i considered this a sente move];B[rb];W[lj]C[i played this to reduce blacks prospects in the center and i thought i would make territory either above or below the line between M10 and Q10.
maybe i should have played on the left side of L10.

i considered white quite ahead now and hoped black could not make up too much in the endgame, but black managed to make quite a lot of territory in the center and reduce mine quite alot. damn. ;)

This is not surprising since who has the strength around here?  Not w.

A more restrained n10 would be better.

Or so would o7.  But b is so strong here that b will get something to balance whatever w gets.]
;B[il];W[mm]C[A bit close to b's strength.  So b can do almost anything in respond and make things hard on w.]
;B[hm];W[go];B[gl];W[fj];B[lh]C[See how the w stone on m10 would be better placed on n10?]
;W[mi]C[No. You must push back - you will lose the surround territory race so you must push through at l11.

Influence is about attitude - your attitude here is all about territory still - when you must attack to use your power.]
;B[mh];W[pe]C[Irrelevant.];B[oh]C[this would be better if w took it.]
;W[nh];B[ng];W[ni];B[pg];W[re];B[qd];W[pf];B[qh]C[this was  good reducing by black]
;W[ri];B[mf]C[This must be very painful.  Not what happened to your influence - links up to a small space.

135 should capture the two stones on top.];W[kd];B[ki];W[pi]
;B[ph];W[hg]C[Again, too far.  g12 or g13 would be beetter.]
