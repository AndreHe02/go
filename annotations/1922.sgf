;B[on];W[nm];B[np]LB[cf:C][mm:B][nn:A]TR[dp]C[block the cornor!

--- Push one more time at A.  If white plays the game move to defend the lower side, black can hane at B, causing white to form bad shape (hane at the head of 3 stones).  White can escape, but in the process black will form thickness on the outside.

Also, sealing white in is not urgent.  White already lives in the corner.  Even if black seals white in, his thickness isn't all that powerful because of the marked white stone.  If the marked stone is black instead, then sealing white in is a reasonable approach.  If black doesn't want to attack the 3 white stones, there are bigger plays (such as C) than sealing white in.]
