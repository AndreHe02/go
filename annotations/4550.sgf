(;B[na]C[cardmagic: was this play too early?

EmTom: That depends. It is sente and it closes your teritory on the top so its ok. If you want to kill the corner though you should not play here cause it forces w to make 2 eyes

Instead you could have tried variation];W[qa];B[cd];W[de];B[qq]
C[cardmagic: was this invation too early? would a reduction play have been better or an invation around R8 to attack the white stones in the left side have been better?

EmTom: I think its ok. You reduce a lot in that corner.];W[pq]

[hn:A][mn:B]C[cardmagic: would B11 have been better?

EmTom: I think that both moves are quite useless as its very hard (if not impossible) to kill this group. Yes b11 is slightly better but i would suggest tenuki. I think that marked moves look much bigger]

[rr][sr][as][bs][cs][ds][es][fs][gs][qs][rs][ss]C[EmTom: This game is hard to comment as you played better than your opponent and your lead was huge. Its hard to find mistakes in such games. Consider sending games that you have lost. They are much more valuable as study material (trust me ive learned this already ;))

Anyway... If you have any more questions feel free to ask (KGS: EmTom). Enjoy this review.]
