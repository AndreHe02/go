hama88 [6k\]: hello
sylvainc [8k\]: have good game
hama88 [6k\]: thx you too

[DP General comments on fuseki:
a) If you're taking handicap stones, try to keep the game simple.  5-4 corner moves and unfinished joseki tend to give the advantage back to W
b) Don't make W strong when you are weak on the other side.  There were several peeps at the bottom, none of which helped you, all of which hurt.  Peep using your weaker stones to secure linkage and escape
c) Guiding principle should be to keep W separated - failing to do this let him back into a game you were winning easily at one stage\]

[DP - General comments on late middle game and yose:
a) W invasions were dealt with lightly.  Attack hard, from the outside typically. In particular, the left side invasion, which nearly won W the game, should have been kept very small.
b) don't be afraid of ko, especially in the yose
c) be aware of big gote moves in endgame.  8 pts is not to be sniffed at towards the end \]]
;W[qp];B[de]C[[DP B needs to be confident of 5-4 joseki before doing this - it is asking to complicate the game, which when giving 2 stones will probably favour W.  There is nothing wrong with the move, but I would probably play 4,4 or 4,3 point, or kakari at P4 against R4\]]
;W[gc]C[[DP W immediately seizes the chance to complicate by using a non-standard approach\]]
;B[op];W[mq];B[qq]C[[DP There are alternatives here, such as O5 or P2 which separate W immediately\]]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[ro]
(;B[jq]LB[pn:B][no:A]C[$ this is my fisrt question. What is right move here ? A and B are joseki

[DP There is a reason why they are joseki too!  If you look at what happens in the game, the P4 set of stones are pushed around by W all over the place, allowing W to launch invasions at will.  B should play O5, and then there are the two standard variations shown off node 9, either of which increases central influence for B\]]
;W[mo]
(;B[on]LB[pn:A]C[$ A best ?

[DP Yes, it would be better - see variations\]];W[qm];B[ol]
;W[mm]
(;B[lp]C[[DP You shouldn't strengthen W against your weak B stones from P4\]]
;W[mp];B[ln]C[[DP and again.... this is putting huge pressure on your P4 stones\]]
;W[mn];B[lo]C[$ what about this gote-two-peep sequence ?

[DP It was horrible :-)  Don't do it!  B stones are now so weak it is only just possible to avoid being cut\]]

(;W[mk];B[oj]C[[DP Good - these needed pulling out since they were in danger\]]
;W[kl]C[[DP Simple extension down the side to R10 probably better for W\]]

(;B[jc]LB[dc:C][jn:B][hp:A]C[$ what s better ?

[DP None of these.  W has not extended along the side, so you can play the multi-purpose move of R9 which
a) puts pressure on the W stones forcing R2 or S2
b) extends from Q16 and with P10 forms an almost ideal shape
c) secures the weak P4 stones
Keep an eye out for moves like these.  Try to avoid having weak groups when taking a handicap
If I had to choose between A, B and C, I would probably go for C to enclose the corner and keep sente, since W will then need to extend at the top to avoid a pincer. The only reason you are thinking about A and B is because of the bad peeps you did earlier.  Check the variation\]]
;W[oh]C[[DP W is not going to let you have a second chance!\]]
;B[ni]C[[DP Separating is fine\]];W[mg];B[li];W[kg]
(;B[qi]C[[DP This puts no pressure on the W stones below, which could still extend to R9 for eyes if required.  Now might be a good time for D17 - P4 stones can still escape into centre or make eyes at the bottom or on the right\]]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[qg];B[ec]LB[qk:A]C[$ A ?

[DP A is too late now. W is secure below and has already eaten into the top right. E17 is sensible, although D17 more secure\]]
;W[pk]C[[DP Nice move by B.  Requires some thought how to answer.  Don't be afraid to sacrifice a stone or two\]]

(;B[ok]C[[DP Think about alternative answers to peeps.  See variations from Q8 answer\]]

(;B[qk];W[ri];B[ql];W[pm];B[om];W[pl];B[qn];W[rm];B[ji]C[$ white did good job on the right side

[DP Yes, he complicated the fight nicely\]];W[il];B[jm]C[[DP Another horrible peep.  Strengthen W against your still weak (no eyes yet) P4 stones\]]
;W[jl];B[rr]C[[DP Yes, this is big for you\]];W[sr];B[nr];W[mr]
;B[nq];W[oo]C[[DP This is a key moment.  This does not connect the W stones or separate you - W is short of liberties on the right. You could have responded and linked immediately here to keep the pressure on W centre stones, and remove it from yours\]]

(;B[qr];W[hq];B[ho]C[[DP Ouch.  This is peanuts, all resulting from the bad peeps earlier. The big points are the top right corner, and the weak W stones at G17\]]
;W[go]C[[DP Luckily for B, W is responding locally\]];B[gn]
C[$ good ?

[DP Sensible\]];W[gp]
(;B[hp]C[[DP - No, J6 or H6 much better. Your move helps W make shape and reduces your own liberties.  There is an absence of strategy here.  You should be thinking about those weak W centre stones (P5 has not connected them - see move 57), and aiming to get strong on the outside to attack.\]]
;W[iq]
(;B[fq]C[[DP Again, another inadvisable peep.  You shouldn't mind if W lives small.  Just make sure he can't connect.  K4 would achieve this\]]
;W[gq];B[fn];W[jr]LB[jo:A]C[$ A ?

[DP No, mistake was earlier.  Letting W connect lets him back into a game which you were winning\]]
;B[jp];W[kr];B[je]C[[DP Good.  Attacks G17 from a distance, and helps claim top area\]]
;W[ig]C[[DP Although W centre is now safe, you are not separated by P5, so do not need to respond at H11.  Either enclosing the corner with R16, or surrounding G17 with G15 would be much bigger\]]
;B[hi];W[gg];B[fi];W[nc]C[[DP W takes advantage of you not having sealed the corner\]]
;B[lf]C[[DP This peep is OK - helps out K17 stones and puts pressure on O17.\]]

(;B[nb]C[[DP Why?  O16 is being offered on a plate!\]];W[mc]
;B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[kc];B[kb]LB[oc:A]C[$ blzck connected but very low. What else to do instead of A

[DP You could have tried O16, but I think A was best.  Needed O16 push-through though\]]
;W[qc]
(;B[of]C[[DP What is this move?  Kill R17 first\]];W[nf];B[qd]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[nh]C[[DP Good.  W has lived top right, but you can now separate and attack using sente\]]
;W[ng];B[og];W[rg];B[ge];W[he]
(;B[gd]C[[DP Yuk.  This reduces your liberties and helps W connect and make shape.  E13 much bigger, forcing W to live in centre and strengthening left side\]]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gf];B[ic];W[eg]C[[DP W escapes.  Good for him, bad for you\]]
;B[dh]LB[fc:A]C[$ what s best ?

[DP Again, the mistake is before this.  But D12 is better than A\]]

;B[cn];W[bi];B[cj];W[bj];B[ck];W[bk]
(;B[dl]C[[DP This time it would be good to peep, since you can't kill it, but you want the corner territory and if he runs to the centre so what? And it would also threaten to kill too!\]]
;W[cm];B[dm];W[bn];B[co];W[bo];B[bp]C[[DP Huge sequence for W taking him from about 50 points behind to less than 20\]]

;W[bf]C[[DP Ouch.  W eats up even more\]];B[fr]C[[DP and so into the yose. F2 is big so no complaints there\]]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[in];B[im];W[ip];B[jn];W[io];B[po];W[no]
(;B[qo]C[[DP Nope - S6 bigger\]];W[pn];B[pp];W[rp];B[rn]
(;W[sn]C[[DP W mistake.  B can now take substantial profit. W should play S8\]]

(;B[so]C[[DP Oops.  S8 first kills and wins the game. So this is your first yose mistake. But you get a good bit of profit here with the S4 stones captured.  So far you are easily outplaying W in the yose\]]

(;B[hh];W[jo];B[ko];W[km];B[kn];W[kp]C[$ i found white's yose very best to mine. What's my mistakes ?

[DP Well, there have been two so far. Lower right where more profit was available, and lower left where you haven't followed up your sente move. This particular move is 8 points gote, so not that small\]]
;B[hg];W[if];B[ie];W[hf];B[gk]C[[DP This is poor - there are generally precious few points in the centre, particularly in the endgame. Go back and claim either L3 for 8 points, or B7 for something similar\]]
