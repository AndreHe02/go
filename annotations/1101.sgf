C[Hello.
 Thanks for reviewing my game.  I'm Black here, 25kyu or so, I guess.  Unsure
of my true rank, as I play mostly online.  I've been reading about moyo and
thickness, and I thought things were going well, and then white poked some
holes...

REV: I'll do my best.];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[nc];B[lc]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[oc];B[nd]C[At
this point I'm pleased with the joseki.  Should I be? what is most important
next.  Perhaps an extension along the top, f/g/h17?

REV:  I'm not really that good at openings, but as long as the thickness you have created doesn't go to waste, this looks like a good result to me.

If white continues to ignore C15, something like you mentioned seems sensible.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[lb];B[kc]C[REV: From this point on, I doubt whether the moves played are really large enough.  I don't quite see why white is running along the second line, and I also don't quite know whether you are getting much out of following him.]
;W[kb];B[jc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]C[REV: This move is fine, but you now have a situation where you have huge influence, and he has large unassailable territory.  I don't quite know how it will pan out, but you will have to use the influence correctly to make this kind of situation worth it.]
;W[gc]C[I felt ok here, ready to build a good moyo.

REV: Yes, but G17 is sente with respect to C15 (I think).  After all, if you had just played C15, and white had responded G17, it would have been slightly weird not to respond, in my opinion.  (Disclaimer:  I am not that good at openings, maybe you can have this review reviewed by a dan player, and send me a copy?)]
;B[pj];W[he];B[je]C[REV:  How big is this move, compared to an extension from C15, or an attack at, maybe, E3?  It is not a bad move in itself, though.]
;W[og]C[REV: Now white is trying to neutralize the influence you built up in the opening.]
;B[pg];W[oh]C[I
didn't know which way to push him here.  Looking back, I think I should have
been mor aggressive.  I did not use my thickness here as well as I could
have.

REV: I might consider keeping him away from the edge, and forcing him to run a bit (see variation)]

(;B[oj];W[oi];B[nj]C[REV: These were good moves, as you make more influence for yourself.]
;W[of];B[jp];W[mf];B[mh];W[kf];B[kh]C[Would k14
have been better?  I think so now.

REV: I agree!

Then he takes L12, and I make shape at
M10?  Good shape bad shape, I don't know.

REV: Seems a bit tenuous with N12 in place, though.];W[jf];B[if]
C[REV: Good, you keep him cut to an extent.];W[ie];B[hg]C[REV: Good:  Keep the cutting stone alive.]
;W[jd]
(;B[le]C[Bad attempt to cut him up.

REV: Why not L15?  Keep the cutting stone alive, make white sweat some more.]
;W[lf]
(;B[ch]C[Black
47 was a guess.  the center felt full and i did not yet have a base on the
left...  Suggestions for more important play?

REV:  THIS  was a big blunder.  (see variation)];W[ke]SQ[if]
[hg]C[Now white doesn't have to worry about his center group any more, and the marked stones are still note quite safe.]
;B[kd]SQ[jc][kc][lc][kd]C[This is a small move.  Sure, you save the marked stones, but still, compare it with something like E3 or something along the left side.]
;W[ic];B[eq]C[OK, so white thought it was sente, and you anyway get a big move in!  ;-)]
;W[jb];B[ld]C[REV: This was maybe 13 points or so.  Not quite obvious that you should ignore it, but not huge either!  He has given you the opportunity to get a move ahead in the bottom left corner.  You should get more out of that, in my extremely humble opinion?]
;W[qi];B[pi]C[Oops,now I'm worried about the stringy group on the top.  It turned out ok, but it was nerve racking, and he gained on the right.]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[rh];B[qg];W[qj];B[rg];W[ri];B[qk];W[rk];B[rl]
C[double hane.  How does it play?  When is it appropriate?  Not here I think.

REV:  I think you should ask a higher reviewer about when to play it, but as you saw, clearly not here!]
;W[ql];B[rm];W[pk];B[pf];W[sg];B[sf]C[I guess it worked out, but I think he could have killed at Q15.  Lucky me.

REV: Quite right!];W[qm];B[rn];W[qn];B[ro];W[qo];B[qp];W[dm]
;B[ck];W[nq];B[oq];W[np]
(;B[mo]C[Black 83 was a guess.  I didn't know what to do.  Thought about o6, m3, e5, etc.

REV: I would go for m3 (see variation).];W[jr]C[83 at m3 looks like it would have been better for me.

REV:  Clearly.  I don't see a good result for black here.  I think you did reasonably OK after N5.]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[hr];W[jq];B[hp];W[lp];B[kp];W[kq];B[mp];W[mq]
C[I gave him a base here, but was happy to limit it as I did.

REV:  Well, you did limit the damage to your territory, but there's still almost none left!]
;B[lo];W[oo];B[cr];W[ek]SQ[dr][ds][es][er][fr][fs][gr][gs][fq]
[gq][hq]C[REV:  As I said earlier: you don't have much left after the white assault on the bottom (11 points at an optimistic count!)]
;B[bm]C[Black 97 and 99.  Big or small?  Maybe they do not fit with the moyo idea I had early on.  Then again, white already has some stringy groups stretching into the middle.  I dunno...

REV: Well, they might not get you much territory, but they remove a sizeable chunk of white territory (compare the board with white peices there in stead of black ones!), so they soom good to me.]
;W[cn];B[do]C[Black 101: small.  How about f7? or e10?  H9?

REV: I agree that this is not a very productive move.  Of the moves you suggested I prefer H9, as it has some effect towards the center group, but how about something like B17?  K13 also seems to make some sense to me.]
;W[co];B[cm];W[dn];B[dl];W[el]
(;B[eh]C[Black 107: should have cut at e7?

REV: I definitely think so! (see variation)];W[hk];B[fm]C[Vulgar move!  Just cut and fight, right?

REV:  Definitely still cut.  The cutting stone would be healthy and happy, but the center white group would be in very bad shape.  You are just forcing him to connect stones that he -wants- to connect by playing F7.  You only do this kind of move if you want to remove eyespace, or if you want to gain influence with the move.]
;W[em];B[fn];W[gl];B[fl]C[REV: Now what is the point of this move?  You are not reducing white's inavsion, nor removing eyes, nor disconnecting!]
;W[fk];B[gj];W[fj];B[gi];W[fi];B[fh];W[gk]C[Many small moves by me.

REV:  Indeed.  You seemed to hang onto the hope of killing white for too long, and played too close.  If you had maybe kept your distance you might have kept more territory.]
;B[bq];W[jh];B[ji];W[ih];B[hh]C[REV: J11 maybe here?];W[ii]
;B[ij];W[jj];B[kj];W[jk]SQ[kn][hn][eo][ll][hj][dp]C[cut to late.  no good.

REV:  By now white is happily alive.  Some moves you might have considered, realizing this, are marked.]

;W[me];C[White wins by 17.

I didn't know the score, but thought it would be close.  I definitely did not make good use of my sanren-sei moyo ideas in the beginning.
What should I work on now?  Fighting and cutting?

REV:  I noticed that you pointed out a number of bad moves yourself in your commentary.  I suggest you make a habit of, before you put down a stone, thinking of one alternative -every time-, and thinking of two possible responses by your opponent to each move you make (except, of course when you are in bad time trouble ;).  This will alert you to obvious bad moves.  Also, when your opponent is thinking, don't think direct strategy, instead, ask yourself "Where am I going with this line?", such questions as "am I killing anything here?"  "what territory am I going after?".]
