C[ok first question.  what to do here?  I don't like giving up too much space by playing r4, but 3-3 leaves the cross cut.

White must R3 here (its joseki and natural).  Black will then cut R4.  Leads to a complicated fight I think.]

(;W[qp];B[op]C[black got good shape here and white overconcentrated.]
;W[ed];B[dd]C[what in the world....
He said later he was testing my strength.  he was confused why I gave him two stones, since he is ranked stronger than me.  I find, though, that I am fighting around 8-9k and like the practice of being behind.
anyway, I had no clue what to do here.  I figured it was a probing move, so I responded with one of my own.]
;W[dc]C[me: are you agressive, or no?

Yes hane good response.];B[ec]C[yep, he's a cutter. I figure I'm ahead here tho.  maybe there was a better way to play it.]
;W[cc];B[de]C[here I thought about
1. playing in the bottom right to break up the ladder
2. maybe e15.  pushing from behind, and risky, but gives him a tough situation too.  Dunno.

F17 is ok.  Can also F16 I think.  See variation.]
(;W[fc]C[I decide on the safe route.

F17 is good too.];B[ee];W[fd];B[bd]C[decent result on either side.

no.  Black bad :)  White got E17 and black not alive];W[bc]
;B[dj]LB[nc:A][qf:B][cn:C][fq:D][iq:E]C[life in gote plus weaknesses for black.

White got better places to play here.];W[jc]C[K17 too close to thickness (you got E17).  See alternative points.]
;B[nc]LB[cn:B][iq:A]C[he's got a big moyo now though.  maybe k17 was too small, but it felt good.  I know something has to go now tho.  better to erase in the 12-13 range or at line 7?

K17 terrible.  I'd say J3 or C6 biggest now.];W[dm];B[fq]
(;W[bm]C[I don't like this move.  makes me low, and doesn't even guarantee eye space.  Shoudl I have started on the third line to make living easier?  I'm alwasy afraid of getting locked in.

yeah this move terrible.  Should just come out directly, no eye space here.]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[bo]C[i thought this was weak.  he needed to push from the other side so I had no eye space.]

(;W[bj]C[cutable, I think.  I hate the second line; why do I use it?

I dunno this attacks black too, so its playable here.  Might consider it too slow though, see alternative.]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[ch]
(;W[bh];B[ci];W[bi];B[pj]C[yeah, I wanted to go over there as soon as my stones settled.  oh well.]

(;W[oo]C[silly.

I dunno its kinda huge.  Altnerative....];B[no]C[give him good shape, make mine bad.  gote to fix it.  hmm, are we thinking at all?]

(;W[qk]C[bad form.];B[qj]C[black was happy to take R10.];W[ff]
;B[eg];W[fg];B[fh];W[bf]C[hmmm well playable but don't like this F16 cut point]
;B[gh];W[hf];B[fe];W[ge];B[ef];W[ng];B[qg];W[kf]C[i was happy with this sequence.  very loose play, I know, but I felt I needed influence there BAD.

playable BUT.  P5 in bad shape.  Urgent before big moves, always.]
;B[hg]C[screw em.  maybe I should have kept them so he had to worry about eye space, but his group is looking pretty lively.  lots of center acess.  better to use this move somewhere big.

yes tenuki but wrong spot.  P5 area more important.];W[cg]C[but I don't.  I was thinking about maybe eliminating his eye space and then saving the two endangered stones. then I can push from the bottom and make sure his center stays weak.]
;B[dg]C[Quillian [10k\]: i am glad to hear that
tom661 [8k\]: no the test is not over yet :)]
(;W[fl];B[gn];W[fn];B[go];W[ig];B[ih]C[what am I thinking? bad shape bad shape alalala.]
;W[jg];B[gf];W[hd];B[ld]C[crud.  should have played n16 instead of that stupid hane.]
;W[me];B[le];W[lf]C[well done on his part i think.  I would have then pushed in deeper.]
;B[md];W[ne];B[of];W[oc]C["Quillian [10k\]: oops
Quillian [10k\]: I think I got ahead of myself in my head
Quillian [10k\]: its ok well see how it plays out"

it actually went how I was thinking anyway; not that it did any good.]
;B[od];W[oe];B[pe];W[nd];B[mc]
(;W[ob]C[Quillian [10k\]: fun

is it?  I think I'm way behind in liberties.  what should I have done instead of this entertaining but admitedly futile invasion?]
;B[qb];W[la]C[wrong move.  maybe small knights jump?  this is cutable now, though he doesn't do it.
what I really need is a stone on the second line to connect to.]
;B[lb];W[ma]C[blah.];B[nb];W[na]C[pretty sure I will lose.  playing through just for the sake of fighting.]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[ka];W[kd];B[pb]C[oh.  somehow I missed that.]
;W[ja]C[well, now I have some decent ko threats. w00t.];B[on]
C[stupid stone.  screw it.  shouldn't have been there in the first place. ;P]
;W[pn];B[po];W[qo];B[qq]C[trouble coming, though I don't see it.]
;W[om];B[nm]
(;W[jh]C[gah why did you leave that piece there! I bet he would have followed me up if I played p8.  would have saved my self a world of hurt later.]
;B[ol];W[ii];B[fj];W[hh];B[gg]C[ok.  I like center influence.  let's do it.]
;W[jm]C[yarr.  maybe should have gone deeper.  dunno.];B[kn]
;W[in];B[io];W[jo];B[jn];W[ho];B[ip];W[hn]C[whee.];B[hp]C[worried about cut.  he should have cut.  meh.]
;W[gm];B[pm]
(;W[rk]C[I was thinking he would defend against the monkey jump, and I would settle my stones.  no problem.]
;B[rn]C[oh_crap.
I should not live, I don't think.  he takes pity and goes easy on me.]
;W[qn]C[Quillian [10k\]: looked at some tries in the corner, but I don't think it can be done
Quillian [10k\]: gave up too many captures in there
Quillian [10k\]: just rediculous
Quillian [10k\]: it's ok, you had a big lead anyway.

;W[gp]C[so we go have fun.  I don't think this was the best I could do, but it was fun nonetheless.]
