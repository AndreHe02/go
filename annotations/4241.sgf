(;B[rp]C[DC: Don't exchange of potential, look up aji
-keshi.];W[qq];B[on];W[np];B[rq]C[Shomego [16k\]: better move for b: Q9?

DC: You should not exchange s4 for r3 as the corner is left open for you then.]
;W[qf];B[pk];W[qk];B[pl]C[DC: move ahead of your opponent with Q10.

Principle; always get your nose in front.];W[pj];B[oj];W[pi]
;B[ln];W[lp]C[Shomego [16k\]: I dislike m4, how could i prevent w to play here, i felt i had to develop black into the center too, it's a hard choice for me.

DC: The mistakes are often earlier than you think.];B[nd];W[rd]
;B[qc];W[lc];B[mb]C[Shomego [16k\]: lagging !];W[jd];B[pg]C[Shomego [16k\]: q13 a real threat for w???]
;W[qg];B[pf];W[qm];B[pm];W[rn];B[qp];W[pq];B[po];W[iq]C[Shomego [16k\]: i don't succeed in getting the sente move, allways reaction on the threating moves of w. how can i change that?

DC: Your problem lies in the fuseki.

Professionals spend a great deal of time studying the fuseki (opening) as advantages lost here can easily cost the game considering equal fighting by both.]
;B[nh];W[lf]C[DC: At this point you have tried to make the most of the centre, whit will need only to reduce with such safe territory.]
;B[le];W[ke];B[ld]C[Shomego [16k\]: is the l14 cut better for black?]

;W[nc];B[od];W[ej];B[dj]C[Shomego [16k\]: i was looking for a move that protected both the lower and the upper side of the c10 area, did i succeed?]

;W[ni]C[benoit [15k\]: thanks
Shomego [16k\]: thnx
Shomego [16k\]: goood play
Shomego [16k\]: so what went wrong? iin the early game, i tended to go for the center (moyo right side to start with), and w reduced it largely.

DC: Your white stopped the centre strategy after black had a poor start in the fuseki. Black was at a disadvantage from this point on. If you see me on IGS\KGS as Dreamrace I woul.d be more than willing to play some teaching games.

Thank you!])

This answers your question.]))
