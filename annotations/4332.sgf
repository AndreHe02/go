AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi my name is Ronald Wopereis, player name is woepwoep. The request to review came from the black player, i wil review for both sides.

My comments preceded by RW>


 - - - the whole point of the game is to have an inner vision of the board as a mountain, rather than an open field.

 - - - when you defend a mountain by having all of the army at the top of the mountain (at the center of the board) then this army will ultimately have less territory. Exactly because the base of a mountain is always bigger than the top.

 - - - Go proverbs are about touching base first, and extend from this base. And the base is at the sides and the corners of the boards - the ground floor of this mountain.

 - - - The reach of one stone, one soldier, is between 3 or 4 lines. So that is why defense of the mountain, this board, should always start at lines 3 and 4.]
;W[dd];B[nj]C[RW>  This stone O10 has a reach to the right of 3, maybe 4 lines. So T10 and S10 are out of reach.

RW> A reply by white on R10 would effectively cut off the O10 stone as a "loose stone". So in terms of the mountain, O10 is placed too far from the base line T10 - it should be at the exact place where white would counter - this means R10 better than O10.

RW> Note that after O10, nothing happens in the R10 region for more than 150 moves. The move, at this point, is therefore played about 150 moves too early.

RW> As a beginner player, this is not easy to understand. So just take this information for granted, and keep much joy in playing !]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[dm]C[Would an extension have beed better here?

RW> no this is excellent play.];B[do];W[bn];B[em];W[dl];B[el]

;W[ap]C[I know, this could have waited.  I was upset at my earlier folly on this side.]
;B[eg]C[RW> like in move #2 , this move is too far off from the side of the board (fifth line, E-line).

RW> One of the goals in the game is to have territory. So imagine this territory owned by black, where the left side of the board is one of the borders ; the black stones A9 thru D9 are another border; and E13 is the first stone to mark the third border. Then the only border missing is the upper, fourth border.

RW> See, there is the problem. There are two borders to be created with one move. How to do it ? 

RW> The samurai way is this : when the opponent attacks with his long sword, the samurai steps forward - there are no second thoughts. 

RW> So C14 or C15 would be a better move for black, if C14 area is the territory that black wants.]
;W[cf]C[RW> very good counter move by white. Now the upper left corner is white's.

RW> one of the golden rules in go is, that you can always tell which move is best for you, because that is the move that your opponent wants to do also.

RW> so in hindsight, blacks previous best move was C14 - because that is what white is now playing.]
;B[ee]C[RW> black agrees that white should have the upper left corner. During the next few moves, black is building a wall and let white have the corner and the upper side. Black imagines that lines F thru T are all black territory - and so that would mean black wins.

RW> in Go, one of the fundamentals is this, that you need to make sure the opponent gets a fair amount of territory. Not as much as you get, just a bit less. Receiving just a bit more than your opponent, thus winning, is the reward for taking good care of your opponent.

RW> if one player wants all territory at the cost of the other player, then there is war, not play. Go is more like dancing, and in a game both are equally responsible for the opponent's joy in playing.]
;W[ed];B[ff];W[gc]C[RW> black agrees that white should have the upper side of the board.]
;B[ge];W[fd];B[gd];W[de]C[emalamud [30k?\]: im lagging...];B[hc]
;W[gb];B[hb];W[ha];B[ia]C[RW> black touches another base - line 19. This is very good play by both players.]
;W[ga];B[df]C[RW> this is a mistake. J18 or K18 was urgently needed here.]
;W[ib]C[RW> white grabs the opportunity.];B[ja]C[RW> black trying to escape...]
;W[jb]C[RW> white shows that black can not escape.];B[lb]C[RW> black understands that L19 etc does not help to escape this "ladder".]
;W[hd]C[RW> white seeks to further expand...];B[ic];W[ka];B[lc]
C[RW> black now "retreats" from his first wall H17 to his second wall at M18/M17/Q16]
;W[id];B[jc];W[fe]C[It looks like I'm stuck in the habbit of firgting locally, any advice on another stratagy would help.

RW> the left upper corner is for white ; the left lower corner is for white. Now there are two more corners to take care of.

RW> Look at the diagonal A1 - T19. Note that this is half the board, yet there are only three stones. So it seems to me that there is plenty opportunity for white to get an even bigger share of the territory.

RW> Just play on the empty side of the diagonal. How much easier can it be than this ?  

 - - - Some people fight over a piece of cake, while others bake new cake.]
;B[gf];W[ef];B[jd];W[dg];B[ie];W[eh];B[fg];W[dh];B[fi];W[ei]
;B[ej];W[ci];B[ek];W[jp]C[RW> great move by white. One line closer to the side , at  K3 ,  would be even better. This is because of the black wall to the left which is quite huge ; so white needs to touch base (K1 horizontal line).]
;B[kp]C[RW> black should not touch white. When stones touch, both black and white get stronger. So effectively white profits from this move.]
;W[gq]C[RW> counter attack by white would be N4 , instead of G3. But as we will see shortly, this G3 move works great for white.]
;B[fq]C[RW> black needs to "push" white against his wall. So in this case, black should make sure he plays to the right of white stones.

RW> Better move: K3 instead of F3.];W[gr];B[fr];W[kq];B[lp]
;W[kr];B[jo];W[ip];B[gp];W[hp];B[ir]C[RW> black shows that he understands at least one basic shape and how to kill it .  Excellent , even when in this game it is not working the way black would like it !

RW> There is only one problem : black misses out on the opening for white at H5 and J5. The GO proverb says : defense before attack.

 - - - The next sequence of moves shows just how hard it is for black to keep the size of this white "fire" under control. 

RW> A white group like the one at K4 is like a fire. To control a fire, the firemen usually stay away from the center of the fire. They just deprive a fire of fuel, oxygen, and/or heat.

RW> Black should attack the white "fire" from the outside in. So never touch the fire, let the fire touch the wall that you build around the fire. It takes some time to build this wall, so therefore the wall should not be built too closely to this fire. While the wall is being built, the fire expands. Timing.]

;W[mo]C[RW> end of the sequence. Now white is safe, and can not be killed as a group. For black all there is left to do is damage control.]
;B[mk]C[RW> this move should be M9 - black threatens then to capture M8 group.]
;W[is];B[fs];W[js];B[lo];W[ln];B[lk];W[oo]C[Could a better move be played here. Why? or Why not?

RW> this move is just fine for white. 

RW> Another move is R6. Because white has such strong presence in group N6, and there is only one black stone Q4 to protect the corner, white can attack the lower right corner from two sides - upper side R6 and left side N4/M3.]
;B[no];W[np];B[nn];W[po];B[qo];W[on];B[nm];W[qn]C[RW> there is R6 - black has R5 in place. 

RW> Maybe black can keep the corner. Maybe black can keep the right part of the board above the line 10.  To do both, to have two goals at the same time, that is very hard work.]

;B[sm];W[ol];B[pm];W[pn];B[om];W[qf];B[qg];W[pg];B[og];W[ph]
C[RW> as you can see, the black move R13 was not such a great move. It is probably lost.]
;B[pf];W[qe];B[qd];W[pe];B[of];W[rg];B[qh];W[qi];B[oe];W[pk]
;B[pj];W[qj];B[qk]C[RW> here is another escape for white into the center. See the openings P12 and P11. So for black it is important to close these openings. 

RW> The example with the fire shows, that the proper way to stop white from escaping into the center, is O12 and O11. So even if white plays P12, with O12 in place white can not go any further than that. By playing O12, black can expect white to play P11 and still have TIME to play O11. So it is about counting time in terms of "how many moves away" should i play?]
;W[oj];B[oi];W[pi];B[oh]C[RW> Excellent closure by black];W[nk]
;B[nl];W[pj];B[ok];W[rk];B[sl];W[sk];B[sn];W[rj];B[qq];W[pr]
;B[rq];W[rr];B[sp]C[RW> excellent move by black. Black has now created a living group with two eyes at S4 and T5.]
;W[qr];B[sq];W[nk];B[re];W[rf];B[ok];W[rd];B[nk]C[RW> black should continue the KO game with S17 instead of playing O9. The one stone that he might gain is no comparison to the tens of points he looses by letting white escape to S17 etc.]

[aa]C[RW> both players played very well. Black has a large portion of the center; white has most of the side area.

 - - - you are both doing wonderful !
