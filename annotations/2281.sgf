C[This game is from round 5 of the Toyota-Denso cup in Brisbane, Australia.]
;B[jj];W[pd];B[dp];W[po];B[dc];W[ci];B[qg];W[jp]C[Maybe playing at the top left corner is more urgent right now - see variation.]

(;B[nf]C[Alex: I don't understand this move!

Christian: Well, I also don't understand it - black cannot expect to build a moyo on the right side.]
;W[nc]
(;B[rd];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb]C[Too slow! Locally the correct answer is S18, but extending along the upper side is much better.
S18 would be good if there is a possibility to attack black on the right side (not in this position).]
;B[pq];W[qq]C[This looks strange! If you want to make use of K4, you should play from the other side, for example at O3 or P3.]
;B[qp]C[Alex: I think this is a mistake by black.

Yes!];W[pp];B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[oq]C[This is an important move, the result is unbearable for black.]
;B[pr];W[rp];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq]TR[nf][qg][jj]C[Alex: I think this has worked out well for me, but I have two questions:

1.  Black's stones at the bottom are only just alive: can I make any useful forcing moves against them?

2.  How can I best use the wall that I've just built?

Christian: You already used your wall to neutralize the marked stones. You should not rush to make an extension and try to surround territory with it. 

Black has to play at T2 (or N2) to live. After T2, there are no more forcing moves.

You should be happy with the result!];B[pe]C[??? This is very strange.]

(;W[qk]C[Alex: I was tempted to try and kill the group at the bottom, but I was afraid of things getting too complicated: see variation.

Christian: Chicken! I don't think the variation is that hard to read out! Even if you cannot read it, you should _feel_ T2 is the correct move. 
Apart from that, don't try to use your thickness to build territory - C15 would still have been better.]
;B[od]C[Aji-keshi.];W[oc];B[qd];W[nd];B[pc];W[pb];B[df]C[A low shimari would be better.]
;W[jc];B[hd]
(;W[cl]C[Alex: what happens if I play C6 instead? (variation)

Christian: C6 would be asking for trouble.
Now you have good a continuation at B14.];B[gq];W[cq]C[Good.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[ep];B[fq];W[bp]
(;B[eo]C[Alex: I think this was a mistake for black.

Christian: Yes!];W[bo];B[fp]C[I still cannot see why black wins the game. White is clearly ahead.]
;W[je]C[You should play B14 first.];B[ib];W[jb];B[ic]C[Alex: I had trouble deciding my next move.  What do you recommend here?

Christian: Apart from the still lethal T2 B14 would have been very big.]
;W[kk]LB[gg:b][nh:a][ii:c][fn:d][mr:e]C[Alex: I think this was a mistake: the territory I get is too small.  What do you think of one of A-E instead?

Christian: Yes, L9 is too small. Black has only one territory at the upper left - that's why B14 would be important. All black groups (except the one at the lower right) are strong - so yo cannot expect to be able to get that many point from your moyo. 
To be honest, none of the moves A-E would come to my mind.]
;B[ok]C[So finally black starts to make good moves?!];W[pm]
C[Alex: this feels too defensive, but I wasn't sure what to do instead.

Christian: Well - if you are not a moyo player (which is ok, I don't like building moyos either), you should not play moves like L9. If you had not played L9, Q7 would have been ok - these moves just don't fit together.]

;W[db]C[R11 is very big now - compare this to black playing R10!!

Locally, this also looks wrong. If you want to live in the corner, C17 is better. But I don't think a deep invasion is necessary or good. Instead, you are starting to loose the game!]
;B[cc];W[gf]C[This move is ok - it threatens to set D18 in motion.]
;B[fe];W[fg]C[Zero points!];B[rj]C[Touch√©! Compare this to white R11!]
;W[rk];B[qj];W[sj];B[pl]C[A surprise.  But surely there is a better response than what follows?

Christian: I would answer at R7 - I don't see why it shouldn't work.]

(;W[ol]C[Alex: is there a better move here? e.g, see variation

Christian: Q9 is _not_ better, but R7 is.];B[pk];W[pj];B[pi]
;W[ri];B[qi];W[rm];B[ql];W[rl];B[rh];W[qm]C[Alex: I thought the game was still close at this point.  Can you make some comments about the endgame?

My estimate of the territory now:

White: top side 12, left 20, right 30, total 62
Black: top left 35, right 30, bottom 5, total 70

so I'm a bit behind but it's still worth fighting on.

Christian: Well, if you play T2, all is different ...
But the strange thing is that black's right side got as big as your's - this should not have happened!]
;B[lj];W[im]C[Well, such moves are much smaller than they may look. 
This moves expands your territory, but there is not black one it reduces. Compare this to B14!]
;B[mr]C[Finally black lives with sente ...];W[lq];B[dh]C[I would have preferred B13.]

(;W[mc]C[Why do you play here? I don't see a threat.
A15, J19, T2 (still better than M2), S2 and D2 are the big points now. If O15 was gote, you should not have played it.]

;W[dn];B[en];W[dm];B[ip];W[jq];B[io]C[Mistake!]

Christian: I don't think you (or your opponent) overlooked a move for black - I don't think there is any.
You cannot expect alway to be able to read out a fight (others may think different than I do :-) - sometimes you have to trust your judgement what has to be the correct move or if you can try to kill or not.]
