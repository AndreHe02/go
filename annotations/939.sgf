C[Summary:  you get off to a poor start in this fuseki,
with a slow development.  Then it seems you fear black's moyo almost too
much and invaded deeper than was wise.  Follow that with some misplayed
fighting that caused your group's death and it's pretty easy to see how
you lost this game.];B[pp];W[pd];B[co];W[dc];B[dq];W[ce];B[jq]
;W[ic];B[pj]C[This fuseki
doesn't feel right for white.  Both star point stones wanted the
extension to q|r10, but black got there.  r14 is small compensation, but
almost feels necessary to prevent pressure on the 4-4 stone.

But it isn't.  C10 is the move here.  Once you've divvied up the board
to top and bottom, with roughly equal formations. the side extensions
become miai.  You can't let black have both of them, or as you saw
later, you end up fighting uphill.]
(;W[qf];B[cj];W[lc]LB[oc:B][jf:C]TR[ic]C[At this point, black has control of a much greater
board area.  All black's stones are working well, white's appear a bit
out of joint.    I think White 12 might be better at  B.  That almost completely secures the corner.  The marked stone then
relates loosely to strong positions on either side and doesn't need
reinforcement.

Another good possibility for W12 is in the neighborhood of C, which
starts to develop more of a competing moyo for white.  12 is small scale
without securing much in the way of certain profit.  This kind of
extension should be held off until it is necessary (the triangled white
stone is pressured), or can be used to attack a weak black group
(double meaning).];B[nq]LB[jo:B][cq:C][jj:A][dk:E][qq:F][bo:D]
TR[cj]C[Your next move 14 at 'a'
is too defensive.

If black were to invade at r17 right now, it would help you, not hurt
you.    It would help you even more if you expanded your moyo or did some
reduction of black's.  A move near tengen would not be crazy though it
feels out of shape with your own stones.  A cap at B is probably too
deep.    You should seriously consider the shoulder hit at E.  This is probably
the best place to start a reduction.   If you want to be a bit more aggressive, some sort of probe of one of
black's formations could probably be appropriate for your next move.    I think the 3/3 at F is premature.  C or D look like the right spot.
You are looking to either grab a small life (maybe something in ko that
you'll wait to play out), or sacrifice some stones to develop a sabaki
position that springs back against the triangled black stone.

The idea is that you make black choose which way to go early, when you
play the probe.  If black chooses to defend the corner, you sacrifice
and attack the triangled stone.  If black  protects the outside and
leaves you aji in the corner, then you play the shoulder hit at E
(since you won't have an attack on that stone), and can go back to the
corner later.

These sorts of probe are fairly high level, if you're not confident of
coming out with a good result, the shoulder hit is simple and works
well.]
(;W[qc]TR[lc][qf]C[I hope from the last screen you can see why 14 is
problematic.  It's not quite a wasted move because you do eliminate some
corner aji, but note that because of the two marked stones, black
already could not invade and live uconditionally.  That makes this
smaller than it otherwise appears.];B[qn]LB[qp:B][qo:A][ej:D]
[nj:C][jn:E][cg:F][ee:G]C[I don't like this 15.  It
feels as though it's trying to secure the corner but stretch a bit to
get closer to the q10 stone.  But this is neither fish nor fowl.  It
neither secures the corner completely, nor connects to the side stone
(A 3,3 invasion still gets a ko).

I would prefer A or B to secure the corner, but probably moves at C, D
or E are superior.  F is not bad.  A cap at G, tengen, or a direct
invasion would also be options for
black.];W[gq]LB[dk:A][eo:B][jj:C][jn:D][dr:F][cq:G][cp:H][bo:I]
TR[cj]C[This looks
awfully deep.

Normally one makes this kind of invasion when you can imagine getting to
freedom, or a helping hand (in the form of friendly stones) a bit
quicker than I can see happening here.  Basically you're begging to be
strongly attacked, and it looks like the attack can be very effective.
You want to build a base with something like A-D before coming in low
like this.

Remember, black is *very* strong here, if he answers a move like D at
16, you can be quite satisfied to have limited black's potential with a
kikashi.  The danger of D is not that black will take 16, but he will
instead surround and attack D!

To invade here, you want to start with a limiting play to develop nearby
friendly groups, or a probing play to create some aji to work with.
Probes at F-I are all possible, and may result in something that will
help make an attack on the triangled stone, or a firmer sabaki on the
lower side around 16
possible.];B[hq]LB[jo:A][eo:B][ip:D]C[17 is a mistake.  White has wandered into the lion's den and deserves
to be strongly attacked.  Do not touch what you are attacking.

A,B,D, and c are all much stronger attacks for black than 17.

Note many variations for your next move.]
(;W[gr]LB[hr:A][hp:B][go:C][eq:D]C[18 is a bigger mistake.  This is the death move right here.  I
don't know that white *should* die even now, but you certainly aren't
helping your cause.    This stone strongly connects, but does nothing to develop eyeshape.  Who
is attacking who?  When you are strong, keep your stones connected and
eyeshape will take care of itself.

When you are weak, eyeshape is everything, and you will jettison
unimportant stones on a moment's notice to help you out.  Connecting
your stones strongly is a liability until you know which stones are
important and which are not.

Here, you are weak -- play contact, and be willing to leave cutting
points, as long as you can play around them.   Attach too many stones together solidly, and your group becomes heavy if
it does not already have eyeshape.

A-D are all possibilities.  I'm not certain which is best, but I can
guarantee you that they are all better than 18, which was probably the
losing move in this game.   Even if black doesn't kill you, going down
makes it easy to confine you to a low position on the side.   Unless you
can make quick eyeshape (which the hane at A or the contact jump at D
would help with), black will surround you in sente, and even if you
live, you will come out way behind.

Go back to see variations.];B[gp]MA[hp]C[If
b19 has a weakness it is the cutting point at X.

The low play at 'a' is not the way to put pressure on it.  The hane at b
or the direct cut are the approaches I'd try.]
(;W[hr];B[iq]C['a' here (W22) is a definite mistake.  You still have
some pressure to apply at b.  22 applies no pressure, black can block
directly with no cutting points.  And he doesn't even have to!   
What do you gain by playing a?  1 point? The second line is known as the
line of defeat for a reason.  Play it before the endgame only when it
has a big effect on connectivity or eyeshape.  Here it is pure aji keshi
even if black makes the expected response.  It adds nothing to eyeshape,
and if you live, the monkey jump would be a better endgame move.]

(;W[ir];B[fq]C[With 24, what were you thinking?  6 in a row on the
second line is dead, so there's no way this can live unless you break
through the constraint.  Either cut, clamp or do whatever you can to
confuse things, or play elsewhere and hope you can find a way to use the
aji.

Playing a just gives black more security in the capture and you less aji
to aim toward later.];W[fr];B[eq];W[er]C[Again, 26 pushes into a clean,
no hane block.  The sort of bend black makes with 27 is the acme of good
thick shape.  Don't induce moves like this from your opponent -- make
them spend a proactive move to do it. I've heard teachers call this sort
of move (like pushing in a line toward an enemy stone) banging your
head against the enemy.  Stop doing that to your stones, it hurts
them.];B[dr];W[jr];B[kr];W[kq];B[lr];W[hp];B[kp];W[qi]LB[ql:B]
[on:C][nj:D][ri:E][rh:F]C[34 is another example of an exchange that tends to
be good for your opponent.  This is, at best, a territorial move, which
eliminates the aji of an invasion at B.  You can't play B directly, but
if you got some stones in the right place it could be very strong.

Once black plays 35, an invasion at B is pretty much out of the
question.  Only local moves can make it a threat.  For this reason
playing 34 and inviting b35 is a mistake.  This exchange should be
played only when the invasion at B is not ever likely to give a good
result -- for instance if there were a black stone around C or D.

Even as a purely territorial move, E or F is probably
better.];B[qj];W[pi]C[Recognize this
situation.  This is black's mistake rather than yours, but it's worth
looking at.  Whenever you see a line of stones side by side like this,
look to press the advantage with a hane.    The only excuse for playing straight ahead is that the cut is dangerous.
But don't just assume it is -- read it out, especially where you are
strong, like black is here.]
(;B[oj]LB[oi:A]C[37 should be a hane at A go back for variations.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[pr];B[or]
(;W[ps]C[44 is a mistake.  You should play for ko with b.  Also black 45
is a bigger mistake.  black 'b' will kill you unconditionally.]

(;B[os];W[rr];B[rp];W[rq];B[ro];W[qs]
(;B[lq]C[b 51 is unnecessary as black can make the ladder local (go
back and see the b variation).  If b were pro, I might consider it an
invitation for you to resign, but this may just have been nervousness
about preserving a large lead.

It does reduce aji.  That black considered this more important than
anything else tells you how big he thinks his lead is.

He was correct. If anything you do better than black for the rest of
this game, but still lose by 30
points.];W[oi];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi];W[mh];B[li];W[ch];B[lh];W[lf]
LB[ei:A]C[
Black next move is very suspect.  A move at A, the junction line between
your two moyos is very large.  Locally 61 doesn't feel right either,
since it bangs into your stone.

You should probably also have played A in preference to 60.]
;B[lg]C[a is bad shape.  b is the better way to defend here.]

(;W[mg];B[kf];W[le];B[ke];W[eh]TR[ei]LB[ei:A]C[Good instinct, but A is
better.  Press the junction line between you and
black.];B[kd];W[kc];B[ld];W[md];B[id];W[hd];B[ie];W[ge];B[he]
;W[gc];B[gf];W[fe];B[ej]LB[jh:B]C[W 80 (a) is
ridiculously deep.  B is a nice weak point to aim at.  I recommend
playing reduction.  Something like 'b' gives you an idea.

Black has given you a *lot* of secure territory (more than was
necessary by far).  If you can be effective with reduction, you could
get back into this game, but w80 gives the initiative right back to
black by giving him a weak group to attack.]

[ol][pl][ml][ll][kl][jl][il][hl][gl][fl][el][ek]C[black 97 is silly.  That
stone is unimportant.  Stopping the thrust of the white reduction is far
more important.  b does that.

You, with 96 nearly concede the game to an alert black.

You need to be counting the score here.  See that black needs only
defend the area I've marked to win, even if you can capture the marked
stones (only if black makes a huge mistake).  This count assumes you
get every points you could possible claim in the endgame, and doesn't
give black anything that isn't 100% firmly his if you let him play
defensively.

Clearly, you are too far behind to play safe now.  Face the fact that
you will be cut off and play for a big life in the middle of black's
area.  It's the only way you can possibly win now.  
Play 'b' or a point around there, with an aim toward playing C and D.
If you can get both of those in sente and then a shape move, you might
have a shot.

It's a long shot, but at this point, your only real
shot.]

They are flexible and in the open, and can see your main stones.  Once
secure, they make a good base to launch invasions in black's moyo.
You've also traded a few points of secure territory on the side for a
fairly significant limit on black's moyo potential.

Now moves like A and B that looked dangerously deep before, are good
followups.  An invasion around C might work now as well.

I think you're still a bit behind here since black has the initiative,
but you would definitely be within striking distance.  Much better than
in the game.])

you gain little more than a weak group to worry about here.  Black's

on the rest of the game assuming it survives.  If it dies, the game is
over.  If it takes too many moves to live, and black is smart about
securing territory or influence while attacking,the game will also be
over.

But black still looks good.  You have just escaped, but he has secured
