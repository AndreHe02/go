C[Reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to review this game, I'm playing as black and would like any tips and variations you might have. In particular, if you can comment on my fuseki I would greatly appreciate it. I feel like I'm in a slump with regard to my playing strength and can't seem to get past this barrier, currently 11kyu for me.]

TR[jc][kc][jd][kd]C[I figured this would be good to have a nice shimari and a wide shimari on the opposing side

------------------------------------------------------------

Seems ok, but i prefer one of the triangled points because these are extensions from a shimari.]
;W[cd]C[I wasn't expecting this and thought that I would just try to stay connected and have outward influence

-------------------------

Very bad move from white because it will provide a great influence for black.]
;B[de];W[dd];B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[eb];B[fb];W[db];B[fe]C[Very good for black]
;W[bf];B[be]C[this seems bad, how do I make use of that wall I've built? maybe at L16?]
;W[cc]C[Look at the alternatives ...]
(;B[fd]C[I thought white G16 would be bad for me, to protect maybe I should have played G16 myself?

-------------------------------------------------------

Very slow and bad move :(   Don't fear of g16. 

Use your thickness to attack...

Look at the alternatives];W[qm];B[kd];W[jp]C[Look at the board now! White began to control the board. It's because of your slow move L16.]
;B[qh]C[Feels slow to me, white looks so huge on the bottom now!

R 11 is better i think!];W[bg];B[qk];W[ce];B[df];W[cg];B[np]
C[I felt like I needed to make something happen and thought this would be interesting atleast.

-------------------

Yes you're right but i' prefer n4];W[op]C[This spooked me, didn't know how to respond.. attach, hane.. or attach, extend?
------------------------------------------

Your aim is to reduce the white moyo so ...]
(;B[no]C[o5 is slow , i guess.];W[qg];B[ph];W[pg]
(;B[rd]C[I had visions of white playing this probe and connected to his R13 group
-----------------------------

look at the alternative pls.];W[ng]
(;B[kg]C[thought I should put pressure on white and this seemed to work well with my thickness on the left, is this good?
------------------------------
Maybe after P12 - p13 exchange. BUt the problem is that o4 stones are very week...]

did you read L7 move also?]

;W[gj];B[hl]C[So at the end of the review ( i hope it's useful) i have little sugests :

- Don't use your thickness for territory...
- Don't let your stones week and without base at the fuseki stage (o4 stones case.)

FOr this game i think you managed good at the end, but this is because of your opponent who played very gently :)

See you,
