C[hi :¡³
I'm 10k* at CTN.I seldom play there now.Anyway,I'll try my best to review your game because this is the first time I do reviews.I'll skip in opening,because opening depeng on your own style and interest. I will attempt to give you some advice, but i still make quite a few mistakes.  I will try to give you the best advice(if I can).  The variations that I include might not be the best alternatives, but they are some possibilities that occured to me.  The feasibility of some variations depends on your opponent's response.    Please feel free to email me with any questions at  xinhai1911@hotmail.com.
(because you did not include any questions or comments here)
OK?---xinhai];B[po];W[dp];B[de]C[untill now,I can sense that black is going to bbuild a big influenceinstead of territory. Because black plays at 1 and 3.]
;W[pq]C[If you are capaple of fighting,you should play around Q16. If not,you should play your 2 around D16 first,then wait for black response,if black still play at 2,you can play Q16,it's better.]
;B[qd]C[Black is bigger.];W[oc]C[I would play P16 if you want to play here.If can ,you should play at N4 or O4,at least I prefer todo so.]
;B[pf]C[good too,to secure the right side. Normally at N16 or M16,you can also try M17 or N17.]

(;W[ec]C[you should try around M17.See variation.];B[cc];W[gd]
C[finally,good too but a little slow for white.But D16(star point) is better.]
;B[ci];W[cn];B[np]C[as i said before,N4 or O4 is important, you should move there first. Now,black takes the initiative to attack white.]
;W[qp]C[fine,to protect your territoryat the lower right.];B[jq]
;W[gq];B[kc]C[Black intrude,big move.];W[mc];B[ke]C[black jump out, white is being attacked now.]

(;W[gf]C[not good, I think. At least try R9 or R10. See variation.]
;B[pk]C[Big move]
(;W[gi]C[no,try invading black at D13 seems better . See variation.]
;B[pc];W[ne];B[qo];W[nr]C[O3 is better];B[lq];W[jj]C[Try C9 instead. It help to prevent black to play at C8.]
;B[cl];W[gl]C[E8 is better. This can stop black from coming out and enlarge it's territory.]

;B[co];W[bp]C[too late now.];B[cm];W[cp];B[an]C[Overall,Black plays better than white.
White was behind from the start of game. White should always concentrate on the whole game while playing. Every move must relate to each other.
     White also have several mistakes to overcome. Black also lose the chance to kill white group in the early.  Maybe a good openings and strategies book is helpful for you.
     Doing live and dead question everyday can help you to improve. Studying others' reviews is very important too.
     Because I've agree to do the review,so eventhough I'm in rush of time,I still try my best to help you. Therefore, I can't deny that I made some mistakes here. If you have different suggestion, write to me,OK?
     Wish you have a good time in learning and playing Go. See you *^o^*]
