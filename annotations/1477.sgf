;B[qd]C[Hi, Thank you for reviewing the game.
This was a game a friend and me played through e-mail, I played black, and though in the end I lost big, I thought I wasn't doing that bad during the game.

My friend and me are both 2 - 4 month beginners of the game, and wanting to learn more!

We want to know if we counted right (Komi 6,5) A White win by 33,5 ?

So thanks :-)

----------------------------------------

Hi! I am the reviewer, a 11 Kyu on KGS (online go server). I will try my best to give you useful help and comments on this game. Since you say that your opponent is a friend, I will try to give a few helpful hints for white as well so you can share it with him/her. I am Dutch myself, as are you. However since a lot of the common terms used in the world of Go are English (Knight's move, shortage of liberties) I have decided to review in English. Should you have need of a Dutch translation, then I can provide it.

First off, with 6,5 komi the count of white win by 33,5 is indeed correct.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[di]LB[kc:D][jd:B][kd:C][dj:A]C[[black\] All game I wondered if this move should've been somewhere else.

The most common extention of a stone on the star point (B16) is one on the .....point (A or B). The main reason for this is that it's nice halfway between your star point stone and white's star point stone (on D4), with you making potential for the bigger half of that side of the board. This is by no means territory yet, but could develop as such in the future. Generally sticking to these type of extentions from the star point is fine.

Worth mentioning here is that a move on C or D would give you the Chinese opening. This is a pretty common opening in professional games. The placing on C or D has to do with the relation between the D16 and R16 stone.

Remember that it's really hard to give value to moves in the opening, since the game is still very open. All in all your move was not bad, but would perhaps have been more suited on A.]

(;B[oh]LB[nh:A]C[[black\]: Was this an ok move ?

It depends really on what you were trying to accomplish with it. By the looks of it you tried to keep white to the side while building up a wall for yourself on the outside. For that, this move was not as much suited. White shows this lateron by walking right through the gaps. In general during the game I think you try to keep your opponent in too much with close moves. It is far easier to keep your opponent in with moves that take a little distance from his position. For keeping white in, a stone at A would've been better.

[See Variation\]];W[og];B[ng];W[ph];B[rf]LB[pk:A][qk:B]TR[pe]
[nf][nh]C[It seems here you are too severely trying to attack white with contact moves, while your own groups are not secure at all. You have a great number of weaknesses (marked with triangles) that white can make use of. Remember that Go is not about killing groups, but about making territory.

Aside from this, if you should even manage to properly attack white's eye space, he can always jump out to A or B and live.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[pe]
(;B[od]LB[pd:B][oe:A]TR[od]C[Whenever white starts crawling through what you believe is your territory, the main idea is to let him crawl while making strong positions on both sides of where he crawls. Try to get your stones on both sides of him to stick together and make a good shape. The marked stone only allows white to seperate you into more unsecure groups, which you can't all keep alive at the same time in the end.
Placing this stone at A or B would've given you a better result.

;B[qb];W[pb];B[pa]LB[ne:C][qg:B][rg:A]C[With this move you give away sente and the initiative to white. A better way to ensure life is to play at A, threatening to cut at B. White responds at B, black lives and has sente to close and strengthen his position at for instance, C.]
;W[oa];B[qa];W[ne];B[md];W[me]
(;B[mh]C[[Black\] I wondered if this move was the one in which I lost the N16 group...

After white M15, both the N16 and the O14 group are being attacked. Saving one would be getting the other one into trouble. I believe it's more important to see that you should not have let it come to this situation by playing more solidly and closing the gaps while you can. If you would have chosen to save the N16 group, then white could easily exploit the weaknesses of the O14 group.

;B[mi]C[[Black\] at this time i was quite pleased with the wall forming, but (As I saw later in the game) when should i have done something about that big area in the bottom ?

Usually when your opponent has a strong framework as white has here along the bottom of the board, it is wise to first fight in other areas and gain power and influence which you can then use to invade. The black wall you have just formed provides a 'base of attack'. You could now invade somewhere near the white stones and run away with your invading stone to the center.]
;W[pj];B[kb]LB[cd:D][cm:A][mp:B][qq:C]C[I think at this move it is important to mention that you have to keep trying to make the biggest move (the one worth the largest amount of points). While closing white in may be worth a few points (no more than 10), making a framework for your territory is worth much much more. Consider for example extending to A, invading at B, invading the corner at C or closing your own corner at D. All these moves are worth far more than the move you made here.

When things settle down a bit in the fight like it has done here (white has won the life or death struggle), you should force yourself to look for the biggest move on the board.]
;W[ma];B[ja];W[la];B[le];W[na];B[jb];W[lf];B[ke];W[mf]
(;B[kg]LB[kf:A][jg:B]C[Again this move lacks in solidity. Consider A, or perhaps even better, B.

(;B[bp]C[While the pusing moves were good for black to form territory (even though white also got some on the bottom), this move is worth relatively little. Black is making a framework, and he should continue trying to build one while at the same time threatening to invade white's framework or territory.

(;W[np]C[For white: The same is true for white as is for black. Try to take a bit more distance when trying to hold back a crawling enemy and it will be much easier to keep him in. This is especially true in this situation where you can afford to be split into two since both groups are alive anyway.

C[[Black\] I was worried about whites invasion into the terriroty How could I have handled it better?

Well in fact this is a pretty good move to take care of the invasion. It takes some distance, and as you can see from the following moves white has no real chance of crawling through.]
;W[ei];B[ej];W[dh];B[ch];W[eh];B[dj]C[Goal accomplished. Nice work.]

C[[Black\] No good response?

Well actually the invasion white made is quite unreasonable. Clearly there is never going to be enough room to make life there for himself, so all he can do is run his invading stone to any weaknesses that are in your barrier. However, there are no real weaknesses here right now.

The response is good, although the next two moves white made could have easily been ignored since they posed no real threat against you.]

;W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[sf];W[sh];B[im];W[he];B[gf];W[co]C[I know it must have been hard to see this coming, but indeed white took good use of the insecureness of the position. If you recognize the weaknesses after white's move, then you should consider the situation carefully. Since you could not save both the E5 and B5 group, it would've been better to sacrifice one of them and keep the losses to a minimum.

C[Overall a pretty good and even game. I think it's important to note three things for black as main improvement points:

1. When defending against an invading/crawling enemy group try to keep your distance when defending. This will give you more time to build up a solid wall to withstand the invader, instead of laying loose bricks in his path that are easily taken.

2. Try to keep making the biggest move on the board. Don't waste your sente/initiative on small moves that are worth little points. Instead, try to build up a framework that could lead to territory.

3. Don't get too caught up in a single fight. Once the main battle has been settled, then don't continue it just for the sake of it. Instead try to find other areas that may prove more profitable.


I hope this review has been helpful to you.])
