C[SM - Hey there,



This is a game I played online recently against someone around the same strength as me. I made an early decision to take a large lower left corner for the sake of central influence - I think I gave away a little more than what I should have, and spent the rest of the game trying to catch up (lost by about 15 points). Mostly interseted in a couple of middle game moves and corner mistakes



Thanks in advance,

Shaun

Hi Shaun,

As I usually do with reviews, I'll go through once just giving my overall impressions, then go through again giving a more through analysis and 'cheating' with the use of joseki dictionary and the like.  I use this approach because the first pass can help to give you an idea of what I'm looking at and what you should be looking at in a game, while the second pass helps to correct any errors I make.]
PL[B];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]
(;W[dj]C[Answering san-ren-sei with san-ren-sei is ok, but most people have more success with an immediate approach (O17 is by far the most popular).

san-ren-sei is an extremely fast fuseki, and so your move allows black to continue developing at a fast pace.]
;B[jd];W[nq]C[This move makes me a little uncomfortable.  Black must pincer, and white is left with three stars versus five.  I'm not saying it is wrong (it isn't), just that you will have to be careful in the next few moves.]
;B[kp]C[Right.  M3 is also good here, but L4 follows K16, trying to take another star.]
;W[no]C[--
(second pass) I now think this move is wrong, and it should be R3.  Since L4 is far and high, white cannot put much pressure on it (J4 is obvious but black just jumps).  So, white will give black Q6 and get little compensation.]
;B[pn];W[pr]C[--
(Second pass).  Obviously this move is joseki, but I think it is wrong here.  Black's whole development so far has been to build a huge moyo and this joseki will give black that.]
;B[qq];W[kr]C[--
(second pass) here you could exchange O7 for Q8 and then pincer.  I think that way would be much more active and make for a less complicated game.  Having said that, pros have played L2 with K16 in place, but pros are very good at assessing balance.]
;B[nm]C[--
(second pass) black is happy];W[kq]C[SM - I have seen this move before as it strengthens White's position on the lower side; however, maybe I needed to play something like M5?
--
I consider L3 too slow this early in the fuseki, I think you should deal with the upper right.  Obviously, without L3 the LR will get hedged in easily by black.

(second pass) nobody in my database of games has played in the LR for the next move, they all swap to the UR with either R14 or O17.]
;B[ln]C[SM - This seemed a bit bold to me, but when I tried to cut it, I think I was let off the hook a few times
--
Personally I would not cut it.  That's not to say the cut won't work, but the aji there isn't going to go away, so I would play elsewhere being mindful of the cut.  The reason is that if white gets a stronger position in the lower left then the cut will be much more severe but if you cut now, black can either sacrifice or live easily.

(second pass) swap to R14 now.  The weakness of L6 will cause black problems eventually and it will help justify the solid L3 move.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[lo]
(;B[kn]C[SM - Maybe L5 would be better?
--
I don't think so. Black is developing an excellent moyo while white is getting fifth line territory.  White's stones are overconcentrated.  L5 would leave too many cutting points]
;W[ko]
(;B[nn]C[--
Small error, this is ajikeshi];W[mo]
(;B[jp]C[SM - I think K5 is better?
--
K4 is awful, I would play K6 myself rather than K5, but K5 is much better than K4.]
;W[jo];B[jn]C[--
Black appears to realise his mistake];W[io]
(;B[in]C[--
This move is a little crude.  I would play H7 instead.];W[hn]
C[SM - I wasn't sure if extending blacks wall was a good thing here, considering the three stones in the upper left corner, though it did give me the lower left
--
This is fine];B[hm]
(;W[gn]C[--
G6 should be at G7];B[gm];W[fn]C[SM - Wasn't sure if I could hane here?
--
You can];B[fm];W[em];B[fc]C[--
Ok.

I would spend a long time on this move.  This move is key because black is one move away from getting an unbeatable position.  If you simply answer F17, you will probably lose the game.  I guess this is the key point you wanted to know how to spot at the start.

Black's just staked out a moyo that clearly encompasses over half the board.  Further, white's lower side is easily invadeable (san-san for a start, and F3).

White's upper left is weak and black can destroy it in one move.  With the K16 star in place, simply answering D14 will lead to black taking sente (D16, D18, C17, tenuki) so is probably undesirable.

R17 is still open but playing it will destroy most of the remaining aji.

So, my thought process is: White absolutely cannot defend the lower side or else white will get too far behind.  White cannot play an ordinary answer to F17 or black will get sente. So, white can either try a joseki for sente in the upper left or ignore F17 and invade directly.

The logical joseki for sente is attach & extend since it threatens black's moyo.  But K16 in place makes this undesirable.  Similarly, H17 can be discarded since black will take a suboptimal result in the corner in exchange for wapping up H17 which is too painful for white.

So, white must invade.  Since R17 is insufficient, R14 seems best.  A couple light reduction moves to start may also be a good plan, say K14.

(second pass) R14 is the most popular approach in my database here too.]

(;W[df];B[qg]C[SM - At this stage, the game looks better for black. Strong right side, and large central influence.
--
Yes.  That is why I wouldn't play R13.  Incidentially, I think R13 would have been better at R15.

Ok, white now has an approach on the UR star, or else sealing the UL.  C3 feels too small (just).

I would approach the UR star.  The reason is that it is invading black's prize moyo and so black will end in gote.  As for a point, O17, Q17, P18 and Q18 are the points that spring to mind.  I think I'd go for P18.

(second pass) According to my database, M17 (or N17) is how to approach such a huge moyo.  It is not a move I would have thought of.]

(;W[gk]C[SM - Trying to work on that central influence - maybe an invasion aroung N16 would be better? but it would be hard to run without some support
--
Invasion is clearly necessary but I do not like N16 since black has N7 etc.  Fourth line invasions are for when you have somewhere to run to, third line is for when you must live internally.  Pros are much better at living inside moyos so would probably invade higher than me.

I think G9 is quite good, though maybe not deep enough.  Finding the right answer is hard which is always the sign of a good move.]
;B[ik]
(;W[hi]C[--
I prefer J10 there, you are behind and need to push hard.  Also, since black has all his eggs in one basket you don't need to worry about furikawari.]
;B[ji];W[il]C[SM - I am not really sure if this whole exchange around this part of the center was worth it for me - I was hoping to "squeze into the black terrirotry"
--
This move is ok since black cannot play H9 and cut you (H9, H8, G8, J7, F8, F9)]
;B[im]
(;W[hk]C[H9 was not so important, you should treat J8 as a forcing move and tenuki, probably to K12]
;B[jl]C[--
K8 is poor.  imagine K9 instead.];W[ij];B[jk];W[jj]C[SM - Not sure if pushing here is good - leaves some bad points at J11
--
This is dubious, you fix some of black's aji while creating more elsewhere.  I would go straight to K12 since this move is sente should you decide you want L11 as a cutting point.]
;B[kj];W[kk]C[SM - Waste of a move
--
Worse than that, you allow black to fix L11.  Still, black made a mistake just a couple moves ago so it kind of balances out :)]
;B[lj];W[hd]C[SM - At this point, black is still ahead, even if I take the whole left side
--
H16 is the wrong technique to cut black here.  Further, the UL is still open, P18 is still open, and so is C3.

I would start with K12 (sacrifice the J10 stones), then D18 to force H16, then P18 to live in the UR in sente, then C3 in gote.  If you get them all, the game will still be close.

Note that black C10 lives.]
(;B[db]C[SM - Not sure if this is the right move as H16 ends up being in a nice place after the joseki

--
There is nothing wrong with D18, though I think C17 is better.

(second pass) I think I was wrong first time.  D18 should be H17.  It is simpler and works well here.]

This is a big mistake by black.  Black has a first class territory there and should just give up a small center.]

NO! :-)

S17 is not enough to live, and getting just one eye is not important.  More relevant, you need the aji of S15 to threaten Q15.  You should play P17 instead.]

Close in the end, 89.5 vs 88 so a very high scoring game.

You win by 1.5 with a komi of 5.5.  Since komi is supposed to be 6.5 now, but black lost a point at S6, 1.5 seems about right.

I guess the key mistake you made was playing joseki and allowing black to form a coherant plan.  This came up first in the LR where your choice of joseki gave black a wonderful moyo, and second in the UL where you answered black's kikari allowing black to play R13 and seal the game.  After the fuseki you were clearly behind.

Also, if you had pushed a little harder as black waled along L6 etc, you could have got a lot more compesation for the huge moyo.  This would have made the result in early chuban a little closer and so a less radical plan would have been ok.

However, you did an excellent job of recovering with the sacrifice of the corner and overall I think you deserved your win.]
