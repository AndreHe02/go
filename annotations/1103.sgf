bobc [?\]: right.

Yes, no really big blunder. That's why I would like to say some words about strategy at the end, and not about tactics. What I want to stress first is: Stay away from strength, like I explained at move #149. I know that this is very difficult, because it means granting your opponent some territory, if it is his strength. Some! You always grant him less than what he could get from attacking your stones when they are too weak. This is the art of applying this proverb.

The other point is: Stay connected. If you look at the end position now: b has 5 groups and w has 3. Having less groups is better than having more, because for every group you have to worry about eyes. One example of this is move #57.]
)
(;W[qk]C[w can now directly invade and give you some trouble.

Staying away from strength means both: Staying away from own strengths, because playing near it makes your stones overconcentrated. And staying away from the other's strengths, because it will make your stones a target of attack, like here.]

(;B[qk]LB[qh:A][qn:B]C[This invasion points seems to be better, because you can make a base for this stone at either, 'A' or 'B'. So, it cannot come easiely under attack.]
