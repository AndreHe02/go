C[Okay! This game, I won by pure luck, but I have serious problems in the opening. Please point out the mistakes in the opening. ^^

I'll point out the mistakes and make comments as I see them.  My comments I'll label with a Z:]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq]
(;B[fp]LB[cn:C][dn:D][co:A][do:B]TR[fq]C[I tried to attack somehow but I think this was a wrong move.. Or was it good?

Z: Approaching like this is a bad choice of direction.  Typically when an opponent has a 3-4 (komoku) stone you want to approach from the wider side, a, b, c, and d are better approaches.  Also your stone is high on the fourth line so white can slip right below it.]

(;W[fq];B[gq]C[I did'nt knwo what to play, so I just tried a hane...]
;W[eq]
(;B[go]LB[gp:A][hp:B]C[Z:  a solid connection at A would be my preference.  Though B is also better then your move it has influence over the bottomt side, which is what black is hoping to develop in this position.]
;W[gm];B[jd]LB[fc:A][jd:E][cf:D][cj:C][qj:B][cm:F]TR[kq]C[Tried to get some territory in the north. XD

Z:  A-F are all big points but a triangle move at or near the triangle point is urgent.   Your stones at the bottom have kind of a funny shape and a move at C would help settle the stones, secure the side more, as well as extend from both sides.   Remember that stones are a burden unless they have a base so just grab a base before your opponent steals it from you.]
;W[hq]LB[fc:F][qf:E][cj:C][qj:B][qn:D][kq:A]C[Ouch. Will it die now?!

Z:  If both play right nothing will die.  White is correct that your shape is incomplete.  There are so many big points on the board I can't agree with whites timing.  I would play B if I were white.  Remember think BIG in the opening fight over influence over entire corners and sides there will be plenty of time to fight later.]

(;B[gr];W[hp]
(;B[hr]C[Or should I have played G4?!];W[ir];B[iq]LB[jq:A]C[Z: This cut doesn't work, white can capture it with a ladder at a immediately.]
;W[jr];B[ip];W[ho]
(;B[ep];W[co]LB[co:B][io:C][ep:A]C[Your move at A removes a liberty from strong stones and persuades white to take a big point.  So your move at A gains you one liberty in exchange for 8 or so spots of territory also white could just play at c and continue the fighting.]
;B[hn];W[io]
(;B[jp]C[Try to avoid making empty triangles.];W[kq];B[jo]C[Well.. I tried to make a ladder somehow.. :)

Z:  Magic is an ineffective way to remove liberties.];W[in]
;B[im];W[jn];B[kn];W[jm];B[jl]C[Ouch.. Souldn't have done that. What could I have done instead?

Z:  The best way to protect against this travesty is preventing it before it started.  See again the variations from black 9 and black 13.]
;W[hm];B[km];W[il];B[gp];W[gn];B[fn];W[fm];B[en];W[ko];B[kp]

(;W[qr]C[z: BIG MISTAKE for white.]
(;B[ik]C[Well.. Can you tell me how it is looking right now?!
Am I behind, or?!

z:  White r2 was a mistake.  But black failed to catch it.  It's not an easy problem, but you should have a look.]
;W[hk];B[jk]TR[ep]C[Z:  The urgent situation on the board is not building up more of your moyo by attacking a white strong group but for finding eyes for the marked group.   m1 is no doubt the best way to do that but there might be others.]

;B[aj];W[ch];B[al]LB[qc:B][qf:C][qi:D][rm:A]C[I lived because of whites mistakes.. How's it now?

Z:  It's easy to live with three points when you sacrifice nearly 25 points.   Look back at the exchange of 75 for 76 and consider whose mistake is more severe.  I still put white ahead in that your area of influence is easily invadable.]

Z:  the game is now over you won and congratulations.   The most important lesson you should learn here is:
Stones without a base work more against you then for you.  Therefore don't let your stones be attacked from the roots.  You had quite the travesty in the lower left corner and needed white to make mistakes in order to come back.  Conveniently white had those mistakes.  You should note that your two "winning" moves (marked) had proper counters.  It is an important part of the game at every level to punish opponents mistakes so good job with that, but do note the distinction between moves that ARE good and moves that ENDED good. Also there existed moves that both parties didn't see at m1 for instance off of move 61.  These are difficult moves to see and can only be found with practice at tsumego (life and death problems) and game experience.  With patience and effort you'll find things like that.   Keep it up!  Happy go journeys.]
