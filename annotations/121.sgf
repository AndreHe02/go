;B[dd]C[Hi,

My general feeling about the game:

White, who requested the review, has to learn about attack and defense:
First strengthen your group, then use it to attack your oponent.

Attacking doesn't necessarily means killing. While your oponent is concerned about saving his group, you can pursue another purpose (taking territory, building influence ,strengthening,...)

Look what black has built on the upper left while attacking white's left group!

Moreover, I think black is far better than 21k, at least in global view of the game...

I think you'd rather strengthen your group first
(see var)];B[dm];W[dl];B[cm];W[en];B[fo];W[gp]C[Protect the cut at E8!

White's bottom left group is not in danger.
But white's left side one is.  As we will see, a black cut at E8 would be disastrous for white...]
;B[bl];W[bk];B[bm];W[cj];B[el]C[ooops...]
(;W[fl]C[Mistake!
Capturing E8 stone looks difficult...
Instead, you are creating two weak white groups.
Now that black has cut, I would have played E9 and forgot about the E6 stones]

C[Now white has two weak groups.];W[ch];B[cg];W[bh];B[bg];W[di]
;B[eg];W[dk]C[OK, white left group is alive.
but it is worth, say, 4 points of territory  (!!!)  In the meantime, black has become very strong in the upper left.
Note that the G8 group is not secure yet.

Allowing your oponent to split your stones isn't a good idea!]

;B[hn];W[im];B[an]C[Black is definitely secure.];W[qk]C[The situation looks difficult for white now

What if black plays K16? He would become very very strong in all the upper side...

R9 is too slow.
Play K16 or K17 instead, or jump to R14];B[qg];W[nc]C[Too close to black stones.
It s easy for black to attack now.];B[nd];W[md];B[oc];W[nb]

C[Black is too strong here for white to attack successfully.
Again white has two weak groups (G17 and N17). The first thing is to secure them.

I suggest K15 instead of F16: even if white cannot capture the K17 stone, at least white can escape, while reducing black' moyo on the upper side.]
