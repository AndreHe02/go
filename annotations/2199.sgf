RE[B+2.5]

C[Hi, I'm Zooey playing white. This is a close game that I think I played reasonably well for me. ( Several blunders though;  I've been waiting for a fairly blunder-free game to submit, but I don't think its going to hapen any time soon. :) ) In general, I think my biggest weakness is reading tactics.

Many thanks for the review, and all who have put work into GTL. it's an amazing resource. This is the first game I've submitted, but I've read many.

Zooey,
   first I must say that my advice must be taken with a grain of salt. Only a high dan player can really give unshakable advice, and could analyze all the possible reprucussions of a suggestion that i make. I do hope my review helps your go.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]C[Z: I know almost no Joseki. I usually aproach the 4,4 at the 6-3 with my corner behind me. I'm not sure what to play if B takes 017 away with K16 here.

See variations. Invading inside an established moyo is obviously more difficult the more stones on that side your opponent has, but is still quite doable early on in the game]

(;B[pk]C[If you mean K16 here, to prevent o17, its still possible to invade at o17, just much more difficult. See variations]

(;W[nc]C[Or do you mean here, with this pincer?]
(;B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[jd]C[Z: I'm lucky and got to play what I know. I considered N15, D10, and K4 as alternatives.

D10 would've had black play around M17, and your two stones would be in a bit of trouble.  N15 might've ended up the same way, as your left side would be open and not thick. K16 is a good spot. L17 is the normal joseki because its safer, because black can still attack at m16/m17.]
;B[jp]
(;W[gq]C[good followup. The joseki move is actually at H3, but that seems very greedy, and also very open to later attacks to myself]
;B[cf];W[dh]C[Z: I let B get too much on the left. If my strategy to let B live small, would C11 be better?

Actaully, you got WAY too much in this  exchange. When B lost c17, you got almost the entire upper edge]
;B[bd]C[Here black made a pretty bad mistake. Blacks intention at the beginning is either to run and reuce your territory, or sneak under and grab the corner]
;W[cc]C[giving you this point, he has to run];B[bh]
(;W[cj]C[very good response. Not too shallow, and not overextensive. You couldn't expect to kill this black easily. If you played D14, he could've encroached deep into your left edge]
;B[ef]C[Now he has to run, but the defense you can make while doing so benefits you greatly]
;W[fe];B[eh];W[ei];B[fh];W[fi];B[hg]C[Blacks getting almost nothing, and giving you a wall on the left edge plus some thickness towards the middle.]

(;W[qn]C[Is this too early? I thought of C7 or C3 as alternatives.

It looks right for the situation. Playing C7 would've been a little too defensive and c3 is way too small. Its a nice spot. Only other place I could see would be around N3/N4 for a major reduction, or around q11 if you were looking for a good fight. Another one which is another comple joseki is q5.]
;B[qk];W[qp];B[qq];W[pp];B[pm];W[oq];B[or]C[Z: I think B is making it easy on me here, would P4 or Q6 be better?

B is being very weak considering. Pushing him along the 2nd line ends up giving you life]
;W[nq];B[nr];W[pn];B[mq]C[I would've kept crawling. Pushing him along the second line is very good for you]

In strict terms of moyo, you are crushing black at this point. While my estimate is probably off on your d4 moyo and blacks c14 moyo, I currently see the score as 79.5(W) to 55(B), and with a single stone at C7/C6, it would be more around 100 - 60]

(;W[ho]C[Here I might've played C7 if you couldn't see any good attack places. Also I'd play something like S3. You'll never kill his lower right, and whoever attacks this group first can still make some territory.]
;B[bl]C[Z: Now I reall want my last move back. I often mistake moyo for territory. I think I'm still winning if I just play C3 and insure my left stones run to the center, but instead I  try to contain black.

Yes, containing and killing is always incredibly hard. Attaching here did help him a little a little as well. This is one of those points when you have to sacrifice a little to make a lot. My response would've been around C6. C3 is still small]

(;W[cl]C[Z: I know that contact moves are very poor at constraining an opponent, but its a lesson I need to keep learning. I think better alternatives  are C3, D8.

see previous];B[bm]
(;W[bk];B[dm]
(;W[cm]C[more poor contact.

Yes. Your intention was right, but he was in too easily defendable a position]
;B[cn]
(;W[dl]C[At this point I would've certainly defended. Your group can still run, but you can no longer contain B]
;B[cp]C[Bad move by black. With so many stones nearby, you couldve attacked and easily saved the corner, plus made some nice profit in defending afterwards]

(;W[dn]C[Bad attack. Your not effectively threatening his territory, just one stone]
;B[do]C[A bad threat by black, in my opinion.]
(;W[en]C[still salvagable. One piece of advice, if one of your stones is threatened, ask yourself this: Is it vital? Is it a critical pat of defense? Will I need it later? If the answer to all of those is no, you might want to toss it and move somewhere else.]

A little, but M12-14 would've been better, as it would be just as influintial, but could also make territory. O12 at this point wouldn't have been very effective at getting a response, as he already has a stone at q12]

With standard komi (6.5 points) though, you actually won by 4.5 moku. My only main suggestions would be to get every sente move(moves which leave you with control of the board) you can during yose (the last part of the game). Also, recognize when it is more worthwhile to sacrifice a lone stone rather than fight a losing battle by capturing it. Aside from that, you should learn some of the very basic joseki. While even I don't know them all, there are only about 20 that are vital, and come up the most often. I do hope this review has helped your go.]

Right. One basic principle is you want to direct your opponent towards your strong stones when trying to kill, and out of the shape when trying to defending. As you don't have stones close enough to help, you want to atari from m14]
