C[D:  Reviewer, thanks in advance for taking a look at this game.  I'm playing black and made a pretty big trade at the very beginning of the game (largely due to greed).  I'd especially like your comments on my style of play: am I being too aggressive?  Too hasty?

Thank you!

Lop: The endresult of the trade was quite nice for black, very interesting variation. Maybe you are really a little hasty. Just keep cool and win the game. The endgame is also interesting, you have good ideas but play some moves that actually helped your opponent. I hope i can help you a little with this review.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[qf]LB[qn:A]C[Lop: White R6 (A) is played very often]

(;B[nc];W[pj]
(;B[qd]LB[ce:C][qn:B][qo:A]C[D:  This seems too early, now.  How about A, B, or C?  Which do you prefer?

I also think that R16 is not very good. I'd probably play A]
;W[qo];B[po];W[pn];B[oo];W[qp];B[qq];W[rq];B[pp]LB[rr:A]C[LoP: Strange shape. I think black should play S2 (A) instead]
;W[rr]LB[qn:A]C[D:  I didn't think white was able to ignore the cut at A, so I tried it.  This leads to some very messy fighting.

Lop: You should think about the weakness at A in a different way.
You are right that A is a weak spot in white's shape. But right now white feels save enough on the right side because of Q10 and R14. So white doesn't immediately protect this point in a direct way (like R7???). When you think about it it is only natural for white to do this.
So what can black do? When we look at the board we see that we are acutally still in fuseki stage. A few big moves are still available (C15, F5, R12). R12 is especially interesting because black wants to make use of his earlier move at R16. R12 also has a relation to white's weak spot at A. This means because of white's problem he cannot play too aggressively there and black can hope to get a little more from that move than usual.
This is why I think R12 is a nice move for black now. Indirectly exploiting weaknesses is saver than going full out and trying a direct 'punishment' here.
Even if you just tenuki (maybe C15), white will still have a bad aftertaste and if he goes back to play another move there (maybe P6) you still gain a move, the value of this is not to be underestimated.]
;B[qn];W[pm];B[rn];W[ro];B[so];W[rp];B[ql];W[pl]C[Lop: If you feel unsafe now you can still bail out with R12.]
;B[qk];W[qj];B[pk];W[ok];B[rj];W[ri]C[D:  I feel pretty cooked at this point.  I couldn't read things out anywhere near completely, so I struggled on...

Lop: 3 possibilities to overcome this:
* don't play complicate things that you are not sure you can read out. (my opinion: boring)
* sharpen your tactical skills (tesuji, shape, l&d) (always great to have)
* try to develop an intuitive feeling about situations like this. To the point where you can determine wether your actions will lead to a successful result. Meaning that you either get what you wanted or you bail out at the right moment when you still didn't lose something locally and use your stones to get something else. (maybe you want to call that part of a strategic vision?)

Anyway this position is no fun for black because  you played all or nothing. So you have to get something out of this now, can't just leave it alone.]

[qr:A]C[D:  In retrospect, I should have taken A.  I lost global perspective, though, and thought I could use B to fight the ko fight.]
;B[sm];W[rk];B[nl];W[nm];B[rj];W[no]C[D:  Good ko threat or not?  While reviewing, I decided "no," but I responded in the game.  What do you think?

Lop: I'd probably also answer the threat.];B[np];W[rk];B[mo]
C[D:  I misread here; I just didn't see white's ladder off of O10.]

;W[bd];B[cg];W[hj]C[D:  I need to extract my M10 group, but I want to harass the H10 stones, too.  Where would you move here?

Lop: Either the move you played or M12 seem both fine.];B[kh]
;W[jc]C[D:  This is another junction point; I saw an opportunity to attack D12 and K17 by chasing H10.  Do you think it's safe to do so?  Should I chase one of the other stones instead?

Lop: This white move is an overplay. Your move F10 looks nice.If you feel confident you could also try to enclose K17 in a large scale moyo.]

(;B[fj];W[hh];B[gi];W[hi];B[fg];W[hf]C[Lop: Now  last possible moment to defend your weak center stones! If you do so now you also do it with a nice rythmn. (G11-H11, F13-H14, K14-?)]

(;B[id]C[D:  I played here to split the two white groups.  In retrospect, my center group is too weak for this.  Where would you play instead?

Lop: This move asks for trouble. Black's L12 group is too weak to play aggressively like this.]

LB[dk:A]C[D:  This seems too vulgar now.  However, something like A seems passive.  Opinion?

Lop: Yes this move is completly useless. I like A instead. If you want to cut the move is D6. If D6 doesn't work then don't cut directly and leave the cut for later!]
;W[dn];B[en];W[fl];B[el];W[fm];B[cq]C[D:  I thought I had enough aji to try something here, but I needed to strengthen D7.]
;W[dq]
(;B[co]C[Lop: Careful you are potentially losing points! 
Strong players would never do this in a situation like this. It is only allowed if:
* The move actually gains something and only looks risky for the unkown that can't read it out completly.
* You are so far behind that you need to try something crazy]
;W[do];B[bo];W[bn]C[Lop: For instance B6 is really nice to have for white. I think black lost at least 5 points with this action.]
;B[cr];W[br];B[bq];W[cs];B[cb]C[D:  I felt I could get some forcing moves out of this.
