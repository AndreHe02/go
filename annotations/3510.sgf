;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[np]C[Jay: Unusual approach.  This means that W wants the outside, and an influenced orientated game.]
;B[cd]C[Jay: Tenuki is a good idea, but to counter W's intention playing star D16 is better.  But, the game is still early.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[qo];B[rp];W[oq];B[pr]
;W[or];B[qs];W[pn]C[Bernard - joseki?

Jay: This favors W because B gives outside to W.  This is what W wanted.]
;B[dj];W[ec]C[Jay: I would approach the Q16 stone.];B[gc]C[Jay: Good attack.]
;W[cc]C[Jay: This is in conflict with the LR corner.];B[bc]
;W[dd]C[Bernard - Jaco expected me to play C15. Looking back @ the game maybe it was better.

Jay: What happened in the game is ok. Playing C15 invites a ko favoring W.]

(;B[cb]C[Jay: This is ok to me.];W[ce];B[dc];W[bd];B[cc];W[de]
C[Jay: This wall is not very effective for W.];B[eb];W[dh];B[cn]
;W[fp];B[hq]C[Jay: B is playing very dynamically with good spirit.]
;W[gq]C[Jay: This is a slow move, should pincer to make effective use of the LR wall.]
;B[hp];W[fn];B[kq];W[cl];B[ek]C[Jay: Now B is attacking the weaker UL W group.]

(;W[el]C[Jay: I would go from outside by bringing out D12 stones. for example, by playing F11]
;B[fl];W[em];B[cq]C[Bernard - Should I have left this for later.

Jay: Yes, B should play outside.];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co]
;B[er]C[Jay: Living in gote is slow.];W[ge]C[Jay: Not good for B.]
;B[id]C[Bernard - I think this should have been around F12 to help settle my E9 stones.

Jay: Definitely!];W[fj]C[Jay: This one hurts.];B[fk];W[hn]
(;B[ck]C[Bernard - This move lost me the game i feel. How would you judge the position with black G2 or L5

Jay: The disadvantage was from the earlier moves.  Now B is in bad shape. Given the situation settling the lower side B group may be more urgent.  But, the left side is not small.  To better help it B should play L6.]
;W[hr];B[ko];W[pf]C[Jay: W is not a weak player.  This is to develop outside and continue attacking the two weak B groups.  Normally taking 3-3 is accepable.]

(;B[nd]C[Jay: In the situation, this normal response may be too slow.  I would bring out the left group.]
;W[km]C[Bernard - Rest of the game not recorded. W+6.5.

Jay: Now, W is attacking both weak groups of B, and probablly will capture one of them.]
)
(;B[hl];W[nd];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[nf]C[Jay: This would be ok, since the right side is leaky for W.  As long as B does not get its left group captured, W is lacking territory.  B is still ahead.]

(;B[kn];W[il]
(;B[hk]C[Jay: But, this is ackward for B.  I may give up the four stones on the left, and atttack the weaker W group in LR.]

(;B[qm])))
(;W[fi];B[dm];W[bi];B[bj];W[bo]C[Jay: B has only one eye so far.  This way W can attack two B groups together.]
