C[Hello James, I'm Thomas (Tyrus), your reviewer.
I have marked my comments with an "T".]

B should play at J3 first to stabilize his groups.];W[dq];B[dr]
;W[er];B[cp]C[T:
Not common. B should defend C2 first.];W[eo]C[T:
Not very good. Pushing from the other side leaves less cuts for you.]

B2 sente for B.];B[co];W[do];B[fl];W[cn];B[br];W[ds];B[bn];W[bm]
;B[ao];W[bp];B[bq];W[bs]C[T: You took good profit from B's mistakes.]
;B[fr]C[T:
J3 is quite big for B now. If you don't cover the weakness, your L3-stone becomes very weak there.]
;W[od]C[T: First finish the R6-joseki.];B[oc];W[gm]C[T:
This is not a good strategy. The ladder is still working for B, see my variation.]

(;B[iq];W[el];B[cf]C[T:
The upper right corner is more urgent for B.]
(;W[ch]C[T:
Good direction.];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed]
(;B[be]C[T: 
not common, because B has to deal with 2 very weak groups now. The variation shows the normal joseki.]
;W[bd];B[bh];W[bi];B[bg];W[dh];B[bc];W[ad];B[ef];W[ff]C[T: You should not attach the group you want to attack. It only becomes stronger this way!]

A18 is doing a better job.];B[fc];W[gc]C[T:
F15 is good  for B now.]
(;B[ab];W[bb];B[ca];W[fd];B[mc]C[T:
Bad. B has to defend his upper left corner.];W[fa]C[T:
Good.];B[qh];W[ld]C[Attack on the left side has begun

T: That is too greedy. You killed 2 corners till now. You have a large lead. Now playing peaceful defending moves like R10 or M5 should bring you an easy win. Attacking instead makes your weak groups only weaker.]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[md];W[me];B[ne];W[mf];B[nf];W[mg];B[on];W[pn]
C[T: Now you see another example for attaching to become stronger. B made a good profit, because he was able to attach your stone.]
;B[nn];W[hm]C[T: As told before trying to attack the weak B group is not good at this position. Even if you don't kill it and only let him struggle a bit, you gain very enough profit to win.

Instead of attacking B, W should defend his own weak groups.
L3 is so weak, that B hasn't to be very strong to kill it. and gain much profit. The Q6-group is kind of weak too.
You are ahead if all your groups on the board do live.];B[jn]
;W[jl];B[ii];W[kj]C[After this move B begin to defend. This is when B realized that what i am doing

T: Yes he realizes it. But you attack him too strictly and this way you leave enough weaknesses for him to live.]
;B[ig];W[hg]C[T:
Another attach, this is too direct and agressive. As you see later, you got too much cuts and lost some stones.]
;B[gg];W[hf];B[hh];W[kh];B[jd]
(;W[ie]C[T:
Now attaching instead had been good. Some general rule for attacking: Never attach the group you're attacking, but the groups around it, because you gain outside-strenght  this way. K15 gives your stones a very good shape and B's grou√üs stay divided.]

Now black is unconditionaly alive unfortunately.];W[hf];B[id]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[ib];B[ng];W[nq];B[mq]C[T: The same misstake you made some move before. W gets only stronger. Some Quiet move like N4 would carry you in a larger trouble. But this is also not too good, because your group is so weak. Good continuation for B now in my variation.]

(;B[np];W[mr];B[mo];W[lp]C[T: B played not good, but you still have not 2 sure eyes.]

C[T:
This is an example for a useless try to kill. B played unsave moves, because he didn't want you to escape. This way he left too many weaknesses in his shape and you were able to cut him.]

[qs][rs][ss]C[Some recapitulating suggests you should take to heart:

You are not too bad at fuseki (try only to abandon josekis not  too often, because you can get more weak groups than you like, if your enemy gets sente) or yose, but you still have to learn some crucial things about fighting and kos:

Attacking groups 

1. If you attack an enemy group your main intension should be to gain some profit while shooing the group around the board. You don't have necessarily to kill every weak group, because it's not possible most times and you only gain weaknesses in your shape. 

2. If you attach a weak group, it becomes stronger in most cases. If attaching, then the groups around the group to be attacked, because you gain influence to push it around this way.

3. If you have a large lead, you should avoid to attack an enemy group overall, besides it is so weak, that there is not even a small risk for you. 
If you sucess, you win by resignation, but if you fail, you'll probably  have some weaknesses in your shapes and the enemy sometimes can turn the table by cutting you on some important points. A game played to the end is more fun than always resignations, isn't it?

Kos:

If you fight a ko, you should always watch how much it is worth. Some kos are very small and are only worth one point or less.  The N6-ko for example was not worth very much, but you risked the life of your group at the bottom middle of the board frivolously by taking away the miai of building an eye at L5 or L2. 


I suggest the book 
"Akira Ishida &  James Davies - Attack and Defense"
to you. It contains much infomations about avoiding some mistakes I revealed. I belive, it would you to become stronger
.


I hope I wasn't too acerb with you. Go is an art and everyone must try to find his own style of playing. It was interesting to review and comment this game. Best wishes, 
Thomas (Tyrus)])
