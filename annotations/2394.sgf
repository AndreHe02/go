AB[dd][dp][jj][pd][pp];W[cn]C[Hi, I am Thorre. This is a 5 stone game against a friend with 4kyu-strengh.    

Finally I won this game, but I am sure, there are a lot of bad moves I made. So it would be nice to hear / read your advice. Thanks a lot!    


At some points you will find my questions. Perhaps it would help to look at these questions, cause you can check my wrong logic.    

Thorre (KGS 10.Kyu)];B[fp];W[hq]
(;B[go]C[This move is ok but is quite easy on white - i'd prefer to put the pressure on right from the start - see variations.]
;W[kq];B[pj]C[The idea of this move is to to make a san ren sai as quick as possible. Would it be better to attack these two white stones at the bottom?    

  

with 5, the white group is stable, so directly attacking them is probably not urgent. 6 is definitely big, but what about D10, putting pressure on white 1?]
;W[pn];B[oo]C[At this point it was my wish to split white while moving in the center. But was it right?    

  

  

8 usually is played to build a moyo across the bottom but the white stones prevent this. The one point jump of O4 is simple and good.]
;W[om];B[mn]C[Here I keep splitting.];W[nj]C[At this point it seems possible to make white heavy, but I dont know how...]
;B[on]C[Bad, I think.
..    

  

...yes i don't like this exchange for black];W[pm];B[ph]C[better to play 14 directly and leave the aji alone]
;W[pf];B[og]C[I'd be tempted to jump out from the star point stone at O16 here but you'd have to be happy fighting with black 14 and 6 to do that.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[qc];B[pe];W[qf];B[qe];W[re]LB[rf:a][rd:b]C[With this sort of shape the two cutting points of R14 and DR16are vital. I think it's important for black to cut at some point]
;B[of]C[The idea here is to push white against the border for getting influence while buliding up a big wall.    

  

this is ok];W[pb]
(;B[oc]C[Probably bad... But I dont want to be attacked at this cutting point. Please show me the right way to handle this position.    

  

I'm not sure what is right, but it isn't this ;-)];W[ob];B[qb]
;W[rd];B[nb];W[rb];B[nc]C[This ends up ok for black. Confining white to the corner is good news, especially in a handicap game]
;W[df];B[fd];W[gf]C[I like W35 as a way of reducing the influence of black's thickness]
;B[ok]C[Here the idea is to split white.];W[nl];B[nm];W[mm]
;B[nn];W[ol]C[i don't like the 38-39-40-41 sequence for black -it makes white stronger. I would cut directly at 42 as then you can cut below 43 rather than above.]
;B[nk];W[mk];B[mj];W[ni];B[lk];W[ml]C[And the splitting attack seems to work...]
;B[rg]C[This should be a forcing move, that saves the borderline of future area. But I think it was not good.]
;W[rf]C[Here white answers submissively.    

  

it doesn't do any harm, but the right hand side is not very big - white has a large eyeless chain that black should attack]
;B[qk]LB[ko:A]C[This looks like a good attacking movebut there is not much territory to be made on the right hand side.

Instead, you could play a move such as A which will put pressure on both white groups. White cannot defend both at the same time]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[km];B[kk];W[ln];B[lo];W[ko];B[lp];W[kp]C[It's unfortunate to let the two weak groups link up. Perhaps the correct direction of attack with 50 should be to keep them apart by playing at 57, say]
;B[ch]C[At this point I fear to lose influence at this area. So I want to place an outpost of my forces here.    

  

i think a play near j14 would be big. On the left hand side, it might be better to pincer the bottom stone more directly as this is weakest.]
;W[dj]C[61 helps the bottom white stone];B[ce]C[this forces white to capture 60.]
;W[cg]C[at 64 looks better...];B[cf];W[bg];B[dg];W[dh];B[eg]
;W[ci]C[white has very nice shape];B[jg]LB[fh:A]C[Drawing a line.
..    

  

big];W[gd]C[Dont know how to attack these white stone firmly... 



I think i'd play at f14, to keep the two stones separated];B[eh]
;W[bh];B[fc];W[jf];B[ig];W[ef];B[ge];W[he];B[fe];W[hf];B[hd]
C[Should I take F14? 



F14 would give black a big corner

capturing one stone here with 82 is small and lets white reduce black's centre

how about L14 to enlarge the centre?];W[id];B[hc];W[ic];B[if]
;W[hb];B[gc];W[ie]C[this was painful for black];B[kf]C[big]
;W[gi];B[cl]C[Probably bad, but I thought it could be useful... 

after 91, capturing the 3 black stones with F14 becomes very large. if you play at f14, the white group on top is still not completely settled


92 is playable but seems too aggressive to me.];W[dl];B[co]
;W[dn];B[bo];W[bn];B[gq];W[hr];B[gr]C[92 looks like a good sacrifice to take a big corner now.

The exchange of the corner for the left hand side is good for black, as you have more territory elsewhere.]
;W[ff]C[big];B[hi];W[hh];B[hg];W[gh];B[gj];W[hj];B[ii];W[fj]
;B[gg];W[fg];B[gk];W[fk];B[jn];W[kn];B[kd]C[this is very big. 

i count white as 30 points on the left, 10 on the top right and not much room for more.

black has maybe 15 in the top left, maybe 20 bottom left, an probably 30 in the middle so you are comfortably ahead i think. 

the only weakness for black is maybe the group in the bottom right but it has a lot of space to make eyes still]
