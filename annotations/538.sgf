AB[dp][dd][jj][pp][pd]C[hi, i ( Sebastian/RotBart) played black in this game. my overall expression about this game is that my opening strategy was ok, but , because im a beginner, i failed to recognize some big moves in the middlegame and the endgame. I tried to find such big moves on my own and request you to tell me more about them, and , of course , about my other mistakes too.Thank you!

RickMott: Hi, pleased to meet you.  I'll do my best :)]PL[B]
;W[nc]C[RotBart [12k\]: hi];B[jc];W[lc];B[gc];W[pb];B[pg]C[RickMott: the normal response would be the 3-3 point.
No need to give white the corner.  If he pincers you,
then descend to R18.  The high extension at 6 doesn't
make sense to me here; a high extension wants to
either make a moyo or emphasize the top.  You're not
in a good position for either one.  The Q10 star
point would be OK for moyo building on the bottom,
or the 3-3 for defense.];W[pi]C[RickMott: White's high pincer is unexepcted here.  I would
play this on the 3rd line to open your corner from two
sides.];B[ql]C[RickMott: reasonable, takes white's base away.]
;W[ni];B[ng]C[RickMott: I think you need to worry about making
a base for your group first and attack later.
Maybe 3-3 at R17, then R12.];W[lh];B[mh];W[mi];B[li];W[lg];B[dj]
C[how can i see which side is better to play on an empty star point, the left or the bottom (i.e. d 10 or k4)?

RickMott: This is the better star point because you have more
support for a moyo framework given the upper left, but you
shouldn't be thinking about moyo yet.

The two star points are big, but not urgent.  With this
line of play, you must either make a base for your upper right
group immediately, or you are committed to capturing the three
white stones -- which is not easy to read out at this point.

So I'd play R12, which both starts a base for you and fences
in the three white stones further.  White must answer or you
can connect underneath to R8.  Then you can play R17 and your
base will be pretty secure.];W[ol]C[RickMott: white wants to secure his stones.  Now it's
even harder to guarantee capture, so you must make a
base.];B[qi];W[qj];B[qh];W[rj];B[qc]C[RickMott: Good ideas for making a base.]
;W[qb];B[pn]C[RickMott: your upper right group does not feel secure
yet to me.  I think white could make trouble with some
kind of placement attack.

Think about what you would do if white played R15 or
S15, for example.  Or even S14 -- you would have to
block at S13, white plays R15, threatening to cut
though at Q15 or connect under at S17.  I haven't
read this out thoroughly, but there are many lines
of play for white which could be messy and dangerous
for you.

I've gone through many variations starting with
white's next move.  All of them result in losses
for black, even if the group doesn't die.]
(;W[fq]C[RickMott: he doesn't attack, but there's still some
weakness in that group.  See variations.];B[hq]C[RickMott: The normal response would be to play at C6 or
D6, to reinforce your moyo.  A pincer attack just drives
him into your moyo, not what you want.

If you're going to pincer, do it farther away at K4 or K3
and help your lower right corner and your potential
attack on white's center left group.];W[fo];B[dn];W[jp]C[RickMott: This is why the tight pincer is not so good.
White can counter-pincer and create lots of complication
on the bottom.  You want to let him live small, secure
your lower right corner, and continue your attack on
white's center right group.  Even now, playing M3,
threatening to connect underneath, with N4 or M5 as a
followup might be better than running out with H5.];B[ho];W[fm]
;B[dl];W[hm];B[in]C[RickMott: You're letting white push you around
here.  N3 would be good; you could even consider
cutting and fighting at F4.];W[nq]C[RickMott: Really big for white.]
;B[lq];W[no];B[lo]C[RickMott: you have K4 almost surrounded, but white will
have lots of sente plays threatening to pull it out and
will secure his right-center group and greatly reduce
your lower-right corner in the process.  Much better to
have played a simple extension from the lower right instead
of double pincers.  This kind of complication favors the
stronger player in a handicap game.  You should aim to
force white to live small while strengthening and
expanding your neighboring territories.];W[mn];B[ln];W[pr]C[RickMott: This is big for white.  Reduces your corner,
starts a base for his stones if he can connect to the
center right.  The white formation has weak points
for you to aim at, O7 and Q9 for example.];B[qq];W[cf];B[ce]
C[RickMott: You don't have to answer this.  White's
stones on the bottom and right are very weak and
invite attack.

If you're going to play a diagonal contact move,
why not E3 instead of C15, denying a base to the
four white stones?

Also good would be O7, preventing white from
getting an easy connection between his center
right and bottom right stones.  White should
have a hard time defending both weak groups.];W[dr]C[RickMott: See? you could have denied white this
move.];B[cq];W[ne]C[RickMott: Not sure you are forced to respond to
this.  Suppose you play C12 now, or carry out
the separation attack at O7?  White should
have to treat those as sente, and you can
respond in the upper right later.];B[pf]C[RickMott: Locally, either P15 or the hane at
S18 are probably better, since they expand your
potential eye space more.];W[ci]C[RickMott: Ouch.  Too bad white gets to make a base.
You've been responding a bit passively to everything
white does.  You need to look harder for weaknesses
to exploit -- places where you can keep a weak
group from making a base or keep weak groups from
linking up.];B[cj];W[bj];B[bk];W[bi]
(;B[df];W[eh]C[RickMott: A mistake by white.  You can take away
most of his base by atari at C13.]
(;B[dg];W[dh];B[bf]C[RickMott: Why here?  Pushing in with the atari at
C13 is much better.];W[fj];B[fi]C[RickMott: E11 would be a stronger way to separate
white.  If he plays F11 and you cut at F12, you've
reduced the liberties of white's center left group
and your single stone will be closer to your upper
left moyo.];W[ei];B[ej];W[gj];B[gh];W[gg];B[hh];W[hg];B[jl]
C[RickMott: You can't afford to leave the local fight
yet.  Your three cutting stones are too important.
If you let white atari at F12, you cannot connect
or he will capture your stones with the sequence
J12 atari, black H11, J10 capturing in a net.

You must get more liberties for your cutting stones.
Run out with J12 and if white J13, hane at K13 to
prevent white from linking up with his upper right
stones.];W[fh]C[RickMott: he sees the atari.  Your attacks on his weak
groups get much more difficult after white connects.];B[ii]
C[RIckMott: Now that you can't keep white separated,
the three cutting stones are unimportant so this is
a small move.

The biggest thing I see is the move at O7 to keep
white's remaining weak groups separated.];W[gi]
(;B[ke]C[RickMott: What is this move doing for you?  It doesn't
build your territory; it's not an attack on an obviously
weak white group.  O7 is still better.];W[id];B[ic];W[fc];B[fd]
C[RickMott: I like the clamp at E17 a bit better
here.  It strengthens your corner.];W[gd];B[ec]C[RickMott: In a crosscut, you have the choice of which
side to atari.  Here, strengthening your weaker group by
making the H16 atari would be better.];W[hc];B[fb];W[gb];B[fc]
;W[hb]
(;B[ig]C[RickMott: Not sure what you're trying to do here, but
two possibilities are (1) connect out your top center
group, or (2) attempt to capture the two white stones
at M12-M13.  That's speaking locally; I still think
the attack at O7 outweighs the loss of the 3 stones.
But you don't want white's top area to get too big.

I wouldn't play B (N16) because it will just force
white to strengthen himself.

I might consider K16 first, with K13 as a followup.
If white ataris at J12, ignore it; it's not important.
Just atari at K12 and connect to your upper stones.
You will reduce white's top area and have the attack
on the M12-13 stones remaining.];W[jf];B[if]C[RickMott: This is a mistake; the move doesn't threaten
anything and forces white to strengthen himself.  How
about L14 instead?  That way, you can try either to
connect out or capture M12-13.];W[je];B[ie];W[jd]
(;B[ki]C[RickMott: O7 is still better, I think.];W[ml]C[RickMott: White finally acts to protect his weakness.]
;B[ll];W[lk];B[kl];W[mm];B[jg]C[RickMott: Just forces white to connect.  There are
bigger plays: R2, C2, atari at G15 followed by
cut at F13, defend the upper right group, and so
forth.  This is a small move.];W[kf]C[RickMott: But white answers anyway, so you got away
with it (except all hope of attacking M12-13 is lost).];B[ge]
;W[hd];B[fg];W[qr]
(;B[rl]C[RickMott: A (s8) is fine, you make the stone stronger
and leave the possibility of poking at Q9.];W[rq];B[rp];W[pq]
;B[qp];W[rr];B[ro]C[RickMott: One space above at S6 would be better for
making eye space.];W[cr];B[ri];W[pj];B[cg]C[RickMott: small, a hane at S18 or B2 is much bigger.
I'd pick S18 because that group is weaker.

The tower poke at G6 has some potential.  White's
left side group soesn't have eyes, so he must
connect at F6.  Then you play F8 and life gets
very interesting indeed for White.];W[im];B[jn];W[hn];B[ip]
C[RickMott: After this sequence, White is pretty secure.];W[gr]
;B[hr];W[mr];B[lr];W[bq];B[bp];W[dq];B[cp];W[br]C[RickMott: White is picking up a lot of points with end
game sente plays.];B[rc]C[RickMott: Hane at S18 is better.]

;W[kg];B[ep];W[pe];B[qe];W[si];B[sh];W[sj];B[ph]C[RickMott: Oh, no.  A simple defence at S13 solves all
your problems.  Now White may be able to kill you.];W[rg]C[RickMott: Black cannot live now.  You were ahead up to
this point.]
(;B[rf]C[RickMott: Somebody stronger may be able to find a way to
kill anyway, but I think B (connect at S12) lets you
make life by making miai of S14 and S15.  This way, you
die and lose the game.  Without this mistake, I think
you might win, although the game is within a few points.
It would depend on the end game plays.

No futher comments after this point.  In general, I
think you need to focus on looking for ways to attack
white and keep his groups separated rather than always
responding locally.  When you see a weak group, work
really hard to keep it from getting stronger or
connecting out if you can.  Do the same analysis in
reverse on your own groups first, that is, make your
own groups secure before attacking.  Big gote moves
to make territory are generally less valuable than
preserving attacking chances.

Good luck in future games!
