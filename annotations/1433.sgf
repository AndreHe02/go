C[Petertje (me): currently 12k*, black
silvio: 12k*, white

I registered as 7k on IGS, but got downgraded to 12k* (to a large extent because of 2 drunk evenings with crappy games).

I
win this game by 6.5 moku.  I felt confident about my game, and I estimated
I was ahead since the beginning.  I'd like to get comments on my general
style.  I've experimented a long time with quite aggressive play.  But now
I want to play more solidly.  I'm also practicing heavily on counting the
status while the game is going on, so that I can decide on my style (attack/defense).
 I also have problems with deep reading, particularly when it' a bit more
complicated (lack of liberties, under the stones, ...)

=============================================

Hi
there, I'm writing this lines after reviewing the whole game, so I can answer
better these questions. I'm not much stronger than you (5 kyu on IGS), so
I worked hard to try to bring you good stuff to help in improving your game.

Playing
solid in Go means building strong and safe groups. In my humble opinion,
this doesn't have anything to do with been agressive or passive.

The idea behind safe groups is to have your hands free, so you can build more territory, or fight in good position.
The weakness of a group is felt in the whole board.

I
felt that you are lacking knowledge of good and bad shape, and tries to play
always the biggest move leaving too much aji behind.

To improve this I would recomend 2 things: 

1st) Read Charles Matthews book about shape (http://gobase.org/studying/articles/matthews/shape_up/)

2nd) Play around with some pro games, trying to see this shapes at work to get a felling of how they work.

3rd) (Did I said 2?) When you face a problem at the board ask yourself: "What is good shape here?"

In
this game you read quite well and the things I pointed out above was the
main weakness I saw in your game. But, if you want to improve your reading,
just 2 words: tesuji and life&death. Study and learn the shapes of most
tesuji and life&death problems. It will improve your reading because
you will recognise shape and know the moves and vital points.

Finally: Read the tips that I give about your yose in my comments during the game.

Thanks
for asking this review! I really apreciated it and also learned doing it
:) You can contact me at helcio.pacheco@uol.com.br if you have more question
about the game or just to say hi :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[pj];W[nc];B[lc]C[So
far this moves can be seen in pro games. White next move is common in amateur
games, but not in pro.]
(;W[ne];B[pf]
(;W[pb]C[This move is a mistake.
It's not clear that it is better than the invasion at san-san (R17). So,
it's better to keep the options open and take this decision later.]
;B[qc]
(;W[jc]C[Isn't L16 more severe ?  How does B react then ?
========================================
Helcio:

In
my humble opinion, is a question of style. L16 and K17 will lead to very
different games. The first, giving white a wall and the second, starting
a running battle. But I would play J17 instead of K17, attacking M17 from
distance. 

After L16, black should react like in the variation.];B[mb]
LB[le:a]C[I
realized after playing this, that it goes against the principle of "first
jumping out".  I wanted to avoid a W connection with the stone on the right,
and I wanted to keep W under pressure by reducing the eye space.  I guess
m16 would lock B in ?
==========================================
Helcio:

M15 (a) Would be the proper move. Many proverbs can be used here:

- "Run first, live later", the one you said.
- "Ikken Tobi is never wrong", M15 is Ikken Tobi.
-
" Give your opponent what he wants", if white wants to connect on the second
line in early fuseki, you can just take the time to grab some big points.

Also, you are the one being attacked here. You should make M17 safe by just jumping out. 

I give one variation to attack black as an alternative to white next move.]

(;W[oc]C[This is submissive and nearly a gote play as black N18 was. See the variation for a way of playing.]
;B[le];W[mf]
(;B[je]C[Despite
the fact that L16 can cut, B can still run out.  But would that be good ?
 I was trying to play lightly here, and to keep sente with this pressure
move.
Also, I thought that B can capture the K17 stone if W goes L16: cfr. variation.
===================================
Helcio:
N18
makes this group a bit heavy. In my humble opinion, playing light would mean
sacrifice M17 stone and not K15 that you just played. 

If I was to attack, K17 as you intend I would try to do so with better shape as in variation.]

(;W[hd];B[kh]C[I
guess now W L16 doesn't make sense anymore, because B will build a very strong
wall to surround the W group on the R.

======================
Yes, White should take care of his weak group.];W[qb];B[rb]
;W[mi]C[This
move is an overplay. N12 is better shape. Move like this seems to work now,
but in the future, their weakness can be used by black.];B[mk]
C[A little experiment :-)
Ideas: capping keeps him under pressure + influence for a bottom R moyo.
I
didn't want to play N12 or something aggressive like that.  I thought that
would reinforce W, which would be bad for B's right side.  Is this right
?
=============================================
Helcio:
This move is a bit slacky. I'd play P12 to keep pressure on white whithout hurting black weak group.]
;W[ph]C[Well, this could be bad for B's right side too :-)
=======================

Yeah. White takes full advantage of your last move and get some eye shape for his weak group.]
;B[qh]C[I
was thinking: if W goes R13 or R11 then B crosscut and atari at P12.  That
would make B strong on the outside, which is bad for W's group.

===================================

Helcio: I agree :)];W[pg];B[qg];W[of];B[pe];W[nq]C[It's too soon to tenuki. O15 group is not secure and has bad shape.]
;B[qn]C[Better
at o4 ?  I was looking at this, but I didn't like his hane at n4 as an answer.
 On the other hand, if I then n5, I'm making a big moyo.

Better at O5 ?  More peacefully ?

Other views ?  Other moves ?

=============================================
Helcio:

o5
doesn't look bigger than R6. The moyo with it is quite small and can still
be reduced. Also, there is no time to build such a thing. It's better to
just get sente here and use it to make your weak group at M15 stronger.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[kp]C[This
ambitious move is not justified. White needs at least two more moves to secure
the territory that he wants with this move. So, it is very inefficient and
L3 would be simple, efficient and better. Perhaps it's why it is joseki after
all...]
(;B[cn]C[I think the other side (F3 or F4) would give W a perfect pincer-extension at H3/4.
===========================================

Helcio:

Look for the variation that I give as an alternative for this move. There is a battle happening on the uper left! 

The proverb just say it:

"Urgent moves before big ones".];W[fq]C[Still open around H3/4 if necessary later.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[cf]C[After
playing this, I got afraid of e.g. C11 : I play 3-3, W goes C8 afterwards.
 Doesn't look good for B, does it ?
============================================

Helcio: Did you calculated it? Let's see a variation.]
(;W[be]C[This do not look like a good move as it helps black to get a stronger shape.]
;B[bf];W[ce];B[cj];W[df];B[dg]LB[bh:a][ch:b]C[This
move although it seems big, it leaves too much aji here. better to just play
B12 (A) or C12 (B).];W[lj]C[This would be better played at O12. White would have freehands to fight...]
;B[ef]LB[cg:a]C[This, compared to a white at E14 or E13, looks much nicer for B to me.  Reactions ?
============================================

Helcio: There is still some aji at  C13(A). So, seems a bit of overplay.]
;W[de];B[id]C[I'm trying to build a wall, which works out nicely in the game as it was played.]
;W[ic];B[he];W[gd];B[ge]C[I
thought this was sente (he indeed reacts).  But if W tenuki, B F16 ?  W F17
would finish off his territory.  But without this stone, the wall feels so
weak...
Ideas ?];W[kd]C[Oh yeah, with the stone at J17, it isn't possible to capture the K17 stone anymore :-(]
;B[ld];W[ke];B[lf]
(;W[lg]C[I felt lucky here.  Cfr. variation.
===============
Helcio:

Not
so lucky. Since white right side group is still weak, he has to play something
around here. he doesnt have freehands to fight...];B[kf];W[jf]
;B[ie];W[fe];B[ff];W[fd];B[jg]C[I
find this looks a bit funny, but it felt more certain than L13, because of
the cutting point at G14.];W[ki]LB[jj:a][en:b]C[Helcio:
==========================================
This is slow. K11 (A) would be better locally. But the biggest point now is E6, the border of 2 moyos.]
;B[ii]LB[en:a]C[I'm trying to make a moyo in the center here.
=====================================
Helcio:

You should play at the border of two moyo at E6.];W[ji];B[ij]
C[More moyo building...];W[ol]C[Aw !
===============================
Helcio: 

Overplay.
You don't need to push hard and try to punish him. This stone need to link
up with someone. This gives you sente, which would mean that you can get
something bigger than what white got here.

White should have played E6. Locally, O5 does a much better job.]
;B[no]C[I'm aiming at N3 if he doesn't react here.
============================================
Helcio:
It seems a nice idea.];W[mp];B[pi]C[Looked like sente to me: I'm threatening
his eye space.  But W runs out :-(  Much later, this move gave me a nice
combination, though !
============================================

Helcio:
There is no problem in not killing P8 stone. Just making him rescue it in
gote is enough! But you should just play R8, secure territory and let white
find a way to rescue his stone.];W[nj];B[ok];W[nk];B[pl]C[I counted and
I felt I was a little ahead, so I played calmly.  I considered my center
moyo and an invasion around e.g. H3/4 miai.
============================================
Helcio:

It's the right idea, but wrong execution. White could play E6 here.

Let's check your counting.

White: 
Upper Left = 25;Lower Side=35; Right Group = 5
Komi:5.5 (don't forget this!!!).

Black:
Left Side=20; Right Side=40; Center =10

The game is even. A white move at E6 is nearly decisive.];W[nl]
C[Helcio: 

This
is the famous "losing move". There is no need to rescue this stone as it
is too small now. It's about 4-5 points. E6 is much bigger. Here, you really
got lucky :)];B[qr]C[Same idea: if I'm ahead, I can quietly take points.
But
reviewing the game, F6 looks nicer.  If W goes around E6, he's building a
moyo (making an invasion around F3 much more difficult) too while reducing
mine.
=============================================
Helcio:

I agree here. It's why E6 is really big and also sente.];W[il]
C[Miss the point again.]
(;B[gl]C[A bit risky, but I think it works as in the game.  Other variations that would let W run in ?
============================================
Helcio: Look at variations.]
(;W[hk];B[gj];W[pm];B[qm];W[oo];B[op];W[np];B[on];W[mo];B[nn]
;W[mn];B[jk]C[I'm trying to run in, but W seals off nicely of course.]
;W[jl];B[kk];W[kl];B[fn]C[The point I mentioned before: reducing his moyo, enlarging mine.
============================================

Helcio: Yes, you played it, but is it good shape? Better at E6.]
;W[en];B[em];W[fm]C[This feels like he agrees with my analysis: if he's behind, he must play aggressively.
===========================================
He is also taking  advantage of your bad aji here. F6 was bigger, but E6 was better shape... It would avoid all this problem.]
;B[dm];W[gm];B[fl]C[I still think I'm ahead.
=====================================
Lets count again:

White:
Upper Right=25; Lower Moyo=50; Right Group=5
Komi:5.5

Black: 

Right Side=45; Left Moyo = 50.

Helcio:
You are a bit ahead, but if you miss some key yose moves you can lose. I
will quote the comments of another GTL game about yose:

Play in this order:

1) Play double moves
2) Play sente moves
3) Play reverse sente moves
4) Play gote moves.

Have this rules in mind and get stronger at yose :)

Also: white lost a lot of stones at Q18 and still lost by only 6.5 points! So he did a much better job in the yose.]
;W[gn];B[lk]C[Helcio: 

At
first, I thought that this move was small and gote. But after some thought,
I see it as an important move for both sides. The question is: how big is
it? 

In my opinion, it is really big, but you need to read the variations
if white ignores it really deep to profit from attacking white weak group.
Since you are ahead, it better to play simple sente move first, gaining some
points before playing here. There is at least 2 big sente moves at L18 and
at B3. If white ignores them to play here, it seems about 15 or more points.]
;W[bq];B[cp]C[Helcio: This seems bad shape. B5 is simple and leaves no aji. Also, it means that you agree that M9 wasn't sente.]
;W[do];B[hl];W[hm];B[or];W[oq];B[pq];W[nr];B[oh]LB[kb:a]C[B
at Q1 looked much too small to me, despite the fact that I did start the
variation.  The variation itself looked big, until the capture.  Correct
?

=============================================
Helcio: Since it
ends in gote, it was not good at all. Remember: At yose, sente moves first.
L18 (A) is one move that comes to my mind. The one you played is really good,
its the consequence of M9 and the reason that it was sente. White cannot
avoid losing something here because this group is very weak.]
