AB[pd][dp]C[[Malweth\] I'm a KGS 9 kyu player from RI, USA.
From what it looks like to me, your game is quite strong into the opening and vs gnugo you managed to keep your Handicap lead until a few major mistakes.

The major mistakes you made seems like you are overreaching - the mindset that white has "too much" even when you're leading can weaken a game considerably.

Some work on threats might also be good - when there's a place you can peep (or otherwise attack) without changing the board position for the worse you should always do it.

Working on keeping your stones connected could help -- the fundamentals are "connecting a live group to a live group is bad" (unless it achieves 1 or more other goals) and "connecting two groups without eyes is bad"

Good books, if you haven't read them, are Attack + Defense and Tesuji from the Elementary go series. Kageyama's "Fundamentals of go" is also essential. 

It would be helpful for you to play opponents other than GnuGo as well... I saw some pretty big mistakes from it here too (especially the invasion on the left side). Although GnuGo at Level 10 is rated at 8-9k there are many 15k or worse mistakes it makes.

Good luck in your studies! :)
----
This is a game I played against gnugo, and I chose it because there are only two blunders that are obvious to me.  (Since I'm fairly new to the game, especially the 19x19 game, that isn't a lot for me.)  Hopefully the commentor on this game can pick up on some blunders I made that aren't so obvious.  Ultimately, I won by 1.5]

LB[iq:A][lq:1]TR[np]CR[ip]C[[Malweth\] Typically it's best to finish off a group's base before escaping into the center. The triangled stones are too far away to interact well with the LL 4-4 stone.

A move at K3 looks good, or if prefer a high approach, L4.  Anything further apart than this would invite a white invasion because P6 is now strong (has a base).

With N6, white has options to play at the marked positions. However, this would create a weak group (with a base) (See variation A)

Another point is to determine what the purpose of N6 is. N6 is a capping move, limiting White's access into the center. At this stage of the game, access to the center is not important, so a white play at N6 would also be bad (unless it is sente).]

(;W[lq]LB[lp:1][jq:A]C[[Malweth\] This move seems suspect. See comment on white's move at J3.]

(;B[lp]C[[Malweth\] M4 is an attachment. Typically it's best to attach when defending and keep your distance when attacking. (The only exceptions are for tesuji). See variation.]
;W[kq];B[kp]LB[cn:1]C[[Malweth\] Joseki are not useful to you at this point. I've gone over some of my thoughts on your opening, but the only "joseki" is the continuation after O4. More interesting than joseki, however, is the reasoning behind it. See "Pass" variation.
---
I really don't know a lot about joseki, but at this point I'd been reading up a little... any comments on how I played them would be appreciated.]

(;W[cn]LB[gq:1][jq:A]C[[Malweth\] This is a bad move by GnuGo. Why would one leave the L3 group? It is weak and heavy.

I would consider ignoring C6 to attack L3.]

(;B[ge];W[ec]C[[Malweth\] This move by white takes the most advantage of the position, giving white:

1) Good shape
2) An excellent late-game follow-up at G17.
3) no defects

Compare with joseki variation...];B[hc]C[[Malweth\] This isn't big enough to play now. If W plays G17, you can sacrifice it at H17.

Furthermore, H17 is an inferior play to G17 which is much stronger. With G17 white does not have a play at F18.]
;W[oe]C[[Malweth\] As I said before, white's group here can act to ruin any chance of moyo you created by building the G16 wall.]
;B[od]C[[Malweth\] Not necessary, though it prevents a forcing move by W at P16.]
;W[ne];B[nd];W[me];B[ld];W[kf];B[je];W[fb];B[gc]C[[Malweth\] Too small now.]
;W[bp];B[cq]C[[Malweth\] 54 is big. A white play at C3 would lose a lot of territory in the corner. G17 was the most suspect.

Hmm, I feel that maybe I should have put 54 at the spot where white places next... I perhaps gave white too much reign in that whole left side.  Comments?]
;W[fg];B[gg];W[fi]LB[ff:1][gh:A]
(;B[ff];W[ef];B[ee]C[[Malweth\] This isn't a wall. Black has a wall at G16 facing outward, but it doesn't really do anything. White making territory on the left side cannot be stopped easily. G15 is probably the move that stopped any chance of invading white's moyo.

If you followed the joseki I showed, a reduction play threatening to push through that shape might have worked (or perhaps not.

Even now, with G13, F14, and E15 you're thinking that White shouldn't be allowed such a big space Instead you should be looking to use your power to the south with the varation starting at move 57, G12 
----
this was a bit of a silly move where I just wasn't really thinking about what I was doing... the idea was to capture the f15 stones or cut the wall white is forming.  I'd appreciate comments on how I could have played to get through this wall or how I could have stopped it from forming so strongly.]

White is alive above and doesn't need to play o14 until after you play Q14.

----
Well, here I think I should have attached above 111, and this is the first obvious blunder to me, since otherwise I might have won this upper group.  Mind you, maybe gnu would have simply made the attachment above 99... but then that might have been okay, because I think I lost a bit of space while I was fighting so hard to take this group.]

This:

This is one of the easier joseki to understand because there are relatively few variations. W must play at D17 to block access to the corner. B can vary K17 depending on board position, but this is otherwise the best for all sides...

The benefit of a slightly higher position at G15 is almost non-existant compared with the strong territory this gives. G15 would be a better answer if you hope to create a moyo on the top side, but white's P13 group works to prevent that.]

[kq]C[[Malweth\] my Joseki database stops here. the LR lives for B... it is important to see what follow-ups remain. Because you have the advantage of a black HC stone in the LL, it makes the most sense for you to continue your group toward it. Extending to K3 is safe because it cannot be invaded easily and it also operates as a long extension from D4.

The hard part about fuseki is that even if you know you want to move in one section of the board (marked with circles) you still have a number of options to decide from.

Essentially, memorizing patterns doesn't help. If you know the pattern in the LR is joseki but W approaches at M3 and you don't know what to do, then the pattern you've memorized is useless.]
