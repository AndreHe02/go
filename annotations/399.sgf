C[Hello.
I lost this game early but I'm lost in what happened on the right.

Hi folks,
here is the reviewed game.  I stopped paying close attention shortly after
white's huge middle game blunder.

This game shows good fighting spirit by both sides but perhaps a bit of a
lack of positional judgement on both player's parts.  White made the last
big mistake, but black made many passive moves playing on his strong group
instead of his weak group.

I hope my comments are useful to you.

;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[cp];B[jd];W[qf];B[pi];W[qc]C[This may
be a joseki, but it doesn't seem interesting to me.  It lets black use the
K16 stone effectively.  I'd play it at P14 instead, separating the Q11
stone.];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qb]C[This also seems a little unusual, giving black a very
strong formation and reducing white's potential to separate Q11.  Isn't Q14
the joseki here?];B[pb];W[pf]C[The exchange of R18 for Q18 is now bad for
white.];B[qe];W[re];B[of];W[og]C[This looks like an overplay; white has
too many weaknesses.];B[pg];W[nf];B[oe];W[qg]C[Palustris :
I'm not sure of this move. I take sente to play O13 but the weakness I
leave is great.
But ti play S13 seems a little submissive.

Joshua: S13 threatens to capture Q13 also, so it might be sente too.
Certainly if black answers S13, you'd rather play there than R13.  If black
doesn't answer S13, then the Q11 stone becomes weak because the Q13 stone
is capturable.  So I think S13 is better.];B[ph];W[ng]C[This connection
feels like an overplay.  You need to play lighter here.  Black is strong in
this area and you are not.];B[qa]C[This is too slow for black.  A move
around N11 would have you hurting.];W[ri]C[I'm not sure of this shape.  I
suspect a tesuji somewhere to eliminate cleanly all this bad aji. Maibe R11
?

R11 is not strong shape for you.  After black pushes through at R12, he can
capture something for sure.  O13 should have been something lighter (like
K14, for example) or just left for later (and play around R7 or D10 or
the like).  This move (S11) should probably just be S12 to keep you safe
and strong.];B[rj];W[rh];B[md]C[Seems too slow to me.

Yes, N16 is too close to black's strength.  Black should attack from the
O11 direction.];W[nj]C[I'm happy to play here.];B[pk];W[pm]
C[Black's group looks a little
weak now, and the fight has become fair.  Black's moves at R19 and N16 were
not good.  Black needs to push you TOWARD his strength.  Instead black
chased you toward his weak group.];B[ol];W[ml];B[om];W[qj]C[All the ensuing
sequence mai be reviewed. I cannot read well here.];B[ni];W[ok]
;B[pj];W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[qo];W[po]C[Now I think P6 shoukd be far better but I
read badly the sequence.

Joshua: It's not so much the reading as the importance of the stones.  Your
corner stone is not important; it's your center group and black's weak
group that are important.  P6 is correct because it emphasizes keeping
black's group weak.  Q5 is wrong because it emphasizes the corner.

I might even prefer Q6 instead of P6 just to stay simple and strong in the
attack on black's big group.];B[pn]C[I thought that after R7, black cannot
play R6 because of the cutting point at P6 but after reasonnig, I saw that
black can afford to be cut because his "weak" group is not so weak, he can
easily break through at O12. So I played R6 but it is a loss.

Yes.  If you had played Q6 instead of Q5, maybe black has to play O12 to
save his big group, and you can play Q5 next, losing some up top but
gaining a lot in the bottom right corner.

Still, the important point is that the O13 move was an overplay for you,
and N16 and R19 were the wrong direction for black.];W[qn];B[qm]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[qo]C[The ko would be pretty huge (if you play S7) and black gets to
take it first ... look around to see if there's anyplace where two moves in
a row would be really great for you ... OK, you are probably right not to
start this ko.];B[rd]C[This is not big; if you capture S7 your group is
still alive.  Black is just taking territory in the corner.  HIs group is
already strong.  I would play S7 or N11 or O5 or something to attack
black's weak group.];W[rc];B[rk];W[rl];B[rm];W[sk]C[As you can see, black
gets to play S7 in sente.  So S7 was worth a lot more than your S17
move.];B[ep];W[hp];B[oo];W[op];B[np];W[no];B[on];W[mp]C[This looks like an overplay.  You're not
going to kill black's big side group.  Just calmly walk out along the third
line (O3) and if you can link up to your H4 stone, you'll be
satisfied.];B[nq];W[mq];B[oq];W[pp];B[mr];W[lr];B[nr];W[kq]

;B[pq];W[rp];B[sr];W[os];B[pr];W[ms];B[sq]C[No comment !
Of course, I will loose this game but it is still interesting.

Joshua: I don't think the game is interesting any more.  Black now has a
big territory (28 points) in that corner, which is more than white's
territory on the side.  And look at black's thickness!  White's O14 stones
are almost worthless, as are O10/P9, because black's group is now very
strong.

This game should be a 50 or 60 point lead for black at this point.  White
should resign.];W[dn];B[gp]C[Instead of starting this fight (which is still good for
black!), it would be even simpler to just play D10 and let white have the
lower left.  Black will still win easily.];W[ho];B[fn];W[dk]
;B[gq]C[Black
should run out, not try to live on the side here (unless black is trying
to kill white's L3 stones!)];W[dq]C[White gets territory in the corner
while attacking.  Good job!  Black should have left the E4 stone alone and
just played D10.];B[hq];W[eq];B[iq];W[jp];B[jn];W[jo];B[fl]
;W[dg]C[Now white gets up this side.  Black's lead
has dwindled to maybe 20-30 points now.];B[hm];W[fc];B[ee];W[cc]
