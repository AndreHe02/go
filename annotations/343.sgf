C[i won this game, because my opponent made some silly mistakes
in the end, probably thinking that he was behind.

in general, i have a serious fuseki  problem, usually ending
up in moyo games where i am behind right from the beginning.
this is not so obvious here, but still bad enough. i'm not sure
which points i would like to have addressed in particular, because
i don't feel realy comfortable with my game right now, and i
can't figure out what it is that i don't like, apart from the
fusekis.
therefore i would appreciate any comments  ...

hello Tobias,
let me first say that fuseki is not really my strong point either.
but i like moyos ;-)
it stroke me that you sometimes play (very) slow moves. i'll
point the most important ones out.
since you didn't ask particular questions i'll point out things
that jumped into my eye.
greets.
Steffen

hi both of you!
i'm martin (starting my comment with "m:" for that reason) and
i'm happy to comment the game/comments. i will usally beginn
with the words "agree" or "dissagree" which try to indicate that
my opinion may be differnt, but need not be "better" than steffens!]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[pn]MA[qo]C[if you don't like moyos why do you play an the fourth line here?
;-)
R5 would be the standart move.

but this one is fine also...

m: R6 and Q5 are as standart as R5. Q6 is not really a mistake,
but I don't like it. as said above: 4th line is for influence.
but the 2 point jump has a weakness, is not so powerfull. my
advice: if you want the 4th line - play Q5!];W[mq]C[m: hmm, I think this is too close to a (rather) stong black position.
if you want to play on the lower side - try K3 or K4.];B[kq]
MA[jp]C[right direction but too close. around k4 would be better.   the
idea should be to you use your influence in the right buttom
corner to attack this stone.

K4 would have two possibilities implemented:
a) attack the white stone by pushing it against your buttom right
corner.
b) building a base by extending to the left.

m: I agree with the "implemented possibilities", but I think
L3 is as good as K3 or K4 would be.];W[op]C[m: I wouldn't do that. black has a minor weakness with his two
point jump on the 4th line. this move is forcing black to remove
his weakness. that is called a "thank you move." white should
jump to N5.

a counter-pincer with J3 seems also possible, but playing there
is to admit that N3 was not a good move.];B[pp];W[mn];B[ko]
C[why not first settle this group and attack the white stones afterwards?
you could play much more relaxed then ;-)

here it is no good to chase white because your stones don't have
a base themselves.

m: I disargree. why not settle oneself while attacking? I think
this move is ok.];W[jp]C[m: again white forces black to strengthen his position. this
won't help the 3 white stones on the right.];B[kp];W[on]C[m: the proverb says, that attaching makes the opponent stronger.
white dues not want that.
whites moves are rather heavy where they should be light.];B[pm]
;W[po]C[m: my impression is that almost all of whites moves force black
to play moves that are more efficient than whits moves were.]
;B[qo];W[oo]C[m: even gote for white.];B[nr]C[this is an endgame move. there are bigger points on the board.
this one is not important now.

m: well, I agree that this move is not so good. but: this is
not meant to be endgame, this is meant to attack white. the right
idea, but the wrong move. black has now a strong position on
the lower right corner. use it by pressing from the outside.

there is no need to takes white base away, because white has
no base there. i'd play L7. if white jumps answer with Q9. the
stones
on the L-line would be safe in the center and the territorry
on the right would be the profit from the fight.];W[mr];B[or]
C[and it leaves you in gote...

m: yeah, with this exchange black lost speed. still: white is
attackable, but 19 and 21 should not been played.];W[hq]C[m: white still should do something for his weak group. a move
like M7 or L7 comes to my mind. if black also runs toward the
center, white can play a move around 22 next.];B[jo];W[ip];B[io]
MA[km]C[now there come some slow stones. also consider other direction.
L7 e.g. would put the white group to the right under pressure
again.

m: yeah, agree. with black 23 in place, even L8 seems possible,
but L7 is good enough.];W[ho];B[hn];W[go];B[im]C[this one is particularly slow.

m: again agreed. black settels himself, but:
(a) is not really attacking the white group on the right and
(b) forces white to take profit on the lower left.];W[ml];B[pl]
MA[ok]C[your buttom right corner is secure territory so this move is
too slow.
it is not severe on white either.
e.g. with P9 you would push white and at the same time open up
your right side territory.

if a group is already settled (like this one) try to find a move
away from such a group.
try to find moves that have more than one meaning.

m: again agreed. but since black was not very efficient with
25, 27 and 29, even P9 would not be very severe.];W[km];B[jm]
C[m: again: slow move.];W[fm]C[m: good. efficient. taking lots of profit.]
;B[gm]LB[jm:a][im:b]MA[hk][jj]C[where K7(a) was a good move since it created eyespace, this one
is too low and lets white contain you too easily. conlusion:
wrong direction. escape towards the center. e.g. H9 or K10. the
idea is: this group is weak. perhaps you'll lose it. so it
is not a good plan to connect too much stones directly to it
(like (b) some moves ago). better spread your stones so that
you will not have to discard all stones when time comes. you
will get "faster" and less heavy.
after having added too much stones you will have no choice but
get this clot to life.

m: agreed that black is heavy and should rather jump to one of
the marked points. disagreed that K7 was good. I think is was
also too slow.];W[fl];B[gl]C[m: again: too slow.];W[kk];B[co]
LB[fc:a][cf:b]C[your L4 group is still weak and you are going to get another
weak group.

if you don't want to flee with your L4 group better play around
(a) or (b).

m: yeah, agreed. now it's almost to late to invade the lower
left corner. and blacks weak group is now to large to sacrifice
it. this is the problem with slow and heavy play: now you've
got this useless bulk of stones and can't affort to sacrifice
it.];W[cp]C[m: i'd play from the outside and try to capture on large scale,
because white is so strong. C8 for example.];B[do]C[m: inefficient move!! play C8 now. try to make a base.]
;W[cm];B[dm];W[dl];B[fn];W[en]MA[gn]C[white should keep the two black groups separated with G6, e.g.
idea: don't let two weak groups connect!

cutting opponent's weak groups (keeping them separated) and connecting
own weak groups is a very important concept in Go.

m: yes, yes and yes!];B[fo];W[eo];B[gn];W[fp];B[gp]C[very tricky now ;-)

m: yes! i think white should sacrifice two stones to keep black
seperated. i think i'd play F3.];W[hp];B[ep];W[fq];B[em];W[eq]
;B[dp]C[m: better play D6 now!];W[el];B[dn]C[m: mmm, big successs for black.]
;W[bn]LB[dl:a][hi:b]MA[co][gl]C[nice tactical sequence.

there are two things (actually three) i'd like to pull your attention
to though:

1. white got a wall towards the top around D8(a).
2. the buttom left is now secure territory for white.
3. you got two prisoners and made life sure for a group that
was in danger but could live some other way (e.g. by further
escaping into the center (b)).

this sounds quite unfavorable, doesn't it? ;-)

let me explain what went wrong:
the move that initatied this sequence (C5) was too deep into
whites territory already (back then i mentioned that you get
two weak groups) and white could use his influence to put this
stone under pressure.
as 3) indicates, you managed the situation but Go is always a
give and take and you gave white more than you got in return
(i think) ;-)

the idea would be to play in the top left corner instead of N5
in white's influence.
but pay attention to get your group around G8 out there later
on!

m: i do not really agree! yes, blacks initial invasion was too
deep, but now black is connected! yes: the resulting whole-board
position is not bad for white, but white could have even (much)
more that that!
Black was far (!) behind but now he is almost catching up.]
;B[bp]MA[bo]C[not necessary.  play somewhere else and keep B5 for later (B5
would be sente then. B4 gives you gote.)

the top is very empty!

m: well, it is clearly not the biggest move now, but still big.
the problem is, that it is gote (B5 played now is also gote)
and it is clearly not big enough to take gote!];W[cq];B[bo]
;W[bq]C[m: no! don't let black have sente! 64 is much to small now (because
whites group is allready save).];B[nc];W[qg];B[qd]C[m: i'd rather play R11 or R10! white can make a base now. this
is especially a problem since white is on the 3rd and black is
on the 4th line. so white can make a base AND threatening to
slide along the side into blacks territorry!];W[qj]C[m: yes.]
;B[oj]C[quite good, attacking two white groups (R10 and N8).

m: disagreed. white can slide now to S8 and then there is not
much of an attack left!];W[rl];B[rn];W[pk]C[m: i'd rather play something like P13.]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[ok];W[pj];B[nl]C[well done keeping the two white groups separated!

m: yes, but it doesn't help much. the white group on the right
is now almost setteled, and the group on the left can easily
escape to the center. I
still think 67 was a mistake.];W[nm];B[mk];W[lk];B[mj]C[tenuki, this one is too slow.

m: yes, agreed!];W[dg];B[jc]C[your top right corner is settled so better play further away.
you invite white to expand his top left corner.  risk something!


the idea here is that a settled group radiates power. playing
close to such a group does not add much to that power.
so one playes further away inviting the other player to do something
so that this power can work.

m: yes, agreed.];W[gc];B[of]MA[cc]C[this one makes just a few points (the white group around R10
is almost settled, so no attack). a corner-invasion would be
big now.

m: hmmm, a corner invasion is one possibility, but after this
the left side will be safe white territorry. maybe black should
try to reduce there first and go for the corner later.];W[cc]
C[m: big, but big enough?. if (!) the left side will be whites
territorry, this move is ok, because white will be 20 points
ahead then. but if black can invade there, the game would be
close again.];B[hg]MA[ji]C[consider this:
white's N8 group is still weak. you could exploit this weakness
by attacking from the right direction.
playing K11 e.g. you could force white to escape to the left
while building territory around the place you intended.

m: yes, i'd like to play from the other side too, but isn't it
to late now? white almost has two eyes - no?];W[kh]
(;B[le]MA[cl]C[this, again, just makes little points.

perhaps an invasion into white's left side territory is possible.
consider its weakness at C8.

m: agreed!

steffen: see variation for "possibilities"...

m: i think you "planed" some bad moves for white in your variations,
hmm  ;-)];W[gf];B[hf]C[m: wrong direction. black must at least try to reduce whites
territory on the left.];W[gg];B[fi];W[ei];B[fj];W[eh];B[ej]
;W[dj];B[dk];W[ck];B[ek];W[cj]C[m: i think this redrucing is not enough for black.]
;B[gh];W[re]C[m: it is ok to settle the white group on the right now! but S14
would be more of a sente move (black could ignore it, but white
would have a big follow up with T17). S15 is gote.];B[rd];W[he]
C[m: ok, but if white doesn't want to answer 105, he shouldn't
play 104 in the first place.];B[ie];W[id]C[m: double-hane? i'd simply play H16.]
;B[hd];W[ge];B[jd]C[this is a nice forcing sequence!

m: yes, but nice for black or for white??];W[if];B[ic];W[ig]
;B[hh];W[ih];B[hj]C[m: after this sequence, black won't make many points in the center,
but he has increased his territory and further possibilities
on the top. i think the sequece might be a little better for
black.];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[rc];W[lf];B[qe];W[rf];B[qf];W[rh]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[oh];W[ke];B[ld];W[mf];B[je];W[jf];B[gd]C[m: good.]
;W[fd];B[fc]C[m: good.];W[ed];B[fb]C[m: yes, that has been a big endgame!]
;W[gb];B[hb];W[eb]C[m: nice sacrufice technique by white. so he will be able to close
his corner in sente. but he has lost lots of points on the upper
side!];B[ga];W[ec];B[hc];W[jr]C[m: another nice endgame move.]
;B[fg];W[ef];B[ff];W[fe];B[fh]C[m: gote, gote, gote. a sente move is twice as
valuable as an gote move!];W[gk]C[m: that doesn't work.];B[fk]
;W[ij]C[ohoh, white oversees something >;->

m: ouch!];B[cl]C[m: with his success on the upper side and this white mistake,
black is getting close!];W[bl];B[hk];W[ik]
(;B[eg]MA[kr]C[L2 is much bigger. if white playes here he saves some points
he would otherwise have to spent in order to secure the border.

see variation

(this is "just" one point in sente.)

m: well, yes! but since it is sente, black can still play L2
after this move.];W[dh];B[il]C[m: now it's time for L2 (or another big move).]

;W[ll]C[m: first: rather connect at O4!! if you need to play around 107:
better play one line below (M7). that would be better shape (eyeshape!).]

;B[kj];W[lj];B[kg];W[li];B[kf];W[lg];B[kd];W[nd];B[od];W[ql]
;B[mh];W[jg]C[m: play m12 now. you have to play it anyhow. this move is worth
only 0,5 points. plus: it gives black a ko-thread at J11.];B[ke]

;W[sm];B[rm];W[sn];B[so];W[qp]C[m: that won't work! white is leading, but only by a few points.
with moves like 230 and 236 he is throwing his points away.]
;B[sl];W[rp];B[rq];W[sn];B[sp];W[sk]C[m: now black is leading on the board. with komi, white is leading
one or two points. the game is tight!! any mistake may now lose
the game.];B[sm];W[ls];B[ns];W[mp];B[jl];W[kl];C[here is my conclusion:

i didn't find your fuseki to be bad. just make better use of
your influence.

you'll have to look not to get weak groups in the very beginning
though. your opponent could easily exploit this. so consider
what is worth more: settling or attacking a group. (this is case-sensitive
;-))

after having settled a group don't play to close to it. use the
influence a settled group radiates.

try to avoid slow moves. i hope by my comments you now have a
picture of what slow moves are!?

moves with more than one meaning are good. try not to go just
for territory or just for influence, try to connect these two
(or other) concepts. (this does not necessarily mean "miai").

keeping opponent's groups separated and connecting own groups
will make them weaker/stronger.

i hope this helps improving your play!
Steffen

m: agree mostly with steffen.  fuseki/midle game was better for white, because he successfully
invaded the right side, while defended the the left side. the
late midle game/endgame was better for black because he expanded
his territorry at the top and made a lot of profit from white
mistakes in the yose.

hope you will find my comments usefull,
