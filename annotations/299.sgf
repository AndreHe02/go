C[
I played Black here, and I was somewhat satisfied with the beginning  of the game up until my unexpected (for me) loss in a fight on the bottom. after that I think all was lost...

I would appreciate comments about everything but especialy about the opening and middle up to that unfortunate fight.]

;B[fq];W[dm];B[dr];W[cj]LB[jd:a][fc:b]TR[dr][fq]C[Nothing to say until here.

White goes a bit too much for the left side.
Black can keep the advantage by playing
'a' (K16) or 'b' (F17), as the marked stones can settle in the corner or on the side.]
;B[ip];W[cg]LB[nc:a][qo:b][po:c][qn:d]C[White goes TOO MUCH for the side.
Should be at a b c or d.];B[eo]LB[fc:a][pk:b][jd:c]C[Wrong direction.
First, you must take big points on the sides. Here, you can play 'a' (F17), 'b' (Q9) or 'c' (K16).]
;W[do];B[en]C[Useless and gote.

It's very bad to loose initiative here...];W[qj]C[Good point for White.]
;B[ql]C[Good direction];W[qg];B[qf]C[Better not to play this move as it doesn't defend the corner properly.]

(;B[kq]C[Don't go to contact unless you want to settle stones.

You want to attack M3. A good way to do this is to play Q5 and wait.

(see var)];W[lp];B[gc]C[I think it's not bad to tenuki, as the white's bottom stones will have no trouble to make sabaki.]
;W[ic]LB[ge:a][cc:b][id:c][kc:d]C[White pincer is a little overplay. Better to play D17.

Black has several options: the game, C17, J16, L17 ... I prefer L17

see vars for 'b' and 'd']

Here, Black can play O19 sente.];B[jc]C[A bit useless. Better to descend in sente at O19 and then Q5.]

It's time to attack these stones.];W[kr];B[jq];W[jr];B[ir];W[mr]
;B[pj]C[The fight is NOT over in the bottom... You musn't leave a fight when you have initiative in it.  Just play O2 and White will have to run out, and THEN, attack the over group: purshasing two groups = sure win.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[rl];B[qm];W[rm];B[rn]C[Better to push once more at R6 (more solid)]
;W[rf];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[nr]C[Here, you lost initiative in the lower side...]

Very good point.];W[ri];B[rj];W[rk];B[rh];W[sj]
(;B[rg]C[JUST CONNECT

See var];W[qh];B[sf];W[pi]C[The local battle is over...

Look at the overall position. White have 3 little groups (and 2 not alive yeat) + the left side.

As you  can't attack strongly the little groups, take away some territory (sente).

See var]
(;B[oi];W[oh];B[nj];W[mg]C[NEBIS: it's about here I realize white bottom group isn't alive if I play M1 but since white didn't seem to notice that, I decided to get some more influence in the center first.]

(;B[ml]C[NEBIS: seems like this is my big mistake...
most of my next moves are forced.
would B M8 W N8 B O8 instead work?

 nebis 19k*: wow, I didn't see that one's coming...

^^^^^^^^^ says it all.
====================================

NH: Ok, that's not so bad :)
The point is you think too much about killing. I lost most of my games by trying to kill when it's impossible, instead of attacking and building territory.
In this game, you had the option of having a quiet continuation, whith big yose moves.

BUT, you have a lot of Go vocabulary already, whith good sense of shapes.

Have fun playing GO.];B[ki]C[NEBIS: now I try kill the white middle group and fail in that too :-(
