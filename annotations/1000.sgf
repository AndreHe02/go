C[Hi Go freinds from teaching ladder. Here is my first game i would like to be reviewed. My main interest concerns following: I had a massiv wall on the top and middle right, while my oppent was forced to connect sometimes even on the 1. line, so he hadnt that much profit. Middle left i had a good position, too, but I feel I used the influece I had not very well. Plz try to commet my game in that point of view, too.  And the second threat is this one: 2 of my groups (mid left later, and mid bottom) came into serious trouble and I only could live with lots of luck. So i thinks both (1. and 2.) point  are related very strong and I really wish to know, how to do it better!
Thx very much!];B[dp];W[cd];B[pd];W[qp];B[ec];W[oq];B[df];W[cb]

(;B[gd]C[See the variation.  I think Black's move is a bit passive.  White's stones can be cut apart.]
;W[dc];B[hc];W[fb];B[fc];W[gb];B[ld]SQ[hb]C[A black play at the square will help keep white out of the upper side at least as well as the current move.]
;W[cg]SQ[pj][qf][cn][fq]C[This is small.  White should play at one of the squares instead.]
;B[cf]SQ[mq][jp][pj][qn][cj]C[This is also small.  The squares are all worth more.]
;W[di];B[ck];W[bf];B[be];W[bg];B[ce];W[bd];B[dg];W[ae];B[ch]
SQ[pj][jp][mp][qn][mq][pm]C[This is a middle game move.  Attacking this white group is a good idea, but now is not the time.  Playing one stone on the right side or bottom is worth more than several moves spent attacking this white group.  The squares are all still good choices.]
;W[bh];B[ci];W[dh];B[cj];W[de];B[ee];W[dd];B[ef]C[Several stones have been added here since my last comment, but the overall score has not changed much.  Don't play the best spot in the current fight, play the best spot on the whole board. The squares I marked previously are still good choices.]
;W[fh];B[dj]SQ[ph][mp][hi][hj][gj]C[This is not the best way to attack white.  This white group will have to run to the right side or lower right corner to live. The way to kill it is to cut off its retreat.  You can't do this by making a contact play.  The squares are all good choices to cut off the white group.  Note how none of them are actually next to the group.  You usually can't surround a group by playing next to it.  You surround it by playing about two spaces away. Finally, note how the squares farthest from the white group serve two purposes.  They cut off an escape route, and help make side territory for black.  A move that does two jobs is almost always better than a move that just does one job.]
;W[hf];B[jf]C[This is a better surrounding move.];W[he];B[hd]
;W[je];B[ie];W[hb]C[See how nice a black stone here would be now.]
;B[ib];W[jb]
(;B[ic]TR[ck][cj][dj]SQ[id][hd][hc][ic]C[This is bad.  Black should cut white apart.  See the variation.

Also, this is bad shape.  Any time you are about to make a square shape with four stones, stop and reconsider.  There is probably a better move than one which makes a square clump of stones. Empy triangles, like the stones marked with triangles, are also a bad shape.]
;W[ia]
(;B[ke]TR[je]SQ[lb]C[Capturing this white stone is a small move.  Play at the square to keep white out of the upper right corner.  Rmemeber, the best surrounding move is generally not right next to the group you are surrounding.  See variation.]
;W[lc];B[kc]SQ[nc][mc]C[The squares are both better for cutting white off.]
;W[jc];B[jd];W[kb]
(;B[kd]C[See the variation.  Black is still not playing moves to keep white out of the upper right corner.]
;W[mb];B[nd]SQ[ob]C[The square is better.  This move doesn't make any territory, since white is between this stone and the side.  The square keeps white out of the corner.]
;W[qk];B[qh];W[ri];B[rh];W[oh];B[pi];W[ih];B[kh]C[This is a good move.  It helps cut the middle white group off.]
;W[fe];B[fd];W[jg];B[kg];W[hj];B[kj];W[hl]
(;B[nj]SQ[fm][hn][kl]C[Black should play at one of the squares to keep pressure on the white group.  Once you have decided to attack this group, don't give up and let it go until you have squeezed all of the benefit out of the fight you can.  There is a fairly good chance that white will eventually escape and save this group.  Black should be sure he is profiting from the chase itself, not just the eventual capture.  Black should be building strong walls to support his own groups as he chases the white group.  This way, even if it escapes, black has profited.  See the variation for an example.]
;W[nl];B[gf]SQ[kl]C[This is bad.  At best, this will capture one white stone.  Black should play at the square to keep pressure on the entire center group.  Don't nibble off one stone when you can bite the whole group.]
;W[gg];B[ig];W[hg];B[jh];W[ii];B[ge];W[fg];B[ff]C[Black has captured the one stone, but the white group has at least one eye in the center after this exchange.  White got more out of this exchange than black.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[eo];B[do];W[ep];B[kq]C[Finally, after almost 100 moves someone plays on the lower side.]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[dn]
(;B[cm]C[See the variation for a better way to block white.  Black has been too quick to connect and save one stone in this game.  Sacrificing one stone can be a better choice.]
;W[cn];B[dq]SQ[bn]C[The square is better.];W[bn]SQ[el]C[The black left side group is now in major trouble.  White has both sides of the group undercut.  Black will now have a hard time making even one eye on the left side edge.  Also, the center white group will make it hard for black to run into the center. Playing at the square will give black one eye when the white stone beside the square is captured.  Then black can try to make another eye along the wall.]
;B[bp]C[Black should not play here.  The danger to the left side group is too high.  Black should try to save it right now.  Letting white play first to attack the side group may mean the difference between life and death.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[dr];W[fs];B[bi]
(;W[ai]SQ[ak]C[White should play a monkey jump at the square.  This will destroy most of black's eye potential on the side.  See the variation.]
;B[aj];W[bm];B[bl];W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[el];W[fl];B[ek]C[Black is now alive.  White should play elsewhere.  Playing next to an alive group rarely accomplishes much, except as an endgame move.]
;W[fk]
(;B[fj]SQ[hr]C[Play at the square to strengthen the bottom side black stone. See the variation.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[eh]SQ[ej];B[ej];W[gi];B[fm];W[en]
(;B[gn]SQ[ko][mr][hr][hq][fm]C[This is bad.  Don't try to save the marked black stone.  White will gain too much while chasing it.  This is essentially the reverse of black chasing the central white group earlier.  Instead, make the lower side group stronger by playing at one of the squares. See the variation and compare it to the actual game.]

;W[gl];B[eg];W[hh];B[ns];W[os];B[ai]SQ[no]C[Don't connect here until white forces you to, or unless there are no other useful moves on the board.  The square is worth a point.]
;W[no];B[ag];W[ad]C[   Overall, black spent too much time playing right next to white. Remember to look at the whole board.  The best move may be far away from your opponent's last move.  Both black and white started playing middle game fighting moves before all of the big opening spots were taken.
   Also, when trying to surround or cut off a group, the best move is usually around 2 spaces away from the group, not touching it.
   Finally, once you do decided to attack a group like white's center group, don't stop until you have finished the fight.  You stopped putting pressure on white's group and white started pressing on your left side group instead.]
