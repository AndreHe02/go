AB[dp][pd]C[Dear reviewer,

The settings for this game may seem like a reversed handicap, but it isn't quite so. Chris and I play a series of games where 3 consecutive wins increase/decrease the handicap. Currently he takes two stones. American ranks are somewhat weaker compared to European. Also, I may be a bit stronger than 1 kyu.

I can see two overplays of mine in this game and two missed opportunities.

I don't really know what to get out of this review. I was quite happy with the game, so probably I just want you to wake me up from my daydream and point out my major errors. What disturbs me most is that on average I don't seem to think much deeper than two moves ahead, although I practice my reading skill by studying tsumego daily. I find it very hard to transfer the discipline of reading in tsumego to actual play.

Thank you very much];W[cd];B[pq];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm]
;B[nq];W[qi];B[jp]C[a bit overconcentrated
klin: Agreed.  Should R13, or UL corner.];W[dj];B[jd];W[nc]
C[better high kakari ?
klin: I like R14 better.];B[pf];W[ld];B[ed];W[df];B[cc];W[bc]
;B[dc];W[be];B[jf];W[nf]C[I want the oba at C6
klin: W has to play in this area.  Q18 may be better.];B[ph]
;W[pi];B[ng];W[mg];B[nh];W[cn]C[grabbing sente
klin: W very thin here, needs to keep playing.];B[fp]C[klin: B should P17 attack immediately.]
;W[hq]C[overplay #1
immediately regretted this move
klin: Maybe not for a 2-stone game. :-)];B[iq];W[ho];B[gq];W[en]
C[Black submitted so I return to large points (tewari)
klin: I think it is a strategic mistake to make territory on the left side and give up H5 stone.  Please compare the territory W and B make at the end of the game.]

;B[oi]C[klin: P11 bad move.  B still should P17.];W[rg];B[ki]
;W[of];B[pg]C[klin: If W P13, B P12 (not that W should play it), you can see how bad B P11 is.]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[kb]C[The goal is to make good shape and have either sente or points. True ?
klin: B did not attack efficiently.  W can settle easily.];B[jb]
;W[kc];B[ib];W[mo]C[sente
klin: W can P4 first.];B[lp]C[klin: If B plays P5 or P6 and cut N5 stone, W may be in trouble.]
;W[pb]C[klin: Q18 huge.];B[qb];W[pc];B[qc];W[re];B[qd];W[bp]
;B[bo];W[ao];B[cq];W[mj]C[overplay #2
klin: W is attacking a solid B group.  It is meaningless.];B[ok]
;W[pk];B[ql];W[pl];B[pj]C[klin: B coulde play S6.  It is bigger.  But because of W's mistake (next move), B not bad. :-)]
;W[qk]C[blunder: one space higher is much better
I wanted to make the counterhane at S7 atari, but now Black has R12]
;B[rh]C[fortunately, he saw a less optimal pattern
this is not the most skillful stage of the game];W[qh];B[qg]
;W[ri];B[rf];W[sh];B[nm];W[on]C[I want R15, but it is gote]
;B[ln];W[hl];B[im];W[il];B[jm];W[gm];B[hm];W[jl];B[kl];W[kk]
;B[ll];W[lk]C[klin: Now you can see the center is not as big as it first look.  Nevertheless, B still gains.]
;B[ii];W[gi];B[jk]C[klin: B cuts directly will not work.  Shouls play around G12 first to prepare for it.]

;W[gl];B[hj];W[kj];B[hi];W[ji];B[hg];W[kg]C[Now I lose territory on the left, but I had to play agressively]
;B[sf];W[hf];B[gg]C[klin: B greedy, almost got itself killed.  Should simply J14.]
;W[gf];B[jh];W[li];B[jg]C[klin: B should J14, safe.];W[hd]C[I thought long about the kosumi at J15. First, I don't like that shape. Second, I'll have to reduce the group to one eye at J12 in gote, and I risk to lose a lot of territory in the process of trying to kill the group.

klin: W probably should try to kill.  See my end-game comment.]

;B[je];W[dd]C[Quite a large gain.];B[if];W[he];B[od];W[nd];B[pa]
;W[mb];B[eh];W[ei]C[cutting the keima seems to be too crude
klin: Cut won't work.];B[fh];W[dh];B[fi];W[fj];B[qj]C[klin: This move is very small.]

(;W[cl]C[Looking back, this was a missed opportunity, inspired by fear. I can simply capture 6 stones, and answer the cut by crawling. See var2.
klin: Not big deal.];B[ih];W[gh];B[ig];W[np]C[bad move, loses either sente or points]
;B[op];W[ob]C[klin: W should save O4, N5 two stones.];B[nn]
;W[oo];B[no];W[br]C[From here I don't remember the exact sequence. I still got the big yose at C1, and he got a misfired attack on my big top right group. I eventually lost by 7 points.

klin: Looking back, W has played better yose and still loose.  It proves that W was way behind in the mid game.  Therefore, W should take the chance to kill the dragon. (end)]
