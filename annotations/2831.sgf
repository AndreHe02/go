Black win];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq];W[hq];B[oq]C[is this move right??

patrickb: Yes, this is a good move.];W[fp];B[de];W[ce];B[cf]
;W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj]C[patrickb: It's important to note here that white has a very solid, almost thick position in the bottom. Playing high here gives him a move around D7 that both extends from that and threatens to slide under D10 and undercut your base. I'd play low at C10 here as a result.]
;W[eq];B[cn]C[patrickb: Playing too close to thickness. White can and invade immediately at C8. Holding back to C7 would make more sense on this side.]
;W[bo]C[patrickb: Not bad for w, but perhaps overconcentrated, and helps b make a large area.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[co];W[cp];B[bn]C[patrickb: White should tenuki. Black taking B4 is gote.]

(;W[bq];B[fn];W[cj]C[which move is a better way to respon this move??

patrickb: White's most urgent threat is to connect under at B14, and he's hoping to separate your stones and make one of them weak at the same time. The group on the bottom already has a jump into the center, so the hane at C11 is what I would play - it helps prevent the connection underneath and helps the weaker of the two halves of your stones.]
;B[ck];W[di];B[bj];W[ci];B[bi];W[bh]C[patrickb: This is dangerous for b. White has a lot of forcing ataris now.]
;B[ch]
(;W[dh];B[cg];W[fi]C[patrickb: But black gets a good result because white goes easy on him. Black is connected, white is weak in the center.]
;B[ej];W[fh];B[qj];W[dk];B[cl];W[el];B[fl]C[patrickb: nicely done.]
;W[fk];B[ek];W[fj];B[dl];W[em];B[fm];W[eo];B[en];W[qf];B[qe]
;W[qc]C[patrickb: The threat of R15 is to play Q14, and that is a severe threat. Play it now!]

(;B[pc]C[patrickb: This move emphasizes the top and top right corner more than the right side. White is pretty solid in the top left corner, though, so the top isn't so interesting, and most of black's potential is on the right side. I'd prefer the Q14 more earlier just to keep white from trying anything on the outside and then returning to the corner later. Still, black has a good lead coming out of the opening, so you should be okay here.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qd];B[pe];W[rc];B[rf];W[sd];B[qg]C[patrickb: But again, white gives you a great result.]
;W[lq];B[oj];W[qn]C[patrickb: White is threatening to switch to something like R3 in the corner here so you need to be a little careful.]
;B[qo]C[is this move ok or right??

patrickb: The shape is a little odd... My preference would be to play something like Q5. Keep in mind that black can look to counter-invade at K3 after this, which could be very difficult for w to deal with.]
;W[pn]C[patrickb: A reasonable choice.]
(;B[ql]C[patrickb: This feels strange and a little cramped, since it helps white run out, which he needed to do anyway. Almost a thank-you move.  If your plan is to run out into the center with w and use the strength you gain to invade the bottom, this is reasonable, though I'm having trouble finding a good sequence to do so after playing R8. Did you have something specific in mind?]
;W[nn];B[jc];W[kc]C[how to respon this move better??

patrickb: The hane at L16 should be fine, but this isn't terrible. White is overplaying badly.]
;B[jd];W[kd];B[ke];W[je];B[le];W[ie];B[kb];W[ib];B[lc];W[jb]
;B[ge];W[nq];B[np];W[or];B[pq];W[pr];B[nr];W[mq];B[qr];W[mr]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[jp];W[jq];B[jm];W[mo];B[mp]C[patrickb: no point in playing here now if you can't cut. Using the weakness of the white stones on the right to reduce in sente was enough. Getting K7 and G15 gives you what you need to attack white's middle stones on a large scale. Patience is a great way to deal with this sort of greedy play by w, and you're doing it well.]
;W[lp];B[op];W[kn]C[patrickb: Dicey connection...];B[lo];W[ko]
;B[on];W[om];B[oo];W[pl];B[qm];W[pm];B[nm];W[nl];B[mm];W[ln]
;B[ok];W[ol];B[rn];W[ll];B[mn];W[ml];B[no];W[kl]C[patrickb: Better to play M7 for the connection here for w. Note that black has hurt his chances to attack in the middle now...]

patrickb: Heh. What's the score in the game if you do something simple like taking H18?

White: 15 points upper left, 6 points upper right,  35 points bottom, so about 60 points with komi.

Black: 60 points right side and top, 15-20 points left side, so about 75-80 points for black and an easy win just taking H18.]
;W[ii];B[ik];W[hp];B[gh];W[gi];B[fg]C[patrickb: Very small compared to H18.]
;W[hb]C[patrickb: Game is getting closer, but black still comfortably 10 points ahead.]
;B[ih];W[ji];B[jh];W[kg];B[ki];W[kj];B[lj];W[li];B[mk]C[Black : ccwc
White : CKDUCKS
Black win

patrickb: Unusual to see a resign at this point since it's only about a 10-15 point game. On the whole, I think you played pretty well. White played a very greedy game that you didn't overreact to by trying to kill to much, which was the important thing. A little better handling of the white invasion of the right would have decimated white's bottom side and made the game a blowout instead of just a comfortable win. :)]

(;B[no]C[patrickb: I might try something like this to aim at the invasion at the bottom directly.]
