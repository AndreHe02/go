C[Ted: Hi! My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I've preceded all my comments with my name.

The first thing that immediately jumps out in looking at this game is that both players started playing in the center much too early.  The rule of thumb according to the Go proverbs is that "the third line is for territory, and the fourth line is for influence".

The other big mistake I think both players made was to follow each other around the board playing small attacking moves, instead of looking to play larger developing moves.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dd];W[ep];B[ok]C[Ted: This move is unorthodox.  I think it would be better to approach one of White's stones now.  I'd pick the Q16 stone and play either R14 or O17.

Even if Black wanted to extend from the Q4 stone, it would be better to do it on either the third or fourth line, at say Q10 or R10.]
;W[jo]TR[ok][pp]C[Was this move too agressive?

Ted: I wouldn't call it aggressive at all.  Aggressive would be trying to split the two Black stones by playing something like Q6, or trying to limit the Black influence on the right side by playing under the Black stones at something like R9.

If I were White, I would have approached the D16 stone from one side or the other (probably F17).]
;B[ke]C[Ted: This move, like the last two, is too geared towards the center.]
;W[me]C[Would a knight's approach have worked better?

Ted: White should develop normally, and not worry too much about the center yet.  N16 would be good, as would extending in the other direction, or approaching the D16 stone, or extending in the bottom left by playing something like C10.]

;B[ig];W[kf];B[hf];W[jp]C[Ted: This move is much too slow.  I'd take a big point like C10 here.]
;B[le];W[lf];B[fl];W[ej]C[Would something more along the lines of E7 have been better?

Ted: If anything, this move should have been lower -- on the third line.  You've got three stones at the bottom, and don't need to worry much about Black approaching there yet.]

;B[hh];W[ij];B[jj];W[dg]C[Ted: Good.  Black's been too worried about the center, allowing you to take territory on the side.]
;B[ii];W[hj];B[fj];W[fi];B[gj]C[Ted: Black should have seen that coming.]
;W[gh];B[gg];W[fg];B[ff];W[ee]C[E14?

Ted: Yes.]
(;B[eg]C[Ted:  I think Black should have played E14 instead; see the variations.]
;W[eh];B[fh]C[Ted: Black is focussing too much on one individual stone, and ought to look at the bigger picture.  Black ought to play something like R14.]

C[Ted: There's a Go proverb that says, "The empty triangle is bad.  This move doesn't help Black get an eye, and White doesn't need to respond to it.]

(;W[dj]C[Ted: White didn't need to respond here.  I'd play C17 instead]

(;W[fa]C[Ted: You ask later where you erred; I think this is the point.  You should capture directly at F18.  See the variations.]

(;B[fa]C[Ted: Black should just capture at E17 here.];W[ec]
;B[fe];W[ib];B[fc]C[Where did I make the mistake?

Ted: I think the mistake was when you didn't capture directly at move 94.  See the variations.]
;W[ic];B[cj];W[ci];B[oi];W[lj]C[Ted: Since the two White stones at L/M14 are alive, Black isn't going to get much territory in the center.  Extend along one of the sides instead.  I'd probably play N3.]
;B[nh];W[jh];B[ld];W[lc];B[md];W[nd];B[em];W[ih];B[ji];W[hg]
C[This ko was unnecessary, wasn't it?

Ted: It depends on what you want to do with the stones at J/K12.  If Black had filled in at H13, he could capture those two white stones by playing L12.  Having said that, however, I'd agree that those two stones aren't worth much, and that it's much better to extend along one of the sides, which are still bigger.]
;B[dl];W[ek];B[hh];W[ck];B[hg];W[ja];B[kh];W[lh];B[jg]C[Ted: This move is unneccessary; Black can wait to capture until White forces it.  Black, too, should be looking to extend along one of the sides.]
