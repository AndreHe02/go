version];B[dd];W[kd]C[Hello Donald.

During the Fuseki (opening), you might remember this rule: first
take corners, then borders, finally the center.

Play first in an empty corner: there are two corners left. So
which one to choose ? Play in corner with no enemy adjacent corner.

But at which point ?]
(;B[jd]C[Attacking a stone with a Tsuke (contact strike) is too early
at this stage of the Game.];W[cj]C[White takes an empty corner.]

(;B[ci];W[jk]C[Again, White occupies a corner.];B[dj]C[Surrounding an enemy stone is a good idea.

The Hane (turning move) attacks the stone and tries to separate
the white stones.   But as you played on the 4th line (a bit high) you should not
expect to kill the corner. Use the attack and the threat to force
white moves and gradually build your influence...];W[fc]LB[ji:A]
[ki:B]C[White ignores the threat and makes a Kakari (corner approach
move).   Black Has now the choice. He can asnswer carefully to the Kakari,
or attack the last corner in the near future: playing at A, or
even B, will prevent White enclosing the corner.   Remember: when you play the Hoshi (4-4) in the corner you want
influence, but you can't avoid an invasion at the San-san. If
you want to take the points in the corner play directly at the
San-san (3-3). When you want to secure the corner, after a move
other than the 3-3, you need to play twice.   The 2 stones needed to secure such a corner are called a Shimari.
That's why White is going to play at B as soon as he can !]

(;B[ec]LB[ji:9]C[Here, the Kosumi-Tsuke is not a good idea. beacause it strengthens
White...

Kosumi: diagonal move
Tsuke: contact];W[fd]C[White stones are now stronger.]
(;B[fe];W[ee]C[White 12 separates the stones.];B[ed]LB[dc:A]
C[A bad shape called "empty angle". Try to avoid this kind of shapes.

The problem is that you don't need to connect a Kosumi (diagonal
stones), because it is already virtually connected. When White
will come in 13, play at A, and vice-versa. Therefore you loose
your turn.];W[ki]C[White takes advantage of your unecessary last move and makes
a Shimari to secure his corner.]
(;B[de];W[kf]C[White takes points on the border.]
(;B[ke];W[hj]LB[le:A]C[A mistake ??? White should have answered your invasion and play
at A.]
(;B[hk]C[Playing under the white stones like this is a bit risky.]
;W[le]C[White finally reacts and makes Atari.]
(;B[gj];W[il]C[White should think about his lonely stone on the down-left corner.]
;B[hl]C[Yes ! the best move.

You get eye for your still unsettled group. You make also a threat
to surround. By pushing against the enemy group you get more
liberties while taking  away White's liberties. You also defend
territory.

This is the obvious and urgent local response to last move.]
;W[hd]
(;B[gd]C[Here comes a fight.];W[gc];B[ge];W[eb]
(;B[db]C[moves 28-29: That's an endgame pattern. You block and protect
your corner, but for just a few points.];W[fb]C[Obvious response.]
;B[ea]C[Much too early: a Yose move (endgame).];W[ib];B[id]
;W[fa]LB[dk:A];B[da];W[dl]LB[dk:A]C[White wants to live now. If you played at A, you might have killed
him, and surely got a few points on the border.]

when stones are packed in an heavy group.];W[he];B[if];W[ig]

(;B[ef];W[gg];B[ff]C[Unecessary,  your group is not in danger. Why fill a gap where
the enemy cannot go ?

You loose Sente (initiative).];W[fl]
(;B[ek]LB[gk:X]C[This move forces White to connect its stones.
Beware the cut at X... !];W[el]LB[gk:X][dk:X]C[You must now choose between the corner and the two stones on
the right, because White has two cuts marked X.];B[cl]C[You decide to play in the corner, so...]
;W[gk]C[... White cuts on the other side. His stones are alive although
you could have taken them.];B[fj]C[Good Move.];W[hm]C[Unecessary move : your stones are already (virtually) dead, so
White looses initiative !]
(;B[gl]C[Trying an atari here is worthless...];W[fk];B[aj]C[These two white stones are already tactically dead, even if they
move first. Better attack at the weaknesses as seen before.]
;W[gm]C[Another time White looses initiative...];B[dm];W[jb]
C[At last, White has seen the weakness and connects !]
(;B[em]LB[fh:A]C[An endgame play... prefer connecting at A and prevent White's
penetration.];W[fm]C[Still too early to play endgame patterns ! There are bigger points.]

(;B[fi]C[A bad shape (empty triangle) and it doesn't stop White.]

;B[ej]C[Ok, you connect.];W[gi]
(;B[di]C[Not so urgent.];W[ld]C[Yeah ! White has realized he had such a weakness !]
;B[dk]C[Good, you try an atari.];W[ik];B[dg]LB[cg:A]C[Black 85 is unecessary, you don't have a weakness there. If White
comes in 85, play at A.];W[kl];B[bi]C[Don't take already dead stones.
Each time you play a stone in your territory, you loose one point.
So be sure you have to.];W[lg]C[You can Pass, game is over...]

come now.];W[lk];B[al]C[Again, unecessary.

I hope these advices will help you improving your skills.]

live with some difficult sequence.

It attacks both white groups and prevents yours.   It makes a placement to kill an eye in white group by sacrificing
at a vital point.   It saves the two threatened black stones.

It might also kill and capture the six white stones.];W[hb]

stones.])

with a Shicho (ladder).

Now if it tries to escape you put a ladder and kill the group

it is obvious that Black has won the game !]))

jump). Then White extends his 2 stones... The problem here is
that your stone marked X is very weak now.])

his Shimari (couple of corner stones), is still a good move because

last very quickly, so you should consider taking also territory.]

fast points, but with a very agressive strategy following it.

the best 3-4 point.])

irradiate on the 4th line of influence with the 4-4 stone on
