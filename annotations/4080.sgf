(;B[mq]TR[kq]C[or how else? ^^*

V:

Do you feel you have to answer the white last move?

Determining wether or not you need to answer your opponent's last move is an important skill. In general, this is not obvious.

Because it is not obvious, lower ranked players tend to feel an urge to answer automatically. I would recommmend investing effort in battling this urge.

Right now, you ask me how else you should have played. You are not looking at the game of Go correctly if you think that there is a way of determining how you should play.

You will decide if N3 is a good move or a bad move later on. Look at the example below to see how we can turn N3 in a bad move.]
;W[hq];B[fd]LB[de:A]C[where to approach? is there a rule? ^^

V:

There is no rule. Again, play 20 games using this approach to gain an understanding of its effects on the game.

If you are able to read or you have experience with this position, then you can anticipate that White will play at A.

The question is: will you regret playing F16. This in turn becomes, will you regret it if White plays A.

If you will regret that white plays at A later on, then F16 is a bad move. If you don't mind that white plays at A and you consider this a good exchange then it is a good move (but you need to show us that F16 is a good move).

My experience tells me that this exchange is bad, and that Black should not play F16. But I would not mind playing this game as Black, it looks like I could learn from the experience.

Unfortunatly, I cannot transfer to you all my experience, you must acquire this yourself.]
;W[de];B[ff]
(;W[kc]TR[fd][ff]C[How to handle this stone?

V:

When you played these 2 moves, white cannot afford to let you build a huge moyo by playing in that area.

This is why white plays here.

You have gained a new experience:

If you threaten to build a huge moyo, white will try to stop you.

Now that you have gained this experience, you can apply it in your next game.]
;B[ic];W[nc];B[ne];W[ke];B[eb]LB[cg:A]C[wanted to secure something like a base...

V:

Always a good idea. You also threaten to play at A which will be diffcult for white to handle.]

(;W[qn]C[and this one?

V:

Normally, we deal with invasions by forcing them to live small in exchange for thickness.

But we have already discussed that gaining thickness here would be a mistake because you played N3.

Therefore, we can say that this is a nice invasion by white. White is taking advantage of that fact that you played N3 and invades here.]
;B[qp]LB[oq:A]C[?

V:

I guess that since you cannot go for thickness, it is ok to go for corner territory.

But white can still play A later on.];W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[ok]

C[V:

Very good, you have enclosed white.

Now that you know that enclosing your opponent is good, perhaps you will try to not let your own stones become enclosed?]

;W[ej];B[ho]LB[ml:A][hr:B]C[reducing, but is this the correct move to do it?

V:

Again, I will point out that you will only know if this is good by reading or by gaining experience from this type of move.

Normally, when you reduce, you don't play deep like this.

I'd say a move such as A qualifies as a reduction.

Also, Black can set up alot of aji by playing at B.

There are many possible scenarios. The important thing, is to chose a move that you will not regret later on.

If you feel that you are not very good at handling moyos, then perhaps you should try playing 20 games with different types of reduction and analyzing them to gain a better understanding.

There is no other way, if I could transfer my experience to you, I would. In fact, I wouldn't mind it if a 9p transfered his experience to me, but this is not possible.]

Let us discuss S10.

S10 threatens 2 things: Kill white and play at A.

In this position, playing at A is not as effective as it could be.

Do you remember your "reduction" of H5? Because you played in this way, you made A here less effective.

You probably ask how were you supposed to know that your reduction would not allow reduce the effectiveness of A?

The answer is experience. With experience you will get a better feeling for manipulating the game.

I'm not saying that this position is bad for you.

I'm saying that if you want to become better, you have to stop playing locally all the time.

Playing globally means to take into account all your moves and your future moves when chosing where to play.]
)
(;AW[hk][hl][hm][ho]AB[rj][il][im][jo][lp]LB[rm:A]C[V:

Let us imagine a reduction such as this and that you did not let yourself get sealed in.

Now A is looking to be quite a bit more dangerous for white.

White can probably live, but it is quite obvious that the position is aweful for white.]

(;AW[qk][ql][qm][qn][qo]AB[pl][pm][pn][po]TR[hq][kq]C[V:

Normally, black deals with invasions by exchaning life for thickness.

Why do we deal with invasions by exchanging for thickness?

We do this because it is impossible to kill white. If it was possible to kill the invasion, then that is what we must do.

As dicussed, this is a failure for black, because of N3 and because white has a strong position.

(by the way, dealing with an invasion will not always lead to this, here I exagerated the thickness gained for you to see better what I mean)]
)
(;AW[qn]AE[hq][mq]TR[hq][mq]C[V:

Let us imagine that you did not play N3. Let us imagine that since you did not play N3, white did not play H3.

The way to deal with invasion, is to exchange it for thickness]
)
(;AW[qk][ql][qm][qn][qo]AB[pl][pm][pn][po]AE[hq][mq]LB[iq:B]
[mq:A]C[V:

Black deals with the invasion by gaining thickness

Usually this is sente for black (since black is gaining thickness by threatning to kill white).

If this is sente, then it is black's turn.

Now, if it's your turn, will you play N3?

Of course not.

You will use your thickness to attack. Black will play at B.

Now you have gained experience that exchanging Black N3 for White H3 is not a good idea because it does not allow you to handle a white invasion at R6.]
))
(;AB[jd][cj]AE[fd][ff]LB[jd:1][de:2][cj:3]C[V:

Now that you know that if you try to big huge structures, white will try to stop you, you can try to build less huge structures like this.

I am not saying that building huge structures is bad. For example, you can try to set up a trap for white by making him invade your huge moyo and getting profit from it.

Ask yourself why Black plays 3 here?]))
(;AB[pl][pm][pn][po][pq][pr]AE[kq]LB[fq:B][mq:A]C[V:

Let us suppose that the board is like this.

In this position, would you play N3? Of course not.

In this position, you would extend as far as possible from this wall, all the way to B.

In the game, you commit yourself when you play N3. If, during the game (after you play N3), you acquire a huge wall like this, then you will have failed in playing N3 for the same reason that playing at A now is a failure.

This is how you should look at go. Ask not how you should play now, ask how you should play so that later you don't regret playing there.

Imagine, if you could see the future you could then chose the correct move knowing what will happen. In go, there is a way of seeing in the future. It is called reading. Although it is very hard to be able to read (and it is impossible to read completely).

Another way, which is much simpler, is to use your own experience. Play 20 games using this same opening and analyze them keeping in mind that you played N3, you will then gain a better understanding of the effects of N3.

This is why there is a proverb that says it takes 1000 games to become 1 dan. During these 1000 games, you are supposed to gain experience with the moves you play which you can then use to determine where to play next.

Rank in go is associated with how much experience a player has and how far he can read.]
