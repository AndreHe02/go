C[Rogga: I think this is an important game for me.
About one month ago, I played with this opponent and I resigned. ( I took Black that time. )
After studying some Go textbooks and playing some games, I played with him again, today. This time, I won with White by 17.5 points. (Chinese Rule. B:W=189.25:171.75) I am very happy to know I have made some progress.
But I hope someone could review this game for me to tell me some points I neglected.
Thank you very much.];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[nc];W[pf];B[kc]
LB[pb:A][qc:B]C[Rogga:I think this move is not good.
Maybe he prepare to take A or B, but I never give him this chinese.

(ed: Tom's editor didn't show this move, so he comments from here on like B didn't make this move.)]
;W[oc]C[White has just taken two moves in a row, so I
suspect that there is something wrong with the
Game record.  Especially as there is a similar error much later

(ed: see comment in previous move about this)];B[ob]
(;W[pb];B[nb];W[nd];B[md];W[ne];B[me];W[mf]
(;B[hc]C[Rogga: How did he think? I don't think this move good.
But maybe I am wrong, B really get some territory.

You are right, this is not a very good move.  It is too
close to Black's thickness. He should be looking to
play closer to whites corner, Then if white invades
he can attack strongly.  (e.g 16-2) . However,
this is not a good time to tenuki from the running battle
in the top right.]
(;W[fc]C[Rogga: The corner is bigger than the border, so I
played this move. And I don't want to make B solid,
so I didn't play A.

But this is rather defensive, and still does not secure
the corner, which can still be invaded at 3-3 or by
attaching to the 4-4 stone.  White should punish
Black for leaving the running battle by playing as in
17-2];B[cf]
(;W[df]C[Rogga: I managed to play some kind of joseki,
such as ...

I think    the rest of your comment got lost.

This attachment is not really a very good idea.
It strengthens Black on the left, and any thikness
White builds will not be very useful, as it is
neutralised by the black stone top-centre.

The white stones were in no danger of being in
so White should have taken one of the big points
elsewhere (See lines 19-2, 19-3, 19-4, 19,5)]
(;B[ce];W[de];B[dg];W[cd]C[Rogga: Again, corner is big.

This move is probably worth about 15 points. If you
were worried about the corner you should have played
as in 19-2. There are many bigger moves here.];B[eg]
(;W[ef]C[Rogga: Now, I think this is bod move. I think A will be
better.

Yes.  It makes the classic bad-shape - an empty
triangle.  This move adds very little territory, influence
or eye shape.  If you wanted to contine this battle, you
should have jumped ahead of this stone, as in 25-2  .

However, as your group is  virtually alive anyway,
you could have played tenuki to take a big point
elsewhere.];B[cj]C[This is a bit loose, It doesn't properly guard the
cutting point .     By cutting now you could have
given Black a nasty problem.

At worst you end up with some good aji.

See lines 27-2, 27-3  for some possibilities]
(;W[oq]C[This does not work very well with white's thickness .
The approach one point higher, Aiming to keep Black
pinned down seems better.];B[pq];W[op];B[qm]C[This is loose.  He should play one point lower, to
guard against the threatened attachment]
(;W[kq]C[Rogga: Stand 2 and extend 3. I think this is safe.

This is OK, but hackneyed.  You could punish black
for not making the one point jump.  See 31-2   for
the line.  This would either have cut white apart, or
allowed you to take the corner from him as well as
establishing a position on the lower edge];B[mq]C[Rogga: I never mind fighting with my opponent,
especially on my own territory.

Yes.  I agree. This a foolhardy invasion.];W[mp];B[nq];W[np]
;B[or]
(;W[lq]C[Rogga: Later, if it is necessary, I could run to upper.

This is solid, but slow.  You could prevent Black
running away, and develop your position with 37-2
or 37-3];B[pr]C[Much too small to play at this stage.];W[fq]
;B[iq]C[Rogga: I think this is a good time to enter 3-3.(c3)

Yes.  Invading now is the logical follow up to
your approach.];W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[ The wrong side.  Black should secure his territory
on the left as in for example, 41-2];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[cp]
C[Rogga: I think he should play A instead of c4.

Yes this is really terrible.  Having played 44 he must
connect.  If he wanted to block here he should not
have haned at the previous move.];W[eq]C[Rogga: Capture the stone and connect my stones.

Absolutely.  Because now the black stone at the bottom
comes under attack];B[bp]
(;W[bq]C[Rogga: Get some points, and make my left-bottom
safe. Is this necessary?

No!!  It only makes a couple of points.  It is better to
jump out to  a vital point, and start your attack.
See 49-2 for some ideas on how play might develop]
(;B[dm]C[Too conservative.  Better is 50-2];W[hp]C[Rogga: I want to attack the single stone, and hope to get some territory on bottom.]

     A wasted move. This just stengthens white];W[fr];B[gq]

;W[lp]C[Rogga: Is this good? I think I can't capture these right now.]
;B[ko];W[ho]C[Rogga: Before fighting, I think this connect move is very important. I am afraid that B play here then my stones will be separated.]
;B[kn]C[ Black is out, and that should be the end of his
troubles.      In general it is BAD to attack an eyeless
group with contact moves, unless you can read it out
to a definite capture.  Here you should have chased
 the group at a distance so as to build influence,
somethng like 49-2.];W[mn]C[Rogga: Run, and continue to attack B's stones.]
;B[pj]C[Rogga: I know what this mean. But I think maybe I can
get some exact territory. So I played A.]
(;W[qh]C[This is not a good idea.  Now that blacks group has escaped
your lower centre is in danger.  71-2 is better];B[og]C[Rogga: I think this stone is too close to my group.]
;W[oh];B[pg];B[ng]C[ Here is the second problem I mentioned at the start.

Black has just had two moves together.  This means that
both sides are back to the right number of moves,
but perhaps the record is flawed and the game
is different.];W[qg]
(;B[nh]C[ Terrible.  Black must cut as in 77-2, Then white is in
real trouble.  There are so many cutting points that you
can't hold him in];W[oj];B[pk];W[ni]C[Rogga: Is W80 ,W82  some technique? I continue attack B and reduce B's territory.]

(;B[lh]C[Rogga: B run, but I don't care. I had entered center.
 I hope I can connect upper and bottom.

Black could have played for the big ko fight, by
pushing through as in 81-2.  I think he has
more   big ko threats, so he wins, and keeps better
attacking chancesagainst the white centre, at some
cost to his territory on on the left.];W[mi]C[Rogga: My sente?]

(;B[mh]C[This is poor.  The bamboo joint  (83-2) is better shape.]
;W[mk]C[Rogga: Will A be better?

White's whole poition is a bit loose.  There are
several cutting points that I have already pointed out,
as well as the big Ko, though as Black's lower centre
is beginning to get surrounded again  that is now
more problematic.];B[nf]C[At last];W[of];B[li];W[lj];B[kj];W[kk]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[jm]C[Rogga: I think B had found my attempt. But that is a little too late, I think.]
;W[ij]C[Rogga: My sente again.];B[ji];W[im]C[Rogga: Now the left way is blocked.]
;B[il];W[jl];B[hl];B[km];W[hm];B[gl];W[ik]C[Rogga: Should I connect? Or is A position better?
If I didn't connect with W108, when B plays here, I think he will get very large territory!]
;B[ll];W[lk];B[ml];W[nl]C[Rogga: I think this is bad, playing A will be better.
Later, I will find this.....];B[nm];W[mm];B[nn]C[ Both sides have been careless here.  Black was
asleep and did not notice his lower centre being
enfolded.  White should never have allowed his lower
left to be disconnected.];W[mo]C[Rogga: I don't know whether this is right.
In fact I am very afraid Black plays A.
So, maybe W112 is a bad move....]
(;B[ol]C[Rogga: Black lose his chance, the center bottom
Black group will die.

Not necessarily!  See the nect comment.

There may be a mistake in my reading - but
the cut on the other side looks dangerous to me];W[nk]
(;B[no]C[ This is an interesting try, but the cut on the other side
was better (I think).  See 114-2];W[mr];B[nr];W[ls]C[Rogga: I want to make my eye shpae.]
;B[ii]C[Black misses another chance to cut at 6-4 in the lower
left.];W[hi];B[kh];W[gg]C[Rogga: Again, I divide the B's moyo, I connect my two group.]

or guard the cutting point.]

I just know I must protect the connecting point A.

Yes - this is a very good move.  But you should
have played it a LONG time ago :-)];B[je];W[if]C[Rogga: Too coward I think. Playing A is still ok.]
;B[jf];W[ic]C[Rogga: This is my fault.];B[hd];W[he];B[id];W[hb]

keep Black to a minimum];B[fn];W[eo];B[do];W[ep]C[Unecessary - You already have two eyes for this
group.  This is a one point move that should only be
played late in the ending.];B[en];W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[bo];W[es]
C[
This is also un-necessary.  There is no way Black can
attack your corner.    1,2 and 1,3 are Miai.  You only
to take if Black threatens to connect under, or fills
another outside liberty.];B[pi];W[oi]

 by 162-2.];W[ri];B[rj];W[si];B[sj];W[rh]C[
This is bad shape - Two empty triangles.

It leaves the edge susceptible to nasty cuts, and leaves
a lot of Ko threats];B[qf];W[qe];B[oe];W[pe];B[rf];W[re];B[rg]

 I can play A to save my two stones and
do not worry about these B's stones, right?

You should Connect as in 175-2 .  You are right.  Those
two stones don't matter.];B[od];W[pc];B[oo];W[is];B[ns];W[ms]
;B[fi]C[Not really relevant  to the play.]
(;W[kr]C[Rogga: Make one eye shape, if I can play A later, then the group is alive and the B's group die. I will win.
After this, I think I don't have much to say,


This is sad.  By itself it is a good idea, but black
can still cut/connect, and win everything.

However things have changed, and if you
connect now, black can bring about a Ko for life
