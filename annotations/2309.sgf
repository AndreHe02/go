C[I was playing white. Basically what happened was that black played tsuke against my 4-4 stones two times, and pushed me into sequence, which was very bad for me.

My main question is, how to deal in this kind of situations?

My comments start with "biomorph: ".


neokupo: look out for my variations :)];B[qd];W[dp];B[cp]C[biomorph: This suprised me completely. I thought it was a good idea to extend.

you can take advantage of this..it is a bad move..while it is usually a good idea to stay strong when your opponent plays violent moves, you have a good enough position to play violently back..]

(;W[do]C[this is probably the wrong way to extend; many good results are possible in a cross-cut]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[dr];W[fp]C[biomorph: This felt still pretty nice

this seems giving up a lot; big corner that can still be built upon...]
;B[co];W[cn]LB[dn:A]C[biomorph: Now I feel I should have played tenuki, K4, D9 or D16 maybe. P16 also seems big, but maybe to early for that?

this is far too agressive...you're stretching too thin while leaving a huge cutting point which would make the play worthless (a)
not to mention that a play here this early in the game might be bad..]
;B[en];W[dn];B[eo]
(;W[ck]C[biomorph: I think I should have connected.];B[ep];W[gq]
;B[er];W[dd]C[not the time to tenuki..];B[fq]C[b is now connected and dominant in that area.  the ~10 points you'll get for the corner play will probably end up miniscule compared to this advantage b gets.]
;W[go];B[fo];W[gp];B[gr];W[hq]LB[jq:A]TR[gp][gq]C[bad bad bad..this move does nothing...a is a good extension

the corner thing you made is something to stay away from (triangles)]
;B[gn];W[hn];B[gm];W[pp]TR[gp]C[biomorph: I think this was definetely too far, L4 maybe better?

no!  corner was good to take.  if b invades, serious pincers are available, and your side is fairly strong (triangle)]
;B[pq]C[biomorph: Again, this was a suprise, and I didn't quite know how to handle with it.

cross-cut is again advantageous.  you have an extra stone in the area at all times]
;W[oq];B[qq];W[po]C[biomorph: O4 maybe better?

both are acceptable, but i'd play r4];B[np]C[biomorph: And of course that is what black played.]
;W[lp]C[biomorph: Should have connected, but I was getting worried for H3 group]

[ss]C[well, i hope i answered your question, and if i didn't, i'll try to clarify:

if your opponent uses a tsuke in a weird area where you are stronger (even by 1 stone you can take the advantage) you fight back!  you can get a good position by fighting off the tsuke..

also, fighting should never have to spread across the whole board like this.  it is often good for your opponent if you try to escape an area because of what they can build on the outside.  this is something also to take advantage of.

feel free to ask me if you need more, biomorph.])
