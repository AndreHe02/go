C[Hi, I'll try to make a good review. I'll prepend my comments with j: and I'll include some final suggestions.]
;B[pp];W[qd];B[cp];W[dd];B[oc]C[Maybe this is not a good move to approach the white stone? Should I have played P16 here?

J: it seems a reasonable move to me, aggresive. P16 is also OK, more aimed at influence]
;W[oe]C[I really didn't know how to answer this move. Is R17 a reasonable move?

j: it depends how strong you feel at fighting :-) At this moment I'd rather play a calm M3, and you'll have a foothold there]
;B[pd]C[This is what I decided to do.

J: yes, seems quite standard, iirc];W[pe];B[qc];W[qe];B[lc]
C[I think this result is ok, but white has a better position

j: yes, it's ok IMHO, and even if white has better position, the corner was his to start with, so it's ok.
But your position has a weakness, see var]
(;W[qk];B[qm]C[J: i'd rather play E3 or J3 here, no hurry to go to R7, and not too much to get there]
;W[ok]C[j: this is what's called an induced move. It's up to you to judge if the exchange is ok or not. Me, I don't like the exchange, but it seems not so bad either.]
;B[jp]C[J: good];W[ep]C[J: now he's give you a good chance of taking profit while chasing him. He's played high, so he'll probably have to escape into the center, but you can make some points in the meanwhile]
;B[gq];W[dq];B[dn]C[J: that's the idea!];W[en];B[dm];W[em];B[el]
;W[hn]C[j: up to now, more or less as I said.];B[dh]C[Leaving the cutting point at D8 turns out to be a big mistake.

j: well, that's the way of go, no risk...];W[cf];B[ch]C[j: again, time to consider the exchange (forgetting the d8 issue for the moment).d12 c12 seems a little bit heavy]
;W[dl]C[j: see the var, maybe the problem was not d8 but the answer]

(;B[dk];W[cl];B[ek];W[bn]C[I misjudged and didn't see this coming.

j: yes, trouble now];B[cq];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[bo];W[cn];B[ck]
;W[bk];B[bl]C[j: the problem with this is that it is gote!]
;W[cm];B[bj];W[cr];B[br];W[ds];B[bs]C[Here I thought I would live in the corner, but I was wrong...

j: yes C2 was killing :(];W[aq];B[ar];W[ao];B[gc]C[j: ok ok good tenuki. After a battle, take a deep breath, relax, and look the whole board]
;W[db];B[me]C[I decided that it was most important to prevent that my opponent would get a lot of territory in the center.

j: ok, but maybe you should count, you're quite ok on points, maybe reinforcing is suitable here too. Also, remember it's quite difficult to make a lot of points in the center.]
;W[id]C[j: now he's trying to reduce you... maybe a little too deep, I'd prefer h16]
;B[ge];W[if]C[j: again: instead of trying to kill, think how you can profit chasing it]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[gd];W[fc];B[mg]C[My idea is to get the possibility of invading the territory on the right, as well as chasing the white J14 group.

j: good idea];W[ih];B[hk]C[j: good again, large scale move!]
;W[lf];B[mf];W[lg];B[oh]C[j: good, you did it! If you only were able to take sente to reinforce the bottom]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[ni];B[of];W[pg];B[og];W[ph];B[mp]C[j: perfect. Now only 3-3 is open]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq];W[ro];B[rn]
;W[rp];B[ki]C[This turns out to be not so effective.

j: imho, o7 or whereabouts were better here, the cutting point at q5 makes me feel uneasy. Unless you think you can kill j16, no one is going to make points there.]
;W[kh];B[ke]C[The idea behind this move is, to prevent the white group making eyes. I still thought that the white group could not escape.]
;W[ji];B[li];W[jj];B[lk];W[jl];B[il];W[jm];B[jk];W[kk];B[ik]
;W[kj];B[kl]C[I decided to let the white group link up to the right side, so I could build some territory at the lower right.]
;W[ll];B[km];W[lj];B[mk];W[mj];B[nl];W[nk];B[ml];W[oi];B[im]
;W[in];B[jn];W[go]C[j: you are clearly ahead, time to play calmly and sente.]
;B[gr]C[j: well, this is big, but gote. S17 and C15 seem better to me]
;W[hp];B[iq];W[hq];B[hr];W[ip];B[jo];W[gb];B[ce]C[I had seen the possibility for this a while ago, and now seems to be the right moment.]
;W[de];B[bf];W[be];B[df];W[cd];B[bg];W[gh];B[hb]C[j: good, white should have played there (j18) instead of G12. It was risky leaving g18 behind]
;W[fb];B[ic];W[jd];B[nd];W[ne];B[kd];W[jc];B[jb];W[kc];B[kb]
;W[jf];B[rc];W[rd]C[Here I have the feeling that we are going towards the endgame. Most of the territories seem to be decided, we will now just close them. It is alwasy difficult for me to decide where the biggest plays are.

j: its difficult for me too, I don't find any other way than counting, and paying deep attention to sente issues.

I won't add more comments. Regarding the endgame, I too feel really weak. It's most important to really think if you have to answer a given move, and conversely if he'll have to answer. And resist the temptation to play a long thought tesuji if it's gote!

I think you played a nice game, and had the upper hand most of the time. Probably a little bit more of attention to the sente-gote issue will make you improve.]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[ps]C[i decided to try and kill this group, even though I knew he could live with S2..]

(;W[qs];B[rr]C[This wins the game, I guess.

J: seems as if it was almost won already, but yes, no option for w now.]
