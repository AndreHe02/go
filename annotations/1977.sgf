C[Hi Ripley,

My name is lakeland and I am 1d on KGS.  I'm not normally comfortable reviewing people stronger than five kyu, but I got a friend to help, so between us I think we've made up for the deficencies in my analisis.]
;B[pd];W[cq];B[pq];W[dd];B[jp];W[pn]C[After 7, I don't like this at all. How about a wedge on the third line to the right of 7?

--

Right.  There is a joseki where W plays R3 after the long pincer, but I don't know it.  I would have tried to play that anyway, starting a joseki is more likely to come out better, IMO.]
;B[pk]C[Good move by black.  You've wandered into the chinese high fuseki by an indirect route. 

So the normal reduction move by white is Q5 rather than Q6.  I'd try to apply much of the same stuff.  Also be aware that the fuseki generally makes K4 and K16 miai, so you really want to get there quite soon.]

There is only one move for white here (see variation).  Your move destroys the benefit of K16.

No.  I think you should be expanding your corner (G4).  

In my opinion you are behind so you cannot waste a move on your weak central group. However I think a pro would disagree with this statement, saying you must save the center, and then you can think about catching up.

Besides, your stone just gets cut off, you're in too deep.]

Settling the center is a tricky question.  I think your choice of time to tenuki was bad, even worse than ignoring C11 to settle it.  It isn't entirely true that the center was made weak by the fighting, the J stones helped you settle it.

Yes.  But what to do when you're behind? Take gote and fall so far behind you can't catch up? Or leave it, where black is bound to find it sooner or later?

Incidentially. I do sometimes do exactly what black did if I think I'm ahead.

Counting is more important in the early endgame.  In the late endgame it is much less important because you can work out near perfect play without too much trouble.]
