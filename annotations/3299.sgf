C[---NOTE: White is played by GNU-Go-software!---

Though I've been playing go for a little while, I've never played against a human (Only GNU Go and Igowin) and have no idea what my rank would be... GNU Go is supposed to be about 11-12kyu, so maybe I'm between 15-20? I need to find a go club soon. Any suggestions that you can offer on the game will be quite helpful. Thank you!

io: Dear Jon, telling your strength from games against computer-go is almost impossible. Furthermore, playing against the computer too much, you will learn moves that can only trick go-software. A human opponent will probably not even fall for it once.
So, if you want to get better, find a go club at any cost. Have a look at: http://www.usgo.org/usa/chapclub.asp#PA
or start one in your town, if you can't find one. Especially in the beginning, visiting tournaments will help you a lot, and it's fun, too! After visiting one or two tournaments you will know your correct rank aswell.
You can also try an internt go server, where you can play against human opponents everywhere in the world. (for example: http://kgs.kiseido.com)
In your first game against a human, you will probably get crushed, even if your opponent is not strong. Never mind! Ask your opponent for coments and then play again!
Another alternative would be reading a book (you can't compensate for playing real opponents though). I think "The Second Book of Go" might do you some good. (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/4906574319/qid=1116353338/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-4517195-1890235)
I've included some japanese go terms (and the appropriate explanations).

Always have a lot of fun playing go!];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq]

(;B[qk]LB[qo:A]C[io: You do first play in "empty" corners, that's good! Now I would rather go for "unbalanced" corners (A), if you like fighting you might want to invade at C5 (but maybe you'd like to establish some backup in your black stones on the right first).
Going for the "side" with R9 is also good.];W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[io: This stone seems to be to close to Q16.  There's a rule of thumb that you can jump two, if you have one stone in a row... if two, jump three... without taking to much risk that your stones will get seperated.]
;W[co];B[fc]SQ[mc]C[io: If i was the white player, i would love to sqeeze your stone at H17. With a black stone at N17 instead of O16 white would not dare to play in this region (unless he is very desperate).]
;W[jq];B[mq];W[rd];B[qc]TR[nd][pd]C[io: That's a good reply (standard sequence) but your three stones look a little agglomerated now. You would prefer the O16 stone at N16 now (if not at M16)!]
;W[qi]C[io: White is making a base, so his stones can live if necessary.]
;B[pn];W[cf];B[id];W[gq]
(;B[dc]C[io: Ataching makes the stones strong, that's right for your opponents stones, too. You probably wouldn't want to strengthen your opponent.
Corners are large, but the left side is big too, if white get's it all.]
;W[cc]C[io: That's a somehow natural reply to D17.];B[db]C[io: Here we go... if you wanted half of the corner so much, you could have played here instead of D17, with a much more desirable result. (but in the actual situation you have to go to D18 now)]
;W[ci]C[io: ...now the left side is rather occupied.]
(;B[pg];W[oi];B[ok]C[io: What's the use of this stone? Note: here you have the good connection of P9, R9 and Q6 that the Q13-stone is missing (to O16 and Q16)! ;o)]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[pf];B[ng]C[io: Good one! Did you calculate the follow-up?]
;W[jo];B[dk]C[io: Better late then never!];W[rc];B[rb];W[cb]
;B[ed];W[da];B[ea];W[ca];B[eb];W[de];B[ee];W[pi];B[of];W[rj]
;B[rk];W[mi];B[lg];W[lh];B[kh];W[ki];B[mh]C[io: This desire to catch single stones can be seen over and over again in this game. It clearly is a consequence of playing computer-opponents to often.
Go is not so much about catching stones! Even big groups of stones in the midle are rarely as valuable as a good sente endgame sequence.
(If you played a "sente" move your opponent need's to reply or he will suffer a big loss in the follow up. The opposite term of "gote" referrs to a move that does not require a direct reply, so your opponent has the initiative. Endgame is all about sente and gote!)]

(;B[dj]C[This move worked because of white's response, but it seems like a weak threat that white could have handled effectively enough to kill. Where should I have played instead? (Perhaps black's invasion at D9 should have been handled differently too?)

io: right];W[bk];B[ek];W[di];B[fj];W[ei]

io: This works as a connection, too.];W[hh];B[hj];W[gg];B[if]

;B[mr];W[kq];B[lp];W[ml];B[nj]C[...to strengthen O7

io: Pardon? I don't see a stone at O7!?
Anyway, even though you don't have any sente-endgames, both T9/T10 and N1/M1 are "reverse sente" (sente for white if he plays first), so you would want to play one of these instead.]
;W[ni];B[nm];W[kl];B[ln];W[kn]C[io: White is too kind to answer all your moves insted of playing a big sente endgame!]

;B[fr];W[hn]C[I had overlooked this move];B[qj]C[io: Found that one too, good. :)
Note: both sequences (at R10 and M3) are "reverse gote" (if white played first, he would loose the initiative), so white neglected playing here first.]

(;B[ck]C[io: I think it's the right time for an invasion! Your stones don't need to live on the side as long as you can build a connection to another group. This way you can reduce white territory and white will probably be busy putting up the border lines for his territory (on two sides) needing far more stones than he usually would.]

(;B[qo]C[io: This constellation of two stones (Q3 and R5) is called a 'keima'. It provides an almost solid conection between your stones. 
Attaching directly would make your stones very strong and solid... and unflexible, therefor it is concidered to be bad at most occasions.]
