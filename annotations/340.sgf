AB[pj][dj][jj][dd][pp][dp][pd]C[I played Black in this game.  Please comment on both good and
bad moves I made as well as general areas I should study.];W[qn]
;B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[jd];B[ql]C[Was it a good idea to ignore White's last move and pressure these
stones?

Yes, I think an attack is reasonable.  What you neet to consider is where you expect to profit from the attack.  This particular attack forces white to run out into the center, and you would expect to take some profit while chasing the weak group.   Don't start an
attack unless you have identified the profit first. ];W[on]
;B[lo]C[Is this a good way to keep pressure on the three white stones?

It looks like you want to take your profit on the lower side.  That seem like a reasonable plan.  If you want to move at M5, it would be nice if white forced you to play there. If you played P8 first, white would have to jump to N6, and then your M5 move would be forcing. as it it now, white has some options for this group, and can play elsewhere. P8 would also strengthen the Q10/R8 group, should it come under attack later.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[fc];B[df];W[fe];B[dc]C[This move just takes some territory.  You should continue the attack on the lower white group instead, perhaps by playing S3 to take away white's base.  This move is worth several points by itself, and forces white to start making life, which will make you stronger in the Q10 area.]
;W[iq]C[THis looks dangerous. White now has two weak groups to worry about. The question here is how to take the most profit from the attacks.  Since the black stones near Q4 are strong, I would force white to play toward them, making them stronger, and then attack all out on hte R6 white group.]

(;B[kq]C[I think this is the wrong direction.  You are using your stones to just take territory. Also, the M4 stone looks poorly placed.  It would be more efficient to take territory on the left and build strength with the four black stoned in the lower right.]
;W[fq];B[dq];W[fo];B[dn];W[pl];B[pk]C[
There are two ways you can respond to attachment like this.  You can hane, as you did here, or you can just draw back at R9.  The hane gives white more resources to work with.]
;W[qm];B[qk]C[I was trying to be conservative and connect my groups solidly.
This seems like a good strategy when taking a large handicap


The idea is good, but you should descend to S8 instead to avoid making an empty triangle.]
;W[ol];B[ok]C[this is bad shape too.  If you want to push white in this direction, you should jump to O9. This group now has two empty triangles.]
;W[ph]C[I was not sure how to respond to this invasion.


The group at Q10 is thick, so you could push white toward it.  The white group at R7 doesn't quite have two eyes yet, so you could attack it to get stronger at Q10, too.  Actually, you plan of contact under this stone works well.]
;B[qh];W[qg];B[pg];W[qi]
(;B[qf]C[A reading error. You should still try to connect even if white lives on the side.]
;W[rh]
(;B[ni]C[You should try to enclose white along the side.];W[rf]
;B[re];W[nh];B[oi];W[oh];B[nf];W[mh];B[mi]C[At this point I thought that my group in the upper right corner
should be able to live even if it was cut off from the center.
I also thought that my group on the right side was connected
out to the center fairly well.  Are these accurate assumptions?]
;W[dl]CR[dl]C[Again, I was not sure what to do in response

cut this stone off from its friends.  Just defending the territory is small.]

(;B[cm]C[How many points is this move worth?  I would guess no more than five or six.  The corner is always your territory.]
;W[dh]CR[dh]C[Here you should just separate the two weak left side groups.]

(;B[cg]C[I thought that my stone at D10 could either connect under one
of the white stones or run to the center, so I was not very worried
about it.];W[jh];B[nl]C[White's group here seems weak, so I wanted to squeeze it while
trying to make territory];W[nm];B[ml];W[ij];B[ji]C[DOn't push against the knight's move unless you plan to cut.  It just makes white stronger. J9 is better.]
;W[ii];B[jl];W[ej];B[ch]C[This was to help D10 connect to the upper left side]

;W[li];B[lj];W[me];B[nd]C[This was actually a mistake.  I had intended to play right below
this at o15, but I "missed" my mouse click.  Since my next move
was at o15 anyway, the end result is the same for me.];W[md]

I could then play at t7.];B[hn];W[rc];B[qb];W[rd];B[qe];W[se]
