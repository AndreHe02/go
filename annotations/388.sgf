;B[dp]C[Dear Felipe,n
        A little general remark in the beginning: It's thought of as the
polite way to start a game in the upper right corner. Another effect is,
that it makes games a bit easier to compare.n
        Don't take this too serious, but you will always find players
pleased by a polite opening.n
        Anyway, a good start.;-)];W[pd];B[dc];W[qp];B[ci];W[oq]
C[loks good so far.];B[ce]LB[pj:An][jd:B][nc:C][pf:D][fd:X]
[gd:X][ee:X][ed:X][de:X]TR[ci]C[too cautious!n
        Why not playing in front of W's shimari on A?n
        Or on the upper side on B, creating a kind of double wing?n
        Also C is possible. If W jumps to D, Black plays B, so W will be a
bit overconcentrated on the right side, when playing A then.n
        If you still feel better playing save in the upper left, try one of
the X's, which have more influence to the surrounding. The leftmost X makes
better shape with the marked stone.

Don't be afraid of an invasion. In chasing the invading stones towards the
middle, you can get territory on the upper side and strength in the middle
left, which aids you in getting profit in the bottom left later on.]
;W[fd]LB[pj:A]C[Could have been your point ;-)n
        But for W it's too near to B's strength.

Imagine you played 7 on A. It's as if you now have 2 consecutive moves
against W8. Doesn't this let you think of a pincer move?n
       Perhaps something like the variation.]
(;B[qj];W[qh];B[qm];W[jp]C[good.n
       An extension with effects on the two B stones to the right.]
;B[gq];W[jd]C[the same as before]
(;B[md]LB[mc:A]TR[jp]C[here you realised, that something had to be done on the upper side.n
       It's not too late, but more difficult than a few moves before.n
       Now you are the invader, fighting shorthanded. It's ok to play there,
but I would have tried A with the idea of running out into the middle or
looking for possibilities similar to the given variations. In each case
trying to help the two b stones to the right an destroying W's potential in
the middle.

Maybe you can look for a chance to do the same on the bottom side?n
       You could perhaps connect to the left or help your weak stones to the
right and if the single marked stone comes into motion, make territory on
the left side.n
       I would prefer that side. The fight is somehow the same, but with
better prospects.];W[lc];B[mc];W[oc];B[ld]C[good];W[kc];B[kd]

(;B[lb]TR[hc][ic][jc]LB[gb:A]C[Bad!n
       This helps W to get a living shape. Don't give every atari you see.
Think about the status of groups. The three marked stones are in extreme
danger and you really should connect them to the left corner at A instead of
forcing W to a move he wants to play anyway.n
       To attack, one seldom gives atari. This "defense" connection is the
strongest attack you can find here.n

;B[hb];W[ob];B[na];W[ma];B[ja]C[No.n
      W already lived with move 36! That way you waste possible ko threats
you may need later on.n
      As mentioned before, you should connect to the left corner.]
;W[ia];B[ha]C[you should connect to the left corner.];W[fb]

;B[eb]LB[gc:A]C[A to give up the corner and take the center as shown in a variation
before.];W[fa]LB[gc:A]C[Wrong.n
      W takes the pon nuki at A and catches the Black stones.]
;B[ed];W[gc]LB[ec:A][gd:B][gb:C]C[now Black A, White B, Black C and you luckily save the Black stones.]
;B[gd];W[ec]C[now you need a ko threat. Please think of this situation before playing
moves (like 43) no more worth than that the other has to answer.]
;B[fe]LB[ie:X]C[no ko threat (there are still some. X for example). The ko is favorable
for you and you can get at least a lucrative move elsewhere on the board.n
      But if you're satisfied with the upcoming seki, that's the move.]

;W[hg]LB[eg:A][df:B][de:C]C[W should push B one move forth at A before defending. That gives a
stronger wall and best chances to control the center, attack the weak black
groups to the right or invade the lower left side.n
      Black of course answers at B, giving White no opportunity to squeeze
Black one more time at B.];B[ea]C[See move 43.];W[id]
(;B[if]C[B now has to look after his top right group. Doing that by attacking W is
an exellent idea. Taking vital points also. But be careful not to push the
opponent into your own weak group.n
     W is hardly killable now, so better save this move for later.n
     See variation];W[ig]LB[eg:A]C[W shall force at a A first, then coming back to this move. He will need
it.];B[hf];W[jf];B[gg];W[jg];B[lh];W[jj];B[lj];W[gh];B[gf];W[eg]
C[I told him. ;-)];B[fh];W[gi];B[eh];W[dg];B[dh];W[df]C[Now the squeeze is for no effect than to waste ko threats.]
;B[de];W[ie];B[ee];W[ki]C[ok];B[li];W[nk]C[good];B[ll];W[ln]
LB[nm:A]C[Better at A, closing in the two stones. The black group is out anyway, so
better chase them to get profit elsewhere.];B[mm];W[no]C[That's not much territory with those B left corner stones looking under
the W bottom group.];B[om];W[dm];B[dl]LB[el:A][fm:B][cl:C][bm:D]
[cp:X][bp:X][bo:X]C[A basic technique in Go is, that the strongest attacks keep a little
distance to the attacked stones. The usual defense is an attachment.n
    In this case, I think, you wanted to attack the invading stone. You
could do that better in playing for example A or B, both with the intention
to gain outside strength and a further attack on the white center group or
with C or D, driving him to the center and trying to save the side.n
   But if you estimate the score, you will find that the upper left is save
and much bigger than W can expect in the upper right. If you can take the
lower left corner, it will be at least as big as the lower right corner. So
don't care about his invasion, take the corner, reduce his territory from
the outside and there should no further worries arise.n
   Any of the X's is fine. Play around with them to find the differences.]
;W[el];B[dk];W[cm];B[en]C[You must cut. That peep does nothing for your position, if W connects.]

differences in the score. You will be astonished!]
(;B[mo]C[Why invading instead of reducing from the outside. You're right in
thinking the lower right is vulnerable. But you have about 45 points save
already against 25 for W. Your right side group is still weak. Don't push W
against it.n
  Better play the big point from the lower left side or strengthen your
right side group by pushing from the outside.n

Puh! That was close.

I think, it was a nice game.n
Both of you should try to estimate the score to decide, whether to invade or
reduce from the outside. The latter is to prefer mostly, if you're in the
lead. The next is to think about the status of a group. Is it weak or
strong? Try to strengthen weak groups, if possible while attacking and use
strong groups to push your opponents weak groups against it. Think about the
benefits of sente and how to keep it. Finally, in the early endgame look out
for big points in the corners or on the edge, before fighting hard to get 5
points in the center.n
Thus, I hope to have been helpful and if there are questions concerning this
comment, feel free to ask.

May the fun endure.n
Bye,
