C[[Calvin\]: I am black.   I'm just looking for some general comments.   I'm not quite sure how I fell behind in this game.

Hello,

I will mark my remarks with [ZD\].  I am not all that strong myself, so sorry if the remarks will turn out to be misleading.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[qp];B[co];W[ck]C[[ZD\] This pincer looks a bit slack to me -- distant pincers are useful if they work also as an extension, but this is not the case here.]

(;B[dp]LB[ck:A]C[[Calvin\]: This may not be the best variation here.

[ZD\]  This looks like you are touching a potentially weak stone.  This might make sense if you wanted to either settle your weak stone (but it is not all that weak, considering the situation), or to build a strength to attack A; however, it seems hard to attack A severely just now.  I commented also on your variations.]
;W[eq];B[cq];W[cr];B[bq];W[hq];B[ep]LB[ch:A]C[[ZD\] This move seems small to me.  White can ignore it and play A, and you will end up with thickness facing a strong white position.]
;W[fq];B[ci];W[ed]
(;B[gd]LB[df:A]C[[Calvin\]: Aggressive.   Maybe 'a' (D14) is sufficient.

[ZD\] You are strong in the area, you must play aggressively.  I am not sure whether this particular pincer is the best choice, but definitely you must pincer in this situation.]
;W[cg]
(;B[de]LB[de:B][dj:A]C[[Calvin\]: I'm not sure about this.   Maybe black should start with 'a' (D10) first?

[ZD\] White would be happy to enclose your corner stone with something like B, then.  I think B is a good move.]
;W[fg];B[dg];W[df]
(;B[cf];W[bf];B[ef];W[ch];B[dh];W[bi]
(;B[di]LB[bh:A]C[[Calvin\]: A little soft, maybe.   Could black play at 'a' instead?

[ZD\] A is possible. There are variations that you must be aware of, though.  Playing solidly like this and taking sente shoud be fine, too.]
;W[bj];B[bl]LB[ek:A]C[[ZD\] This move is very small and just asks white to move out.  Your lower group is very solid, there is no need to strengthen it.  If you wanted to play  in this area, something like A to completely enclose white is much better choice.]
;W[fe]C[[ZD\] White is making his group heavy.  You could try either about capturing it on large scale, or chasing it and building teritory in the progress.  Something like the variations.]

(;B[ff]C[[ZD\] I think this move helps white get stronger.]
;W[ge];B[hd]LB[id:A]C[[Calvin\]: Maybe better to skip lightly to 'a' (J16)?

[ZD\] No, this is better. You do not want to play 'lightly' (and give oponent useful forcing moves) in the area where you are strong.]
;W[he];B[id];W[dc];B[cc];W[kd]LB[id:D][jd:C][kd:B][ge:A]C[[Calvin\]: This seems like a strong move from white.

[ZD\] This move of white looks very bad to me.  He will have a hard time saving both A and B.  You could have jumped to C instead of playing D, but this situation should still be fine for you.]

(;B[ie];W[hg]
(;B[ke]TR[gd][hd][id][ie]C[[Calvin\]: I hate to attach like this, but I feel black's marked stones are heavy and require defense.]
;W[nc];B[ld];W[lc];B[kc];W[kb]
(;B[jc];W[md];B[le];W[qd];B[pc];W[qf];B[pe];W[qe]
(;B[qc]LB[ne:A]C[[ZD\] A move around A is more urgent (and sente).]
;W[nf];B[pf];W[qh];B[pg];W[ph]
(;B[rd]LB[rd:B][ng:A]C[[ZD\] This move is small.  Enclosing white like in the variation, or moving out with A is better.  Also, B is aji keshi, see the second variation.]
;W[re];B[rc];W[qm]LB[op:A]C[[ZD\] A would be better for white.  Still, he should  do something about his weak groups before playing territorial moves like this.]

(;B[nq]LB[hi:B][oq:A]C[[ZD\] Approach at A is also possible.  However, you might want to play something like B to attack white's weak groups (with the intent to kill one of them, now).]
;W[pq];B[kq];W[no];B[qg]LB[qg:B][ko:A]C[[Calvin\]: Maybe should defend at 'a' (L5)?

[ZD\] B is very small and sente for you, playing it now is too early (and possibly aji keshi.  A is definitely better, the attacking moves discussed before are also still possible.]
;W[rg];B[se]LB[se:A]C[[Calvin\]: To capture is more than 8 points gote because of the follow-up, but maybe that's not big now.

[ZD\] Again, there is absolutely no reason why to play A now.]
;W[mr];B[mq];W[nr];B[ko];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp];B[jp];W[lo];B[iq]
;W[kn];B[jo];W[go];B[im];W[kl]LB[md:B][ge:C][oh:A]C[[ZD\] You can consider A to reduce white a bit and to built a power to kill B or C.]

(;B[ng]C[[Calvin\]: This fighting has helped white build a large, solid territory on the right.   Black is behind in territory at this point.  White has some weak groups, but I failed to see how to profit from attacking them.]

(;B[gr]C[[ZD\] I think it should be possible to kill white here, see the variations.]
;W[hr];B[br];W[ds];B[rf];W[rh];B[fi];W[fj];B[gg];W[hi]LB[jc:D]
[rd:A][mg:C][bl:B]C[[ZD\] There are still some opportunities (not all of them of course have to work the way I suggest).

White played quite recklessly in this game -- he created many weak groups, and played territorial moves instead of defending them.  Black however missed several opportunities to kill one of the groups. The slow moves (A, B, C) of black contributed to this.  Not capturing with D allowed white to make one of his groups stronger than necessary.]

[ZD\]  This looks too passive to me (from black).  White will ignore the marked stone for now; but that stone makes it very difficult to make a large moyo on left -- white may either move it out, or use it to get several forcing moves from outside.

For white, I would prefer playing A, to avoid forcing moves that enable black to develop his moyo.]

and you played C; the invasion at C now looks too early to me, so tenuki probably is not the best choice here.  I would expect something like the following continuations, after which you have a weak group.]
