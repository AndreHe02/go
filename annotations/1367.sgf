;B[pd]C[I thought it was close, but I lost by 17.5 -- help!

RickMott: Ok, seems like the first thing we need to
work on is counting... :)];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo];W[dj];B[jp]
;W[od]C[RickMott: This is an unusual attachment.  Normally, white attaches underneath the
stone.];B[oe]C[RickMott: No good reason to hane here.  Just extend to Q17 and say
thank you for the nice corner.  Or extend down to Q15 and play for side
moyo with your bottom right stones.];W[oc];B[pc];W[ne];B[of]
C[RickMott: The sequence works out OK for you anyway.  I was expecting white
to cross-cut.];W[ld]C[I feel like I came out with a strong opening. My opponent seemed to be overly aggressive, too quick to play contact, and didn't cover his weaknesses. Of course, I obviously didn't take advantage of these, or I would have won.

RickMott: Yes, you definitely came out ahead on this corner exchange.  White is overconcentrated
and you can make a very large moyo with a move around Q10.]
;B[fc]C[RickMott: You don't need to start the fighting here.  Finish your moyo and make your
opponent come to you; then you can make territory while attacking.  White's san-ren-sei
is so open he can't make solid territory with one move anyway, so there's no rush.
Besides, until the opening is played out further you don't know which approach move
is best.  Offhand, if I were determined to play an approach, I would play F3 first which
also works well with my bottom moyo.  Always look for moves with more than one purpose.
This invasion is single purpose (reduce white's potential) but doesn't help you otherwise.]
;W[gc];B[gd]C[RickMott: Automatic hane in response to a contact play is a bad habit you
need to break.  Your position is much stronger if you extend solidly at F16.
White is stronger locally, so you can't be so aggressive.  White should cross-cut.]
;W[fd]C[Obviously I screwed this up. What is black's best move here?

RickMott: and he does.  Remember your goal here: reduce white and get out safely.
Probably your best bet is to atari H17, atari F15, and connect at H16.  White can't cut
because the ladder works for you.  You are facing out into the center and can run out
easily.  See variation.]
(;B[hd]C[RickMott: This is OK, though not taking the forcing moves first allows White to get
an extra move.];W[ec];B[fb]C[RickMott: The stones cannot escape, but...]
;W[gb];B[fe];W[ed];B[hb]C[RickMottL Yes, this is correct.  You wind up with sente.  Very good.]
;W[eb];B[hc];W[fa];B[kc]C[RickMott: Good move, makes a small base and threatens the white group.  How did you
manage to lose this game, anyway???    :)];W[lc];B[lb]C[RickMott: This move is small, and you give up sente for it.  It would be much
better to complete the moyo around Q10.];W[mb];B[kb];W[kd];B[jd]
C[RickMott: But white makes a small move too.  You shouldn't respond; your group is
safe enough, and if you take a big point on the right now the game is very good for you.]
;W[je];B[ie]C[RickMott: ouch.  This is bad locally and still too small.  Just connect at J16 or don't
respond at all.];W[jc];B[jb];W[id];B[ic];W[jd];B[if];W[ha];B[ef]
C[RickMott: Ok, finally we start thinking about reducing White's potential.]
;W[df];B[eg];W[dg];B[fq]C[RickMott: This is good, too, but I think Q10 area is still bigger.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[dn]C[My corner feels huge, and I managed to bulk it up as the game continued. And yet, it wasn't big enough. I lost the F3 group, which obviously hurt. But is there anything else I could have done?

RickMott: Well, my sense is that black is ahead here. Completing the moyo around Q10
seems good. Maybe a move at O14 could be sente, though; threaten to make it hard for
white to get two eyes.];B[pj]C[RickMott: Exactly where I would play.  You should have an easy game here.  Let's see what
went wrong.];W[qj];B[qk]C[RickMott: This is the right choice.  Defending the bottom territory feels bigger.]
;W[qi];B[qg]C[RickMott: Protect your cutting point first.  Either connect at Q9 or press at Q11; white will
have to struggle to live inside.];W[pi];B[oj]C[RickMott: But this continuation is OK for you.  I would have cut as white.]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi];W[og];B[nf]C[RickMott: Not the biggest part of the board right now.  Wrap at N12, then a followup at
J11, feels much stronger.];W[mh];B[li];W[lh]
(;B[nk]C[This felt good for black.

RickMott: I don't think white can make anything out of these cuts.  I would think about
playing to keep white from connecting.  He'll be too busy to make much trouble. Let's
try a sequence here...  see variation from last move.  Your long-term goal is to close off
the gap between F4 and M11 to complete a huge moyo.  White has only one big territory;
even if he closes off the entire right side, he gets about 65-70 points.  You should get
that much, minimum, on the bottom and still have the upper right corner.  You should
play reducing moves and moyo-enclosing moves, not invasions at this point.  Simplicity
is your ally.];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[rm];W[ki];B[kj];W[jj]
(;B[ji]C[RickMott: Hmmm. This is a tough call.  I think I would cut at L12 and extend to L13 to
separate white instead.  Neither of his groups is securely alive, so he's going to be very
very busy.  If he plays to reduce your moyo, you may catch one of his groups.]
;W[kh];B[jk];W[ij]
(;B[kk]C[RickMott: Too defensive, I think.  Extend at J9.  A white cut won't hurt you, and you have an
atari threat against white's two stones.];W[ih];B[hh]C[RickMott: Why here?  You've been offered a chance to enlarge your moyo for free.
White shouldn't have made a net; he should have played J9, so you should play
there now.  If you're defending the top group, G13 is better than a contact play.]
;W[hi];B[gh];W[eh];B[fh]C[RickMott: You don't need this to live, but maybe it's OK.]
;W[ei];B[gi]C[A waste of a black move, obviously.

RickMott: yes.  Better to enlarge your moyo or reduce white.  E8 perhaps?]
;W[gj];B[ig]C[RickMott: This is not needed to live, and it doesn't threaten to pull out K11 either.  Much more
interesting would be the peep at K13, or the reducing move which should now be F7.]
;W[jg]
(;B[gf]C[RickMott: This is painful, because whte has forced black several times.  If white gets
the first play against this group, black will have to give up 4 stones (8 points).  Let's
see if black has any plays worth more than 8 points...];W[ia]
;B[ib]C[RickMott: We just showed in the last variation that you had plays worth more than 8 points.
Give up the stones.];W[la];B[jf]C[Another waste.  RickMott: Yes.]
;W[kf]C[RickMott: But he answers you, so you get another chance.]
;B[ik]C[RickMott: I like F7 first, because it threatens a reduction in white's territoryif he chooses
to reduce yours.];W[hk];B[hl]C[This was the dumb move, in retrospect. J3 feels like a better move.]
;W[gl];B[hm]C[RickMott: White came out better on this exchange; he has sente as well.]
;W[jq];B[kq];W[iq];B[kp];W[ip];B[io];W[ho]
(;B[in]C[RickMott: Ok, this is probably the losing move right here.  You have to seal white in and
prevent him from cutting off your two stones.  I would clamp at G5; see variation from
previous move.];W[gp]
(;B[fo]C[RickMott: As you saw, white can separate you.  You have to try separating him first with E6.
White can probably make a ko, though, which is unfavorable for you.]
;W[gn];B[gm];W[fn]
(;B[cq]C[Now I'm getting desperate.

RickMott: Yes, but all this will do is strengthen white around you.  You have to
do something which helps your three stones.  The possibilities which occur to
me are G3 and poking at E5.  Look at the variations from the previous move.]

RickMott: Mainly, a tendency to continue to play locally instead of seeking the first opportunity
to take a big point somewhere else.  That seems like the biggest issue; failing to keep an eye on
the big picture, saving or threatening a few stones but giving up strategic advantage.  And yes,
the tactics around the F3 group were critical.  You tried to defend your territory first rather than
look at possibilities for mutual reduction while keeping your outpost stones safe.  You played
quite well in the opening, then let white get too much in the late middle game.

Hope this helps for next time.  :)  Rick])
