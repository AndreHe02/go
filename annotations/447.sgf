C[Eule: I would be interested on comments about the fuseki and
possible alternatives. Apparently it wasn't completely wrong
on my side, since I got quite some center influence, but I never
feel very comfortable in this phase of the game...  Game Name:
Eule-puffo(B) IGS Black Rank: 26k Write Rank: 27k];B[dp]C[



puffo 26k*: Hi!];W[pp];B[qd];W[dc];B[oc]C[This is very standard so far.  Black appears to be interested
in a less aggressive game.  If Black wanted to be more aggressive
the this move would have been an approach move on one of White's
corners];W[jp]TR[dn][cn]SQ[fq]C[This move is reasonable for White, but it is rather conservative.
I would have played an approach move at the square.  If Black
draws back by playing at one of the triangles, then White can
play at 6 and have tentative territory on the whole lower side.]
;B[pj]C[This makes good use of Black's corner enclosure in the upper
right.];W[cf]LB[ce:a]TR[gq]SQ[cn]C[Eule: a seemed to small to me   puffo: I feel that, if I would have some trouble somewhere, I
could be play in a, so I saw a weakness in your c14; "a" would
be a pretty sure lock for your corner, so you should not  have
to play there in future..    This is not a good move for White.  As noted, it does not secure
the corner well.  It also does not reach very far down the side
either.  C15 is the best way to secure the corner.  Playing on
the square at C6 is one way to start securing the side.  If Black
answers around the triangle at G3, then White can play around
D9.];B[cd]SQ[jd]C[This is a bit soon for a severe invasion like this.  There are
still a lot of opening moves worth many points to be played.
I think Black's best move is at the square.  This makes a very
formidable double wing formation extending from the upper right
corner.];W[dd]LB[cc:A]C[Eule: I figured giving up the corner in turn for thickness in
the direction of both black corners would help   puffo: with this move you push my stone toward "a", which give
me some space, and maybe the corner; I think  "a" should be better
for you because, in this way, you tighten my stone between yours
(group d16 and c14), which would made me running away and leave
you the corner and part of the border   White must choose to either contain Black in the corner, or force
Black to run out into the center.  Either way White can benefit.
Which move is best depends on the whole board situation and White's
goals.  With this move White has chosen to contain Black.  White
should be able to build a huge wall facing Black's upper right
corner.];B[cc]
(;W[cn]TR[cb]SQ[db]C[Eule: Let's try to get a moyo along the side...    This is too soon to leave the fight in the upper left corner.
Once a contact fight has started you should almost always settle
it.  If you didn't plan on settling it, the you should not have
started fighting.    Your group(s) in a contact fight are settled when they are: 1)
definately alive 2) definately dead 3) or have 5 or more liberties.

If White plays at the square, then Black should answer at the
triangle.  White will have Sente and Black will be almost surely
alive.    If White plays at the triangle first, then Black will have to
fight harder for life.  White may not end up with Sente, however.

See the variations.];B[bo]C[puffo: I alway play this move, but I know it is a bad reply...
I could have "pince" around c8 or extend around g3   I would respond with G3 here.  The Black corner already has white
stones fairly close on the bottom.  This means Black is close
to being surrounded.  G3 will provide a base to make life if
needed.    C4 is another reasonable option.  This would keep White from
moving into the corner from the left side.  Black would still
need to play around G3 or F3 to close off the lower side as well
at some point.]
(;W[bn]LB[co:a][dn:b][do:c]C[Eule: a,b or c better to help shut black in the corner and build
center influence? puffo: I think b6 was a good reply; maybe in
"a" you'd be more aggressive: I should have to close in c4 and
then you could have play in b6 and finally I had to play gote
in b4   This is a reasonable move if White wants to secure territory
on the left side.  E5 is a nice light move to press Black into
the corner while building center influence.  E5 would also help
link up with the White stones on the bottom.  Finally, Black's
stone at B5 doesn't not prevent a 3-3 point invasion.  See the
variation for a White play at C3];B[co];W[fq]C[Eule: put black into the corner and maybe connect those to sides
for center strength later...];B[er]C[This a weak linkage for Black's stones.  It seems to cry out
for White to cut and invade.]
(;W[fr]LB[ep:c][fp:b][eq:a]C[Eule: abc better (as before)?   This is again fine to secure territory on the bottom side.  E5
is again a good way to cut Black off from the center.  See the
variation for a White invasion at D3.];B[eq];W[ql]C[K16 or K17 is worth more.  D10 is also worth a lot.  Both of
these moves would build on the small walls White has made so
far.];B[qo]SQ[nq][mq]C[puffo: now I felt I had to play against your big moyo   Playing here is reasonable only because of the Black stone at
Q10.  Black can threaten to connect to it and cut off the White
stone at R8.  If Black did not have the stone at Q10, the an
invasion at one of the triangles would be better.  There is more
room on the bottom for Black to make a base for life if needed.]
;W[qp]C[Eule: should I have given up that corner as well? puffo: I think
you did well keeping the corner, wich make a big moyo in the
border together with your other stones...];B[po]SQ[pl][on]C[This is a heavy move for Black.  Black can't expect to make life
on the side, so running out should be the top priority.  Both
of the squares are the sort of light moves that work best is
this sort of situation.];W[om]C[This is a good move to pressure the Black stones.]
;B[rp];W[rq];B[ro]
(;W[oo]SQ[np]C[puffo: If I where white, I didn't like this shape at all! But
I was unable to take advantage from it   This is a bad move for White.  White should be trying to kill
Black here.  You don't kill with a contact fight.  Contact fights
strengthen both sides.  To kill, one should play far enough away
to make a loose net.  Here, a play at O4 would be good.  It keeps
Black out of the  lower side.  Even if Black manages to run out
to the center, White can solidify the lower side while chasing
the Black stones all the way over to the left side and the White
stones waiting there.    See the variations];B[on];W[nn];B[pn]
;W[np]
(;B[sl]SQ[pm]C[This is a bad move for Black.  This stone is too far from the
stone at Q10 to have any hope of connecting to it.  See the variation
for a better option at Q7.];W[rj];B[pl]C[Eule: during the following sequence I decided to give up my 2
stones for lot's of center influence   This is reasonable.  Be sure you don't give up too much side
and corner territory for center influence, however.  It is much
easier to make territory in the corners and sides.  Central influence
is best used as a way to attack your opponent, not make territory.

In the current situation, White has about as much side and corner
territory as Black does.  So, focusing on center influence is
reasonable.];W[pm];B[qm]
(;W[ol]C[See the variation.  It is still possible to kill Black and get
some center influence at the same time.];B[pk];W[nj];B[qk];W[oh]
C[These last two White moves are an excellent job of surrounding
the Black stones.  The Black stones will live, but will not influence
the rest of the board.];B[eo]LB[en:A][fo:B]SQ[bn][cn]C[puffo: too small... a or b would have give me more influence
toward the center...    I would play B first.  White will probably defend the lower side
at G4 or H4.  Then Black can attack the marked White stones with
a play at C8];W[go];B[qh]C[Doesn't anybody want the wide open space on the top?  There are
no real weak groups at this time.  So both players should be
expanding their areas of influence.];W[em];B[jd];W[hd];B[ib]
C[This is small.  Move out into the center at J14.  White has almost
enclosed the entire center and Black should move in through the
last large gap to reduce it.];W[if]
(;B[fa]LB[mf:A][dh:B][ml:D][gm:C]C[puffo: one of my stupidest move in the last months (and I did
a LOT of stupid moves!).. I should have play somewhere around
a, b, or c; or even I could have attack around d....    D12 has some potential.  See the variation for one way it could
work out.    N14 is also good.  The other two spots will probably just result
in a isolated Black center group.  It will really have to struggle
for life.];W[hb];B[ce];W[de];B[bf];W[bg];B[be];W[dg];B[db];W[eb]
;B[da];W[ea];B[bb];W[ic];B[fb];W[ec];B[jb];W[ke]LB[cj:A]C[Eule: should I have reinforced my center dominance somewhere
instead? Where would have been a good idea to do so? Actually
this is a point where I do not really know what to do ;-)   puffo: Don't know when, maybe right now, but I would strengthen
the moyo in the left border with a or something around it...

This move is a light reduction against Black.  Since White is
ahead at this point, a conservative light reduction is fine.
Playing at C10 is also a reasonable move.];B[ch]
(;W[cg]SQ[di]C[White does not have to answer the Peep directly.  White's goal
here is containing Black.  So, something like the net at D11
is good.  See the variation.];B[bh];W[ag]SQ[di]C[Again, a net at D11 would contain Black.  Even if Black connects
to the upper left corner, the score doesn't change a whole lot.]

(;B[bk]C[Playing at C9 is better.  This move makes it easier for White
to surround Black on the side.  Black wants as much room as possible,
so access to the center is important.  See the variation.]
(;W[dk]SQ[cj]C[This is not severe enough.  See the variation for a play at C10.]
;B[ck]
(;W[dn]LB[di:a][ei:c][dj:b]C[Eule: abc all better I think - I guess without this mistake life
would have been a *LOT* easier in the center!   puffo: effectively, this move was really good... for me. My corner
was pretty strong, but my groups in the border were not...    This is a bad move for White.  Playing at E11 is a good way to
contain Black.  See the variation.];B[dj]C[Eule: During the following fight I think I played not so well
- Should have been able to contain black to the side in a better
way, hints welcome!!!];W[ej];B[ek];W[dl];B[ei]
(;W[fk]SQ[di]C[I think playing at D11 is better.  White can't keep Black out
of the center now.  White can cut black and destroy the eye space
on the side, however.  Since White has walls on either side here,
White cutting stones are harder for Black to capture.  White
can just run to one wall for safety.  See the variation.];B[fj]
;W[el]SQ[dh]C[D12 is better to reduce Black's eye space.];B[dh]
;W[gj];B[ej];W[gl];B[eg];W[gg]LB[fe:C][gh:B][hh:A]TR[fb][fa]
C[Eule: This probably should have been at a or b and I would have
had little trouble with a black attack   puffo: I saw your groups in the left without eyes.. I didn't
play well, but I feel I could have kill them... that's why I
would take a look at c, too...    Eule: Since I can kill the marked stones, I think "big groups
live" (or something like that applies here...    Black shouldn't be able to kill the White stones in the upper
left.  See the variation starting next move for an example of
a failed attempt.    White's move would be better at G12.  This focuses more on keeping
Black out of the center than G13 does.]
(;B[kd];W[mf];B[gi]C[Eule: damn ;-)];W[hi];B[hj];W[hk]C[I would just connect at G9.  Either way, Black can cut and generally
make a mess of the center, however.];B[gk];W[ij];B[fl];W[fm]

this...];W[fc]
(;B[ha]C[This move doesn't accomplish much at all.  Save this as a ko
threat.    Black is losing by a large margin at this point.  Both players
should be aware of this.  It is important to make estimates of
the score regularly during a game.  White should play solid,
conservative moves to maintain the lead.  Black needs to do something
desperate.  I would suggest Black try invading at M3.  This is
the largest open area inside White's side territory.  It is much
easier to make life on the side, so this is better than invading
the middle.];W[gb];B[md]C[puffo: another mine big mistake! I was defending a really smaller-then-your
territory instead of trying to make it bigger!];W[le];B[bm]

;B[il]C[Eule: should I have attacked this black stone earlier? I figured
it wouldn't be able to live (correct in this game, I guess almost
always), but black was able to reduce lot's of territory, when
I closed in his invasion.    Was this because of mistakes I made later on or a consequence
of my ignorance of the black stone?   puffo: often it happens that a little, lonely stone, wich you
consider almost died but IS NOT, could give a lot of problems...
if I had counted better, maybe I would have killed your groups....
in effect, you lived just for one "freedom" (?)   This Black stone should not be able to live in the center or
do any important damage.  White was right to ignore it.  In theory,
White should be able to contain anything Black does.]

weakest point I saw in your group was p4   This attack should have been done a long time ago.  It is less
likely to work now that Black has forced White to thicken up
the stones in this area.]
