Played on http://www.dragongoserver.net/
Handicap set according to several previous games.

Thanks for reviewing this game for us!

Simon:
This is my first review, I hope it works out ok...
I'm using a new SGF editor, so I apologise if this turns out to be a bit garbled. If there's any problem, e-mail me and I'll try to clear it up.]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[cc]C[The usual joseki played in ameteur games is white C11. This settles white along the side, but gives sente to black.]

(;W[dn]LB[ci:B][dn:A]C[ At this point, black could consider playiong a pincer, in order to seperate D6 from the two stones at the top left.]

(;B[fp]LB[ck:B][fp:A];W[qj];B[qn];W[nc];B[qf]
(;W[qc]LB[pb:B][qc:A]C[White would normally play this move if black had a pincer along the top. In the joseki which follows, white lives in the corner, but black gets a strong wall.  

Black R16 is redundant because of black R14.]
(;B[qd]LB[pc:B][qd:A];W[pc];B[qh]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
Too crowded? Maybe there was a bigger move for me, along the top or bottom =
sides?  I felt these stones were in trouble and becoming disconnected from =
my other groups.

True, this move is inefficient, but you have the right idea. The black group is now settled and the white stone is threatened and will need to run to the centre]

(;W[ic]LB[ic:A][jc:B]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Berg\]
Perhaps something completely different is better here, like K4?

J17 is one of the big moves remaining on the board, but the jump is too far. I would play K17 or L17.
Other possibilities are C10 or C4];B[jc]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
feign east to go west -- I wanted to try and reclaim some of that lost terr=
itory, but maybe I'm attacking too soon

This move begins a complicated fight. Often, playing right beside a stone can be a bad idea, as it makes the stone stronger. a good idea is to simply threaten the stone, chase it along and make yourself strong while doing so.]

Shall I capture on K18 instead?
[Dennis Wheeler\]
I expected a capture. Okay then, gives me a chance to expand a little more =
then.

A capture is definitely a better option. The resulting shape is very strong, and black loses a ko threat. However, black can still play k15.]
;B[je];W[kd]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Berg\]
Shall I capture on K18 instead?
[Dennis Wheeler\]
I don't think it matters now, perhaps this move was best for you.

yes, one move is much the same as the other.];B[he]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
I'm pleased with my sacrifice and development here so far.


Yes, this worked out ok, but you should have continued with d14]

(;W[dj]LB[ef:B][dj:A]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Berg\]
Again I am uncertain.  Are there other, bigger moves?

The black stones near D16 form a framework for territory. you should eliminate any threat from them first. However, D10 is a very big move and works well with D6.]

(;B[kq]LB[df:B][kq:A]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
seems like my biggest move now. could I have played on the 4th line?

I would advise against playing on the fourth line. white will no doubt try and invade now, and having a stone on the third line makes it that much more difficult for him to settle his group.]
;W[np]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Berg\]
After Black L3 I feel the need to stop Black from getting the entire lower =
edge of the board.
Is this the right thought?
Are there better approaches than O4?

Yes, stopping black here is urgent.
Whatever happens, you're in for a difficult time. Maybe best would be to play  O3 threatening to invade the corner. After black's response, playing on the left of L3 might give you a good chance.]

(;B[qk]LB[qk:A][pq:B]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
probably a dumb move for me];W[pk];B[rk];W[rj];B[pl]
(;W[oj]LB[oj:A][ol:B]C[[Dennis Wheeler=

oops. now I've just realized that I've helped you put more pressure on my o=
wn group above];B[nd]C[your four stones are strong already. They should make at least one eye on the right side, and if white makes any agressive moves, jump toward the center and make eyespace on the way.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[oc];B[ne];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[oh]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
Is this too small? Are there bigger moves elsewhere for me?

It depends what your plan is... You're not making much territory, but the move threatens the already weak white group. If you next attack it from the bottom, you can threaten 04 at the same time, and maybe kill one of them.]
;W[rl];B[qm]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
huh? I don't know what I was thinking (must have been an early morning move=
)
I think I should have played R8 instead

Yes, this looks absent-minded. The bad news is I still make these kinds of moves. I suppose even dans must do, sometimes.
R8 isindeed  the correct move.];W[ql];B[ok]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
trying to make the best of a bad situation];W[sk];B[nk];W[ol]
;B[pm];W[nm]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Berg\]
I am only partly happy with this development.  Black is divided.  But so am=
 I.  The three single stones might end up enclosed.

Yes, the three stones are weak. You should consider sacrificing one or both of P8 and O7 to make sure O4 lives.]
;B[lm]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
hummm... I saw that possibility for enclosement

This leaves white room to escape at N8]
(;W[nl]LB[ml:B][nl:A];B[nj]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
N9 better?

much better];W[oi];B[ni];W[pi];B[ph];W[qi]C[white didn't need to bother defending these stones]
;B[nq]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
Man! I have got to learn to stop attaching! It gets me into trouble every t=
ime!
Again, N9 would have been better? or even M9? 

This was actually a good move. O3 or P3 limit white's ability to make eyes while gaining territory.]

(;W[mq]LB[mq:A][oq:B]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Be=
rg\]
Perhaps P3 is better?
Will that give me a fair chance of taking the corner?

Black can take the corner either way. What I would be worried about is getting the white group to safety. If black kills these, white should resign.]
;B[oq];W[mp];B[ko];W[ll]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Berg\]
A try at bullying my way out.
[Dennis Wheeler\]
See, now I sure wished I had played N9 earlier. :)];B[kl];W[lk]

Later I can cut at O12, so my hope for saving my stones rise a little.]

After white H1, I didn't yet realize my stones were about to die, I thought=
 this move at N2 would help save them.
maybe N1 or O1 would have been better?];W[nr];B[or]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
hummm... maybe M2 better than P2?

Yes, M2 lets you connect];W[lr]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
I should have seen that coming. Good move!

trying to keep my groups connected

No real need...your centre group is not strong, but if you think he's trying to cut, you have three strong groups you could run to.]
;W[cd]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Berg\]
I think C16 might be too small.  Alternatives?

You could think about a monkey-jump at T5, which is in sente, or jumping out to E14 to expand your moyo.]
;B[de];W[df];B[ef];W[eg];B[ff];W[fg];B[ji]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
also trying to keep my groups connected -- but too small? Perhaps there's a=
 bigger move for me elsewhere?

Yes, D8 is urgent];W[eo]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
so much for me keeping my groups connected. Nice cut!];B[fo]

;W[hh];B[bc]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
Seemed like a big move to me -- keeping the corner, with the monkey jump th=
reat from white nearby

Yes, this is one of the last big moves. The endgame starts here, so I'll pretty much finish up. One thing to note is that white has a weakness here. Black cannot be allowed to play J12...]

(;B[sq]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
not quite sure how to respond to this?];W[jg];B[sn];W[rn];B[ro]
;W[rm];B[sp];W[kg]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
I think losing that ko cost me the game ultimately (or maybe it was later o=
n).
I didn't see any other good ko threats.

That ko fight strikes me as being very small, since it is only one stone, and no major groups are threatened by the outcome.]

still a close game, trying to reach as deep as I can];W[mb]
;B[lc];W[lb];B[le];W[ld];B[md];W[lf];B[me];W[gb]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Berg\]
G18 is a desperate attempt at attacking.  With the cuts at G14 and J14 it m=
ight become something.
[Dennis Wheeler\] ouch!

In this next fight, black seems a little submissive. It often happens that a weaker player will simply wait and react to a stronger player's moves, instead of taking the initiative.]
;B[ha]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
I knew that move was big trouble for me, but I mistakenly thought the the b=
iggest threat was if you connected underneath (H19). But at the same time I=
 could see that my K14 group was in trouble also.


That was the correct move, though j19 is worth one point more.]
;W[gf]
(;B[hf]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
ouch again, didn't see that coming];W[gd];B[hd]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
hummm... I think I misplayed that. I thought I needed to connect to save th=
ose groups, but I think now that G15 would have been suficient?

Yes, this was an unfortunate mistake. At this stage of the game, a sequence like this is very valuable.]
;W[ge];B[gc]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
no choice now, I'm short on liberties];W[ee]C[[Bj=C3=B8rn Ingmar Berg\]

I don't know. I thought I saw something that I might have missed before.]
;W[ls];B[on]C[[Dennis Wheeler\]
biggest move I could find?


It's big, but it's gote. playing a move which your opponent has to respond to (A16 for example) is more valuable 99 times out of 100.]

Overall a close enough game. As a general comment, I think that  black should stop worrying about being connected, and just think about eyespace for individual groups.
Sorry this review took so long, but I've had exams in college over the past two weeks, and haven't had much spare time.]
