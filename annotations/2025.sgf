C[Hello, I hope it isnt too early to submit another game. The last review helped me so much. I thought this was an interestign game myself. My main questions are: Is there a way i could have stopped the reduction in the lR? and When should i have invaded or how could I have reduced my oponents L? My last reviewer, Tartuffe, said I needed to make territory in CORNER-SIDE-CORNER. I tried to do that more and keep some influce in the center as well. Anhow, and commenst would eb appreciated.]

;B[pe];W[cf];B[fq];W[fp]C[Brodie: up to here everything looks pretty good.]

(;B[hp]C[Brodie:  This isn't very solid.  White should be able to cut at G3 no problem.  I think H3 would be much safer.]

(;W[eq];B[gq];W[gp];B[iq];W[me];B[jd]C[Brodie:  Very good.  This is the right idea;  taking the territory now would be much easier than invading later.]
;W[lc];B[pb]C[Brodie: This is small.  It's worth a few more points than I thought, but following up your move at K16 would probably be better.]
;W[oc]TR[gc]
(;B[rb]C[Brodie:  This is even smaller! I don't think it's really necessary.  G17, or a similar play would be very good;  K16 is pretty vulnerable.]
;W[hd]C[Brodie:  there's a small variation added somewhere.  Here white makes territory along the top, where black had the chance to first.]
;B[jg];W[gn]C[Brodie:  invading the side now would be good.  It's always nice to be prompt with these things.  Once you miss your chance, it's very hard to fix things.  Also, you could invade upper left corner! 3,3]
;B[fj]C[Brodie:  I would play to make territory still, rather than reduce.  C10 is Probably pretty good.]
;W[kq];B[nq]C[Brodie: .... other side maybe?  Should be okay, but it crowds the left group so  I feel uneasy about it though.]
;W[ko];B[jr];W[kr];B[hr];W[ho];B[ip]C[Brodie: J5.  It's the same thing, more or less, but if you lost by a point......  :-)]
;W[io];B[is]C[Brodie: This is okay; it's good to be safe, but try not to over do it.   Also,  I think F2 would be a little better (just a few points again, but they add up!)]
;W[jp];B[jq]C[Brodie:  This one, I'm sure isn't necessary.   This move could be put to a lot better use.  Black still has the option of trying to make some territory on the left, or invading the top right corner (3,3).]
;W[mo];B[pm]C[Brodie:  This is fine also.];W[jj]C[Brodie:  I think the game is fairly even at this point.]
;B[mm];W[km];B[gg]C[Brodie:  I'm not sure about this.  It makes sense to connect, but I think you could do without it right now.  Once again, the left side is wide open!]
;W[ff];B[ge]C[Brodie:  it looked okay at first, but it doesn't work, it's so easy to cut.]
;W[gf];B[hf];W[he];B[ig];W[je];B[ke];W[ie];B[lf]C[Brodie:  This is fine, but letting your K16 stone get cut hurt a lot.  These past few moves didn't go so well.  The problem was G15...]
;W[kf];B[jf];W[kg];B[kh];W[kd];B[lg];W[le];B[kf]C[Brodie:  This one's kind of small.  If you moved right away, you could still take a lot of the left side.  You still might get away with a small invasion in the corner also]
;W[eh];B[fh]C[Brodie:  Yeah,  connecting is good, and this almost gets you a few points in the middle, but, it's not that big.  The side is still possible.]
;W[ej]C[Brodie:  Now it would be much harder to do anything in the side.  Almost any of your moves up till now could have gone around C9 and would likely have worked out great.]
;B[ek];W[fi]C[Brodie:  How about D10?  Letting white take the side is definitely a bad thing.]
;B[gi];W[ei];B[gk];W[dk];B[kc]C[Brodie:  This is the right idea.  Cut things, threaten things, try and see what you can do.  It works out very well for you!]
;W[ld];B[ic];W[gd];B[lb];W[mb];B[ka];W[oe];B[qf];W[og];B[id]
;W[hc];B[ib];W[hb];B[la]C[Brodie: K18 is essential RIGHT NOW.  You play it on your next move, which is good, but white K18 now is sure to kill that group.]
;W[na];B[jb];W[ob];B[pa];W[mg];B[mh];W[nh];B[mi];W[lj];B[li]
C[Brodie:  I think this move is a little small.  E8 might be good.]
;W[hk];B[dm]C[Brodie:  This one is similar to G15.  Be careful when you extend, you're letting stones get cut a bit too easily some times.]

;W[pr];B[lp]C[Brodie:  I think R2 might be a little better here.  You're showing some good fearless spirit; good for you!  It's good not to let yourself get pushed around.  Still, being careful is good too! ^_^]
;W[lo];B[kp];W[nr];B[mq];W[ms];B[ls];W[jo]C[Brodie:  All is not lost.  I think you still have the option of playing R2 at this point, with quite a reward.  (There are a few variations, R2 works, but there's a slight problem if white replies at R3.)]

I lost by a lot, but i thought that until teh end the game was close. Thank you for your help and time again. ~Erithid

Brodie:  The game was pretty close for much of the game.  Trying to take territory on the left at almost any point would have helped a lot.  The earlier the better.  Try to be prompt with this sort of thing.  You often had the right idea, but just not early enough.
  Another thing, is the plays at G15 and D7.  The were cut very easily, and seemed a little wasteful.  Other than that you played quite well.  Keeping the bottom right would have been a big help too!
  I hope this all helps!  Much luck playing Go!])
