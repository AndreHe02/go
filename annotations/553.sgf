C[Notes for the reviewer :

I have lost this game, by nearly 30 points,
which seems quite a big difference
considering :

- one kyu difference betwen players

- I did not make a big blunder where I lost a
big group.

Obvioulsy, I missed important development
points, but I don't understand where

As obvioulsy, I leave weaknesses in my
groups, but I am unable to correctly spot
them.

Basically, I would like to understand where I
missed important Go rules and behaviour.

Thanks in advance];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq]C[DRS: My teacher says this and C15 are biggest on move 5.]
;W[qj]C[DRS: So I believe that according to him, missing C15 is a lost opportunity.]
;B[qg]C[DRS: This too:  C15 is still begging to be played.]
;W[qm];B[de]C[DRS: There you go; C15 is better for making life.   If you feel this is shaping up into a moyo game, then D15 is best.  This doesn't look moyoish to me tho, so C15 might be preferable.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[ef];B[df]C[I followed quite stubornly the Joseki.
Problem is : I don't know the correct
development after this.

DRS: Joseki, according to Kogo's.];W[nc]C[DRS: According to Kogo's, White E16 would have been joseki, followed by B C9.]
;B[jc]C[I wanted to pincer, and help D14. Any
comments ?

DRS: I think the pincer kind of begs W to invade at R17, which isn't entirely unattractive given the distance of R13 from Q16.  So perhaps this asks W to do a good thing for W.]
;W[hc];B[nd]C[Idea was to let corner go, but get wall
toward center

DRS: Maybe this does have a reasonable chance to give you your wall, but it also attaches to a weak stone.  It more or less asks White to strengthen O17.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[qe];W[rf];B[qf]
C[DRS: I think maybe this is slow.  F3 or C9 or C6 or J3 would be bigger.  I consider C9 fairly urgent.]
;W[rg]C[Up to there, I am happy with upper right
development.];B[cm]C[I still prefer C9 or C6.  But perhaps that's because I haven't studied C7 much.]
;W[ck];B[em];W[ek]C[Now the C14 group is in some pain.  You can extend to C11 and make a base of sorts, but it feels overconcentrated.  C11 does have the advantage of threatening to link to C7.]
;B[gq]C[DRS: IMO, this begs White to jump out to F5 or so, which hurts E7.  I think I'd rather jump out with G9 here.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[er];B[eo];W[di]C[DRS: C14 is really hurting now.  It has bad shape and no base.]
;B[bh]C[DRS: I don't think you're going to get two eyes locally if White decides to harrie this group.  It's probably best to run.]
;W[iq];B[kq];W[gr];B[hq];W[hr];B[ip];W[fq];B[do]C[I was not satisfied with the overall shape in
lower left, and decided to secure it,
possibly letting W exploit H4 weakness

DRS: I agree, C7 needs to get settled.];W[jp];B[io]C[DRS: How about K3 first?]
;W[jq];B[kr];W[cp];B[co];W[fp];B[hp]C[DRS: How important is it to rescue these stones?  They are only two, and they don't separate a weak group from safety - so they are probably small until the endgame.  I think it is bigger to help C14.]
;W[jo];B[jn];W[in];B[hn];W[im];B[gm]C[K6 was intended for securing H4 group

DRS: I think it helps a little.];W[fo];B[fn];W[qh];B[ph];W[pi]
;B[oh];W[gj]C[DRS: W helps E9 and weakens C14 further.  And H4...]
;B[jm]C[I started to fear W right development

DRS: If you are concerned about W's right getting big, how about Q6 or O10?  K7 doesn't feel important to me, and predictably, W's J7 group was strengthened.]
;W[il];B[ln];W[lo];B[mo];W[lp];B[mr];W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[ll]
;W[oi];B[no]C[DRS: Why?  Is N5 an important stone?  Is O6 going to be damaged?  I think N5 was unimportant, and O6 can run to R7 even more easily after this move.  B's increase in territoruy in the LR seems slight.]
;W[on];B[jg]C[I imagined this as helping both K7 and D14 groups

DRS: Agreed.  I like this.  It develops too.];W[nh];B[ni];W[mi]

(;B[kh]C[I think I was wrong here. L10 might have been
much better . I did not see W surround M8
group

DRS: I'm not wild about L10 in my first impression, but...]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[nl];B[nm];W[mk]C[DRS: Wow, overplay.];B[nk]C[DRS: This connects, but does it give the group as a whole life?]

;W[gc];B[ed];W[ec];B[eh];W[qd];B[oe]C[DRS: This feels slow.  If W cuts at Q15, I think W will have a hard fight to save the cutting stones.]
;W[og];B[pg]C[DRS: These two are cutting stones, separating O12 from P11.  However, if you think that O12 is safe connected to G10, this might be small.  If you feel you could attack G10, this is big.]
