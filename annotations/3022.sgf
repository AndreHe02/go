AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hey, this is the first review I've done, and only recently became 11k, but I'll do my best, and try not to waffle to much :-)

Any more questions just e-mail me on LithiumTwo@gmail.com, and I'll keep your game handy to have a look, although I'm only 11k and may not be right.

Also, bear in mind that I have added a large amount of variation, and a lot of it is to prove that certain moves are required or certain things are true, if you don't think you need the variations to help you, just take a quick look, and if you still don't, just leave them and carry on...

Now, on with the review...];W[nc]C[mdm [22k\]: hi

(;B[jp]C[when people play this against me I always get a bit annoyed, it's a very good move and makes white feel a bit helpless (in my experience).

In handicap games the object for black is to simplify the game, and keep it's lead, unless white can get into a big fight, there's not much chance white will win.]

(;B[gh]C[Proverb: "Do not play against thickness"

The idea is that if you are the enemy, playing against your opponents thickness means you are in danger, whereas, playing near your own thickness is bad as it leaves you overconcentrated and ineffective (see the variation from this move for an example)...

The marked stones are almost a wall, and G12 is playing against thickness... a defending move would be nice around the bottom (see the 2nd variation from move 41 for some nice points) or sides.]

I think your best moves are with the circles, especially the low ones as they prevent invasion.

As always, "Score Est." (on KGS) is a bit misleading, but I think you're about 90 ahead in points. So it's important to keep it with defensive moves.]

i thought he would soon try to connect his stone at tengen to the top group and then attack the left side. i had three other options on my mind:

1)somewhere around N4 to strengthen my lower side and to threaten to attack white's group at N6. of course white could run with k6/k7, but that would have left me a lot of points at the bottom (?)

2)k6/k7 to prevent whit from going there and to provide an escape route for the case that white connects his stone at tengen to the top.

3) probably the weakest option was to play the forcing move at F13

I've set this up to explain what the proverb means.
The triangles seperate the different examples.

Stone 2: This stone is much happier, it is a large extension, and it would be dangerous for white to go in between. This move is good for territory, life, influence, and further extension - it's a very nice move.
Stone 3: This just looks suicidal, a pincer would force black to run away, after which white would have another wall, and a bucket-load of territory and influence. Not a very nice move.
Stone 4: This move is much better, it cannot be pincered as it is too far from the wall, and if white tries to make territory between it and the stone, it will end up over-concentrated like with the first example.

[gc]C[[Li2\] The triangled stones die. Black is safe here now.

A nice follow up would be to pressure the circled stones with a move around A, although I think to try and kill them outright would be a bit ambitious (see variation).

After white's response to A, black could proceed with B to make another safe territory.]

(;B[gc]C[I like this move more, here you don't need to defend that cutting point (see variation where white moves H16).

You need to be aware of cutting points, as every now and again someone will come along and move at every single cutting point! (I've had a few games like that - hellish).]

The game has become much simplier for black because of the nice wall, and much harder for white.]
