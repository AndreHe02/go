C[Chris: Dear Reviewer,
Thank you very much for looking at this game. I hope to find fundamental errors in my thinking in this game, and hope you can help me identify the mistakes I make all the time. Not so much the reading but rather strategic decisions, that led to my loss.

I hope to learn a lot from you,
best regards
Chris];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq]C[Chris: My favourite opening as Black for the last few months.]
;W[op]LB[pn:B][lp:D][eq:C][iq:A]TR[fq]C[Chris: I am not sure how to handle this approach. I was considering A so when White plays B, his thickness would already be reduced, but it seemed like a vague approach, as White might choose not to play B.

SGF: 'A' would be wrong for two reasons.  It is only a 2 point extension and so W can make it overconcentrated by attaching at C.  Second, it is not really a pincer against W's stone as it is too far away.  In this situation both B and W have a chance to pincer the opponent and in the process strength their own approach stone.  The questions, then, are how wide and how high. To extend correctly from the marked stone a 2 or 3 point pincer is best.  To balance with this stone a high pincer seems better.  I would play at D.]

(;B[mq]C[SGF: For the reasons given before this is not optimal.  None of the standard joseki leave the B stone to the left well placed.]
;W[jp]TR[fq]C[Chris: This feels weird to me, but I find it hard to respond well.

SGF:  This is a funny move.  W should just play a simple joseki and leave B's marked stone badly placed]

(;B[oq]C[SGF: This is not such a good idea.  No doubt it is big but jumping out is more interesting.]
;W[pp];B[pq];W[qo];B[qq];W[pn]LB[np:A]C[SGF: Not good - 'A' is to good for B and W should play there himself.]
;B[np]C[Chris: This result feels better for black

SGF:  Yes.  B is definitiely ahead now];W[fo]C[SGF: Another funny move.  W should patch up his shape at the right.]

(;B[qm]C[Chris: I wanted to launch a serious attack. Maybe a play a bit further away would have been better?

SGF: This is not a serious threat.  W can just descend and he will be ok. 'A' is the key point.  See the variations.]

(;W[pm]C[SGF:  Not good.  See variation.];B[qk];W[ql];B[rl]
;W[pl];B[rm];W[ro];B[qi];W[oj]C[SGF:  B has acheived nothing.  Rather than play this sequence B sould have been better to concentrate on the lower side and come back to this later.]
;B[pk];W[ok];B[nl];W[ol];B[nm]LB[nn:A]C[SGF: 'A' looks better than this move as the following moves show.]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[on];B[lm];W[mo];B[lo];W[lp];B[mp];W[no];B[ko]
;W[kp]
(;B[hp]LB[jo:A]C[SGF:  This just encourages Wa, which is what he wants to play anyway.]
;W[jo];B[jm];W[ho]LB[nm:A]TR[jm]C[SGF:  Terrible for B. There was no time for even thought it was a key point.  This whole position came about by playing the heasvy move at 'A'.]
;B[go];W[hn]
(;B[gp]C[SGF:  B must push through.];W[gn];B[dr]TR[hp]C[SGF:  Diving to the 2nd line to live here is a disaster. It would have been better to jump into the 3-3 point instead of the marked stone and at leave W's territory undercut from the right.]
;W[hl];B[kk]LB[mj:A]C[SGF:  Bad shape.  It has no effect on the W group to the right.  I would have played 'A']

(;W[oh]LB[qg:A][kn:B]C[SGF:  I don't like this move.  If W preserves his options he can aim at 'A' later.  I would therefore play the variation shown, starting at B, to see how B responds]
;B[pi];W[oi];B[pg];W[og];B[pf];W[ki]C[SGF:  Very nice.  More than compensates for the B side.]
;B[jn];W[ip];B[cq]LB[cf:A]C[SGF: Although a big move it does not seem urgent.  If W plays here B can still live.   I think I would play 'A']
;W[cp];B[bq];W[ci]C[Chris: Now Whites stones seem to be better coordinated over the whole board. Where was Blacks mistake?

SGF:  Already explained earlier.];B[jj]C[SGF:  Nice move.  Solidifies B's group and reduces W's influence in many directions.   However, I am concerned about the size of W's moyo.  Given that it is open in the lower left I think the playing the top star point is bigger.]
;W[hi];B[ji];W[kg]
(;B[jc]LB[jf:A]C[SGF:  This feels unbalanced but it is hard to say exactly why. The W dragon to the right is not severely threatened, but neither is it completely alive, so a 4th line move seems better. This move does not stop a 3-3 invasion in the upper left so it is questionable on that count. 

The point 'A' appeals to me. It puts pressure on the W group while eying the moyo more than the move played.]
;W[ld];B[de]LB[jf:A]C[SGF:  B is now giving the impression of jumping about with no plan.  The last two moves do not coordinate well.  'A' still looks good.  If the lower left were sealed off I would be more concerned about the left side.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb]
(;B[cd]LB[bp:A]C[SGF:  This is not the place for a standard joseki move. if W can attack B in sente then he has 'A' to secure a large territory.  B needs to be more resourceful and cut as shown in the variation.]
;W[bb];B[cg];W[hc]TR[jc]C[SGF: Very bad for B.W is safe but B is not.  The bad marked move is now a liability.  B's game is now falling apart.]
;B[mc];W[lc]C[SGF:  Not very imaginative.  A 3-3 invasion first would be more interesting.]
;B[lb];W[kb];B[mb];W[kc];B[eg];W[ei];B[ck]TR[cc][cd][de][cg]
[eg]C[Chris: This was overplay. Is this the loosing move?

SGF:  Not really. The game is probably lost already.  But it is an overplay.  B is obviously thinking that this stone can connect above or below, but if W plays correctly he can make the top group live in gote and then seal off the side.  Making the marked heavy group is not a good strategy in a situation like this.]
;W[bh];B[gg];W[bp]LB[gg:B][bo:A]C[SGF:  This had to be expected. B probably should have jumped to 'A' instead of 'B' and hoped to make the top group live somehow.]
;B[fn]C[SGF:  Very optimistic.];W[eo];B[gj];W[fh];B[fg];W[hj]

;B[pc]LB[md:A]C[SGF: Hard to believe that this move is necessary.  With B being as strong as he is I would expect that 'A' would protect the corner as well.]
