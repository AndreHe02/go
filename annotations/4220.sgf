C[Dear reviewer,

I feel like I let my opponent capture stones on a large scale in this game.  Could you show me opportunities I had to sacrifice my small stones and/or reduce the size of my opponent's gains?

Thanks!
Duck

Nelis (Lambic): in the following my comments will be preceded by N: 
Hope you enjoy the review];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj];W[nc]
;B[pf];W[jd];B[ce]LB[cf:A][df:B]TR[jd]C[N: due to the presence of the marked stone, people generally play at 'A' or 'B' now.]

(;W[cg]LB[dg:A]C[N: Good!];B[ee];W[fd];B[fe];W[gd];B[dh]C[D:  I'm happy enough here.  I don't think black needed to push me along the fourth line, and I'm willing to sacrifice C13.  I considered playing C11 but discarded it in favor of a move on the bottom.  What are your opinions of the situation?

N: C16 was good to keep black out of the corner.];W[cd]
(;B[de]LB[be:A]C[N: this looks too soft, it gives white a very big sente endgame move at 'A'.

considering where to play next, i think the bottom and the left are more or less miai, what you deny black on one side, he'll get on the other. Possible advantage of playing at the left side is that maybe one time in the future you might gain by attacking the black group, but this is a bit wishfull thinking.]

(;W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[jq];B[pc]C[D:  This seems premature, and I consider moves on the bottom/left.  In the end, I respond, but should I have done so?

N: i think your move was ok. again it is not easy to say wich option is biggest.]
;W[ne];B[ng]
(;W[qn]C[D:  I discard my thoughts about the bottom in favor of invading the right.  Is this the right place?  Or the right time?

N: Again a difficult question ;-) and again, i think it is more ore less miai. I think i would go for playing on the left, because this way, you 'll have territory on top and bottom and black only on the right.

In variation an other idea for invading wich i prefer.];B[ql]

(;W[fp];B[cq];W[cp]C[D:  I block on this side to attack C7 (and perhaps use C13).  I never get the chance, though, so was this the wrong direction?

N: your first  block should be in this direction.];B[dr]
(;W[bq]LB[fr:A]C[N: you could also play at 'A' this is an important point to remember and seems better in this case.]
;B[br];W[dq];B[cr]
(;W[er]LB[fr:A]C[N: if you want to block this direction, you should have played at 'A' directly.]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[aq];W[cn];B[cj];W[dm];B[cl];W[ld];B[hp];W[io]
;B[ho];W[hn];B[ip];W[jo];B[fo];W[gn];B[fq];W[eq];B[om];W[rm]
;B[rl];W[ro];B[ob];W[qe]C[D:  A probe.  Was it a bad one?

N: not if black answers as he did.]
(;B[qf];W[dl];B[dk];W[bm];B[bl]LB[ak:D][bk:F][al:C][am:E][ao:A]
[ap:B]C[N: strange, if white plays there, locally, you would expect him to continue W'A' etc.]

(;W[bd]C[N: bad style!];B[be]LB[ad:A][ae:B]C[N: now we have a set of 'double sente' moves. Play here is about sente for both sides, so it is very urgent to play here first! Considering you lost by 4.5 this should make you think.]

(;W[fl]LB[fk:A]C[D:  Too small?  I considered moves on the top.  I want a strong group before reducing/invading the right.

N: fist see previous comments, second, it is too overconcentrated, there are no problems with a move at 'A']
;B[fk];W[gk];B[fj]
(;W[hl]C[N: again overconcentrated];B[ln];W[mj];B[ge];W[hd]
;B[la];W[lb];B[na];W[ka];B[ma]
(;W[jb]C[N: bad style, you should defend the cut like this if making eyes is important or for another good reason.]
;B[hi];W[he];B[hf];W[ml];B[mm];W[jk];B[ad]C[N: at least];W[ac]
;B[ae];W[bb];B[ec];W[ed];B[dd];W[db];B[lp];W[kp];B[lo];W[if]
;B[hg];W[gj];B[gi]C[D:  I count here.  I count black ~80, white ~65.  This surprises me, because I thought I was in a close game and feeling okay.  This causes me to make to try to use R15.
So...
1)  Is my count correct?  If so, where did I go wrong earlier?
2)  Is there a better way to reduce the right side?

N: 1) my estimation gives black about 4 points ahead, to me this means i should just continue playing my best endgame and wait for mistakes of my opponent]
