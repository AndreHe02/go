C[Comments: Andre Bergholz (2K in Germany, marked with AB)

AB: Two months?? I've been stuck at my level for eight years :-). 



A no-komi game played on KGS. (after the ratings adjustment)

This game wasn't terribly eventful or complicated, but I'm very interested to know where  the weak points are in my game these days.  My margin of  victory seemed pretty small given the number of questionable choices that my opponent made, so I feel that I squandered much of my lead.

All comments are very appreciated!  I have  been stuck at almost the same skill level for almost two months now and I need to decide what I should be working on...]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dd];W[dp];B[pf];W[qf];B[qg];W[qe];B[pg];W[nc]
;B[pj]LB[pk:A]C[AB: Yes, Q9 would be much better.

Black seems overconcentrated.];W[qn]LB[cf:A]C[AB: This move is too early. A "normal" move like C14 would be much better. As Black I would think about ignoring this move.

I don't know how I feel about this move.  Greedy?]
(;B[ql]LB[cn:B][nq:A]C[AB: Not good. Black has five of his seven stones there for this one group, that can't be good. If Black answers locally, a simple move like O3 is good. Tenuki at C6 for example is also an alternative.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[AB: Yes, I tend to agree.

Seemed like the wrong direction for black to block.];W[qp];B[po]
;W[rn];B[qo]LB[om:A]C[AB: Very bad. Just block-in with P7.]
;W[ro];B[rl]LB[om:A]C[AB: Another very bad move, still P7 is correct.]
;W[pm]C[AB: Good. It is important to break out here.];B[qr]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[no]LB[nm:A][jq:B]C[AB: Yes. this one for example. The corner is not completely alive, a solid jump to O7 would be better. Completely risk-free and excellent would be to work against the then useless Black wall with K3.

Some of my moves here were probably overplays.];B[mp]LB[on:A]
[rs:B]C[AB: Ok, but could also play P6 directly maybe. Black S1 is more or less sente as White will save the S2 stone. Then White is not alive, so splitting at P6 is actually quite severe.]
;W[np];B[mq];W[nq];B[nr];W[ol]C[AB: Yes, although these stones are not so important in the first place.

The embarassing thing abouut this move is how easily black could cut off the P5 stones.]
;B[mo];W[nn];B[rg]LB[fq:A]C[AB: Terrible. What is Black afraid of? F3 was virtually the only move here.]
;W[fq]C[AB: Very good.];B[cf];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[cn]LB[id:A]
TR[ec][fd]C[AB: The exchange of the marked stones is only meaningful if it is followed up with an attack around J16.]
;W[jd]C[AB: Very good.];B[cj]LB[bp:A]C[AB: Not bad, but B4 seems more interesting.]
;W[bp]C[AB: Ok, but could also be in the direction of the Black influence.]
;B[jq]LB[iq:A]C[AB: Black is a coward :-). He can easily play J3.]
;W[cl]C[AB: Good. So far, White is clearly on the way to victory. The only questionable move by White was R6.]
;B[dl]
(;W[cm]LB[ck:A]C[AB: I think C9 should be possible without much risk (see variation).]
;B[co]C[AB: What is this?];W[dm]C[AB: Of course, only move.]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[do];W[ep];B[bo]
(;W[eo]LB[bq:A]C[AB: Mmh, letting Black capture B4 seems good for Black. I think White can easily accept the fight. The corner is completely alive, and the outside group is not weak either (see variation).]
;B[bq];W[br];B[ap];W[cr];B[en];W[em];B[bm];W[fn];B[dn];W[gm]
;B[dj]LB[bl:A]C[AB: Not so good. Connecting with B8 is not small. The Black move does not serve much at all and is too close to White's thickness.]
;W[cc]LB[bl:A]C[AB: B8 is sente and good.];B[dc];W[bl]C[AB: :-)]
;B[am]
(;W[ai]LB[ch:A]C[AB: Aehm?? It is much too early for the monkey jump. If you want to play in the area, C12 should be possible and severe, too (ok, the variations are complicated :-)).]
;B[bi];W[ak];B[ah];W[aj];B[bk];W[bh]LB[mf:B][al:A]C[AB: Must connect, of course. But, as I said, you're completely on the wrong path here, this is endgame and rather small. A move around N14 would be much more interesting, for example.]
;B[al];W[ag];B[bj]C[This move was definitely wishful thinking.  C12 seems like the best move.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[cg];B[ah];W[ai]
(;B[dg]LB[ci:A]C[AB: Black needed to connect here, but in general this is a bizarre fight.]
;W[ci];B[eh];W[df];B[eg];W[ce];B[bf];W[be];B[di];W[ch];B[cd]
;W[bd];B[de];W[ef];B[bc];W[ac];B[cb];W[af];B[ab];W[ff]TR[dj]
C[AB: Amazing, how White got a great result here. I think it is originally due to the strategically bad move D10, which was way too close to White's thinkness.]
;B[fl];W[el];B[fk];W[fm];B[ek]TR[fl]C[AB: Black manages to turn his peep into a gote move. Bad!]
;W[dk]LB[mf:A]C[AB: Yes, you had sente. A move around N14 would win the game right away. Still, the game is obviously very good for White.

Slow!  This move looked wrong as soon as I played it.];B[ad]
;W[bg];B[rs]C[AB: Black should have played this long ago, I think.]
;W[sr];B[eb];W[fb]C[AB: Because the game is good for you, you can answer here. If the game was bad, this would be an opportunity to ignore Black and to start complications.]
;B[ld]LB[lc:A]C[AB: Normally, M17 is the invasion point. Looks risky to me though, White is already very stable.]
;W[lc]C[AB: White connects, which is why the Black move is rarely played.]
;B[hd]C[I don't know how well I handled the situation at the top.  I lost  quite a few points and didn't get much compensation.]
;W[ie]C[AB: I think this is a good starting point. White is strong in the area and can go all out.]
;B[mc];W[md];B[kc];W[mb];B[kd];W[jc];B[kb];W[mf]LB[lf:A]C[AB: You did not play too badly in this sequence. Which means that for Black there were still some possiblities in the first place. If anything, this move here is a little slack, maybe M14 would be more severe.]
;B[kf]C[AB: It's true that Black now already has quite some breathing space. Hard to capture now.]
;W[fi];B[ei];W[jg];B[lg];W[nh]C[AB: Good.];B[lf];W[ki]LB[mi:A]
C[AB: N11 would be my first instinct.];B[me];W[ne];B[mg]
(;W[nf]C[AB: Taking is better (see variations).];B[ng];W[og]
;B[oh];W[of];B[li]
(;W[kh]C[AB: If you want to keep chasing, then this move is not so good, see variation.]
;B[ni];W[ph];B[oi];W[rf];B[pe];W[qd];B[od];W[oc];B[le];W[nd]
C[AB: Is this move necessary?];B[qh];W[hr]C[AB: Yes, still White should win.

Trying to play the best  endgame I can...];B[ir];W[hq];B[ib]
C[I lost a lot here.];W[jb];B[ha];W[ga]LB[he:A]TR[ib]C[AB: After the marked stone, there are no more points in the small area there. It is best to just close with H15.]

;B[hb];W[gg];B[fh];W[gh];B[gi];W[hi];B[gj];W[hj];B[hk];W[gl]
C[AB: Bad, if you want to play J9, then don't stabalize Black beforehand.]
;B[gk];W[ik];B[il];W[jk]LB[hl:A]TR[gk][gl]C[AB: Without that stupid exchange you could atari and cut at H8 now.]
;B[jl];W[kl]C[AB: Is the White group alive? If so, all these moves help Black more than White and you should thus avoid them.]
;B[km];W[ll];B[lm];W[ml];B[io]C[AB: Now Black actually has points at the bottom whereas you occupied neutral points more or less.]
;W[ln]C[AB: Desperation :-).];B[mn];W[mm];B[jm];W[hf];B[ge]

[os][ps]C[AB: Nobody wanted to fight the ko at H17? Overall, your game was pretty good, especially in the opening. Black was too afraid. In some fighting situations you missed a couple of important moves that unfortunately can be very expensive at times. Your only strategic misjudgement was that monkey jump, it was much too early for that. The early invasion was also not so good. It seems you like to fight, but actually your strength is more on the strategic level. I think you should try to win with calm moves and fight only when it's necessary.
