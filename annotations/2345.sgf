C[At first, i'm spanish and my english isn't good, so if you see a mistake....:)

I think i'd played good so i don't know where's my mistake/s. A help of you could help me to see it more clearly :)

Thanks


It's great The Teaching Leader and all of yours!!



g: I will review the game for the black side as requested. I added some variations to the game. These variations are ideas, how to coninue the game. If you can find better moves, feel free to use your own moves. 

Gerhard];B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[pc];B[pe]C[I like this joseki, i think it give you territory and influence to the center]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[qd];B[pg];W[nd];B[qk]C[g: This is good for both sides. White is a bit ahead in territory, But black has more influence towards the center.

You say you like this joseki, so I added some additional comments in the variations starting next move. The moves shown are standard.]

(;W[fq]
(;B[dm]LB[hp:B][ip:A][hq:D][iq:C]C[Do you think this is a good response?? Is better A, or B, or C, or D????

g: A pincer is not very attractive here. See variation. A pincer against a stone approaching the 4-4 point is rarely good.

I would have played D6.];W[jp];B[hq]C[I want to pincer the white stone (f3) to split white in the lower side.

g: Bad move. White can capture this stone simply by playing g4.]
;W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[i thought this direction is better because in this way i make a wall

g: Correct. But here, D3 is playable, too. See variation.];W[dq]
;B[go];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co]C[g: C6 were better. With C5, white can play A5 in sente later in the endgame. This costs black two points.]
;W[ch];B[cf]C[I wanted to protect my corner because the wall (5b) is stronger than the corner, so I played here

g: Correct.];W[dk];B[cj]C[It's good??

g: Difficult to say.];W[dj];B[ci];W[di]
(;B[ck]C[g: Black should cut. See variation.];W[eg]C[g: Now white is connected.]
;B[cl];W[fc];B[dg];W[dh];B[ef];W[fg];B[ff];W[gg];B[qn];W[qo]
;B[pn];W[nq];B[hc]C[I wanted to kill the white stone];W[cc]
C[I thought white couldn't live at the 3-3 point because i thought the shimari at 14c didn't let white live]
;B[dc];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[be];B[cd];W[bd];B[bf]C[Could I kill the white group?

g: White has to play annother stone to live uncondtionally.]
;W[kc]
(;B[bb]C[g: This is a mistake. Now white can live.]
(;W[bc]C[g: This is a mistake of white. Now black can kill white.]

(;B[da]C[g: Mistake. White can live.];W[ab]C[g: White is alive.]
;B[ba];W[ca];B[ae];W[ad];B[gf];W[hf];B[he];W[ie]C[At this moment, I saw white could have a lot of influence to the center if i didn't do anything.....]
;B[hg]C[So i thought the best way to destroy his influence is to cut at 13h

g: Good move.];W[if];B[hh];W[gi];B[hd];W[jh];B[hi];W[gj];B[hj]
;W[hk]
(;B[gk]C[I think this is a mistake of mine because white could kill 12h group, doesn't it??

g: Yes, white can play J9 immediately. Black can play K11 instead. See variation.]
;W[fk];B[gl]C[g: Again, white can play J9.];W[fl];B[gh]C[g: This move helps white to get eye shape.]
;W[fi];B[ik];W[gm];B[hl];W[em];B[hm]C[At this moment i started to make a moyo because i thought i had a lot of influence to the center

g: The two groups can not be called moyo so far. However, this move is good because it prevents white from connecting his center group to the bottom right while building influence.]
;W[en]C[g: Now it's very important to connect black's two groups by playing E5 for example, because the white group in the center does not have two eyes so far and the white corner can be invaded at E2.]
;B[gn];W[ep]C[g: Now the white groups are connected.];B[po]
C[g: This is slow and not really sente. To follow your 'moyo strategy', black can play N15. This move also threatens to cut at K16 later.]
;W[qp];B[oo]MA[po]LB[mp:a][lq:b]C[g: This is very slow. Black has created an empty triangle. This is bad shape because the marked stone does not have any function anymore. Black could have played at 'a' or invaded at 'b' instead.]
;W[mp];B[op]C[g: This move only helps white to solidify his territory.]
;W[oq];B[mn];W[of]C[g: This white move is weak. It helps black to build a moyo.]
;B[og]C[g: Correct answer. Black starts to build a moyo now.]

(;B[jq]C[g: K2 is a better choice.];W[iq];B[ir]C[I thought i could cut the 4k group

g: It's not possible anymore, but the black stones can live. See variation later.]

C[g: Mistake. Black should block at H18. Remember: Don't make an empty triangle.]
