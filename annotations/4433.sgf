C[Hi, thanks in advance for reviewing my game!  I play black.

I feel like I could have killed a couple of groups in this match, or at least gained a bit more from attacking his weak groups but failed to do so.

[DC\]: Hello. In this game I felt you played at points more aggressive than you could allow yourself(left centre), you also let white reduce too much of your top right area. I don't believe it was possible to kill most of white's weak groups, and if it was, it wouldn't be easy. White actually gave black here alot of advantage by invading too early or mistakenly. In go a situation can always be read in many different ways. Sometimes it is not clear who is attacked and who is attacking, and the difference between strong and heavy, or light and thin. As we grow in experience we learn to estimate these situations more correctly. Overall I feel your game has good direction, but at some points you don't look on it with the right perspective. There were several tactical mistakes you should take note of, but in that area you're also doing ok.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk]C[I enjoy playing the chinese opening.]
;W[dj]C[and enjoy attacking the sanrensei...

[DC\]: Black has taken the right and white has taken the left. Let's see how it develops from here.]
;B[gq]C[I'm under the impression that the chinese opening favors developing the side facing  the 3x4 point.

[DC\]: I'm not entirely sure there is a big difference, but developing on the bottom cannot be wrong.
I would have, however, chosen the more regular keima approach at F3, mainly because it is the default and everyone can play the follow-ups.]
;W[pn]C[[DC\]: I really don't know enough about the chinese to say this, but, I still highly doubt this choice of invasion. Since B is using a high formation a low approach(R6 or R5) will be natural as it will allow white to get territory by sliding in at S3 or S9. Moreover, the two-point approach move to the 3-4 is rather rare, and with Q8 in place it looks to me even harder to play that way.]
;B[np];W[ql];B[qk];W[qp];B[qq];W[rk]C[I'm pretty sure this is an overplay by white, but am not sure how to punish it.  Q8?

[DC\] : I don't think this is an overplay. White's in a very bad position here - White can't be confident of even a single eye, and b got moves like R3 and R9 for free, which are worth alot.]

(;B[rj]C[I think this move is too defensive.

[DC\] : White has just forced B to strengthen this area. If B wants he can ignore but, ...]
;W[sk]C[[DC\] : The descend to the edge in these engame shapes is in about 95% percent of cases not the best option. Not only it gives Black a nice sente follow-up, it leaves the cut undefended and thus allows B to peep at R7 for example. Just connecting would be better.]

(;B[sj]C[Slow I know.  I think I should invade at S7.

[DC\]: Better tenuki than play here. Or attacking. This is not really necessary at this point because there isn't much white can do here, and now the option of w R10 is worse. This also forces white to defend her own weaknesses.]
;W[rm]C[Thought of invading at R5, but nothing I read out at this point would kill white.

[DC\]: You don't always have to think about killing; while white here looks pretty bad, I'm convinced she can easily make life or run towards the centre. Black can be satisfied so far because he gained more from this invasion.]

(;B[jd]C[[DC\]: I think this is bigger than any attacking attempt at this phase of the game. Black can't make a real threat for white, so better play in a big open area, like the top or bottom.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]
(;W[rd]C[[DC\]: In the joseki, white S16 should be at P18, and for a reason. See my comments later on.]
;B[re];W[rc]
(;B[qf]C[[DC\]: Because white did not play at P18 instead of S16, black now has the option of descending to P18. If white will not be able to kill any external black stones, this white group is dead.]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc]C[[DC\]: At this point, when a local sequence came to a stop, it is time to take a new look at the board and reconsider whatever it is you're planning to do.
So: White has about 10 points in top right corner, and about 5 at S7, which can perhaps be attacked later. White also has a big moyo on the left which is probably going to become the next fight in the game.
Black has around R12, let's say, 25 points, and in bottom right corner for sure atleast 10 points. The L3 area is still open to invasion but is also a nice potential territory for b.

So in terms of solid territory black holds the advantage, even though you'd expect differently because it's been white who invaded twice here.(It's the white invasions that gave black all his territory)
The goals of the players should be: surround/destroy k3 area, surround/reduce around L10, and of course, do whatever you can with the moyo on the left.
So let's get to it.];W[jj];B[dg]C[[DC\]: Good to invade now. Maybe it would be easier though to make a second approach to D4, as it will also put white in trouble.]
;W[gc];B[cl]C[[DC\]: Looks like black is creating here two weak groups.]
;W[cj]C[[DC\]: I'm not sure I like this move for white; looks very heavy. Maybe E9?]
;B[fj]C[[DC\]: This is rather irresponsible of black to attack white like this.
White isn't short of ways to seperate the three b stones, which would mean three black weak groups.
This b enclosure is simply too loose, and white has support.
White can break free with any of the points F11, E11, and E12, and with some reading on her part this should not be a challange.]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[cm]C[I was surprised at the cut here, but was happy with the result.]
;B[dn];W[ck]
(;B[cn]C[[DC\]: It is better here to make a sacrifical tesuji by playing B8.]
;W[bl]C[At];B[cq]C[Instead of attacking inside here, perhaps E5?  If he responds with D4, it weakens my D6 group from simply being weak, to likely dead.

[DC\]: This looks ok to me. I don't think blocking white on the outside will kill, also because of B5 being open, so this way black gains territory and now chases D4.
With some luck this should make the L3 area almost solid territory as white will be pushed against it.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[fm];W[go];B[ho];W[gm];B[gl]
;W[hn];B[io]C[Better shape move here?  Connect?  At H4

[DC\]: Connecting at H4 makes a heavy shape and doesn't apply pressure on white. This looks to me the only option.]
;W[hl];B[gk];W[jp];B[iq]C[[DC\]: Correct defence.];W[ko]C[better move at K6? Or perhaps M3..  My goal was to attack the weak groups while stabilizing the right corner group.]
;B[lp]C[[DC\]: As you said, black can also try to seperate the two white groups. But I'm not sure it will be useful enough in this position to be worth more than a move connecting black(if white let's b have one...).]
;W[lo];B[kq];W[jq];B[jr];W[kp];B[lq];W[in];B[jo]C[[DC\]: Black tenuki here. There is still alot to be done; M11, C17.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[lm]C[Good net on his part.

[DC\]: White also had some combinations possible with H4, J2 and L2, but I think this is potentially bigger than capturing three stones in gote.]
;B[km];W[kl];B[ip];W[mo];B[no];W[mj];B[cc]C[Is this an overplay?  He lets me get away with it.

[DC\]: "Get away with it" - this sounds like the 3-3 invasion is not supposed to work. Usually whether the invasion works or not can be seen visually, the bigger question is should we invade?
Invasion at 3-3 gives you territory and the opponent thickness. On an empty board this is not to your advantage.
Here, we need to see what can what gain from b invading. Well, supposing now white blocks at C16, the natural move, follow-ups for white will probably be attempts to make the C13 area territory, hoping with the D13 stone included. B just needs to ask if he's willing to risk it, what is bigger.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce];W[jb]C[[DC\]: To me this feels like white let be off easily. B got a big area and white practically nothing. The D13 stone became useful and now the C9 group doesn't look too happy.]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb]C[I push down here, figuring that I can give up first line territory... while trying to establish a wall ..

[DC\]: It's not giving up first line territory; you can't prevent white having it. This just reduces white and makes preparations to surround things in the centre.]
;B[gd];W[fc];B[fn];W[gn];B[oi];W[ng];B[og]C[[DC\]: O13 is a big over-extension. I would cut straight away with N12 or N11 and there's nothing white can do. I'm not even sure the 'normal' knight's move would work for white.]
;W[nf];B[of];W[ne];B[nh];W[mh];B[mi];W[lh];B[ff]C[Trying to seal the the group in.  Perhaps better move at B12?

[DC\]: There is not much use in sealing this group, because it is clearly alive, and it can also connect to O18. This move doesn't create territory for black and actually just gives black weaknesses to worry about. B12, as you suggested, will be a better move.]
;W[bg];B[bh];W[ch];B[cg]

;B[cb]C[[DC\]: Leaving O12 like this is not recommended at this point of the game. For white to capture it will be big because it creates two dangerous cuts for black and is sente. Black should connect at P12 or alternatively play P10 at O11 which would also be profitable.]

;W[tt];B[ma];W[ra];B[oa];W[pb];B[jh]C[[DC\]: Some conclusions: the R14 area had been greatly reduced, white got alot of plays against it, and then white even broke in, so now it is only 10(8) points, instead of the original 25 point assesment. This is a big difference, black let white too much there. If black would have cut white's ogeima it would have been already atleast 20 points better.]

(;B[ob]C[[DC\]: White is technically dead here because if Q18 b T16.
There is a useful rule: "The L group is dead". http://senseis.xmp.net/?LGroup does a good job explaining the variations; I would recommend learning and understanding the L group as it occurs very often.
White is only 'technically' dead though, since a cut at R15 can cause serious problems.
I've put some possible variations, but I can't hope to cover it all, and even if it wouldn't have worked for black, P18 is useful to know.]
;W[qe];B[rf]
(;W[qj];B[ri]C[[DC\]: The T10 stone gets in the way of black by reducing a liberty that can be essential, that's another reason why not to play it.]

(;B[rg]C[[DC\]: This looks like it works but as you can tell there is no end to the mess white can cause.]

(;W[qi]C[[DC\]: Another possibility. Of course black can let white have T10 if he wants, but better have it all, if you can.]
;B[qj];W[qg]C[[DC\]: This is dangerous, but I think black will make it.]

(;W[ob]C[[DC\]: If white plays by the joseki,]
(;B[nc]C[[DC\]: Black must extend to prevent white from escaping to the third line.(There is also the double hane, see variation)]

(;B[nb]C[[DC\]: Double hane: black gets corner, white gets outside.]
;W[nc];B[od];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[qb]C[[DC\]: This may seem to you the better option for black, but I really don't like this. Even though black gained the corner, there is still too much weaknesses(aji) around R11, so this is hardly solid territory, and white got a ponnuki(the diamond shape O19 P18 O17 & N18) which exerts influence and now white can attack K16. K16 is on 4th line with no territory and surrounded by enemies. Think about w N15 now.]
