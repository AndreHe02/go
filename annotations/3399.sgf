C[buckyyowza: Hello, additional comments my Mark Fyffe.  It appears that this game is commented quite a bit already, so I will simply join in the conversation ;-)  All my comments are prefixed by 'buckyyowza', and for what it is worth I am 3k on IGS.  Since this was obviously a long game in which both players did a lot of thinking, I do not have any overall comments except one: Just because you've got a lot of time to think do not avoid playing the obvious move.  All too often, both players are prone to experiment with tenuki too early ;-)

Thank you for this opportunity!  In all this has been quite an interesting game to review, and doubly a challenging one to comment!  I hope that you learn from my comments, and that I have proofread my variations well enough to trust that they are sane ;-)  Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions about this game or concerns about the validity of anything I have added.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp]C[buckyyowza: white's play at D4 is correct.  P17 is playable, but as you say, is very complicated.  A black play at P17 on the next move is very solid, but is also gote so there is no need for white to worry. Unless you've got the experience of a professional player, or are simply looking for trouble ;-), it is best to keep the opening simple and play moves that you understand and are very comfortable with.  Otherwise, the game is likely to run beyond your grasp and become less enjoyable.  You may have heard the proverb "study joseki and lose 4 stones" - this means that when you play opening sequences that you don't fully understand, the rest of your game will suffer dramatically.  Of course, you shouldn't avoid learning new techniques, just do it sparingly.

The Go Teacher: since we are supposed to comment ...

I think it is advised to play p17, because, now you will play it, and you will get a very strong position on the right.
But i hate to play it, because the follow up that I have been shown, with c4, r5, q15 seems so complicated to me that I feel already completely lost after 7 moves.
So d4 looks safer for now, but I know i will have to dive into the right side sooner or later (preferably sooner), and it will be less comfortable by then.]
;B[ce]LB[oc:B][fq:A]C[buckyyowza: Kakari is an excellent choice to get the game moving and to start off with a nice balance between fighting and more conservative play.  However, this kakari is not advisable because it becomes caught between white's two stones so will either a) trap black in the corner and upper left, helping white develop a much stronger shape in sente on the upper side, or b) force white to develop a large corner without becoming enclosed while black must make due with some side moyo.  Either way, white gets more points and most likely sente.  A good rule of thumb is to approach from the outside on move 5, so I'd prefer to approach the lower left at F3.  Acutally, with three komoku, I'd prefer to shimari at P17 ;-)

Mike Malveaux: (Mike) Since I basically don't know what I'm doing in the fuseki (or most of the rest of the time either), and since I've heard that a kakari is more or less equivalent to a shimari, I'll play here.  That way if you play at P17, I can make the "Shusaku diagonal" at Q15, which is said to be a little slow in the age of komi, but what the hey.]

(;W[dh]C[The Go Teacher: marc
here, what i hope is to end the sequence in sente so that i can play p16. It should be possible since <b>you</b> did the kakari move.
i first wanted to play e16, but since i have d4, i thought a pincer would not be bad.]
;B[ee]C[Mike Malveaux: (Mike) Hmm.... so if black makes the kakari, white should be able to end in sente, generally?  I never thought of it that way.

I have <b>got</b> to get Linux installed on my hard drive, so I can look at Kogo's.  Grrr.]

(;W[gc]LB[fd:A]TR[ce][ee]C[buckyyowza: white's play is too low.  Although it builds territory on the upper side, G17 does little to put pressure on black's stones.  I'd prefer F16; in fact, I'd have just played F16 in response to C15, especially if your aim is P16 (see var on #5).  From here, it is certain black will live with his dragon by running to the right side (or will form 2 eyes trying).  If white plays into black's eyespace during this escape, then he can control the game because his moves will be sente even if their effect elsewhere doesn't require an immediate response.  So it is better to think of using your opponent's stones to your advantage, rather than killing them.  By the way, it is true that most joseki end with the player who made the approach in gote - If you think about it, this is appropriate for a balanced game and a balanced game is the ultimate goal of joseki.

The Go Teacher: marc
well about the sente thing : it wasn't go theory, it was just what seemed to me logical thinking, based on the fact that the player who has already a stone in the corner starts the sequence with an advantage, and should be able to use it in order to get the sente. But the more i think about it, the less convinced i am, especially when the response to the kakari is a pincer. So, if i wanted p16, maybe i should have played e16 iso d12 after all.
Kogo proposes c17 or f16 as your next move ;o) 
There is also some info here : <http://gobase.org/joseki/>
There are so many variations in those dictionnaries, it's boring and a little worrying, because there are so many ways to spoil the thing. I end up always using the same few simple moves when i can.]
;B[bc]
(;W[od]LB[ge:A]C[buckyyowza: see var and also var on #8. B17 should not be ignored since black is now settled, but white is not. Try not to pay such a high price for sente - indeed, white is just _begging_ for a pincer.  Another choice, that regains sente (but allows black to settle) is G15, which is not nearly as slow as K17, nor as dangerous as P16.

The Go Teacher: b17 looks natural to me too.
And now, i kind of <i>know I should</i> add a move like k17 or something that would make my group definitely stable, but i like to play with the devil, and i wanted that p16 move, because i don't like the look of it with a black stone around p16. I even know the response that would bother me : a move around l17 would pincer p16 and g17 at the same time.
I can't help playing like a fool. I need a therapy (not a painful one please).]

(;B[qg]LB[oc:A][kd:B]C[buckyyowza: The normal sequence, starting with black P17 here gets the game moving a littler better than R13 with the same emphasis on the right side.  However, if I had black I'd play the pincer at L16, a much more complicated and aggressive play than is probably warranted this early ;-)

Mike Malveaux: (Mike) Ah, pincer, shminsher.  I wanted to play the Shusaku Diagonal, but noooo, you kakari high instead of low.

Actually, I almost played Q17, on the theory that ... well, there was no theory, actually.]
;W[qc]C[buckyyowza: I see the upper corners as equivalent, in that either one is up for grabs by either side.  White is better off playing at K16 now... and both players need to think about balancing high and low moves: There are too many on the third line (and even one on the 2nd line so soon!)  Remember that territory is good, but influence is needed to make it stick.

The Go Teacher: marc (and for the rest of this game, white moves should normally be played by me :)

as you go along the side, i suppose i should at least try to snap a piece of the corner cake.
to let you play q17 or p17 after r13 would be too much.

too bad that the q17 theory was lost ;)];B[rc]C[buckyyowza: S17 is the only move for black.  This corner is too large for either player to neglect to finish this short sequece, and yes, it is sente so opportunity for a big tenuki is imminent.

Mike Malveaux: (Mike (del negro))  This seems small, I was tempted to play K4 instead.  But I guess it's sente; if you don't answer, the corner looks large after black Q17, and an invasion around L17 starts to look good.]
;W[pc]C[The Go Teacher: i'll try to be consistent : since i played r17, i won't let you play q17.
Now there is still s18, which is valuable for both. If you invade, i hope i can utilize it to make life in the corner.]
;B[qo]LB[jd:A]C[buckyyowza: The time for simplicity is over ;-)  Black is clearly in a better position after some over-anxious plays by white on the upper side.  I'd be inclined to jump right in and join the battle at K16, a certain local victory for black as it splits white's two weaker groups against black's practically settled ones. Of course by "weak" I do not mean that white is in danger of being killed, but the white groups' aji is not nearly as good... so black can very easily settle the upper side, retain sente, and then where is white's potential?  The lower left is only held by two sparse stones and would not be nearly enough.

Mike Malveaux: (Mike) Simple is good.  I'm in a hurry, so I'll skip my usual windiness.]
;W[jq]LB[jd:B][dk:A]C[buckyyowza: yes, white has suffered significant damage, and a double-wing formation on the star point is nearly as good as a white stone at K16.  As white, this is the stragety I'd take: whatever black does next, get sente FAST, then take either D9 or K16, whichever is available.  With luck, either play will enable enough reduction of black's right side to keep the game going.

The Go Teacher: i simply cannot let you have this point, the game would be as good as finished.
My feeling is that you are solid everywhere, I'm thin everywhere, argh]

(;B[mq]LB[dm:A]C[buckyyowza: I'd tend to agree with white's analysis: white is quite thin on the upper side, but since black does not see it white has little to worry about ;-)  The game is young, but black is clearly dominating - and with plays like N3 it looks as though black is confident that he has enough already.  That is, white needs to protect both the upper side and also against a high approach like D7.  Making a solid territorial play like this says "I could attack, but I've got so many options that I'll just grab some points while you decide your own fate"

Mike Malveaux: I think you're being a bit pessimistic.  The game is yet young.  And you're not "thin" on the upper side; and you have the beginnings of a double-wing moyo in the lower left.  Right now, I'd say we're about even.]
;W[og]LB[ge:A]C[buckyyowza: black is very thick here, so P13 does indeed seem too close.  I'd prefer G15 to build thickness for a later attack on the right side while also protecting the upper side and putting pressure on (not to mention capping the influence of) black's weakest group.  Add in the fact that "a one space jump is never bad," and that's five reasons for G15, a move that can't go wrong ;-)

The Go Teacher: your last move seems (too?) close to the shimari.
Maybe i should play a quieter move at the top, but it would seem too flat to me. 
p13 is according to the theory that your good move is my good move. If i did let you play there, your moyo would be huge.]
;B[ck]LB[lp:B][lq:A]C[buckyyowza: A large part of the difference between "slow/slack" and "strong" is timing.  Since black was in the lead, and had done well at covering all his bases N3 was quite a strong and confident play.  I think that M3 is also fine (see var on #17), but I'd prefer M4 or even L4 to build strength while leaning against white's sparse position.

Mike Malveaux: I've always liked that idea, what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  An you're right, white would not want black to have P13... and black would like to have it.

N3 is close to the Q3 shimari.  I didn't go to M3 because if white then played O3, it seems complicated.  But maybe the R5 stone is enough to let black triumph?  Or if we both jumped toward the center, black could attack the K3 stone?  Maybe I should've played N3 instead.  Another favorite saying I heard from a local 6-dan is "make your stones strong, then you can do anything."  But he didn't say "play slow/slack moves"...  I need to learn the difference.

Right now, I'd like Q10; but it doesn't seem like sente.  And if you moved at, say, D9, I'd be thinking "black's good move is white's good move".]

(;W[dm]LB[pj:B][lp:A]C[buckyyowza: I am not so sure that C9 deserves a response this local:  it is big, but D12 is not so easily killed and any attempts to settle C9 will be overplay.  I would see C9 as a immediately successful reduction of white's thickness in the lower left quadrant of the board, and reply by improving that same  influence by developing another area.  M4 comes to mind - although such a play will cause black to strengthen his moyo, black plays will be small and also cause him to become overconcentrated.   An even better idea for white now would be Q10 - since P13 essentially went unanswered, white can take the clue that black is not truly interested in his immense potential on the right side.

The Go Teacher: n3/n4 : 
one could say n3 is more solid and doesn't bring you much less than m3, so why bother?
But theory says "don't play close to thickness". I suppose if you want to invade between k3 and d4, a black stone at m3 would be a little more efficient. Moreover, if you jump toward the centre, you make a bigger box. I don't know.
c9 : 
it's a pincer and an invasion, so it must be good. With c15/e15, something like that was to be expected.
d7 : 
not very efficient for territory, but it threatens to link to d12. 
A high stone may also help if i have to invade the right side. But that's again theory, and theory never seems to apply to <b>my</b> games.]
;B[ej]C[Mike Malveaux: "Everything works in Theory, so let's go live there!"  I like this because it can make shape with E8 or C11.]
;W[ge]TR[dc][gc]C[buckyyowza: I completely agree with white's analysis: this is an excellent play!  Not only does it solidify the marked stones and build potential on the upper side to rival black's right, but it is has an illusory effect of seeming to reply to E10's leaning on D12 (a stone better sacrificed)... so black may now be tricked into an overplay.  In fact, I cannot say enough good about G15 :-)

The Go Teacher: lol
now, i go to threaten a link from the other side.
I think that move shapes up a nice moyo on top, after p13. I could maybe aim to q11 or r12 as follow-up.
Even if you defend by capping d12, I think the d12 stone has still some aji (the big word!)]
;B[fh]C[Mike Malveaux: Oh my, that *is* a big moyo white has.  I expected you to jump toward the center with F12, but your move is better.  (See, you *are* the stronger player!  :-)  Looks like I'd better get my invasion plans going.  Meanwhile, it's very tempting to try to capture the D12 stone, since it's pretty much surrounded.  The trick is to not get caught up in capturing it while you get strong everywhere else.]
;W[gg]LB[pj:A]TR[ee][fh][ej]C[buckyyowza: Doh! D12 is what I like to call "yose aji", meaning that you should ignore it until the late middle game, at which time it will be worth at least 10 points in reduction of territory as the area around the marked stones is negotiated.  G13 encourages black to build a nice fat wall around this moyo, turning it directly into black points now.  White should have played Q10... exactly where black should have played in response to G15.

The Go Teacher: true, taking d12 is very big.
what i'd like is force you to firmly capture it while building on the outside.
So i think (hope) g13 is more or less sente, still threatening to get back to d12.
Moreover, without g13, a reducing move around k15 would probably be efficient.
Supposing you answer locally, i wonder which of extending/reducing with q11, or taking cash with l16 would be better?
But you probably have other plans than answering submissively!
Just blow off a little and the nice straw house will collapse :)]
;B[jd]C[buckyyowza: this is too deep, and besides black needs more thickness to do much good here after white's unanswered plays at G13 and P13.  OTOH K16's aji is very good, but it is better to have some more influence around the center before jumping in so deep - else instead of a useful sacrifice it could become a bonus point.  I'd have played either Q10 (do I keep saying Q10?) or F13 to follow this up. K16 will succeed in some way, have no doubt, but there will be a price to pay for it.

Mike Malveaux: As I look at it, I think I can afford another white move near D12, and still probably catch it or get compensation vs. the gaps at G14/G16.  I *am* troubled by White D14, but I think I can find decent answers.  I feel I have to move in the moyo before you cash out; already it will be tough sledding to live there.  Finding the right point to invade was not easy.  There's a bigger gap to threaten at O15, and L15 is more equidistant from the enemy, but I think coming close to the 3-stone semi-wall will be good if D12 weasels out but I get to cut through at G16 or G14.]
;W[re]LB[rb:B][ld:A]C[buckyyowza: S18 is a better choice to exploit black's slight weakness in this corner, and it is true that black is down a stone (S15, in fact).  However, white is _also_ down a stone around M17 (recall that I said white's groups were weak).  Considering this, you could say that corner play (S15/S18) is too passive.  In order to prevent black from using K16 to exploit this weakness, it is urgent to play at M16 now.

The Go Teacher: Pfew, I thought hard on this one (smoke puffing out of my ears) - in vain.
I was initially thinking of something like d14 or f13 indeed, but even if I manage to connect d12, b17 can probably live, and e10 is light, so d14 is probably not the silver bullet.
k16 is quite deep relatively to g13 and p13, so in theory i should cap it at k14, but k16 has some space and (as you remarked) a few weaknesses to lean on, so it should be able to live or to escape smoothly, and then what remains of my moyo? If i go for k16, i'm condemned to succeed, and i don't like that.
Or maybe i should play tooth for tooth, tenuki and invade the right side?
Or, consider my g line is a strength, and push you toward it with m16? But what do i win in the process?
Or tenuki and build territory in LL (f3 or k6 - k6 may help a shisho for d12 to escape by the way)? But you can make more territory in LR.
All this seems to achieve little, and thus seems to prove g13 was bad, and would have been better used at l16. Or even g15 that seemed like a good idea at the time would have been better at f12. Was i too greedy?
Well, the clock is running and i'm still lost.
I want to give you some brain food too...
Isn't there a stone missing in your UR corner? But likely this is too small right now anyway.
Sigh...];B[qe]C[Mike Malveaux: Wow, that's a lot of thinking you done did there.  What the hey, let's send this one to the GTL when we're done.  (Maybe it'll be assigned to Ben.  :-)

You're right, I *am* missing a stone in the Northeast.  What did I play instead?  I hope it was worth it, you can have a big corner now.  I think it's worth answering locally, because it's somewhat sente, and my move helps aim at the P16 gap.  Of course, if you answer with P16 or O15, that hurts the chances of the K16 stone, and then I don't think S18 quite makes up for it.  But I still think K16 will manage.. Oh well... people say I take too many risks.  Maybe I should work on that.]
;W[pf]LB[ld:B][oe:A][nh:C]C[buckyyowza: P14 is aji keshi and it leaves white with bad shape (see P15 cut).  White is better here at M16 or O12.

The Go Teacher: yes, why not send it to the GTL - or maybe a fellow teacher here will feel like commenting it.

well i played s15 partly out of annoyance for not finding a good move, and now that i see it played with your answer, i am really convinced it was too small. 
Statistically, i have observed that if i must have a good idea, it will come within the first minute of thinking. When i think for longer, i will anyway end up with playing a brainless move out of irritation.
But now s15 is there, how can I use it? By threatening r14, which really starts to look big, and making p13 stronger?]
;B[qf]C[Mike Malveaux: (Mike) Well, after playing R15, I feel obliged to play R14, gives me back the corner, probably too small though.  But if you get R14, my East side hopes and dreams are for naught.  Q14 seems excellent, forcing me to choose and making strength and profit either way.  R15 must've been a mistake.]
;W[fg]C[buckyyowza: too soon to tenuki!  White should play S18, which retains sente, and then think about playing the left side. However, M16 is still urgent (yes, you have a lot invested up there), so F13 is doubly premature.

The Go Teacher: i have been criticised for lack of perseverance in my plans before.
I suppose i have invested so much in upper side that i will have to attack k16 eventually, though it looks difficult.
f13 is mainly for building up strength, or i should say for patching up holes.]
;B[eg]C[Mike Malveaux: Here I go again, playing too thin.  You'd think I'd learn.  Jeez, that looks bad... Why do I want to play such bad-looking moves?  I must need psychiatric help.]
;W[kn]C[buckyyowza: The D12 ladder is irrelevant, because the F13 groups is not important.  Not only that, but black can connect underneath D12 without too much trouble.  The square box idea is not bad, but I think the timing is off especially if you consider that K16 has still gone unanswered.  Right now, the most important area is the upper right.

The Go Teacher: if you think you are thin, then you definitely need psychiatric help ;o) 
I try to convince myself that this l6 move has several objectives : 
- build a square box
- reduce your LR
- be on a ladder path if i further threaten to get d12 out (with g12 or e12).
This is to be consistent with my initial philosophy: "okay, i let you have d12, but i will try to get as much as possible for compensation"
In french, we have a proverb "don't try to catch two hares at the same time"; i have the feeling it could apply to go, and especially to my moves in this game, and i will end up with no hare at all :)]
;B[me]C[Mike Malveaux: I feel secure on the lower right still, and I'm not worried yet about the ladder breaker.  That is a big new moyo you have, but one thing at a time... I need to try to live in the north, while maybe I can.]
;W[cl]TR[pc][qc][od][pf][og]C[buckyyowza: White needs to take care of his eyespace in the upper right!  Now that he's completely given up the upper side moyo, the marked stones are in need of sabaki.

The Go Teacher: my moyos are like sand castles...
I suppose n17 and n13 are miai, so you live or get out easy. Now g13 and p13 look stupid.
Then why not play elsewhere]
(;B[eh]C[buckyyowza: It seems that I agree with white's grasp on the game, but it is black's tactics that make more sense to me.  This is an important play, since D12 has a lot of dangerous aji and E12 eliminates, making this into more of a center game (which black needs to exact full damage on the upper side and to prevent a full scale invasion of the right.

Mike Malveaux: I'm not as confident as you that Black's ok around L16, but the E12 area is big too, so I'll tend that first.  I was going to play B9, but I just don't like the D12 stone cutting at E12.]
;W[dk]C[buckyyowza:  I like D9, it plays well off of D12, especially after black has cut it off from the center.

The Go Teacher: I have hesitated much about cutting (even played preparatory moves, as you know), but eventually, i did think that if you answer quietly at f11, i would not be able to make a lot of damage, especially since my UL stones are not as strong as they seem.
Again, i try to force myself to be consistant (or is it rather stubbornness? - the tactic failed on the top!), and force you to add moves to capture d12, with the smallest possible territory around it, and hopefully some assets for me on the outside. Don't know whether b9 is better than d9.
By the way, i wonder if we have spectators. If yes, they are fairly silent. I wonder what they think of all this. Praise and criticism are welcome alike.]
;B[dj]C[buckyyowza: C10 is gote? see var on #40 for why I don't think so.

Mike Malveaux: Your logic sounds good to me.  My only comfort is that C10 will be gote for you.

It would be nice if the spectators could add their comments in the game, much like kibbitzing on IGS.  But I don't know how that could be done.]
;W[cj]C[The Go Teacher: won't you lose much locally if you take the sente to tenuki?]
;B[ci]C[Mike Malveaux: Lose much locally?  Hmm... wB9cap, B tenuki,
w...D11cut?  bC12 sets the ladder.  so not w cut...
w...C12?  bB11, 4 liberties; if wB12, bD11conxn. if wD11, bB12.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the local loss?  (or more likely, reading it wrong... again?)]

(;W[dq]C[The Go Teacher: i was not looking so far : just simply wb9, b tenuki, wb11, b cannot b12.
But now, i just think taking the corner might be bigger. Moreover, black tenuki would likely be sente, so i'm not sure to be able to come back for b11.]

(;B[pl]LB[ho:A]C[buckyyowza: I find it ironic that black can play Q8, and then smile as he exclaims "D3 is huge" :-)  D3 only prevents a gote corner invasion, which would be quite early at this stage in the game.  OTOH, Q8 is huge! :-)  White's lower left is quite thick, but his upper left is equally thin, and after Q8 black simply doesn't have any weakness on the right side.  FWIW, H5 seems a sufficient point for black to reduce the lower left.

Mike Malveaux: D3 is huge!

At first I thought B10 would now be sente and I could save my stone because you would not like to see Black B6... but you easily kill any invasion like that.  So now I must resort to a naked land grab to balance the scales of territory.]
;W[mc]C[buckyyowza: N17 is overdue, it should have been played in response to N15 to prevent black from getting a base too easily.

The Go Teacher: you now have a fair amount of secure territory (more than me, it seems).
Why n17? It doesn't look much like an attack - but i never found a good attack.
Difficult to say : more feeling than tactics.
In fact, i'd like to play something around o6, because that group is getting really impressive, but it would be rather passive : only reducing purpose.
I secretely hope that n15 will run toward the centre, and that i will be able to play reductions during the resulting sequence (and why not, maybe h6 too).
And it should also give me a few points on the top as a bonus.]
;B[nd]C[Mike Malveaux: Well, my first inclination was K14, to make shape, but it looks like I can cut either O17 or P15, so I want to try that.]
;W[nc]C[

The Go Teacher: yes, the cut is disturbing, but i think i cannot help blocking at o17.]
;B[oe]LB[mg:A][oi:B]TR[pf][og]C[buckyyowza: these stones are cut _now_.  White needs a play like N13 or P11 to get them out before losing sente. Since white cannot counter-cut and retain sente, it is best to treat black as connected and save the aji for later.]
;W[pe]C[buckyyowza: ...therefore this move is aji keshi.

The Go Teacher: so be it :-)];B[pd]C[Mike Malveaux: Woo-hoo!  fighting!]
;W[oc]C[The Go Teacher: had too happen, sooner or later ... but maybe this was not the expected place for the sparkle]
;B[lh]C[Mike Malveaux: And now I have a weak group to chase.  Things are looking up (he said, as he tripped on a cobblestone...)]
;W[le]C[The Go Teacher: i don't like to be chased (except by pretty girls).
so i won't move p13 :)];B[mf]C[Mike Malveaux: Ouch... that makes M12 look too loose and vague.  K16 is probably toast now.  But black seems to do ok on the right, I guess.]
;W[md]C[The Go Teacher: yes, i hope to catch k16. I have been working on that for half of the game :)

and yes, the right side is soooo nice];B[ne]C[Mike Malveaux: Hm, this is bad shape.]
;W[lf]C[The Go Teacher: really bad shapes are shapes that do not work.
this one (though not pleasant to the eye) will do the job :)]
;B[mg]C[Mike Malveaux: I guess that's true... ugly but stronger than the Q14s is good enough.

There must be some way to exploit the aji remaining in K16 (if I ever get sente again)...]

(;W[lk]LB[nj:B][nk:A]C[buckyyowza: White has the right idea, but O10 seems more playable to me. M9 is too easily blocked out with a black stone at O9 or O10.  So... reduction is good, handing your opponent honte on a platter probably not so good :-)

The Go Teacher: i'm not sure at all about this move.
maybe i should just secure the top with k14 or something : it seems big but slow.
Seems more urgent to reduce your moyo.
I tried to go to the place where you would hesitate between fighting and defending.
The problem is m9 is very loosely connected, but i *had to* go quite far.]

(;B[in]C[buckyyowza: white is so sparse, I think black can also afford to go deeper.  For example, it seems K5 is an effective cut, no?

Mike Malveaux: Yes, big; but I don't see M9 as slow.  I *think* I can withstand a white at O12 or P11 area, so I'll counterattack your big moyo.  I'm deep in your area, but I have clear sector lines in two directions (J6-E10 and J6-M12), and they're shorter than your D9-M9 and D9-L6 lines.  I think I can connect out, or if you block me, lightly make shape and get a live group.  And there's some chance maybe to attack K3 for life, I think.]
;W[kp]C[buckyyowza: L4 is very nice, a clean and efficient resolution to this conflict :-)

The Go Teacher: damned! this move takes me by surprise.
It seems so multi-purpose i woudn't be surprised if you told me it serves coffee as well.
I feel i have to connect k3 and l6, because i don't want to play the "i-cut-you-while-you-cut-me" game here.]

(;B[hq]C[buckyyowza: this is too easily cut, and after L4 black has not enough thickness to follow up.  Perhaps playing kikashi at E9 first , then this stone at H4 would be a better plan.

Mike Malveaux: "The Coffee-serving tesuji"... I like it :-)
Not sure where to follow up, though.  L4 looks good.  I'm hoping to loosely make shape (and interupt your moyo) before I have to run for safety.]
;W[hp]C[The Go Teacher: if you reverse the order of play of j6 and h3, then j6 would be what they call a "light move" in the "28th Book of Go" (that i didn't read).
Supposing j6 can go away lightly, i cannot let him take h3 in his luggage. So i think i should cut. If a knight move can be cut, i suppose a large one can be too. But this is yet another place where i may blunder.]

(;B[ip]LB[jr:A]C[buckyyowza: I like to think that K2 makes a nice kikashi for improving black's return on the H3 investment.

Mike Malveaux: Oh, these restrictions on luggage are no fun...  I guess I'll have to try to sneak my souvenirs on board...]
;W[iq]C[The Go Teacher: after the 2 previous moves, i have no other choice.
How relaxing for the brain!
But some thinking will be needed soon, i bet];B[ho]C[buckyyowza: With or without the K2 stone, K4 makes a nice tesuji without forcing white into a profitable position (as H5 does).  G4 also pushes black into a bad way by inviting white to settle his connection to the big dragon.  See var on #61 - in general, even though stones appear 'dead' (talkin' about H3) the messier they are to kill, the better.  That is the essence of good aji.

Mike Malveaux: I'm glad *your* brain had a day off.  As for me, I had trouble picking H5 or G4.  But G4 seems to build a wall along the Gs, eventually connecting to E10; giving you a solid life round the J stones, and my wall facing... your living strong group 2 lines away.  So it disrupts your territory a little, but not enough (if I'm looking at this right).

I'm not sure what H5 will do, maybe give me a bit of center territory?  and later threats vs. M9?  Argh, not sure what's better.]
;W[gp]C[buckyyowza: of course, this is why H3 does not work.  Black has strengthened white instead of reducing him.

The Go Teacher: cool
another no-brainer
tomorrow i will think 
promised];B[fl]LB[jh:A][bj:C][ik:B]C[buckyyowza: F8 is not bad, but it is better to look at the big picture. I'd play something more like K12, to handle this situation as well as several others.  If white blocks your escape to K12, then F8 seems playable as a plan B.  It is also a better idea to jump to J9 instead of F8, since this lets your little group run toward two groups instead of just one and it also prevents the risk of white taking sente over to the left side with something like B10.

Mike Malveaux: First I tried G5, but that seems too risky; you could just cut me off with something like G7, then good luck to black in finding eyes. This seems safer.]
;W[ok]C[buckyyowza: That's the spirit!  However, I think Q10 is more menacing.  After P9, black simply needs to play R10, lean back in his chair, and let out a slow, evil chuckle.

The Go Teacher: you broke my moyo, you rascal!
i will take revenge];B[oi]TR[pe][pf][og]C[buckyyowza: are these stones truly worth more than the whole right side?  M12 is not without hope if it gets cut off, as black also has a presence in the left half of then center.

Mike Malveaux: Yes, you will... eek!]
(;W[jf]LB[gh:B][bj:A]C[buckyyowza: If you are worried about K16, then first take care of B17's aji.  White should probably have played B10 now, all things considered, then finish up with something like G12.  Even without K14, for black to escape K16 with much profit is a bit of a juggling act (and easily compensated for because the right side is still wide open after P9).

The Go Teacher: probably some fight is coming on the east/centre, and during these operations, the aji of k16 may wake up.]

(;B[jh]LB[eb:C][ml:A][lm:B]C[buckyyowza: In this case... the one-space jump is wrong ;-)  black is simply connecting a strong group to a strong group.  K12 does not affect the situation with K16; it is simply a 0 point gote played in a neutral area.  N8, on the other hand, is a nice idea... M7 maybe even more effective.  BTW, due to K16 black's timing is also good now for a play at E18.

Mike Malveaux: I shouldn't play when I'm this sleep deprived... but who can resist?
But I think i'll refrain from making an analysis that later will make me feel embarrassed :-D

ah, i can't resist...  K14 looks slow but proper ("honest"?) to me
K12?  "one-point jump is never wrong"
i hope you answer near J15, then I'll try something like N8.]
;W[jk]C[The Go Teacher: so you think i should defend at j15? Maybe so, but i hope i can shun it. I don't want to open an editor and parse all the possible variations here. It is more a matter of feeling (and crossing fingers), likely not the right way to play go!
I did notice that l6 and m9 are far apart, so my move is to strengthen them a little and to prevent your making too much of centre territory.
My thoughts and my move are very vague here ...];B[kl]C[Mike Malveaux: No, I don't think you needed to J15; but I'm sure you would if I got J13.  Hm, maybe I should have J13 instead of K12, but it seemed too thin so I didn't.

I think K9 is the right area, but does it leave me too many chances?  K8 instead, or L8?  Myabe i should just be happy with Q10... interesting and complicated part of the game.]
;W[ll]C[The Go Teacher: hmm, you are right, your move proves that i was maybe a little too greedy on this move. My first idea was the very solid m7, and then this horse head shape popped and seemed pretty. But a safer move was probably good enough, and this will bring me more problems than profit.]
;B[lm]C[Mike Malveaux: yes, sometimes pretty shapes are irresistable.

now it's my turn to be too greedy.  this is bound to end up damaging the J6 stones... sigh.]
;W[km]C[The Go Teacher: I guess i have no choice here.
Of course, as you like to say, tenuki is always an option ;-)]
;B[jl]C[Mike Malveaux: yes, i agree, it's forced... but who comes out ahead on this crazy course?  i need to not play so many moves i can't read...]

(;W[mm]LB[mn:A]C[buckyyowza: N7 should be at N6.  Now, white is cut here.

The Go Teacher: i can't read them either, if this can cheer you up!
Of course, i hesitate between k7 to put pressure on h5 and protecting my m9 group. I chose the latter as it seems bigger and consistent with my previous moves.
What is k9 doing there :-(];B[ig]C[Mike Malveaux: Hm, I'd thought White's good move would be J8, pressure on the K8s... K9 is maybe not completely useless.  ;-)  But maybe it doesn't work?  Tough for me to read.

N7 seems good.  If I run with M7, I think keep the N8s separated from the L5s, but you get eyeshape by chasing me.  Since you live in the N8 area, and you live in the south by capturing H3, it seems small to rescue M7 right now-- but it might be big in a few moves, if you don't capture it sooner.

I still worry about J8, so I want to get L9 first -- but it seems silly if K9 can just be pulled out to G13.  So my J13 is trying to narrow the 3-space gap, hopefully in sente?  I still think you would not want to see black at J14 now.]
;W[if]C[buckyyowza: This all seems yose... and Q9 is still so big.  However if black chooses to escape M6, Q9 is not so easy for white to pull off.

The Go Teacher: yeah, i was aching to tenuki, but j14 is like a snake's eye : i couldn't look elsewhere]

(;B[kk]C[Mike Malveaux: Oh well, I'm not sure if J13 did anything other than reduce the aji in K16.  I'll still hate to see White at J12 and Q9... sigh.  :-/]
;W[oj]C[The Go Teacher: yes, but that was my hope when i played n7]
;B[pi]C[Mike Malveaux: this is turning into another episode of "As the Moyo Crumbles"  ;-)]
;W[qj]C[The Go Teacher: or "the sand moyo and the rising tide" ;-)

remember this is only an attempt at revenge];B[lj]C[Mike Malveaux: "And moyos made of sand... fall into the sea... eventually."]
;W[nl]C[The Go Teacher: exactly.
How go is a nice mix between poetry and butchery :)
I think i'd better connect here.
You get a nice compensation in centre for all my moyo destruction works!]

(;B[fd]C[buckyyowza: Black needs only play M6 and white's sweet revenge goes up in a puff of smoke.  Well, after playing with the variations it appears more like a messy complicated wildfire that burns down half of the forest than a mere puff of smoke, but white still dies if black is careful enough.

Mike Malveaux: Drat it... i want to move R9 or S9, but I just don't see a way to keep S10 from plaguing me...]
;W[fc]LB[hb:A]C[buckyyowza: H18 seems simplest for white.

The Go Teacher: i hope i read correctly and f17 is possible]
;B[gd]C[Mike Malveaux: I think F17 was right, but now G16 would be too good so I prevent it.  After that I don't think black has much more than ko threats there; but maybe it lets me play G12 in sente?  if so, it's worth it.]
;W[hd]C[buckyyowza: I agree, now H17 has a nice effect.

The Go Teacher: too many cutting points for my liking :-(]
(;B[gh]C[Mike Malveaux: I guess it's not sente, but it seems too big to omit.  :-/]
;W[fn]C[The Go Teacher: big indeed. I try to reduce a little, maybe in sente.]
;B[gn]C[Mike Malveaux: Rats.  I wanted F6... but I couldn't see a way to make it sente.  Your lower left is huge!]
;W[fm]C[The Go Teacher: f7 seems the logical move to me];B[gm]
C[Mike Malveaux: well, F7's certainly sente; and the kind of thing that makes me wish I'd already played at B10.  :-/]
;W[el];B[bj]C[buckyyowza: E9 could have been considered a winning move, worth about 20 points.  B10 is not nearly as large, worth closer to 6.  Of course both plays are gote, so the time is not quite right for either since many of the sente moves I've already highlighted are still available.

Mike Malveaux: torn between E9 and B10.  I picked b10 because i figure it'll let me reduce your corner.]
;W[fk]C[The Go Teacher: difficult to chose between both indeed.
I have also a small reduction of the territory you just closed here, so it seems to balance, except if you found some way to exploit f5.]
;B[gl]C[Mike Malveaux: F5 doesn't seem to go anywhere much, but I might get desperate enough to try.]

[fs][gs][hs]C[buckyyowza: counting points as shown (W=box,B=circle), I've got white up by 2.5.  See how 20 points at E9 would have been quite a winning move for black?  Of course, this game is truly impossible to count with all of this aji on the board.  Certainly an exciting endgame is in the works , barring catastrophe that is.

Mike Malveaux: Who's ahead now?  I tried to count it a couple times (like that ever works), but got dizzy and fell down.  When I woke up, it was still my turn.  As near as I can tell, I'm behind a little.  I almost played G10, but now I think I can't afford to let you have sente.]
;W[gj]C[The Go Teacher: i know that counting is very important, but i find it very difficult.
Also, i find it very difficult to assess the value of moves.
I suppose saving k9 is also quite big, but is it as big as what you can do in UL? I don't know.]
;B[gk]C[Mike Malveaux: I too have trouble counting, and assessing relative values of different moves.  It's a big weak area for me, but I think I've gotten better from reading the Senseis Library stuff on endgame (which I don't quite understand yet), and the concept of "mutual destruction" from a problem at goproblems.com.  (A lot of the time, it's better to take sente to make a reduction, even though doing so fails to block against a reduction threatened against you.  Why?  Don't quite know -- i guess because if White threatens to reduce, Black blocks, White then fixes defect... then White's often gained a pt.  But if White threatens, Black threatens, White exploits, Black exploits, White fixes defect, Black fixes defect... that often turns out about even, which is better for Black than losing a pt.  At least, I think that's how it works.)

It seemed to me like you had 4 or 5 pts. sente reduction around G10 no matter how i played.  If I'd played G10, you had F10 and G9.  Letting you get G10 makes it a 6 or 7 pt. reduction, I think -- only a couple pts. worse; and either way, I'd end in gote.  Meanwhile C18 is worth ... I don't know, or 5 pts.?  And it E18 as a followup.  (though E18 may not do much in his case, because you have the E16 atari... hm, maybe it'd be good to cede the G16s?  I don't think that H15 cutting pt amounts to much, after all...)]
;W[rb]C[buckyyowza: S18 is a perfect place to start.  You are on the right track:  sente first, biggest to smallest, then biggest gote.  To determine if a move is sente, find your opponent's largest move (sente or gote) and if ignoring your play results in more damange than that it means that your move is sente. The process of the endgame is really pretty simple... it is determining the value of each move that is time consuming, nerve-wracking, and otherwise nearly impossible.  All I can say is play a lot ;-)  For example, S18 is worth 6 points in sente: that's 2 points territory for white and 4 points lost territory for black (if black had played S18 first).  BTW Sorry any of my estimates turn out to be imprecise, but as you both agree counting is tricky business ;-)

The Go Teacher: well, i suppose i should try to play sente moves and start with the biggest ones (and the same for you :).
If we have this game reviewed later, I hope to get some guidance on this topic. And maybe I should read that SL stuff.]
;B[rd]C[Mike Malveaux: well, that sure looks like sente... it's what I was planning to play next :-)]
;W[fj];B[hj]
(;W[rj]C[buckyyowza: Simply Q7 seems not bad for white here.

The Go Teacher: i want to reduce, but if ws8, br9, so i can't go very far directly.
but i think s10 threatens sth like q7];B[rl]C[buckyyowza: There are no more points here for either player... time to move on.

Mike Malveaux: Now of course I worry about something like T14.  Oh well, I think you have to cover the Q10 cut first.

Hm... M6 is now good?  You still get to live in the O7 area maybe, but good to make you actually do it?]
;W[qk]C[The Go Teacher: well, s10 was bad.
I had simply not thought of your obvious answer.];B[rh]C[Mike Malveaux: Hm.  It's tricky, isn't it.  I guess I'd better be defensive.]
;W[mo]C[The Go Teacher: i don't see that t13 or around that could have seriously threatened something.
I don't think that m6 would have worked (answered at n5), but i would be uncomfortable with m5, so i will be careful (I remember our previous game together :)]
;B[bl]C[Mike Malveaux: Hm,, i didn't like the chance of w-T13.  Still don't want to see w-R8, but this looks like sente for now, so I'll play this first.]
;W[bm]C[The Go Teacher: i will say it is sente!];B[eb]C[Mike Malveaux: Have not read this, but I've been wanting to play it for a while]
;W[fe]C[The Go Teacher: probably traps at every step here];B[ed]
C[Mike Malveaux: yes, seems pretty complicated.  i have to learn to play simpler.]
;W[ec]C[The Go Teacher: trying to keep d17 seems big];B[db]
C[Mike Malveaux: This allows C16, which is kind of nasty; but i still have the chance to monkey-jump.]
;W[hb]C[The Go Teacher: i don't dare playing c16 directly.
k16 seemed to have still some aji remaining. This one has been bothering me for a long time!]
;B[sb]C[buckyyowza: H18 was urgent, and better simply H17.  The H17 cut has been very real for some time ;-)

Mike Malveaux: H18 seems overcautious, but i guess it makes sensei -- F18 would create a cutting point.  Now i can't choose among C16 and R8.  I guess i'll play sente moves until i figure it out.]
;W[cd]C[The Go Teacher: if you don't take c16, i will.
that's the fight for sente];B[bd]C[Mike Malveaux: Sure, C16's huge.  You can always return for S19.]
;W[ra]C[The Go Teacher: right :)];B[am]C[buckyyowza: After F11 or G11, the one not played becomes sente because if ignored the F6 stones may be captured in sente.

Mike Malveaux: I keep thinking i should be able to do something with the E6 atari and the C6 peep, but there's just not enough there; white's too strong.]
;W[bn]C[The Go Teacher: if needed (not sure), i could have given up the 2 f6 stones]
;B[an]C[Mike Malveaux: I'm about out of sente... and i have so many gote plays i need, that i don't think I can get them all.]
;W[ao]C[The Go Teacher: nothing to say];B[al]C[Mike Malveaux: wasn't sure you'd block... glad you did, because I'm pretty sure you'll now cover the cut, allowing me to try to figure out where to save some points]
;W[bo];B[lr];W[kr]C[The Go Teacher: maybe you are too pessimistic : I think you are leading!
... or then I am the pessimistic one ...];B[ql]C[Mike Malveaux: well, i *think* this is the biggest gote.  though E14 and N9 are also candidates.  Maybe G19 too.]
;W[de]C[buckyyowza: D15 is nice :-)

The Go Teacher: i think i should have a few sente moves now]
;B[df]C[Mike Malveaux: Yes, I'm afraid so.  Oh well... into each game some gote must fall.]
;W[dd]C[The Go Teacher: ... but too much has fallen in mine]
;B[ef];W[oo];B[np];W[jm]
(;B[il]C[buckyyowza: J7 seems OK because it gives black an eye so white cannot do much with the cut aji at J8 and H9... except maybe sneak in an extra point around H11.  The area around N10 is seems neutral no matter what, not worth more than 1 point for either player right now.

Mike Malveaux: This makes H9 interesting, but I think I'm barely ok.  I failed to see before that J7 would give you L10-N10, too big a reduction.  Nice, finding K7.]
;W[hg];B[hh]C[Mike Malveaux: Hmm...  Dragon needs some kind of kibbitzing feature, so our teammates can give us the grief we expected but mostly haven't gotten.]
;W[pn]C[The Go Teacher: that's a good idea, you shoud add that to the wishlist!

Ah maybe they did find our game boring. At least, I didn't!]
;B[qn]C[Mike Malveaux: this is forced, of course]
(;W[nj]C[buckyyowza: N10 is slightly (1 point) bigger because it prevents black N9.  If N10 isn't sente, then O10 isn't either because the aji they leave behind is similar.

The Go Teacher: o11 doesn't work, and n10 is gote, so o10
the last hole in your walls]
(;B[ni]C[buckyyowza: N11 saves 2 points for black, N9 takes 3 points from white... so N9 is bigger.

Mike Malveaux: o11 seems 1 pt better than N11... rats, I never got to play N9.  other things seemed bigger, I guess]
;W[mj];B[mi]C[buckyyowza: Right, this is still anybody's game and every point matters.  I've got white up by 3.5, but it is really too close for me to be accurate trying to count ;-)

Mike Malveaux: Close game.  Looks like... I'm ahead by about 5?  Woops, forgot about komi.  I'm behind by about 2?]

i would give you a small lead, but it's quite close.];B[oq]

I guess I'm such a bad player, that I have to start fights.  And since I fight so much (and often so pointlessly... witness that game, I forget whose, where I spent 6 or 7 of our stones separating the student's groups, to end up with a heavy eyeless group running between two strong living positions... what was I thinking?), sometimes i do it successfully.  :-/  Fighting's fun, and ok, but I'd rather be able to play well.]
