RE[W+3.50]

C[I played black in this game as a 15 k versus a 15 k. Several times I calculated that I had a winning position, but ended up losing by a few points.

Any suggestions for what could have been done differently is appreciated.

[Rich\] - Hi Tim, a few points that came up:

1) Plays on the fourth line generally build influence (to be used in later fighting), plays on the third line go for territory. Certainly in the early game, and when making new groups, it's worth bearing this in mind: a play on the 5th or 6th line leaves a lot of space underneath to creep in, while descending to the 2nd line is generally good only if you can't escape to the centre.

2) At around this strength, it's really useful to start learning about shape; what arrangements of stones are locally strong and why. How to connect and to split stones apart, when that can be done.

3) Finally, in the endgame, don't always respond where your opponent plays - check to see if you *have* to respond, if it will cost you many points to ignore the threat... then look to the big points, and see if they're not bigger.

If you haven't read them already, I'd recommend the following books: Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go for point one, and Making Good Shape for point two.]

(;B[ok]C[I frequently play the Chinese opening

[Rich\] - The Chinese opening is a play on either the third or the fourth line; the fifth line leaves a little too much space to get a base. See variations]
;W[dj];B[jj]C[Recently I've experimented with taking the centre point early in the game. Sometimes it seems to pay dividends in the middle game, though I'm not completely sure about it yet.

[Rich\] - Nothing wrong with experimenting; it may be useful to play moves you understand at least a bit, if only so you can co-ordinate later plays with them. If you play in the centre and on the fourth line, this means you're going for influence, not territory; you make territory later by attacking white when he approaches/invades.]
;W[qf]C[[Rich\] - This is probably the wrong side for white to approach the top right; approaching at O17 aims to let him develop towards his top left.]

(;B[qe];W[pf]
(;B[nc];W[qj]TR[ok]C[[Rich\] - If /\ were a line or two lower, white wouldn't be so stable now.]

(;B[qh]C[I can't remember why I invaded, except probably just to harass my opponent. It was probably a bit too early for this. I've considered other moves.

[Rich\] - This is much too early; white will live, and making him live in your area of influence is painful... much better to leave him with a weak group to worry about while you steadily get stronger and stronger around him :) Instead, he gets strong and your nearby stones get weaker... See vars.

If you block him in and threaten to kill him, he'll have to spend moves defending a small, vulnerable group while all your stones on the outside are getting stronger and you're developing. It's very often better, especially this early in the game, to let a group live small if by doing so you get a lot of influence or territory in return.]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[pj];B[rg];W[pi];B[rf];W[qm];B[qo];W[qg];B[rh]
C[[Rich\] - You don't need to answer here - he can't catch the stones, and even if he could they're only a couple of points. Compare to an approach move on one of the white corners, say, or in the middle of the lower side.]
;W[mg]TR[ok]C[If I'm correct, my premature invasion has only strengthened white

[Rich\] - You're correct :) It's also weakened black /\];B[fq]
C[time to move to another part of the board

[Rich\] - Good plan!];W[dn];B[dr]LB[jp:X]C[[Rich\] - This is a perfectly good territorial play. Since white is almost all influence here, I'd be tempted to reply at X instead, especially as it co-ordinates nicely with the bottom right. But this gives you the option of taking the corner if he ignores you...]
;W[jd];B[kc]C[[Rich\] - This takes another ten points or so, but makes white's stone stronger, which in turn makes it harder for your middle stone to exert much influence.]
;W[jc]
(;B[bq]LB[cq:X]C[[Rich\] - This is OK; the usual play is at X, which also takes the corner without leaving a weakness.]
;W[kd];B[lc];W[jp]
(;B[lp]C[[Rich\] - If your opponent jumps in between your stones, you should chase him toward your stronger side and influence; in this case, approach from the other side. See var.]
;W[jq]
(;B[mq]C[[Rich\] - You don't put any pressure on with this move - why not a straight descent if you want to block that side? More importantly, you have some stones in the centre that are going to be weak if he jumps out, as he does. See var.]
;W[jm]
(;B[om]MA[go][on]C[this seems a mistake. If i wanted to protect territly, I should have gone to P6 first. The other option was to cut between the white stones with something like G5.

[Rich\] - This move does little, you're right. P6 also defends a tiny amount of territory; if you'd wanted territory in the centre, then N3 was the wrong move! Your centre stone is floating uncomfortably. I think a move around G5 would have been better.]

(;B[bf]C[[Rich\] - When the opponent bumps against you like this, you should extend upwards (to D14). Letting him get this point is much to good for him; he has great shape and you have been pressed low. See var.]

C[this invasion seems to have given white too much territory for my effort.

[Rich\] - Not just territory, but influence weakening your centre group too!]

;B[ei];W[cj];B[fi];W[go]C[The spot I should have taken earlier]

;W[hg];B[hf]C[[Rich\] - On a purely shape basis (the efficiency of stones), this is not as good as playing at J15]

;W[je];B[kg];W[jf];B[jg];W[le]LB[oc:B][mc:A]MA[mf]C[this white group manage to survive, though it seems I should be able to kill it. Thoughts? Would playing X next have worked, followed by protecting the cutting points at A and B?

LB[gn:A]C[would A have been more forceful?

[Rich\] - No, you'd still have the weakness around H9 and white could connect out to the right with G5. I think H8 or 9 makes better shape, but there are bigger points still; pushing at O14, plays around L2,S10, S6; B4 is sente.]
;W[hk];B[gl];W[gp];B[gq];W[mn];B[lm]C[[Rich\] - This is almost a wasted move, compared to the other plays mentioned before. 

In the endgame, think where the big points are, and itch to play them! It's OK losing a point not answering something if you gain 8 elsewhere :)]
;W[kk];B[lj];W[jk];B[kj];W[ij];B[lk]C[[Rich\] - the M7 stones are connected already. Compare a white play at M2 vs a black play at L2, for example.]
