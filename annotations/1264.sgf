C[Requester's comments: How do I make progress?
Where are my faults?
Help me to correct them.

Reviewer's comments:

Overall you played better than W (if I counted correctly at the end) but there are a couple of general thoughts that seemd come up several times.

1) Keep your opponenents groups separated when you can.

2) Learn better shapes: bamboo joints for example.

3) Try to make your moves do several thinks at once; extend territory, narrow opp. territory, strengthen your groups and weaken your opp. groups.  Do all 4 is a beautiful move.  Do only 1 is a yukky move.

Hope this and my comments help.  Thanks

;W[pn]C[b and c make for an easier game.  b secures the corner for B but c puts more pressure on W to settle on the right..  See what you think of the variation from c.  Eventually you can get to play something around a if you want to.]

(;B[jq];W[lq]C[This may look scary for B but I wonder if it's not an overplay on W's part.  Pincing again at b looks promising, securing the corner while threatening to connect to K3.  I think you need to keep W on the run here.  Attacking M3 with b forces W to defend.  As you continue to press the attack you will also put pressure on the W stones at R5.  W has 2 weak groups that can give B an advantage.]

;B[rq];W[np]C[This is altogether too dangerous for B compared to the possible developments I suggested earlier.

Blocking a b prevents W from connecting to R6.  B ends up with 2 weak groups and W gets connected.

The block at b helps build an outside influence to go after large territory on the right.]
