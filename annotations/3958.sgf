AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[ Hi, I played this game against one of the strongest guys at the local club in front of a small crowd (fun, but nervewracking). I ended up winning by a couple points, but my opponent still whittled away at my lead throughout the game, and only thanks to a couple oversights on his part near the end did I escape with the lead. I need to take a stone off him for good, so any help you could give me would be great. Thanks!]
;W[fc];B[jc];W[cf];B[ee]C[PC: Good handicap game strategy: separate the White stones and keep them under pressure.]

(;B[fi]LB[dj:B][hi:A]C[PC: This is the first move I don't like. It doesn't put any pressure on the left-side group, so White can safely answer at 'a' and keep ahead of the Black stones in the centre. One alternative is to lean on the left with Black 'b', aiming at Black 'a' next - see variation.]
;W[hi];B[ii];W[hk]
(;B[el]LB[dj:A]C[ After I played this I felt that E9 might have been a more prudent move.

PC: Alternatively, lean on the left with 'a' - see variation.]

(;W[ij]
(;B[ki]LB[gj:A]C[PC: You can play a kikashi at 'a' first, which strengthens your connection a little]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[ej];B[fj];W[ei];B[fh];W[eh]
(;B[eg]TR[dg][dh][di]LB[fg:A]C[PC: Given that you're worried about the cut at 'a' here, an alternative is to play 'a' yourself, sacrificing the marked stones in return for keeping the attack on the centre White group going - see variation.]
;W[id]LB[fg:B][jd:A]C[I though the F13 cut was more urgent than this peep.

PC: Answering the peep with 'a' looks possible because the various White stones on the left aren't safe if White cuts at 'b', but things could get very complicated. See the variation for one possibility.]

(;B[fg];W[jd];B[kd];W[ke];B[ld];W[jf];B[ch]C[PC: Don't play this move unless you're going to cut - it's always going to be your sente, so there's no hurry to play it, and all it does at this point is to remove one of your own liberties and waste a ko threat.]
;W[bh];B[le];W[kf]
(;B[gl]LB[fl:B][lf:A]C[PC: 'a' looks tempting, as it makes a big difference in the centre and the top right, but allowing the cut at 'b' is a bit painful. See variations.]
;W[lf];B[jp];W[me];B[md];W[dl];B[dm]LB[em:A]C[PC: I like this move - it does a better job of keeping the White group's bad aji intact than the simple move at 'a'.]
;W[em];B[fl];W[cl];B[cm];W[bm]
(;B[bn];W[bl];B[co];W[pj];B[qh]C[He played R14 immediately after I put this stone down. Maybe I should have backed off a bit?

PC: I think this is fine, I think the mistake is further on.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[pe];B[of];W[qe];B[oe];W[qd]
(;B[oh]LB[qc:A]C[PC: This lets White live too easily in the corner. Better to play the two-step hane at 'a'; you'll either kill the corner, capture the cutting stone anyway, or force the stone to escape in very bad shape and get a good result. See the variations for some possibilities.]
;W[qc];B[pl];W[nd]
(;B[nc]C[I forgot about the O13 peep, so getting split like this was not good. Maybe M14 atari would be better?

PC: M14 does seem to give you better shape.];W[ne]
(;B[od]LB[oc:A]C[PC: 'a' gives the top group better shape - see variation.]

;W[mg]
(;B[rj]LB[mi:C][oi:A][oj:B]C[PC: It seems a shame to let the centre stones get cut off, as you lose all possibility of attacking White when that happens. One idea here is to play 'a', White 'b', Black 'c'. I don't think White can realistically try to shut you in after that - see the variation.]
;W[qk];B[jl]C[I wasn't sure about this move. It seemed to seal off the lower side.

PC: The lower left, at least. The lower right still looks open.]
;W[kk];B[jk];W[jj];B[kj];W[lk];B[pc]C[PC: Removing your own liberties again.]
;W[pb]
(;B[lm]LB[mk:A]C[After the game I thought this was a terrible move. Maybe S9 followed by K3 or R4 would have been better?

PC: The nose tesuji at 'a' looks interesting - see variation.]
;W[rk];B[rf];W[re];B[sg];W[nh]LB[oi:A]C[PC: 'a' is an interesting idea here, aiming to cut of the White stones on the right or to rescue the Black stones in the centre. If the centre stones are safe then White has to worry about two eyes for his own centre group. See variations.]

(;B[se];W[sd];B[sc]LB[ib:B][jb:A]C[This ko lost me points, but I wasn't sure if the upper side was alive yet, and this way I'd be sure to get some 100% sure points.

PC: I think the upper side is OK, but it's not obvious. The move to worry about is White 'a', but Black can play a sacrifice at 'b' and squeeze out two eyes - see variation.]

(;W[sf];B[nf];W[mf];B[se];W[mc];B[rd];W[mb];B[qb]C[PC: After the ko you've gained about 20 points in the top right and White has gained a similar number (maybe a few more) on the top. The problem is that you initiated the ko and ended in gote, so you've effectively spent a move and not gained anything.]
;W[jq];B[iq];W[kq];B[ip];W[nq];B[pr]LB[or:A]C[PC: 'a' is a more aggressive option, as it threatens White's eye space more directly.]
;W[qn];B[oo];W[mo]
(;B[rp]LB[nn:A]C[PC: This looks too defensive. You need to keep the pressure on the White group running out from the bottom edge, e.g. with 'a'.]

(;B[mq]LB[mr:B][or:A]C[PC: This is the last chance to play 'a'; after White answers N3 with 'b' you're too short of liberties.]

;W[dc];B[lc]LB[pa:B][ra:A]C[This was a mistake... I should have started with O19, P19.

PC: Yes. Note that this is also a point-losing ko threat, as after answering it White will be able to answer Black 'a' with 'b'; previously he would have had to answer at O19.]
