C[I played black in this game and won by six points.  It was round
2 of the Three Peaks tournament in Ingleton, England, and time
limits were 1 hour.

There are a few general points that I would like help on:
1) I won the game by making a large moyo in the centre of the
board.  I would like to know whether my strategy was sound, or
whether it only worked due to my opponent not punishing my un-reasonable
moves.
2) My opponent critised my play near the edge of the board.  He said that the shapes that I made allowed him to get in big
endgame plays.  Is this assesment correct, and if so could you
show me where I went wrong?

I've also added comments at various stages to indicate the thoughts
behind my moves.

Thanks in advance,  Ivan];B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[de];B[od];W[dc]

;W[dq];B[fp];W[qi]LB[jp:A]C[This surprised me.  I had been expecting white to finish the
joseki, allowing me to extend to A.

Reviewer: I think white should extend at D5. If not, R11 is not
the place to play.]
(;B[qg]LB[jc:A]C[Is this too small?  Would a move around A be better?  Or perhaps
a pincer?

Reviewer: Wrong side. See variation];W[jc]C[Reviewer: That was big but white should play R8. Black should
punish that
with R9. See Variation]
(;B[jp];W[po];B[np]LB[qo:A]TR[qi]C[I thought that playing at A would make White strong, and would
work too well for White in relation to the marked stone.

Reviewer: I do not like O17. Too easy for white. I like a pincer
at R8
instead. White is out-numbered so black should be aggressive.]

(;B[jj]C[I am aiming at a large moyo in the centre.  Is this an overplay?
My strategy ended up working, but I am concered as to whether
or not such a strategy is reasonable in this position.  Did it
only work due to inferior play by white?

Reviewer: You are right. You cannot build a moyo by carving it
that way.
You have to play forcing moves that result in a Moyo instead.
See variation - backup one move - lets try if I can build a Moyo
for you!];W[ej];B[di]C[Splitting White seemed correct initially.]
;W[eh]
(;B[gi]C[Played as a forcing move to protect my centre moyo.
Reviewer: If anything, I will cut at E11. There is no center
moyo to protect.
G11 is a thank you move. White is happy to connect. See variation.
backup one.];W[ei];B[em]C[I felt that my stones on the left needed help.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[dj];B[bk];W[ci];B[cl];W[kb];B[gl]C[I judged that this was larger than what I would lose at the top.
I reckoned that a white move at A would lose around ten points
for me (I've added what I expected in the variation).]

;B[pr];W[qq]C[I was quite pleased with this exchange.  I expected White to
do more damage.

Reviewer: That was big for black]
(;B[oh]C[Seems to be the crucial point between my moyo at the top and
White's on the right.

Reviewer: Not sure if that is where I will paly. I will block
at M18 or
play a more agressive move like Q7 or press at Q11or simply play
a sente move at B11 followed by B12]

;B[lb];W[la];B[ma];W[ka];B[nb];W[er];B[fr];W[fs];B[kc]C[A big blunder.  I was determined not to get pushed around and
let White get all the big endgame plays in, but this was a disaster.]
;W[hs];B[hr]C[Could I have defended any better than I did in the subsequent
moves?  I'm never too sure what to do in this sort of situation.

return. You
have many good ko theats];B[hf]C[I thought about this move for a long time.  I could not read
out what would happen if I connected, but thought that if I tried
to fight a ko then White would just ingore my first threat and
my moyo would be gone.

I did not really understand what was going on in the subsequent
fight, but I knew that if White lived I would lose the game.

here.  In hindsight my move seems a bit un-sportsmanlike.

However, would a Black move somewhere in the top left have worked?
I did not even consider such a move until after the game, but
it looks a bit open to me now.];W[bq];B[aq];W[ap]C[We both passed.

Black wins by six points.

Reviewer: Black lucky to win this game. Main mistake is the premature
focus
on building a moyo.  Both did not take advantage of weakness
but also both had good moves during the game. Advise to black
is to build influence then a moyo then use that to attack an
invasion or to build solid territory on a reduction attempt by
w.
Good luck
