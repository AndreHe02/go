;B[dp];W[eq];B[co];W[bp];B[cn];W[cr]C[I do not have my Ishida at hand, but on first sight I would say B3 is the joseki move. G4 would become sente, but B5 would not. With B5 being sente, C7 looses much of its aji.]
;B[dm];W[cf];B[jd];W[hc];B[hd];W[gc];B[ic]C[I don't like the last exchange. White gains more than black.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd]C[Since the lower right corner is black, this joseki is unfavorable for white.]
;W[pi];B[qe]C[I haven't seen this move before. Usually, it is played to make white heavy, but this makes no sense in this position. I would just play the normal joseki (i.e. the sequence without R15), which looks good for black.]
;W[rf];B[qi];W[pj];B[ph];W[oh];B[qj];W[pk];B[ql];W[pg]C[I don't see how the thickness will work for white.]
;B[bo];W[bq];B[cl]C[Too tight and not urgent. The lower right is the key area. I would play Q8.]

;B[qn]C[Now a move around P7 becomes urgent. If white gets to play there, blacks thickness becomes uneffective. Therefore I don't like blocking at R4.]
