(;W[qf]C[A pincer works wonderfully here (r12 being the best I think)
As well pushing the stone with B r15 W q14 B o17 W r11 is a good way to use  the r9 stone.  It limits white side group between strong corner and leaves  you with sente to reenforce your right side or move elsewhere.  You must use  the r9 stone efficiently or else it goes to waste.  That isn't the feeling I  got here.

See variants for what I mean.];B[nd];W[qi];B[qn];W[rd];B[qc]
;W[jc]C[I am especially interested in your opinion about my next few moves. I  didnt really feel they were the correct way to play...]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[dn]
(;B[cq]C[were there any better alternatives?

See variants also.

Depends on your goals and which joseki you know and prefer.  Here I think  you choose wrongly and were luck (due to whites inexperience) to pull out.   White easily cuts you in two and while doing so makes himself stronger.  So  each move you make on the left of his wall make his wall stronger and more  dangerous to your group to the right of it.  Since that group is light you  risk losing it or having it used against you.]

w r14 gruop seems to be very safe (right?)  and I didnt see any way to  attack it

Your correct about eye space.

The time to attack it was earlier as I mentioned.];W[ci];B[fc]
C[I also considered c17, c14 and d17  Did I make correct choice?

c17 Very bad creates a white outer wall that works well with all his stones  to the right and down.

c14 Less room to manuver and the stones are stronger to the bottum.  I don't  like it.

d17 This is properly played as a probe to test white.  Your purpose with it  should be to eventually sacrifice it after useing it to gain easy access to  white moyo (area of influence)

Other choices

N16 good shape with sente and it give that group more center access

h6 is also possible try to close that group off from the center.  J6 is  obvious responce.  G6 doesn't do much for white as your stone can connect to  the right.

G8 Push out and ensure white groups don't connect.

c9  That group is weak and you can likely cut it off, though a few  supporting moves like g8 or h6 would make that move better.

s17 Ensure life.

q10 if he pushes out then you push out till you can hane.

I like N16 best myself followed by g8 or h6 then c9.];W[dc]
;B[cf]C[Another guess on my part - was it good ?

Just know one stone will be sacrificed and yes.  Try to save both and no.   It is adventurous.]
