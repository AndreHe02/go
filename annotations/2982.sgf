C[Dear reviewer,

I played black in this game. It was quite a confusing game for me. At many points I didn't know what to do. I would greatly appreciate it if you could give me some advice in those situations. Thank you very much for reviewing this game.

z -- Hi, my name is Bill, "zinger" in the internet Go community.  I'll try to help as best I can.  My comments are marked with " z -- ".  Be sure to view my comments and variations critically, as I am also very weak.

z -- My first observation is that you won this game by a comfortable margin.  Ususally it is recommended to submit for review games that you have lost.  However, I am not sure this advice is always correct: when I study my own play, I find as many mistakes in games I have won as in games I have lost.  So I will trust your judgement that this is an appropriate game for review.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[cq];W[pp];B[de];W[ce]TR[cf][dd]C[I didn't know whether to play C14 or D16. Which point do you think is best?

z -- Both are joseki.  It is far beyond my skill to find a reason for either to be better.  I can only say that D16 (the avalanche) is complicated, while C14 is simpler.  Which you prefer is up to you.]
;B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cb]C[z -- I am not familiar with this white move.  But then again, I don't know much joseki.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[df]C[z -- looks like a good response.];W[nd]
TR[cf]C[I really didn't know how to respond to this move. I thought about a pincer, but I didn't play it because I thought it would be hard to make territory since my wall has a few cutting points. Finally I just played C14. What should I have done?

z -- considering black's position in the top left, I think a pincer is mandatory - an ideal two purpose move, extending and attacking.  True, the cutting point E16 is aji for white.  But the pincer stone will help with that, not hurt.  L16-17, M16-17 look like good points.  I would choose M17, for the reason given in Ishida: it is the only pincer which prevents white R17.]

(;B[cf]C[z -- admittedly, it is hard to call this move bad.  White is sealed in, and black gets more thickness.]
;W[eb]C[z -- aji keshi.];B[fb];W[da];B[fd]TR[fc]C[Is this connection good or is F17 better?

z -- I don't know.  I would choose F17, because after F16 white has a peep at G17 that might help him get settled at the top.  But then, F17 leaves a possible peep at F15.]
;W[kc]C[z -- this white move reduces black's thickness, another reason why I would have chosen the pincer earlier.]
;B[nq]C[z -- it might be better to develop the R16 stone, perhaps with P17 or R13.  Without this, a second white approach may be bothersome.]
;W[qn];B[jp]C[I didn't like bQ2, wR3, bL3 because then all my stones would be low.

z -- I agree.];W[dp]C[C4 or D3? I have no idea.

z -- me neither.  I think the rule is to crawl toward your own stones, and away from your opponents stones.  Here both ways head for black stones, so your guess is as good as mine.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[eq]C[z -- this is unusual, black normally would play B5 or C4.]
;W[fp]
(;B[dj]C[Should I have pushed on at F3, jump ahead at G3 or play at B5 instead?

z -- this is the right area - a move around here is a good extension for either player.  But I think that black should play closer to white, at D8.  D10 leaves white room for a comfortable extension.]
;W[hq];B[pr];W[qq];B[bo];W[dm];B[cl]C[z -- this move doesn't threaten any stones, and doesn't make safe any stones which were weak, so I don't think it's urgent.  K2, P17, or R13 look more urgent.]
;W[cm]C[z -- this white sequence is extreme aji-keshi.];B[bm]
;W[co];B[bn];W[cp];B[bp]C[z -- white has solidified black's connection and accomplished nothing for himself.]
;W[jr];B[kq];W[kr];B[lr]C[White didn't cut at M3, but what should I have done if she did?

z -- sacrifice one stone as shown in variation.]
(;W[qf]
(;B[pc]C[z -- black should move out instead.  see vars.  It is almost always better to push between a double kakari, rather than hunker down and try to make eyes.  Here especially so, since white's top group will be weakened.]
;W[oc]C[z -- this white move is strange.  Why not finish enclosing black with Q15, P15, or P14?]
;B[pf]C[The result of this sequence wasn't good for me. Where was the mistake and what should I have done instead?

z -- this move is good: black moves out.  Black Q15 would also be OK.  The mistake is next move.]
;W[pg]
(;B[qg]C[z -- this move is bad.  Instead, play P14 - see vars.]
;W[pe];B[of];W[qe]C[z -- now black must live in gote, and to add insult, the ladder starting with black Q12 favors white.]
;B[rd];W[pd];B[rb]TR[pb]C[Is there a better move? I didn't like this move very much, but I wasn't  sure whether I could lived with Q18

z -- black Q18 would indeed be a tricky life and death problem.  It looks like ko to me, but I can't say for sure.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qh];B[rg];W[rh];B[pk]C[I felt I had to do something about the  arising white territory.

z -- I agree some reduction is called for.  With this move, there is a risk that white will attack with O9, and make some nice profit chasing black around;  you must be prepared to fight to play this way.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[qr]C[z -- white should attack instead, perhaps with O9.]
;B[no];W[om];B[oi];W[og];B[ng];W[nf];B[oh];W[ph]C[z -- white should just take off two stones, to prevent the forcing move of black N14.]
;B[mf];W[oe]
(;B[nk]C[z -- black N13 would be better.];W[mm];B[ql];W[on]
;B[lo];W[mh]C[z -- bad.  If white plays here, he should cut.]
;B[lh];W[mg];B[mi];W[lg];B[kg]C[z -- I think this is too loose while black's main group is still floating.  What is stopping white from cutting at M11?]

z -- black H11 doesn't cut.  M8 still looks good.]

;W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[z -- some summary comments:

I think your biggest mistake in this game was failing to move out with your stones in the top right corner.  Getting sealed in was bad.  In such situations, there is no need to try anything fancy (like crosscutting) - just step solidly in between and walk out.  

Also, around moves 76-96 you missed several chances to make good use of your thickness on the left side.  Always try to find moves that work together with your stones that are already on the board.  (This also applies to making the pincer at move 15).

But don't dwell just on the negative.  After all, you played well enough to solidly beat a player ranked above you.  Good job, and good luck in the future!]
