C[Comment: Andre Bergholz, (2K) in Germany, berge on IGS, NNGS (Comments marked  with AB)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[ck]C[AB: It's a good idea to break up the White side, but if you don't want to use the middle point C10 I would prefer to play a little towards the upper half, because the danger of a big framework is there.]

(;W[fq]C[AB: Consequently, I think White should first expand with C11 (see variation).]
;B[cn];W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[pl]LB[pm:A][qm:B]
C[AB: I'm not an expert with Chinese opening, but this move seems not so great, because the exchange for Q9 just helps Black. 'A' or 'B' seem favourable.]
;B[pk];W[om]LB[ol:A]C[AB: Again a strange shape. Why not just extend to 'A'?]
;B[jp]LB[kp:A]C[AB: Maybe just to L4, but I'm not sure.];W[ok]
;B[oj];W[oi]C[AB: Again, rather strange.]
(;B[pi]C[AB: I think atari at O9 is necessary... (see variations).]
;W[nj];B[pj];W[nh]LB[nk:A]C[AB: Again, strange shape. There is bad aji around 'A'.]
;B[ce];W[ed];B[ef];W[gd];B[fn];W[ph];B[qh];W[ql];B[pg];W[fh]
;B[dh];W[gf];B[fg]LB[me:A]C[AB: This cut is really unnecessary, an overplay. Also, G13 is the better starting point for cutting. But right now it is easier to prevent a White moyo by playing something like 'A'.]
;W[gg];B[gh];W[fi];B[hh];W[di]LB[gj:A]C[AB: I'm not sure about this sequence, just White 'A' is good.]
;B[eh];W[ei];B[ci];W[ch]
(;B[cg]C[AB: Better at B11 (see variations).];W[cj];B[bh];W[gj]
;B[jh]C[AB: Now you see that the cut was an overplay, you're into unnecessary trouble.]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[ch];B[bg];W[eg];B[dg];W[ai]C[AB: White could also just connect, that would be good enough to have the advantage in the game.]
;B[ci];W[oq];B[dj];W[pr]C[AB: That was a big exchange, possibly favourable for Black. The corner loss is big, but weakening the White F10 group is too. Black can take the initiative now.]
;B[ij]C[AB: Very good.];W[gl];B[im];W[hm];B[il];W[ho];B[go]
;W[in];B[jn];W[hp];B[fp];W[eq];B[gm];W[hl];B[hn]C[AB: You guys just love kosumis and kos. For Black it is to early to start the ko, though, because after White captures the G7 stone is in atari right away. Black would need a really big threat to prevent White from capturing through.]
;W[gn];B[gk]LB[op:A][nk:B]C[AB: What is that?? You had more interesting threats like 'A' or 'B'.]
;W[fm]C[AB: Of course.];B[fk]
(;W[ek]C[AB: I wouldn't even bother defending the White F11 group, just capture at E6.]
;B[hk];W[dk];B[el];W[dl];B[em];W[en];B[dm];W[dn];B[co];W[cp]
;B[fo];W[fl];B[cm];W[do];B[io];W[hn]
(;B[nq]C[AB: White's loss on the left is a little bigger than necessary, but overall White has the lead. It is difficult to recommend something, maybe the variation?]
;W[ip]LB[me:A]C[AB: Small, 'A' instead and the game is over.]
;B[ne]C[AB: Right idea, although the White move was kind of sente...]

(;W[nr];B[nk];W[ol];B[mk];W[kl]C[AB: Seems like an overplay.]

(;B[kk]C[AB: Not so good (see variation).];W[jm]C[AB: Big! Protecting the cut was important I think.]
;B[ll];W[kn];B[jo];W[jk];B[ik];W[ko]
(;B[kp]LB[jl:A]C[AB: Throw in the atari at 'A'!];W[mo];B[lm]
;W[km];B[lp];W[mn];B[mr];W[ir];B[jr];W[mp];B[mq]
(;W[is]LB[iq:A]C[AB: Big mistake, just 'A' and Black is dead.]
;B[js];W[jq];B[kq];W[lr];B[iq];W[hq];B[hr];W[jq];B[kr];W[ls]
;B[iq];W[kj];B[lk];W[jq];B[ln];W[lo];B[iq];W[mj];B[gq]C[AB: Great tesuji!]

(;W[jq]C[AB: Big mistake. Risks everything in a good position.]
;B[gr];W[lq];B[iq];W[lj];B[hs]C[AB: The game is turned around, Black has a clear advantage now.]
;W[rk];B[rj];W[rl];B[oh];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]
(;B[ob]LB[qd:A]C[AB: Better at 'A', I think (see variation).]
;W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[qd]LB[rf:A][rd:B]C[AB: Very bad! Doesn't gain you anything, but takes away the opportunity to play more interesting move like 'A' or 'B' later on.]
;W[rd];B[lc];W[kc];B[ld];W[lb];B[mb];W[kb]C[AB: You see that Black is overconcentrated.]
;B[ni];W[mi];B[mh];W[oi];B[jj];W[jl];B[ni];W[lh];B[ng];W[lg]
;B[bq]C[AB: Hard to judge (too difficult to read out for me :-)). Didn't work, so obviously playing from the outside would have been better. But you only get to know that afterwards :-).]
;W[bp];B[cr];W[dr];B[fr];W[cq];B[br];W[er];B[bo];W[aq];B[ao]
;W[ap];B[fe]LB[bc:A]C[AB: Well, White proved that this one is not so great. 'A' is a good endgame move in that region.]
;W[ff];B[eg];W[ee];B[dd]LB[bc:A]C[AB: Still 'A'. This is a so called "thank you"-move, because White gets to stabilize his position whereas Black gains nothing.]
;W[dc];B[ie];W[id];B[lf];W[jg]LB[kg:A]C[AB: The disaster gets going :-). In this case, bad shape at 'A' is good.]
;B[ki];W[li];B[kg]C[AB: The game is over. Really.];W[kf];B[kh]
;W[le];B[mf];W[je];B[if];W[ig];B[jf];W[ih];B[ke];W[ii];B[hg]
;W[hi];B[ge];W[ji];B[mg]C[AB: For my taste there was too much fighting going on in this game, so the outcome also depends on luck. Sometimes both of you could have achieved something favourable with a simple, but more strategic move. As for the fighting: It would be good to study kikashi and aji keshi (there is a book "Beyond Forcing Moves"). But actually I don't want you to fight more than you already do :-). Maybe "The Direction of Play" instead. If you have any more questions you can reach me by email: Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com]
