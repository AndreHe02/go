C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  I don't know where I'm going wrong, but it seems as though I keep falling fairly far behind early in the game.

When I play, I find I spend quite a bit of time thinking about what stronger players have suggested, but I guess I must be trying the wrong ideas at the wrong time.  In this game, I'm thinking of the invasion at R8 as an example of this.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger (Fedya on KGS)];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic]
C[Ted: In the past, I would have played the Kobayashia fuseki at C6, but I haven't been getting good results with that, while my opponents have been getting excellent results when they play the Chinese fuseki, so I've decided to try the Chinese fuseki myself.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[Ted: I decided not to play a pincer attack as I didn't think it would be that good to have a stone isolated at R12 between the two white stones.  Stronger players have suggested to me that a pincer attack works better when it's played as an extension from one of your stones.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[pj]LB[qi:A]C[this move falls off the fuseki tree.  The usual continuation
for white is at A];B[cn]C[Ted: I wasn't certain what to do with sente here, and decided that extending from C16, while approaching my opponent's corner, couldn't be a bad thing.  It kills two birds with one stone (no pun intended!).]
;W[cl];B[cq]C[Ted: Running out towards the center by playing E6 wouldn't have been better, would it?  I've never been able to figure out when I should go to the corner and when I should run out to the center when faced with a pincer attack.

I think in this case running out is the right thing.  Jumping into the corner you're
bound to be separated, and have two weak groups to deal with, or white will get a
strong wall and have a lot of potential territory.];W[dq];B[cp]
;W[do];B[bn]C[White goes for the wall.];W[dn];B[nq]LB[jp:A]
C[Ted: I have a feeling this move is going to come under criticism.  But I had no idea what to do here.  I can't allow White to get a big moyo, but don't know the best move to stop it.

Amusingly enough,  I had a similar situation in a recent game that I had reviewed through GTL,
and the kind reviewer recommended probing at A and then extending depending on which way
white responds.   Remember that the wall in Column D has no real territory yet, and the corner
is still open no matter where white reponds.  It's not at all bad for black, as long as he starts now.]
;W[qn]
(;B[kq]LB[iq:A]C[this is too close.  Black is almost insisting on a reponse at A, which will constrain black and be 
very profitable for white.];W[iq]C[How did I guess?  White has the right idea.]
;B[of]LB[ec:A][cj:B]C[Ted: I wonder if I should have played R12 or R8 here.  I've been told in the past that these are weak points, but when I attack them, I don't get a good position out of them.

P14 is over concentrated, and only encourages white to do what he wants to do anyway.  P12 and Q 12
are points to watch, but requires more expertise than I have to orchestrate an invasion at this point.  I would
look at the overall balance, leave the right for now and look at A and B as key points to be developed instead.]
;W[ph]C[white thanks you.];B[cg]LB[fc:B][cj:C][ql:A][gn:D]C[Ted: Again I had sente, and as usual, I had no idea what to do with it.  I thought quite a bit about attacking at R8, since there's no longer a chance to attack at R12.  (Eventually, I did attack at R8, but of course when I try such an attack it doesn't work.)

C13 is too small, it only makes a little territory and white isn't bothered at all.  Not a good use of Sente.
The big points are still in the vicinith of B (will black get the whole side or not) C (who will control the side)
and D (will white's wall eventually surround a huge territory.  Of those three, I would be most worried about
D, because white can easily grow his influence around D by attacking the black stones on teh bottom.]
;W[pq]LB[jp:A]C[given white's strong position in the corner, I would press from the other side, perhaps at A.]
;B[np]C[Ted: I have a feeling you're going to criticize this move.  However, I was terribly worried that White was going to play something like N4 next.]
;W[ci]C[this extension was practically demanded by C13.];B[fc]
C[I think the corner can still be invaded.  E17 would be better.]
;W[lc]C[Ted: White proceeds to get something good out of a splitting attack, which is more than I'll be getting out of my splitting attack.]

(;B[mc]C[playing this way forced white to run out, and in the process probably spoil any
black potential toward the center.  If you press (see variation) white will have a very 
hard time.];W[le];B[lb]C[Ted: I really didn't want White playing here, since it would allow him to weaken either the right or the left side by jumping under the stones and leaving me with thickness instead of territory.]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[lg];B[ql]TR[pj][qn]C[Ted: I've had stronger players tell me that this is a good move for splitting the two marked White stones; indeed, in the past when I've tried playing the Kobayashi fuseki, I've had my stones split in the same way.  When my opponents try such a splitting attack, it works for them, but when I try it, it doesn't work for me.]
;W[pm]
(;B[pk]C[Ted: I took a very long time thinking about this move.  Stronger players keep telling me when my opponents play a pincer attack that it's OK to run out into the center, but I always have difficulty getting eyes in the center, and in this particular case, I think it would mean sacrificing the R8 stone.  I don't think I can sacrifice R8 because that would mean giving up the entire side to White -- in which case, why even play there in the first place?  On the other hand, I don't see where I'm going to get two eyes on the side.]
;W[ok];B[qj];W[pl];B[qk];W[pi];B[rh];W[qi];B[ri];W[rm]LB[rd:2]
[qf:1][rf:A]C[Ted: I thought quite a bit about my next move, since I was trying to figure out where I'm going to get two eyes.

The weaknesses around stones 1 and 2 are your lever.  See variations.  When you have two ways
to go, and white closes one off as with this move, then take the other.  S13 might work, but I like A
better.]
(;B[rl]C[Ted: In retrospect, I think I should have played S13.]
;W[rg];B[sj]C[Ted: I don't think this is right.

There is no "right" here, since you can't live.  The right play (as soon
as you believe that you're probably dead) is to play elsewhere and 
save this for Ko, or maybe something else will develop.  There is no
point in solidifying a lost position.];W[sh];B[si];W[sg];B[rk]
;W[sl];B[qm];W[rn];B[gq]C[Ted: By this time, I realized that the right side was lost.  So, I played here out of desperation.  I have the sinking feeling, however, that the entire game was lost with the right side and that this is pointless.

Not pointless, and in fact this is a pretty good move.  The white wall's potential
is clearly the biggest think you have to worry about, and can possibly do something
about, and this looks like a good way to approach it.];W[io]
;B[go];W[gm];B[ko]C[Ted: Would it have been better to play H6 here?

Definitely H6];W[hn]LB[ip:A]C[See variation.  The key play here is to play at A, and whichever way white reponds, you
have two good cutting points.]
(;B[km];W[nn]
(;B[ie]LB[nh:A]C[too slow.  This lets white sleep blissfully.  Make him sweat a little.
See variation A];W[ln];B[kn];W[kk];B[eg]C[Ted: I have a feeling you'll criticize both this (and my earlier move at J15), suggesting that I should have played on the bottom to ensure I'd get two eyes for that group.  But I thought it was safe, and I needed to make territory on the top.  I knew I was behind, but I didn't realize just how far behind I was.  (And yes, I *did* try counting!  I came to the conclusion that I was only trailing by 15-20 points.)

When you are behind, it is rarely useful to try to make territory by ploddingly claiming
it with 2 point jumps into the center.  It hjust take too many moves, and white can simply
do the same to maintain parity.];W[ei];B[gg];W[hf];B[ge];W[if]
;B[he];W[jf];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[ir]LB[ip:A]C[Look back at the variation I proposed at A.]
;W[hr];B[jr];W[hq]
(;B[jq]LB[or:A]C[this is unnecesary.  Play A instead and live easily.]
;W[or];B[nr];W[rc];B[rb];W[pe];B[oe];W[qd];B[pc];W[jp];B[kp]
;W[lo];B[lp];W[lm];B[pn]C[Ted: Here, I thought I came up with a plan that could save the stones on the right side by playing a few sacrifices, but I missed something in my reading.

I think the only big thing left would be to try something like G11 and hope I can reduce White quite a bit in the center (and keep all my territory).

If there were such a sequence, you would have to use it at an earlier phase. Once you're
down to 2 liberties, white can probably finish the capture if he gets in any trouble.]
;W[on];B[ol];W[om];B[oj];W[nk];B[qg];W[pg]C[Ted: The R13 stone is in atari, which is what I missed.  I was under the impression that White would have to respond at S14 instead of playing Q13.

This is an understandable mistake in reading, but this kind of plan is rarely
successful, as it depends on white making several mistakes in reading and
black making none.  It can happen, but it's not likely.  You shouldn't concentrate
your learning efforts on this approach.];B[rf];W[qh];B[hh];W[hj]
;B[jh];W[li];B[ak];W[bk];B[al];W[bh];B[bg];W[nh];B[jc];W[ke]
;B[gf];W[lr]
(;B[mr]C[Ted: I believe J1 is the right move here.  But I was really demoralized here.  I already knew that White was ahead (I just didn't realize how far ahead White was), and was terribly frustrated that now I was going to have to defend against yet *another* attack.

It's hard to read, but you might manage a seki with J1.];W[ms]
;B[ns];W[ls];B[lq];W[mp];B[mo]C[Ted: Here I resigned, since I realized that O5 kills the Black group.  But even if it survived, I'd still be horribly far behind.

Generally, you're obviously suffering from a plague of pessimism, but you're not in nearly
as bad shape as you think. ( Take 2 Halcyon and call me in the morning.).   You're biggest
problem is a tendancy to play overly conservative, overconcentrated moves.  Loosen up
a little; you only need to play strictly definsively when there is no alternative.  When there are
still alternatives, respond in ways that regain the initiative.  Second, try to play in ways that
give white problems to solve.])
