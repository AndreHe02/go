Hi Romulus,

I hope you will find my comments useful. If you have further questions concerning this game, please feel free to email me.

Joerg.

Hi Joerg & Romulus, here's my "meta-review" :)

I have prefixed my comments using my pseudonym "brn". You will find comments
along the main line of play as well as the variation. My summary is below Joergs towards the end. I have commented both on Joerg's review and some of the original moves..

Christian];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[qn];B[qo]LB[nq:a][np:b][qj:c]
C[White approached this corner pretty early. But you have played on the starpoint which enables you to easily make shape with even two or three white moves in the corner. So I would prever to play in the last open corner. Maybe a matter of taste. Let's see how the game continues.

But if you reply to the approach, this move is not good. By attaching a lone intruder you strengthen him. It is not obvious, but the more severe moves are the ones played some spaces away. (See the Variaton of White 6 for another reason why this move is bad).

Stay calm and play a move around 'a' or 'b'. Even a pincer aound 'c' is better in this situation because it develops your starpoint in the upper right.]

(;W[on]C[The usual move is VAR.
brn: This white move is normally played to make sabaki when in danger. In this case,
there is no danger to the life of white, white will lose out by playing this jump.]

(;B[qj]LB[np:a]C[Your plan to attack is not generally bad. Maybe you should secure your position at the bottom with a move around 'a' first.

Of course this would enable White  to make an extension up the right side, but it would be a fair trade and you could occupy the last empty corner.   That is what Go is about. Balance. It is an important concept. If your opponent gets territory or influence and you get something equal or more valuable it is a fair trade.

brn: In fact, look at the variation for what happens if black plays a.]
;W[pk]LB[op:A]MA[np]C[brn: White should attach at A and seal black into the corner since black neglected to jump
to the marked point. There is nothing to be afraid of there and it will work well with
the white stone in the bottom left.];B[pg];W[pj];B[qi];W[pi]
;B[ph]C[brn: Black says thank you. White has remove all potential on the right and force black to make territory.]
;W[po]
(;B[qp]C[This is a heavy move. Means, it makes your shape not flexible.   Don't be to concerned about a cut.
See VAR.

brn: I wouldn't call it heavy in this case because it's alive in the corner. The point here
is not black's shape, it's White's shape that black is not preventing. The difference between
variation two and white's next move is massive.];W[op];B[oq]
;W[np];B[nq];W[ro]C[brn: This is a mistake.. see next move.]
;B[rp]MA[mp]C[brn: Black should hane at the vital point instead of blocking, (hane at the head of two stones) the difference is huge.]
;W[rn];B[lq]C[brn: Black misses the vital point again.];W[ec]
;B[kc]LB[cd:a]C[Making an approach move is generally more valuable.

The order in the opening is something like this:

- Moves in the corner
- Make corner enclosures or prevent them
- Play in front of corner enclosures


So I would suggest a move around 'a'.];W[de];B[cj]C[Until here everything looks good for me.

Both players have two corners and I was planning to attack white corner as soon as white is revealing  its intentions in reply to my marked move.

------

Ok, to establish a presence at the left seems like a good idea to me.]
;W[cl]LB[cq:a]C[It's obvious his trying to prevent me to atack his  corner

------

This move also attacks your stone. By the way, this move does not really defend the corner territory, because the corner is open to an invasion at 'a'.]

(;B[gp]LB[cg:a]C[too slow

------

Not only that. You should take care of your C10-stone. Playing at C10 is a good idea, if you want to establish a presence there, because it is easy to make a base for that stone. That is, if White attacks from below, you extend upwards. If he attacks from above, you extend down the side.

It seems to me that the G4-move should prevent White from building a moyo. But it is necessary to play important moves before big moves.   In this case you really should extend to 'a'. This would be a threat to the corner, too. This double-purpose makes it really a good move. White would probably defend and you could still play G4.

brn: The reviewer is right here. Black absolutely must make a base, then he can think  about destroying the moyo if it gets formed. Look at the variation.]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[ch]MA[fp]C[Now you are in trouble. You have to run away and White can attack you from above and below while taking territory.

brn: It is extremely bad for white to leave the bottom left corner in the state it is currently
in. Pushing up at the marked point is extremely big and make even close the corner later.
Yes, white can attack this stone a bit, but leaving the corner thin like this he won't have
very big freedom in his attack.
It is always a good strategy to strengthen your stones, threatening an attack and taking
territory at the same time, rather than just attacking by brute force.]

(;B[ej]MA[cn]C[trying to escape to center where I can link my group  to the bottom one

See variation.

------

Escaping is the only way to play now.

brn: Not necessarily. White has extremely bad aji in the lower left. Invading at the marked
point could be playable, threatening to immediately link with the stone on the left. Alternatively, black could play variation 2.]
;W[el];B[fn]C[brn: If you play such a move, you need to know and play a continuation.. Otherwise
you've just lot speed.];W[fh]C[brn: Black is in extreme trouble after letting jump white at both sides.. White's wall
on the right is also waiting for him..];B[hc]C[Jumping to G10 seems to be more urgent to me.]
;W[en]C[G8 would be more severe.];B[eo]C[brn: The sequence starting now completely makes the white corner secure and is black's
biggest loss so far in the game.. black loses the 3-3 point.]
;W[dn];B[ep];W[dq]CR[ej][cj]LB[mc:a][lo:b]MA[mp]TR[gl]C[a short overview from my point of view.

Up to this point except two weak marked stones  situation is even maybe slightly better for me. I  have two corners and white has two. I control the  bottom and upper sides and white is controlling left  side. If I manage to attack his UL corner escaping  the marked stones, I guess I can win this game.

------

I do not agree with you. I dare say that you are in trouble.   Your territory at the bottom and in the bottom right corner is pretty big. So is White's territory in the lower left. The White corner in the lower left is relativ save.

The upper right corner is not yours. It is open to an 3-3 point invasion which will definitely suceed. You have to play at least an other move to secure this corner and still another one to make it hard for Black to invade around 'a'.

The White corner in the top left is not secure, too. But it would be more difficult to invade.   It is easy for White to threaten an invasion at the bottom while enlarging his own influence. (Imagine a move around 'b'). On the other hand it would be big for you to play around 'b' yourself. This is another 'defect' you have to defend.

The focus of the game is the Black group at the left. If White manages to catch it, it will be a big loss. But even if Black manages to escape, White can get an advantage by building strong positions on the right and left.

brn: The white area at the top left is at least 20-30 points. Bottom left around 15-20 points.  White will probably get 5-10 points from his group on the right, total 50-60 points, depending on the next few moves.  Black has a sure 15 points on the right. If black plays another move, he will get around 25 in the corner and on the right. We'll count the two space extension as 4 points for now. Black has 25 points at the bottom and can make more by playing the thick move
at the marked point. So black has just about 50 points, say, but it's black's move.

If black plays at the triangled point to sacrifice his stones or pull them out, that should be
enough to win the game...];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[dr]C[Now the White corner is completely save.]

(;B[gk]C[Looks good. Now black stones are almost escaped.  I don't like the direction but it looked to me that I've  many chances to link my stones to the bottom  group and not to the upper one.

------

It is a good idea to run towards the center. A simple one-point jump would be better though, because it can not so easily be cut like the knight's-move. (See VAR at the next move)

brn: The direction is wrong, black is chasing white into his moyo...]

(;W[fm];B[gm];W[jp]TR[gl]C[Indeed too far.

brn: White MUST play the marked point first it creates two cutting points!]
;B[ko]TR[mp]C[brn: Black should probably play at  the marked point instead, an extremely thick move. Keep in mind that the group on the right is not alive yet, even though it may look big]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[mq];B[mp]C[clicko: I wanted to capture his stone. MAXCAT didn't  wanted to undo so I continued leaving the game as  is.]
;W[mo];C[**romy**: tb please];C[ UNDO: romy undid the last move (N5)  N4.]
;B[mr];W[mp];B[kq]C[Looks good for you.];W[nd];B[nc]C[Maybe again the direction was wrong...

------

Like before: if you attach a lone intruder, you will strengten him.

A diagonal move at P17 should work better. It secures the corner more or less and threatens a link-up the the black group on the left.

brn: I agree with this analysis. In particular, when white descends now he runs into your side territory!]
;W[od];B[oc];W[pe]
(;B[oe]C[very aggressive, right?

------

Right, try the two-step hane. (VAR)

brn: Just connecting seems to work better, see the end of  variation one and then
variation two.];W[qd];B[pc];W[qc]SQ[oe]C[I left him to invade my corner. what a big mistake. I  didn't realized then that by playing hane with the  marked stone I'll let him invade.

------

But these are only some scattered white stones. The real mistake was maybe your next move. And remeber that the idea that the corner belongs to you was a mistake in the first place.]

(;B[qb]C[Too passive. Show more fighting spirit! You are at a clear advantage in this part of the board. (see VAR)]
;W[rb];B[pb];W[rf];B[qe]C[again attack to the max

------

You saw the cut, this is good.];W[re];B[pf];W[rh]LB[qh:A]MA[nd]
[od]CR[qj][qi]C[uggly! I cought his marked stones but now my two  circels are under attack. I should mention I didn't  realized I should connect at A. BIG MISTAKE.

------

true

brn:  you lose the moves threatening to kill the corner and all moves threatening to kill the white group below, this oversight is enourmous.]

(;B[md]C[stupid as hell!];W[qh]C[now it's too late.

I wonder how I could have make some profits here...

------

Now the right side is big for White.

I think your mistake was to play too passively in the corner. As I mentioned, you should have cut earlier.]

(;B[rc];W[rd];B[ra];W[sc]C[forcing him to make two eyes?!? stupid again!

------

And for another reason wrong. These moves were comparatively small and should be made in the endgame. White could have ignored S19 and played a big point elsewhere, because he doesn't need two eyes there. He can always catch the two black stones to link up.
brn: This is more or less the endgame, btw.. but black should take the bigger points in the centre.]
;B[rg]C[what am I trying?!?

------];W[qg];B[ri];W[qk];B[sh];W[sg]C[clear as daylight! where my mind was?

------];B[qf];W[si]
(;B[fl]LB[fj:a][lm:b]C[Does not prevent the cut at 'a' as far as I can see.

White doesn't have to answer this move. (see VAR on White's next move)

Play a bigger move. For example VAR or 'b' (expands your territory while limiting White's)

brn: This atari is quite big, as I've commented before. The review should explore the difference to white playing one point to the right first...]

brn: You got the variation slightly wrong in my opinion.];B[gn]
;W[sp]MA[lm]TR[fj]C[brn: White should play at the marked point, expanding his territory and limiting black's.
White is also aiming at the cut at the triangled stone with this move..]
;B[sq];W[rq]
(;B[qq]C[Ooops... I wonder why I was afraid to capture like in  variation?

------

Yep, in terms of the endgame a big mistake.];W[sr];B[rr]C[brn: Overplay.]

(;W[sq]MA[qr]C[brn: white should play Ko at the marked point, see the variation.]
;B[qr];W[hi]SQ[nd][od]C[This move could have some effect on the two marked stones. Does the ladder still work? Check this out...]
;B[cc]LB[gf:A][ge:B]C[I think it have been better to push around A or B  first.

------

No, I think your invasion is ok. It was maybe the last chance, before White plays here.]

C[brn: order wrong, white MUST hane at the marked point first]
;B[bb];W[bd];B[he]TR[ed]C[Ok, now you still got the chance to push up and build territory to the right.

brn: this move is embarassing for white. white should have played hane at the free point of the jump as said before. black has a good squeeze now starting at the marked point.]

Go on with 'a'. A white move there would be dangerous.

------

indeed. Dont't play too passiv. Don't try to save every single stone in atari. Show more fighting spirit.

brn: bad result is an understatement, white has completely ruined black's center and
the side.];B[ab]LB[li:a][kl:b][bj:c]C[Very small.

Keep White's center small with 'a'. Develop your own center with 'b'. Or descent to 'c' and threaten to reduce the upper or lower white group.]
;W[hg];B[ji]C[This move serves no purpose. It is too pasive.]
;W[li];B[ki];W[kl]C[White is building territory while reducing the potential of your moyo.]

;W[jm];B[in];W[hm];B[hn]CR[ej][cj]C[I had a look at the following moves and could not make out any big mistakes. So there will no comments follow.

I think you lost because of the following points:

Don't let your groups be robbed of a base like the "OOO"-stones for the reasons I already gave. Your opponent simply let you slip away in this game.   Don't think that the 4-4 point secures corner territory. It doesn't! This stone supports influence and a fast development of your opening.

Keep in mind the order of moves in the opening.

Show more fighting spirit. You only lost the top right and top-center because you played to passively. You lost by 20-25 points. This is less than you lost in these fights.

Remember that Go is about balance.


If you keep these points in mind your strength will surely increase.

Good luck, Joerg.

brn: I agree mostly with Joerg's analysis, the strategic points are mostly sound. It seems
that most of the points I disagreed with were tactical mistakes. As for the players, black
must show more fighting spirit indeed. If your opponent runs into your territory you
must not give way. White tenukis too much. The bottom right corner could have ended
very bad for white if black had played the right continuation. Both players have  missed several vital points (remember, hane at the head of two stones).
In the end, black lost because he made whites lower left corner too solid too quickly instead of invading and because  he did not play the right attack on the top right.

(You did not actually lose the game there, you lost it because of the endgame mistakes. But had you played against a stronger player, those more serious mistakes would have cost you the game immediately).]
