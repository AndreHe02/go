C[General: I was really overpowered by white, losing sente over and over again.
 My attempts to sketch territory were turned around easily by white, and couldn'
t find a way to push him back and regain sente.

Moves 6-21: I really didn't have any idea of how to contain white in this fight.
  Is the double approach a good response to this attack?  Or is an extension to
O4 more appropriate?

Moves 49-71: Again, I couldn't stop white from invading my corner

Moves 119-125: My moves felt really weak here.  I couldn't think of a way to sto
p white here.  White has the advantage here in this kind of tit-for-tat play, at
 this point things seemed hopeless.

lop> Hi, I hope i can answer your questions and give you some valueable hints.
Usually I don't show complicated tactictal sequences in reviews because I think  that they wouldn't help very much, I hope that is ok with you.]

(;B[ql]TR[jp]LB[nq:A][np:B]C[usually you play this pincer when you have a stone at K4 because  if white goes into the corner you get a nice wall where K4 is a good extension.

I think instead of the pincer you can simply play A or B here.
A or B are normal and simple moves which everybody knows, you cannot come into troubles  with moves that you know better.

btw: you call this double approach in your question but actually a double approach is something
different, (see variation) this move is called pincer, because it limits whites possiblity to extend and
forces him to run or live in the corner.]
(;W[qp];B[qq];W[po]
(;B[pm]C[not good, this move has no impact on the white shape, see variation for better moves]
;W[op];B[pq];W[oq];B[rp]
(;W[pn]LB[oo:A][on:B]C[This move is wrong, it creates an inefficient empty triangle, and it doesn't connect whites stones.
I think the purpose of it was to connect, i don't see other reasons.

A or B are better connections]
(;B[qo]LB[oc:A][od:B][ec:C][ed:D][iq:E][cn:F][cj:G]C[bad move, it only takes one white stone, you could use sente to play big opening moves a,b,c,d,e,f,g]
;W[ro];B[qp]LB[rq:1][rr:2][rs:3][sr:4][ss:5]C[This move is bad, you protect one stone, which is very small, big beginning moves are still open.

look at the shape of your 6 stones in the corner now, they are one big lump which has no influence on
the rest of the game, they are weak and if they live, they secure only about 5 points territory + 1 prisoner.
6 points with 6 stones is 1 point per stone this is very ineffective, normally 1 stone can make about 4 or 5
points.];W[no]C[White protects his weakness, now he needed 2 moves to connect where he could connect with one move earlier, this is inefficient]
;B[qm]TR[ql][qm][pm]MA[pl]LB[rn:A]C[bad move again

empty triangle is inefficient shape

in case you don't know the empty triangle, it's the shape formed by the triangled stones where the  squared point is empty.


if you think about it if white connects now at A you gained exactly 0 points and the R7 stone
is hidden behind the other stones = no more effect on the game.  So R7 is very bad. Actually  it is even better to pass instead because you force your opponent to connect where you could have cut.]
;W[jp]C[K4 is a good point, it extends from whites wall on the right and from whites hoshi on the left
it is a big fuseki move and worth more than the connection at S6.]
;B[dj]LB[cn:A][cj:B]C[Also a good point but maybe it's better to play on the third line here at A or B]
;W[oc]
(;B[qf]LB[pe:A][oe:B]C[this move is to passive, white has entered blacks sphere of influence so you can attack him.


A or B.
the idea is to build territory on the left side while attacking white.
R14 only establishes 3rdline territory and is to slow when you are strong around like here.]
;W[qc];B[pd];W[pc];B[ec]C[very good point, to prevent the white shimari is very big.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[cf];B[ch];W[bg];B[bh];W[ef]TR[ec][ed]LB[ge:A]
C[with this move white gains power to reduce the top side or to attack  the triangled stones.

the intuitive move is  at A which continues the attack on white and secures the top side.
(see variation)]
(;B[dm]LB[cn:A][cm:B]C[i think it is better to play on the 3rd line here. A or B]
;W[cn];B[cm];W[dn];B[hp]C[good invasion point, now you have to be careful because you are in whites sphere of influence now.
If you become attacked running out is very important.];W[gq]
;B[hq];W[gp];B[go];W[fo];B[hn];W[kq]C[invasion was good. your string is pretty save for now.]
;B[mc]LB[rn:A]C[good move, although the white connection at S6 (a) becomes dangerous now, if white connects
you cannot be 100% sure that you can live in the corner so the black cut and connection at S6  is a good move as well.]
;W[rd];B[db]C[interesting exchange.];W[cb]LB[re:A]C[white protects now so you can also protect on the left side (A) which also makes you strong there]

(;B[ma];W[lc];B[mb]C[this is because you didn't play M17 yourself.]

(;B[od]LB[pf:A]C[this connection is bad, because now 5 stones of yours die better is to connect at  Q14 (a)]
;W[pf]
(;B[ob]C[bad move, it is to small M16 is important to connect those stones to the K16 stone.]
;W[pb];B[oa]LB[ld:A][kc:B]C[very bad, you don't have to make eyes here if you can connect to the outside with M16 or L17]
;W[jb]
(;B[kb];W[kd];B[kc];W[ld];B[ib];W[qh]C[yes now your two stones are weak and can be attacked if they run it becomes dangerous for the R7 stones
as well.];B[pg];W[of]
(;B[qj]C[for the last 15-20 moves many tactical mistakes occurred so the situation becomes chaotic now.
This move is not a good move to secure the 3 R7 stones. The best move locally here is to connect with S6]

It seams that you understand the G9 area as territory or moyo here, but actually it is neutral space  because it is open at three points (squared), there is no need to stop white from crawling into  neutral space.]

;B[fj];W[rm]C[To sum up:

I believe your main problems come from bad shape (R4, R7, Q10, N18)

Also you have troubles with cutting points. Cutting points are dangerous especially when there
are 3 or more in a local situation. Solution: Play more secure on the first hand or protect your
weak points with extra moves.])
