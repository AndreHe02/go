C[Hi. A game played on KGS. Any comments you can think of are very welcome. I'm playing black. I've written some comments and questions into the file. Thank you for taking the time to review this game.


Hi Max, I'm Cap.  I was around a 7kyu player on KGS until I kicked the go addiction for a while.  Now I'm Problably around an 8-10 kyu player. Loosely translated, I'm nothing special and anyone aside us reading this can take me out no problem.  If you have any questions at all email me at silvus@gmail.com.  I play as Silvus on KGS.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[nc]LB[pc:A][pd:B]C[I usually play P17 but wanted to try this variation. What are the biggest weaknesses with this enclosure?

I think A is the biggest problem with the 2 step knights move here.  Black can return with B and get a lot of center influence , but it looses the points it would have controlled in the corner.]

;W[rq];B[qr];W[rp];B[fc]LB[rg:A]C[Since i felt my group at the bottom right to be realtivly safe i decided to try and extend my top. 


You shouldnt think of that as an extension but a new invasion.  It is far to removed to think of as part of your other peices.  I personaly would have  followed up the stone you laid a P10 with one at A.]
;W[cf];B[jd]LB[ic:B][kc:C][lc:D][id:A]C[I think I would have stayed closer to support my lonely friend.  A gives more center influence, while B makes things a little tighter for the inevetible invasion at C or D.]
;W[hd];B[hc]LB[fe:A]C[Right response?

It's what i would have done, but i think someone better than us would have considered the dangerous and exciting fight of A instead.  But our move is the safest one I think.]

;W[bp];B[bq];W[bo];B[bs]C[Is B2 also needed to make life?];W[qg]
;B[nh]LB[pf:A][pg:B]C[Does this give too much room for white?

White had too much room when it set R13 down.  Life seems almost garrunteed.  I think all you can do is minimize the losses with A or B.]

[ih:B][ol:C]C[this is a bit small. i think  would have tried to start utilizing my center influence.]
;W[rm];B[rk];W[nm];B[jg]C[J14 instead? Or what would be a good way to use blacks big wall?

:) J14 is where i would have gone that or J13.];W[ko];B[eq]

[mo:A]C[Instead of your move push in with A.  If you want more points go with B.]
;W[mo];B[jr]LB[ml:A]C[This was overplay by me i guess. L2 instead? or something totally different?

Yeh, it was to far, I really like A.];W[kr];B[kq];W[ir];B[lr]
;W[jp];B[js];W[is];B[ks];W[ni];B[oi];W[mj]LB[mk:A]C[This is a good punishment move for W.  He has called you out on not supporting up here more.  The best move I cam eup with is A, but W can make even more pain for B with one sequence.  So i suppose the best thing to do is try and cut your losses like you did and just play it safe.]
;B[mi];W[nj];B[li];W[lj];B[kj]C[i know i was pushing from behind but could come up with a other way to stop white from ruining my territory. Any suggestions on how to deal with O11 really welcome.]

Good, the way I read it that group could have been killed otherwise.]
