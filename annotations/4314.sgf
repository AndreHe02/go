[os]C[Hello, thank you very much for mulling over my game.  This was an extremely close game that I end up winning by half a point.  However, I could just as easily have lost it as my opponent made an unecessary defensive move near the end to give up a point.  Either way, I feel it makes good review material because we both played well.  I played this game just after losing a game in which I had tons of moyo but my opponent managed to capture almost all of the center.  So I was focusing on not losing the middle.  I generally try to build box-shaped moyo so that I have a good shot at the center, but I find that I'm not that good at fighting for center territory when it comes down to it.  Any comments on that portion of the game would be a big help.  Thank you.

Hi, I'll do my best to answer your questions and show all of those why, how and when. First of all that you are having trouble with getting center points is understandeble, perhaps a pro or 2 can make the center territory every time. Most player just find it to difficult, me included. And if you draw a line along the 4:th line there's more points outside then inside. Below is my explanation on why the center is so hard to make points in.

Worth remembering.
The center almost never gives any territory, Why??

You can attack the corner 2 ways. (triangels) A&B
You can attack the side 3 ways. (rectangles) C-F
You can attack the center 8 ways.... (circkels)1-8

Therefore start playing in the corner continiue out on the side and then make sure your opponent don't get any points in the center. Done right and with a little luck you win the game.

My recomendation is that you stop trying to make points i the center, but it doesn't mean you should give up on making moyos. Just keep your moyos along the edges.

Just some extra info...

Some numbers I've come across... That can be good to have in the back of ones mind when one meets a san-ren-sei opening.

A-C 1-19 is 57 points. More points then it usually looks like.
A games (with no or just a few prisoners) most common score is 50-70 for both players. Good to keep in mind when one counts score in the early midgame.( in this game around 24 or so)
A 3-3 invasion only gives a few points to the invader but it costs 25-30 points for the defender.]
;B[qd]C[I some times tend to get carried away in my exampels and they might not always be the best move in the given posistion. The exampels are only exampels and they should show why and what might be better or at least give you an id√© on a better play.
I've also gone trough the game several time and may have added comments that can seem out of place but it's because I've seen how bad a move got later on in the game. 

If I ever get to make a proverb I think this will be mine.

Every time i find the right move in a problem I'll find a new misstake.


The day i stop finding problems to find the right move in,  I'm not gonna be 6 k I'll be 9p... ;-)

Meaning that if i get a problem I've must have made a misstake eariler.]

(;B[jq]C[I typically use this move when my opponent plays both stones on 4,4, but I tried it in this game.  Is there a better placement for splitting these stones?

The drawback of this move is that B allow W to push B around as he want's to. N3 gives W a chance to play D5 as he wants. Rather then G3 B could play K5 and hope that W doesn't play D5 now because whitout any stones around D5 is way to slow to play now. K16 doesn't mean that W is getting ahead if he plays at K4, B got sente.]

Any way I could play the game to avoid that?  I think giving him D10 unpressured was the biggest problem I had.

D10 evens out the score. B at O14 gives B problem, Q13 does give W a bad headake...]

(;B[lp]C[Here I'm looking to build moyo, so I peep on both sides and then play toward the center.

Ambitious moyo atempt indeed. G & K3 groups shouldn't run away, it should be run to.
The biggest problem i see for B is that W group at R line... If B can contain it or kill it B gets his moyo and W invades it. If that W Rline group get out, B wont even get a shadow of a moyo....]

When I review game I often get the question " what was the losing or winning move?" In this game I coulnd't find one but i did find that move 33 (at E4) turned B path to victory from a walk up slop to climbing the north side of mount everest. 


To put it short i could say if an area gets to big invade it, pronto.
see Move 33 (D4) example.

About the closed in group, G3 & K3 is a tiny living group. Treat it like one. If you want to run with it perhaps move 33 should be played at G6, but then W is getting the edge almost for free.
You are suppose to run to living groups not run whit them.

If you like reading books I recomend 
1:  "Attack & Defend" 
Gives tips on when to invade and sometime why but most of all what shapes to avoid and why they are weak. 
2:  "Crosscut workshop" Show what you actually can do whit a crosscut. The crosscut move is far more complexed then what it appers to be. One of the more intresting books I got. Though it can be quite confusing...
3: "Sabaki"
I think it means "Take care of, handle". It shows you how to handle weak groups or stones. This books demands that one read ahead alot but it also show how one should read ahead, It shows why a inosent little stone that looks almost misplaced actually is a breathtaking attack. 

Book 1 & 2 is a must in any go players libary.
Book 3 does have it's given place in the libary but it's not a "must have" book.]
