;B[dc];W[pd];B[qp];W[cp];B[nc];W[pf];B[kd];W[eq]C[May be too slow. The left side is important beacause of the black formation on
the upper side, and white's shimari makes it still more important ... in gote.
Whether a move at C or D10 or an approach at C/D 14/15 is beyond my level,
although I would play the approach, but now a black move at D10 looks perfect.]
;B[qj]C[As said, the left side is hottest.
If black wants to play in the right side, R12 is the point that hurts white, letting
white take it turns black stone at R10 almost a yose move.]
;W[op];B[pq];W[oq];B[rg]C[May be a black move at Q6 instead would be better, white would probably
answer around L4 and then black has the choice of D10 or R17.]
;W[rf]C[As black is not really sliding beneath white stones because R10 is too
far away, white has a number of possibilities to take care of the corner:
R17, the san-san, is the simplest one, and it doesn't give away as many
points as it seems, R15 is another one, sometimes better beacuse of the
shape that gives that the one used in the game, that has many drawbacks.]
;B[qg];W[qf];B[qb]C[Maybe black is overdoing things, but if white cannot cut at Q18 and
capture the black stone and/or black gets to play R17,  the white stones
will have a tought time ahead.];W[qn]C[Probably R5 is severest, R6 can be easily cut off and white gains nothing,
but the upper right corner is a more urgent problem.];B[po]
;W[pn];B[oo];W[pk];B[qk];W[ql];B[rl];W[ol];B[mo];W[lq]
(;B[dj]C[Finally black gets the big point, white's group at the right side are weaker than
black's and at the lower side white's also in worst shape that black is at the
upper side. Black's leading by far more than the komi.
In fact white's so weak at the right side that black can think of playing some
sente moves there to improve even further the position before turning to D10 or
launch a more severe attack there. See variations.];W[dl]C[Better at C8, threatening B10, here it has no good follow up because of black
L5 easily reducing the possibility of a moyo and at the same time threatening
the white groups above and below.];B[dg]C[Too slow, black has to attack when he has the chance.]
;W[fc];B[ed];W[gd];B[ic];W[gf];B[or]C[Better L5 in my opinion, but if black wants to play around here Q2 is far
better as whites following moves prove.];W[mq];B[ne]C[Black can no hope to make a big moyo because of the 3 white stones
around G16, so R17 chasing out white while getting points and preparing
a 3-way attack on white's weak groups feel better.];W[pp]C[Bad move. Very bad move.
Is too early to try to exploit P2 mistake. First white should reinforce somehow
the stones above, P8 & cia., so that black connecting at R5 should be only a defensive
move and not had the added value of keeping an attack on white.]

(;B[qr]C[Awful mistake that allows white to cut 3 stones, thus changing the
situation quite a lot and turning Q4 a sever cut.
Black had to connect at R5 and endure the little loss caused by P2
not beeing at Q2.];W[qo]
(;B[rp]C[Force before defending, says the proverb. Look at the variation to see it
applied twice and keeping black ahead.];W[no]C[Whie connects, building strength and a big moyo that, to me, balances
more or less the weak groups at the top. Now even sacrificing the stones
at Q14 can be a workable strategy if white manages to keep a 100+ points
territory from D8 to P8 below.

Cutting stones, as P/Q5 were, are not to be ligthly sacrificed.]
)
(;B[no];W[rp];B[qq];W[nr];B[rq]C[Black's alive and white still cut and weak, White situation has improved
because of the 4 black stones beeing adrift, but white still has more weak
groups than black.]))
(;B[qo]C[After this echange black can connect at S6 and O5 has become sente,
so white ougth to capture a stone below, but that's gote. allowing
black to keep on his attack.]))

(;W[oh];B[oi];W[ni];B[oj]
(;W[nj];B[rm]C[Now the cuts at O12 and O9 are miai and one of the two white groups
look bad.])
(;W[ng];B[nj]C[White has troubles.]))
(;W[og];B[oi]C[As far as white is divided will have troubles that can give black the
chance to protect the upper side against invasions or invade the lower
side without risks.]))
(;B[oh];W[pb];B[ml];W[rm];B[od];W[qc];B[dj]C[Black chooses to force white to live while building toward the center.]
