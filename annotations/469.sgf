Black player comments enclosed.  I will try to answer all these questions.


 I played black. I added some comments in the game, and here are the questions I have about it :
   I won the game closely, mainly because white committed a couple of mistakes in the end. Otherwise, I would have lost.

 1) Basically, I think I let w make some territorry on lower side, and in the middle. I wonder how I could have prevented this to happen.

2) Is there any other game behaviour I should primarily focus on to improve my playing ? (thickness, attack, defense, territorry pattern,
sente, whatever ...)



RR:  To answer question 1a.
W got territory on the bottom because W got 4 stones on the 3rd line with no black attack.  B got territory on the left side in return.  A fair trade.
1b.  W got territory in the middle because B didn't push W in the right direction.  B should push W into strength.  I think that W should have gotten even more territory that just a few points.

To answer question 2, look at 1b.  The direction of play is very important.  Using your strenght to fight your opponent, not to make territory.    Also, don't attach to weak stones.  By attaching, you will strengthen the stones, huring yourself.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[cn]TR[oq][op]C[RR:  Usually, an enclosure on your own corner takes precedence over an opponents corner.  Plus, the white stone is on the 4,4 point, so there is no rush to play here.

A better move would be at P3 or P4];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck]
;W[iq]C[RR:  I don't know Joseki, but white's move here seems small.]
;B[nq];W[pn];B[no]TR[pl]C[Is this correct in any way ?  The idea is to prevent w playing the same, which would result in b being capped under a wide w shape facing center

RR:  I don't know Joseki, but my feeling is to pincer this stone from above.  Using the upper right stone as support, attack the white stone somewhere around Q8.

Black already has (almost) territory in the bottom right.  An attack on the lone white stone will build a black wall facking the top, and w whill not have a wide shape facing center.  White will have a row of stones between blacks bottom base and the pincer/attack stones above.

Remember to always use your strength to attack, and not to build territory.]
;W[qj]C[RR:  White seems to jump out lightly here.  This seems a bit loose, but because black is very stong in the corner, I guess this is ok.]
;B[qg]TR[fc]C[RR:  This black stone doesn't do very much.  There is much more territory on the upper side.  A move around F17 is the biggest point now.]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[qo]C[RR:  White builds a wall because of the extension.  The white side now looks like territory.]
;B[jd]TR[fc]C[RR:  This seems too slow for black. F17 is the point.]
;W[fc];B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[ce];B[bf];W[be];B[ef];W[ic];B[jc]
;W[id];B[de]TR[je]C[RR:  Usually, it is a good idea to jump ahead when being pushed by white.  A black stone at K15 is huge.

The position on the left side is also good, but the followups don't look very nice for black.]
;W[ee];B[ff]TR[fe]C[RR:  To play the ko, atari the stone at E15 with a move at F15.]
;W[em]TR[jf][ek]C[This was a good w move, to my opinion


RR:  White has two sides of a fence, which needs four sides to complete.  I don't think this move does very much.  Black has two nice moves to increase it's moyo, at F9 and K15.]
;B[en]C[RR:  Black seems to be ahead now.  No real need to attack so soon.]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[fo];B[fl]C[RR:  Remember to never peep when you can cut.  I think a cut is more effective here.]
;W[ep];B[dm]TR[co]C[RR:  The bamboo joint at C5 is a better connection.  White has a nice weak point to press (which it does the next move.)]
;W[co];B[fm];W[bo];B[bn];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]C[RR:  I think that W misses the Joseki here.]
;B[ob];W[qa];B[qd];W[rc];B[rd];W[rb];B[pi]TR[oc]C[RR:  Black needs to read out the ladder at the cutting point.  It is currently in black's favor.]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[jj]TR[oj][om][ie]C[Again, w let me think I'm late ...

RR:  Here, black can play "capture the center stone!"  When I look at white's move, I think, where will it connect to?  Black is so strong in the middle.  Black can do some sente moves around the edge, and this white stone is in trouble.

Some forcing moves:  P10, P7, J15

But, don't forget the cut at P17....];B[kh]C[RR:  Using a wall to make territory is the wrong direction.  Black welcomes a fight in this area.  Block off the area in which white wants to run.
It is hard to do, this looks like alot of territory!

And it protects the cut, which may be B's intention here.];W[ih]
;B[kj]C[RR:  This move doesn't serve much purpose.  Usually, don't connect to weak stones, especially if you are strong!  It will only help to make the weak stones stronger.]
;W[je]C[RR:  White takes a vital point in the game.];B[ke];W[lq]
C[RR:  White gets 4 stones on the 3rd line.  This is how W gets territory on the bottom (Question from the beginning.)]
;B[jk]TR[jf]C[RR:  I think that black would do better to atari the top stone at K15.  It is still hard for white to connect at the bottom.  But now, it is still easy to connect at the top.]
;W[ij];B[ik];W[hj];B[gj]C[RR:  I don't understand what B is thinking here.  If trying to make territory on the left side, then don't make a contact play.  Like a big tree in the wind, be able to bend with the attack, don't be rigid and hit it straight on. You will fail.]

(;B[hl]C[I chose to play it safe, and let this live. After review, I don't see how to kill simply without endangering myself seriously

RR:  At this stage of the game, even if you don't kill, but get lots of outward influence, and let white live small, it is still a victory.]
;W[fg];B[fj];W[fi];B[oj]TR[kk][il]C[RR:  Black has some weak points to protect before this big move.]
;W[sp];B[sq];W[pp];B[qq];W[pq];B[qr];W[pr];B[rr];W[lo]C[RR:  Nice sequence by white.]
;B[oo];W[po];B[nm];W[jb];B[ld]C[RR:  Because of the capture, this isn't a cutting point that needs to be protected.]

;W[rh]C[first w mistake

RR:  If W protects, then about 10 points in gote.  The current W move is about 6 points, but possible sente.]
