C[Jadoube:

I seemed to get off to a really good start in this game but it went rapidly downhill from about move 50. Therefore I think I made a number of strategic mistakes about then.

H : This a very interesting  fighting game.   With the first white invasion, blacks scored a sucess,
making two big peaces of territory.
When white invadede the top-right, he should have been killed but he leaved, so the game became close.
Black missed the big point at the bottom-left and defended poorly against white invasion.]

K10 is a fighting move.]
(;W[qo]C[The usual move here is Q5. But white has many mant possibilities. The first move is note the more important.]
;B[qp]C[Very good move, this make white heavy.]
(;W[po]C[Bad move. White must RESIST black stategy.
In a vast moyo, white must play very lightly, and never hesitate to sacrifice some stones to make sabaki.]
;B[np]C[Good move, but never forget it leaves some bad aji in the corner.]
;W[qm];B[ok];W[nn]LB[no:a]C[A bit vague. A move at a could be better.]

(;B[lo]LB[lq:a][oq:b]C[No. There a strange feeling at the bottom.  The aji is very bad.
To allow two weak points invite later problems.

There is a GOLD RULE when attacking :
Leave GOOD AJI evywhere !

When the attack is finished and white is alive,
you when to PROFIT from the attack.
If you leave bad aji, all your work will go to ashes with just a little tesuji.]

;W[nm];B[pm]LB[rl:a]C[GOLD RULE :

Never attack to kill,
attack to make good aji.

This move is clearly a move to kill.
White will not die so P7-Q7 will have no value.

Furthermore, white shape is still good, white lives easily with a.]

Wrong direction, the top-left corner is more important.

Local : I'm not sure but with K6, the bottom has become less important so I would play C6 or C3 here.]
;W[dq]C[D6 is good enough for white. There no point to complicate when basic joseki give good result.]
;B[fo]C[Top-left corner is still valuable.
Locally, it may possible to start a fight with C6 or C8.];W[dn]

(;B[jn]C[J: Better to simply expand with  H4 or H5?
  First : a white invasion here will not cost too much so play at the top left.

Second : play K5 first, the exchange K6-K7 is very bad for black.

Third : locally, a move at H5 is best shape ...

H : Your stategy is OK.]

C12 is enough.

Playing C11, you force white to play C10 and C10 is a very good move for white, so you force white to play a good move !]

White :  20 pt at the top

Black : 10 pt on the left
 15 pt on the right
 25 pt at the bottom

The game is very close.
If, after dealing with the top,
black comes back to play c and d, he will win.

This invasion is too deep, a or b seems correct.
with such a deep invasion, there is a great risk of being killed.]
