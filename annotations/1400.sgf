C[Hubris (Ness): I played W in this game.  I appreciate your comments very much.  I should have resigned after move 111, so I won't bother with moves after that.]
;B[dc];W[cp];B[qd];W[qp];B[qj];W[jq]C[This is a rather unusual pattern - I have never seen it before.]
;B[cj]TR[cp][qp]SQ[cj][qj]C[I would not be happy with this position. Why? The marked black stones are blocking white's extensions on both sides, so your three stones can only secure the territory at the bottom and have no further potential. And even worse, this territory will be rather low and is easily reduced because of the low position of K3.
The problem was K3 - you should have played a kakari around C15 instead.]
;W[oc];B[mc];W[md];B[ld];W[nd];B[kc];W[pf];B[pe];W[qf]C[Ness: I tried to play creatively here...I thought the position was reasonable for me.
This looks like an overplay (because black can move out at P15), but if you are good at fighting, this might be ok. Black has too be very careful. Pulling back at P14 would be a more conservative approach.]
;B[oe];W[pi]C[Good. If you get sente here and nother move around O14, black has a serious problem.]
;B[qi]C[This might be a mistake. I would rather play at N14 and start the fight immediately. Black cannot afford you to get sente and shut him in.]
;W[qh];B[pj];W[mf]C[Good.];B[ng];W[nf];B[of];W[og];B[oh]
(;W[ph]C[You should not fear the fight and connect! If you let black connect, you have two weak groups and you are bound to get a bad result. So even if you cannot read out the fight to the end (you would be a pro if you could), you must not avoid it.]
;B[pg];W[oi];B[ni];W[oj];B[pm]C[This result is unbearable.]
;W[ok]C[Ness: I was particularly unsure of this move.
I think this is correct shape in this position. If you would play the magari (O10), you would do too much harm to your other group.]

MA[km]C[Ness: if I had thought to peep at X the game would have gone much differently.
The peep not good! Black L6 would create too much bad aji on the bottom.]
;B[kf]C[This might be the coup de grace for your group.];W[mh]
;B[nh];W[mg];B[li];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[rb];W[kg]
(;B[kh]C[This is very mild - I would be tempted to play K13 and go for a kill. This move just helps white to separate the black groups.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[jg];B[jh];W[ig];B[ih];W[lb]C[A good probe!]
(;B[mb]TR[mb][kc][mc][ld][kf]C[This looks too greedy. The marked stones are too thin to try to capture white, so black should play solidly at L18.]
;W[ic]C[Good. Now black has to be careful, too.];B[kb];W[jd]
;B[ke]C[Bad shape.];W[lg];B[hh];W[kd]C[Ness: I was happy with this sequence.
Yes, white is alive now.];B[ob];W[pb];B[nc]
(;W[od]MA[oa]C[Ness: I decided that X was unnecessarily risky.
It's not a risk, it just doesn't work.];B[oa];W[le]C[Now you have recovered a lot, black's attack did not give him any profit. The group in the upper right is save, the bottom is big and the group in the center is not really weak.]

;B[dq];W[do];B[cq];W[bp];B[bq];W[cn];B[em];W[gj];B[fh];W[cl]
;B[dk];W[fj]C[Again, I thought the game was going well...
Yes, but the game is not yet won: There is still bad aji at M3, and your center group is not yet definitely alive.]
;B[jk]
(;W[ik]C[Ness: This move lost me the game, I think, see variation.  I was careless and optimistic about attacking black's groups.]
