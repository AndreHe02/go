C[I tried to comment the SGF file pretty well. I'm especially interested in why I would have lost so badly in territory even if I had kept all my groups alive.

rika:
Hi, I'm Chun-Kit. My strength is IGS 4k, DE 5k.
I put all my go knowledge into the few opening moves of your game, since there were some weaknesses I discovered. I can't say much about your middle and ending game, since by the start of the middle game, your opponent controls the board. 
Nevertheless I have tried to comment some middle game techniques.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq]C[Kakari, I'm looking at moyo along the bottom side.

rika:
ok. But you can't create a moyo with just 2 or 3 stones. If white played pincer (like wH3) you can't expect to make a moyo at the bottom (because you must take the corner, see var)]

(;W[dn];B[mq]SQ[ip][jp][jq]C[rika:
questionable stone.
It is neither an extention of bF3 nor a corner enclosure. 
Extention: squares
Corner enclosure: (hmm, difficult because from a 4-4 point you need 2 more stones to secure corner territory) 

My favorite is bK4, leaves corner open for a 3-3 invasion in case of tight game, and the 2 stones at the starpoints (K4 and Q4) works well.]
;W[nc];B[qf]C[Strenghtening the corner, I don't want my stone squeezed from both sides.

rika:
ok];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[pk]C[Looks like a big point at this stage of the game. But maybe the third line would have been better?

rika:
I like your style so far. The right side isn't important for me now, because R18 and R11 are miai.
Just imagine bN3 would be at K4, then bQ10 is perfect.
For a balance formation at the right side, try to create a W-formation (i.e. third line - forth line - third line etc)]
;W[qn]C[Invasion!]
(;B[dq]C[And counter-invasion. Maybe not so good move after all, especially when I didn't have a sensible followup? Capping the R6 stone with P6 right away might have been better? Or C2 after white's C3?

rika:
your bD3 is too early and is only playable if white has pincer your bF3 stone.
(btw: your play isn't an invasion, maybe a probe)

Attacking the invasion stone is the best respond (see var)]
;W[cq]
(;B[di]C[I can still freely extend from here if white approaches at either side.

rika:
your lower left group need still more attention.
white has reduced your bD3 stone's liberty, so responding there is still a must. otherwise you have wasted a stone.]
;W[kq]
(;B[df]TR[kq][qn]MA[di]C[The corner looked a bit vulnerable so I played here to put some pressure on it.

rika:
but white made 2 "invasions". It's really urgent to strenghten your lower left group by attacking wL3. And your bD11 stone isn't really in danger, because black will always find a base to either side.
What about white's corner in the upper left. White has nothing to fear no matter how black can play at the top left.]
;W[hq]C[...but my two stones in the lower left corner are being squeezed.

rika:
yes, because the lower side is more important than the upper left.
why is the left side not important to me? just because black has good answer after wC14 or wC/D9 (miai)]
;B[fo]C[...so I make a run for the center.];W[on]
(;B[nl]C[Applying some pressure on the two white stones.

rika:
attack from the weak side (bN5) + put pressure on the two white stones (multipurpose move)]
;W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[I extented in this direction because I thought I would otherwise get squeezed between the invading stones and the P6-R6 stones.]
;W[qp];B[no]C[Essential for good shape?

rika:
still like bN5 to put pressure on the 2 white stones.
And: white is secure on the right side. white doesn't need to answer.]
;W[nn]
(;B[fc]SQ[mq][no][pp][pq]TR[kq][nn][on][qn][qp][qq]C[The open space seemed to invite my stone.

rika:
not the right time. just look at the lower right. your 4 stones are about to be surrounded.]
;W[fd]
(;B[dc]C[rika:
I don't like it. First bG16 and follow the joseki or an other option, which is might thinkable]
;W[cc]
(;B[ec];W[ed]C[Heavy play from both...

rika:
you could have created trouble by playing bE16 yourself. This makes some serious cutting points.]
;B[cb];W[gc];B[bc]C[White seems to be shutting the right side of this group, so I take the corner and try to go around and reach the two stones below.

rika:
right direction by white. but looks stange.];W[cd];B[bd];W[be]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[cg];W[bf]C[rika:
it's a mystery why white didn't capture the atari-stone.];B[bg]
;W[ef]C[rika:
quesionable fight];B[dl]C[Now it's looking like I can't connect my left top corner and left side groups, so I extend to get some breathing space.

rika:
black can still connect with bA15 and bA16 as you played it in the next moves.]
;W[qi];B[oi]C[Capping move. No contact play, to avoid the white stone getting stronger.

rika:
ok... the right side seems to be white favourite.];W[rk];B[ql]
;W[rl];B[qh]C[Now it looks like the white is here to stay, so I apply some pressure.]
;W[rh]
(;B[qj]C[rika:

(;B[pi]C[Extending from the stone in atari just looked bad? But I'm giving ponnuki to white. Bad idea.

;W[pe]
(;B[og];W[nh];B[ng];W[ni]C[rika:
white shouldn't turn in (if saving this group is important to him), because white's liberty is only 3 instead of 4 after wN12]
;B[nj];W[lg]C[White's mistake, didn't see the ladder coming.]
;B[oc];W[oe];B[mh]C[Making the ladder. I have a breaker, white can't save the group.]
;W[qb];B[mi]C[Took the group right away. Maybe too early, but I didn't want to complicate things. Was using two moves to capture 4 stones too much? Did I lose more in the corners while playing here?

rika:
definately. you could have played bH5 for some center work]

rika:
don't think about eyes if you can escape into the center. white 3 stones are in the right spot for being attacked]
;W[ls];B[hr];W[dg];B[dh];W[eg]C[rika:

rika:
yes];W[db]
(;B[bb]C[The three stones are dead, so I'm just doing some damage control.
Actually, now that I looked at it afterwards, I could have saved them, but would have lost the B16 and B17 stones and white would have taken the corner and built some nice outward influence. I think I gained territory in the center by sacrificing the three stones?

rika:
I have deleted some of your var, and added a few.];W[fb];B[ae]
C[Atari to force the white to capture...];W[de];B[af]C[...so I can link my groups underneath.

ok, but white still has sente.];W[cm];B[bl];W[cl];B[ck];W[bm]
;B[dm];W[en];B[jg]TR[eg][en][jp][mm]C[I'm trying to use the influence of my strong group on the right here to make some moyo in the center. Not sure if this is a good spot, though.

rika:
moyo at that stage is too late. white can make damage from the triangle sides.

Your last stone is just a reduction of whites territory.

if you look at the whole board now, white is clearly ahead.]

(;B[id]C[This is as far as I dared to extend from the center. This just for grabbing territory. Looking back, maybe I should have played on the bottom half, L4 or J3 or something, and tried to link up my bottom groups and grab some territory there.

rika:
difficult to say at the stage where you can't win anymore. Anyway, you have forced white to secure territory.]

The only territory I got was in the center and in the upper left side. This seems to happen to me a lot: the fuseki looks fine, but when we get to the middlegame, I find my opponent controlling most of the edge. My groups find their life difficult away from the edge, vulnerable from all directions. And I can't see where I went so wrong.

rika:
well, the fuseki is the hardest part of the game of go. if you are doing fine, you shouldn't have any problems in attacking/defending, creating moyos, finding weaknesses in your and opponent's position.
But it's a long way to go.
I hope you see what is important in a go game even after move 20.
How to handle invasion stones like wR6 and wR11. That's a question I can partly answer. 
It seems to me you lose some focus of the whole board situation (as you mentioned once for life and death of the lower right black group. 
But don't worry, I have played your style some time ago (all player starts with zero knowledge), and with some work and patience, the only way to go is UP!!!
