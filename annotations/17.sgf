C[joanco: Dear reviewer; I'm joanco and I play with black stones.
I'm beginner and I just have played only 2 games serious on IGS. But I read some books about Go and I replayed lot of games from the teacher leader.
In this game I did an enormous mistake and I lose the game. I'm sure I need to play more games against human players because I play at home against my computer (TurboGO share version) and normally I win.
I put some comments in this game for help you about my know and my strong of Go.
If is possible, tell me about my level because I reject some games because I think my oponent is more strong as me and belive my oponent going to be bored with my play.
Sorry, my english is very bad.
Thanks.

I will comment on what you say here before I look at your game.  I will probably be able to find better plays in your game, but I do not think that I will be able to judge how strong you are. You should find that out by playing as many games on IGS as you can. I was shy about playing stronger players at first myself, but you really should play stronger players as much as possible. You learn more that way. Also, the stronger players will not agree to play with you if they are afraid that they will be bored. Instead they will make some excuse for not wanting to play. So do not worry too much about their feelings.

It is polite to resign if you are hopelessly losing a game, but do not do this too quickly. Many times I have made a big mistake and thought about resigning. I then decided to play a few more moves and ended up winning. Sometimes these strong players are not as strong as they seem or you are better than you think you are..]

(;B[fc]LB[ch:a][gc:b][qj:c]C[joanco: I think this move is bad because my shimari on the upper left. Better in a?

I don't think your move is too bad but a is  better. See other branch for one possible continuation.
b is also probably a little better
c really deserves some consideration, since it works so well with the shimari. Black's corner stone would then probably come under double approach, but it can survive.]
;W[bd]LB[ch:A]C[There were 2 moves in a row by white in the game record that I received.  I took out the one at A.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[df];W[dh]LB[cg:A]C[I think A might be better for white before going to the 4th line.]
;B[qn];W[qo];B[qj]LB[pn:A]C[A is the standard response to white's move, but your move works real well with the shimari.]
;W[pn]
(;B[qm]LB[pm:a]C[joanco: I have a problem, I don't know when cut and sacrifice. Is better move 18 in a?

I think your move is fine here. I explore a few branches starting with a.
Later in the game, you miss a good cutting chance.];W[ol];B[oj]
C[I think this move is fine, but it has a lot of stategic meaning. In the following few moves, both sides build large frameworks. White's is larger but less secure than black's. Therefore, black needs to think about the best time and point to invade white.]
;W[ml];B[mj];W[cm]C[White starts to secure the framework, but black still has invasion chances.]

(;B[jq]C[joanco: This move is good or maybe better on the lower right corner in 3-3 point?

I would have played your move, but I try some branches from the 3-3 move.]

LB[fq:A][do:B][ik:C][fg:D][kc:E][gq:F]C[I don't like this move. It seems to result in both b and w strengthening each other, but I think that b's group is strong enough to live. b should try to make a big move to damage w some more or secure b's own framework.
Any of A-F would be better.];W[qq];B[or];W[pr];B[nr];W[np];B[mq]
LB[mp:a]C[joanco: I think move 40 in a is better

I agree.];W[kq];B[lr]LB[kr:A]C[A is much better here.];W[lp]
;B[kr];W[ko];B[hq]C[Black is definitely alive here so I would try for a bigger move than this. Those I mentioned before are still good.]

(;B[hs]LB[fq:A]C[b should cut at A. w will lose 1 of his 2 stones here and b will be better.]
;W[eq]LB[fq:A][fp:B]C[w should just connect at A. This move leaves aji for b of peep at B.]
;B[fg]MA[oc][qd][kk][mj][oj][qj][fc]C[joanco: In this moment I thought my situation in the lower edge is lower. I'm going to do a moyo with the stones mark.

I agree about the moyo.];W[fh];B[gg];W[hh];B[if];W[hg];B[hf]

(;B[ff]LB[eg:A][kc:B][ik:C][jk:D][hp:E][fl:F][jh:G]C[I don't like this move. It forces w to extend, giving more aji for an invasion on the top.
If you are worried about your 2 stones, A is better.
I really think you should consider tenuki here. I think that these 2 stones are stronger than they appear. See some branches from this point. B-E, even F might be good moves.]
;W[ge];B[fe]LB[gd:A]C[A better here. Nose tesuji.];W[hd];B[jd]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[je];B[jf];W[ke]
(;B[ld]LB[ie:A]C[A better here. Divides w's group, threatens to connect b's stones. Actually I see that your way works out well too.]
;W[kf];B[jg];W[jh];B[kg];W[lf]LB[kh:A]C[w starts to play very desparately here.  w should probably just sacrifice the weak stones and play at A to push into b's area.]
;B[ie];W[id];B[mf];W[lg]C[joanco: My opponent is doing a mistake with the ladder.

;W[ja];B[ka];W[ib];B[hk]LB[ha:A]C[joanco: I have feel i going to win the game. The side right is clearly for black. And now I'm going to attack the center and left side.

This is good but you should kill w's top with A. You have several chances for reducing w's territory left, so you can give one up. Killing the group at the top is a sure thing and it is big.]
;W[ha];B[gh]LB[ek:a]C[joanco: Mistake. I think is better around

It is hard to be sure about this. Your move cuts off the three white stones for a sure gain. A move at a could be very big but is maybe a little uncertain.]

[ij][jh]C[joanco: White is doing mistakes. The marked stones are dead.

I agree];W[jl];B[ej]LB[fi:a]C[joanco: Mistake. 124 in a, double atari.

I don't know, your move ends up working pretty well.]

C[joanco: White is despaired. He can't live here if I not do a mistake. My group in lower edge have a weak point. I didn't see that and I lose the game.

You are right. It is often hard to see such shortage of liberty situations.]
