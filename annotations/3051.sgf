C[IGS game
tonypoon9k(W)vsSilkRoad9k(B)
i am tonypoon9k(white).
Although i won by 2.5 stones, i was confused by my opponent's few plays.
I want to ask he had mad mistakes in several plays or not.
Also ,can you give some comments on my §G§½(starting steps) please?
My weakest part is §G§½.so i hope some experts can help me overcome my weakness. THX a lot!!!


<W> I do not know these signs/terms, and other terms you use, but will comment on the game as best I can.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[qi]C[my opponent started by¤¤°ê¬y!!!
i am very scare when i see such kinds of starting.eg¤¤°ê¬y,¤T³s¬P
Are there any suggestions for me to combat them?

<W> This opening is called the "low chinese" opening in english terminology and the common response is to play somewhere on the top, to limit the moyo black wants to build around the strong q17 stone. Others do not like moyo games at all, and like you, play to break up the sphere of influence at once. This is usually a bad idea, unless you really know what you're doing. If you want to break it up, you have to atleast give up the idea that you must take two corners with your first two stones.]

(;W[qe]LB[jd:C][nd:A][nq:B]C[I think this is wrong as i am creating weak stone in opponent's territory.
Will A and B be better?

<W> R15 works, in that it breaks up black, but at a cost. Black can now become strong on both sides. A and B are not moves I would consider, tho B is sometimes played when white wants to build a moyo to rival blacks.

C is what I am leaning towards. It limits the size of what black can make, and gives you potential, without being a stone that will immediately come under attack and have to be defended.]
;B[rd]
(;W[pg]LB[oe:B][pg:A]TR[qi]C[<W> This stone seems wrong. The triangle marked stone is light, and can easilly be stabilized, pulled out, or sacrificed. Better to push towards blacks corner group first, then try to see what you can get on the side.]
;B[rg];W[ne];B[nd];W[oi];B[oh]LB[pk:A][ql:B]C[i think his move is too strong.
Should he play at A?

<W> Yes I think so, or at B];W[ph];B[oe]C[i think this is also too strong]

(;W[of]C[however, i played this move. is it ok?

<W> It is ok locally; it connects all stones except O15 safely.]
;B[pe];W[qf];B[qd];W[nh];B[pl];W[md];B[nc]
(;W[mf]LB[me:B][mf:A]C[<W> Better to play solid here, and not let black peep.]
;B[le]C[is this move wrong?
he seems to be isolating himself

<W> It is what is called a "kikashi" move. A light and not very important move, but that gives black a little bit of local influence for later. He does not lose anything by forcing you to confirm your connections (you are already connected) at worst it is one extra point inside your territory.]
;W[me];B[fq];W[ip]C[should i use this ©w¦¡?
i think his stones on the right side are very strong to support his stone on the left.thus i want to isolate them.

<W> A good move. Your stones on the top are strong and radiate influence. This is the time to attack.]
;B[kp];W[fp]LB[eq:A]C[should i play this as to let him get the corner?also ,can i play at A?

<W> The corner is not important. Black is getting some outside influence with L4, that F4 balances.]
;B[ir]C[why he concede and left the stone?

<W> Mistake by black, perhaps missclick? Not a good move, does not connect F3 and L4.]
;W[gq];B[iq];W[hq];B[jp];W[dj]C[i tried ¤T³s¬P. am i correct?



<W> Yes this is a good move. You have massive influence in the center now, and even if black has secure territory, you should be able to regain that.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[bp];W[bo];B[br]
(;W[dr];B[cr];W[es];B[aq];W[ao];B[ap];W[dn]C[he got the corner.
how can he do that?
have i played wrongly?



<W> Yes, you could have gotten ko. But the result is not that bad, it's a very small corner, and you are strong. Now is the time to consolidate and make territory. Playing C17 seems a good idea at some point, from here on you should try gaining sente.]
;B[en]C[<W> Again, seems like a mistake by black. Not good, strenghtens you without giving black anything in return.]
;W[em];B[cg];W[ce]LB[bd:C][be:B][ce:A]C[<W> This is too high I think. You are defending passively, saying "here is my territory, the rest is yours." B or C are better.]
;B[bj]C[he destroyed my territory again!!!
i think i have played wrongly and lead t my loss.can you tell me which moves i have played wrong?

<W> First of all, this is not your territory. It is your sphere of influence. You will have to let black gain something. Letting him live small here while building up even more strenght is very good for white.]

[ic:B]C[i dont know what should i do to face this move.should i play at A to protect the corner or what?

<W> You have good strenght all around, this is the time to attack. But neither A nor B attack hard enough, black can settle either way. Again play low, so you can strike him from below later.]
;W[ic];B[db]
(;W[ec]LB[cb:B][eb:D][cc:C][ec:A]C[<W> Always a wrong move. You gain nothing, and strenghtens black.]
;B[eb];W[hb];B[gb];W[ie];B[bc];W[ge]C[<W> An ok solution. You still have outside influence, tho you are a bit heavy in the top left corner since you lost your territory there. Time to make the last wall in the center moyo. But black comes first.]
;B[qp]C[my nightmare comes!!!
ishould play it first,isnt it?

<W> No, let black have territory. There are bigger moves, play to grab the center, when black gives you the opportunity with a gote move like this.]

finally, thank you for your invaluable help!!!


<W> Yes you could have won by more, by seeing and exploiting your outside influence. Do not fear black taking territory along the sides and in the corners; if he does, it is likely too early, and you gain more in potential than he gains in territory.


There is a saying "If black gets all four corners, white wins" and there is much truth to it.

I don't know about "invaluable", but I hope my comments were of some help atleast.]
