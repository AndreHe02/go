;W[dj];B[jd]C[JR: All nice and calm so far.];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd]
;B[qc];W[qi];B[qj]C[Is this the right answer? Or better something like K4 and ignore it?

JR: Perfectly fine the white group is in some danger and should need another move.

R10 also looks good with the Q4 stone];W[ri]
(;B[jp]C[JR: I'd prefer an approach move. All black's stones are still in one half of the board.]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[np]
(;B[fq]TR[oq]C[JR: In one sense the purpose of the marked stone is to make white heavy so it can be attacked. It is not good to leave the position now]
;W[eq];B[fp]TR[eq]C[JR: The marked exchange is good for black]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[jr];B[ir];W[kr]
(;B[hq]C[I am not sure weather I had to play so many stones into this area.

JR: You can afford to play elsewhere. The white cut is a threat but the black stones can still survive to its not that big for the moment.]
;W[nn]
(;B[fc]C[I think this stone is too far away from the K16 stone.

JR: You cannot afford to leave the bottom corener like this.]
;W[hc]
(;B[hd]C[I thought that I can catch the white stone


JR: Generally you defend with contact moves like this and attack from a distance. White should be able to break out.]

(;W[jc];B[gc]
(;W[kc];B[ic];W[kd];B[je];W[ib];B[hb]C[Now it looks very good for me.]
;W[ja]
(;B[lb]C[Making territory and attacking the white stones.

JR: Good idea.

White should ingore this move and keep running.

Therefore]
(;W[kb]
(;B[me]C[Now I didn't know what to play. Maybe on the left side? On C13, C7 or C17? Or strengthen my group in the lower right part?

JR: This is perfectly reasonable, the white group is in trouble. Much better than the alternatives you are suggesting.]
;W[le];B[ke];W[md];B[lf]
(;W[lc];B[mb];W[ne];B[mf];W[of]C[I thinks this move is a big mistake and now I can kill his whole group.


JR: Yes a big mistake.];B[nd];W[pm]C[JR: This is why you could not afford to leave this area to play F17 some moves back.]
;B[qn]C[What is the best answer against such a move? It always happens to me.

JR: White has reduced the side. White is also threatening the 2 stones above.

So your thinking is

a)  Can the corner live if I use my move to help the stones above?
b) if not what move makes the corner live and gives most help above.

It is not important to worry about how big you make the corner, it only needs to live.

R6 invites white R7 and that cuts off the stones - so it is helping white play a move he wanted to anyway.]
;W[qm]
(;B[rm]C[JR: 

Black is not going to be able to connect so this move has no purpose]
;W[rl];B[rn];W[oi]C[And I lost my two stones.]
(;B[cc]C[I wanted to play into his potential territiory?

What is the best time to play such a move on 3x3?



JR: The stones one the side are not lost, see varaition

This is not a good time to play 3-3. It is too easy on white.

Black has lots of strength in this area. invade and push white towards the strength.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[nj]
(;B[li]TR[cd][dd]C[Not a good move I suppose.

JR: The two marked stones are begging to be attacked.];W[dg]

(;B[en]C[JR: THe black group at H3 is safe so I think you can invade]
;W[cn]C[Now his territory on the right side is very (!) big.]

(;B[dm]C[JR: But this just invites white to make the territory stronger. It is better not to play it at all.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[er]
(;B[fr]C[JR: Do not let the rush of the game lead you to simply reply to white's moves.

The alternative is much bigger];W[bn]
(;B[ef]C[JR: This invites white to make 4th line territory. consider being more ambitious. Sacrifice a stone or two to break in.]
;W[df];B[eg];W[fj]
(;B[gh]C[My plan was to build a big territory in the center and with the help of my upper group.

JR: Black already has a big territory. This is not adding a huge amount to it since white will not jump in that much.

Also this is just responding to white.

I'd try to get white responding to Black];W[ji]
(;B[il]C[JR: This makes it too easy for white to connect. Over the next 10 moves or so white is able to gain a lot from this.]

;W[ch];B[di];W[ci];B[kn];W[lm];B[km]C[Better on G7?

JR Yes, this stone isn't doing anything

G7 is one option. Better is N12 to ensure that stone dos not get captured. White has built up a nice bit of centre territory over the past few moves.

There is even the danger that white will get to cut at L14 and force a ko fight for the top group - which would be a disaster.]

If you want to play in this corner Q15 is not right]

;W[kf];B[jf];W[mg];B[ld];W[fn]C[A big mistake. With the ko he would have rescued his group K19. Am I right?

JR: Yes this is a huge ko for white to win  

White's move is a good ko threat. R4 is another. 

Ignoring it may have cost black the game.];B[mc];W[go];B[hn]
;W[ho];B[im];W[in];B[hm]C[JR: Good squeezing technique by white.]
;W[fo]
(;B[io];W[eo]C[JR: White has reduced black by up to 10 points AND captured 10 stones  to give about 27 points. In addition black has lost any potential from A6 etc in the end game

The gain overall is at least 40 points - nearly double the value of the top group.

So White caught up by 15-20 points here. That is lots more than the winning margin.]
