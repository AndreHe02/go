;W[po]C[this stone doesnt work good with the others, hm?

Otakung:It's OK. Separate the black group or R14 is also good.]
;B[qo]C[Otakung:This is the other joseki.]
(;W[pp];B[qp]
(;W[qq]C[Otakung:This is not good , if black play P3 then white'll have 2 weak groups and cannot get anything from this corner.:
Tanguy: agreed black is happy to let a little corner to white (see variation)]

(;W[qj]C[Otakung:From this position it's hard to get many points it should play at Q9 to go to the center and pressure the black group.]

;W[qf]C[Otakung:I think it's too far from the R10's group. If white is cut white'll have 2 weak groups.]
;B[qh]
(;W[qc]C[maybe i should play p 14?

Otakung:I think so. Now you'll see if the white stone at R10 is moved at Q9 it's easier for connect when you jump to P14 than R10.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od]

(;W[of];B[nc]C[is it possible for white to secure life here?

Otakung:yes

(;W[lb];B[ob]C[such a bad trick, and i dont know how to response]
;W[ma];B[qb]

;B[pi];W[pj];B[oh];W[qi];B[ph];W[ng];B[ni];W[oj];B[nh]C[Otakung:Now white have many weak groups.]

;B[pb];W[nj];B[li];W[kg];B[lh];W[mh]C[Otakung:Connect at M13 is better because the black group can connect at S14.]
;B[lg];W[mi];B[rf];W[rg];B[qg]C[again, he´s cheating me, and i dont know what to do..;  i cant find a variation, which is good for me.

Otakung:You should connect at Q14 and connect again at M10.]

(;W[pf];B[rh];W[re];B[sg];W[qe];B[se];W[lj]C[Otakung:I think this is the best for white :)]
;B[mk];W[mj];B[md];W[kc];B[kd];W[jc];B[ic];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb]
;B[gc];W[id]C[Otakung:I think M14 is better , cut black group because the corner is empty and the white group at the upper is already alive so three stone is not have many points.]
;B[ie];W[hd]C[Otakung:The ladder is worked :)]
(;B[gd]C[Tanguy: Yes the ladder work but when you can directly capture in a geta: choose the geta!]
;W[cj];B[he]C[whites position at this point is not tooo bad, or?

Otakung:The black group is very strong so it's hard to take many points from the left.]

Tanguy: I would first play moves O9 but it will only give you one eye]

(see variation)];W[ld];B[nf];W[mf];B[og];W[cg];B[cm];W[dm]C[is this good strategy? i thought i have to keep the whole left side, otherwise i would have no chance anymore to stay in the game.
but my opponent had so good fighting skills!
