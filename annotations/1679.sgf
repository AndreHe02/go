C[karelian: I found this game pretty odd, since koba810 was supposed to be around fifth kyu. At the time of the game I didn't actually have a rank in IGS, but my rank couldn't have been higher than fifteenth kyu at this point. By rights I should have been crushed in this game, but instead I survived pretty far. Did my opponent play easy on me, or did I just get lucky?]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[dj];W[qn]C[karelian: I usually attack the corner with a hand like this if the opponent has played in the four-four point. Still,  in the end black ends up with a better position. Is this weak fuseki?]
;B[ql];W[on];B[np];W[qj]C[karelian: White is in no position to start killing the black stone at R8, but I thought the white stone there would eventually be of some use.]
;B[ol];W[mn];B[pi]C[karelian: Well, now the R10 stone is in a pretty weak position.

that`s not true, if you wish you can save it]
(;W[qf]C[karelian: Still, it makes R14 a stronger move.];B[qh]
;W[of]C[karelian: Not strong enough that I'd dare to move into the corner with R17, though. I wonder if an attack at O17 instead of R14 would have been better.]
;B[nd];W[mf];B[kd]C[karelian: Well, now Black pretty much controls lots of territory both above and below, while White has no territory, and White has little chance of effectively weakening Black's territory.

see variations]
(;W[hd];B[ic];W[hc];B[cf];W[df];B[cg]
(;W[jf]C[With this, the row of White stones is alive for now and I won't have to worry too much about them. It  isn't sente, though, and does allow Black to attach again.

your p14 group is ok without this move too because can make life  on side or run in center it`s not in imediate danger.
So I think it`s better to put some presure on o4-q4 stones in order to make some teritory while atacking.]
;B[dn];W[eo]C[karelian: This response seems very odd to me, since it does nothing to defend the corner. I suppose it was meant to aim at the three white stones in the bottom right, but all in all, it does a pretty lousy job of defending anything really, so I had to play another stone there later. Would a response into C8 or something been better, since Black's framework is very loose?]
;B[jp];W[hp];B[hq];W[gq]C[And now White's corner territory is extremely small compared to Black's.]
;B[iq]
(;W[co]C[karelian: Three white stones against one black stone seems pretty odd to me. I guess I wanted that little corner territory that badly. At this time, if I had jumped at C8, the black stone at D6 could probably have lived in the corner, and I didn't want to take that risk.]
;B[cn]C[karelian: Now it's time to see what the white stone at R10 is good for.]

(;W[rl]C[if you want to link your r10 stone you should push first  at q 10]
;B[rm];W[qm];B[rk];W[pl];B[qk];W[pk];B[pj];W[ok]C[karelian: I'm pretty sure I couldn't have won the fight if I'd tried to kill the four black stones there, so I didn't even try.]
;B[rj];W[rp]C[karelian: Instead I strenghtened my position a little, and]
;B[qq];W[ni]C[karelian: Now the two white groups are connected and I have some decent influence on the center. The attack on the black group seems to have been successful.]
;B[lo];W[kn];B[fm];W[hm]C[karelian: This hand was pretty weak. Not only did it not stop black from attacking further above, it also couldn't stop black from entering my territory later on.]
;B[ij];W[gk];B[gj];W[fj];B[fi];W[hj];B[gi];W[hi];B[fk];W[fl]
;B[ek]
(;W[hl]C[Was this hand necessary? I suppose it does prevent black from attacking effectively through there, but now Black gets to move in from above.]
;B[ig]
(;W[jh]C[karelian: This response, in retrospect, seems pretty weak. I think it should have been possible to cut the black stone off from the other groups, and even if not, giving it some chase might have given me an advantage later. Well, I was desperate to get the territory in the center, and I got it.]
;B[ih];W[ii];B[hh];W[ji]C[karelian: Now it's obvious how weak the stone at H7 is - not only does it very little in the above formation, it also does nothing to prevent Black from attacking.]
;B[jn];W[jm]C[karelian: Another sheepish response.];B[in];W[im]
;B[hn];W[gn];B[gm];W[fn];B[em];W[gg];B[gh];W[rd];B[qc];W[bn]
C[karelian: This is what they call a bad move. Clearly I didn't think at all.]
;B[do];W[dp];B[bo];W[bp];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[aq];B[ao]C[karelian: Well, at least I got to keep sente, but that was still pretty embarassing, especially after wasting two stones to defend that.]
;W[dh]C[karelian: And now I step too far... again.];B[dg];W[eg]
;B[eh]C[karelian: I think I could be considered very lucky in that Black didn't go to D15.

Right, you was lucky :)];W[de];B[fg];W[ff];B[ef];W[ee];B[eg]
;W[gf]C[karelian: Well, so much for my chances to attack Black's middle left territory.]
;B[jg];W[kg];B[if];W[je];B[jd];W[le];B[ld];W[ib];B[jb];W[id]
;B[jc]TR[ib]C[usually you don`t defend that stone right now, it means 5 points in gote for black, first you should make some other sente moves which worth about 5 points each one ;)]

;W[sb];B[pb];W[ra];B[qb];W[rq];B[rr];W[sr]C[karelian: The next move makes it self-evident that this move was abad one.]

(;W[qo];B[ro]C[still not late for r2];W[qp];B[pr];W[mo];B[mp]
;W[ko];B[kp];W[jo]C[karelian: And I so thought that this was a clever move.]
;B[io]
(;W[ip];B[ln]C[karelian: No way to back down, might as well make the most of it.]
;W[ho];B[lm];W[kl];B[ll];W[lk];B[ml];W[mk];B[nk];W[nj];B[nl]
;W[oj]C[karelian: Well, at least White's lower right group lived. Black still gets a great opportunity to further reduce White's middle territory.]
;B[oh];W[ng]C[karelian: I wonder what would have happened if I'd just went and played at O12]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[qg];W[rg]C[karelian: Not too clever, I should have just connected at Q14.]
;B[rh];W[sf];B[pf];W[pe];B[pg];W[qe];B[oe];W[ne];B[od];W[sc]
;B[re];W[se]C[karelian: And with this, White lives, though Black still got more out of the battle.]
;B[sh];W[be]C[karelian: After all the consecutive mistakes, White's only chance get anything is to attack Black's large territory in the left. This stone does very little in itself, and Black would have had, as far as I could tell, a virtually guaranteed victory just defending at B14. But instead...]
;B[cc]C[karelian: What is Black thinking? There is basically no way for Black to survive there unless I intentionally let it to. Perhaps Black just wanted to see what I would do and played the attack just for fun, since he had already all but won.

Sorry I don`t read minds, but who knows some players are gready and maybe he hoped that you`ll make a mistake.]
;W[dc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[da];B[bd];W[ce];B[ba]C[karelian: Since the black group is virtually dead and is hardly worth anything, I decided to launch my attack on the Black territory below now that I had the chance.]
;W[ah];B[bf];W[af];B[ad]C[karelian: I still wonder];W[ae]C[karelian: At this point Black can live in the corner, of course, but in comparison to the chance to reduce territory below, the crummy twelve moku in the corner mean very little.]

(;W[ak]C[karelian: I wonder if this move was unnecessary? I had no need to make eyes of course, and Black couldn't have really attacked there, could he?

yes better at A6];B[an];W[bm];B[am];W[al];B[gl];W[hk];B[ci]
C[karelian: I don't understand this Black move. He already has two eyes, doesn't he?

yes, but after the disaster you produced to his teritory he might be afraid :)]
