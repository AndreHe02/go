C[Hello, I'm a french player, recently rated 12K on KGS.
As I'm french, I hope you'll be able to understand all my comments (with my poor english)
I tried to comment this game a little, hoping you will answer
some of my questions. Thank you also for giving me the vision of a stronger player.

In this game I played white. Komi is 6.5, both players are 12K.]

;W[dc];B[fd];W[cf];B[jd];W[nq];B[oq]LB[jp:A]C[I think this stone rather helps me (there is no black stone on K4 = A)

Yes, it` true, black should go on the right or pincer the o3 stone]
;W[np];B[pn];W[jp];B[op]C[I think black is over condensed];W[nr]
LB[nn:A]C[hmm, this one is kind of small and slow.
I think is better at A . with o6 you enlarge your moyo while reducing black, and prepare a invasion on right side.]
;B[or];W[qf];B[qh];W[rd]C[with
this move (S16) you lose the option to enter in the corner at R17, so
it is better for this stage of the game to jump in center with P14.]

;B[nh];W[ph]C[ther I try to settle my own group before attacking the black stones.
I think your group is already settled. A move at n14 will be very good for white.]
;B[pi];W[qg];B[oi];W[pg]LB[nf:B][pk:A]C[I think this ston is rather stupid, I should better begin the fight toward A or B

Yes q12 is not worth to be saved black cant make even en eye there. Best move localy speaking is N14 I think.]
;B[nf]C[black
benefits from this move];W[ok]C[Again a slow move, things are clear on
this side of board, white should look forward to f13 or around of this
point. Here is the line of black and white moyo`s, you extend yours and
reduce black moyo at the same time.];B[pk];W[oj];B[pm];W[ol]
;B[oe];W[pl]C[slow and small, again f13 is big];B[ql];W[rk]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[qm];W[sl];B[rn];W[sm]C[there I think I should rather play for points on the left edge]
;B[sn];W[sk]C[so, with s7 you gained few points and lose sente. That`s bad result for white.]

wrong, see variation];B[bp];W[bq];B[an];W[ap];B[bm];W[dm];B[fm]

No, is better to play safe first.]

;W[gl]LB[cq:A]C[here I misread, there's a weakness at A, and black will benefit of this one later


This is a very strange move. I don`t understand at all the meaning, has no use, just causes trouble and help black]
;B[hl];W[gm];B[fj];W[hk];B[hj]C[isn't black too easy on me ?]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[jk];B[nn];W[gi]C[just a peeping to place a stone]

I put this variation because you looked interested, but I want to give you an advice:
That black group is hard to kill because is out in the center, so don`t try that.
Instead
you should try to build some teritory while aiming to catch it first. I
think is better for you to block him in center and let that group live
small on the side])
