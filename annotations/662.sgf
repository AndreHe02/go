C[I pick up some ground at the end, but his general placement of stones kept me fighting from behind for the whole game, which I lost.  How did he do that?
Thanks in advance,

C[I thought a while about this move.  I didn't know what the best way to respond to the 4-3,5-3 corner was.  It seemed if I played near it, I would make it stronger, so I played at R6, but I'm curious as to how one should respond.
RESPONSE: This move is fine. It is also possible to play at a, b or c for example.]
;B[pn]C[this is another question for me.  This comes up a lot, and I don't know whether to hane or cut into the corner.  I think studying joseki would be a waste of time at this point in my game, so what solid principles can I follow here?
RESPONSE: It is important to remember that attaching moves are normally defensive. I think Black is aiming to defend the area betwen this corner and his enclosure in the lower left. This can be quite a good strategy for black but not necessarily one you should worry about]

(;W[qp];B[qq];W[rp];B[po];W[qo]C[Comment: This is bad shape and looses you a move]
;B[jp]C[Good play by black as the wall, this stone and the lower left corner work well together.]
;W[pm]C[Comment: This helps black to build up a strong wall facing the stone]
;B[om];W[pl];B[ol];W[pk];B[qf];W[qh]C[Looks good];B[qd];W[qc]
;B[rd];W[pf];B[pe];W[oe];B[pc];W[od];B[pb];W[oc];B[ic]C[Comment: You can play down one more move in sente.]

(;W[lc]C[Comment: I think this is too close to your wall. Better to play away from strength including your own. See variation for a different idea. Black forced to low position and white builds a moyo.]
;B[ob];W[nc]C[Comment: Bad shape again. Often building empty trianges is not only bad shape but also implies a wasted move. Better play elsewhere. Left hand side.]
;B[fc]C[at this point, I begin to feel that he is placing his stones more efficiently than me, doing 2 point jumps himself while nudging me to do one point jumps and extensions.

Comment: Reasonable assessment. Black has played more efficient stones while you have been caught making small moves that result in bad shape. More important at this stage in the game to look at the space where no body has played and see if you can play there!]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[db];B[ed];W[dc];B[fb];W[ee]C[Comment:  More important to extend up the left side...]
;B[ci]
(;W[cg]C[should I have invaded here?

Comment: It's possible to play lower and I think you maybe need to do this to mix up the game and try to bring it to your advantage. Depends in part on style of play. Better to play here instead of the atari.]
;B[ei]
(;W[dl]C[I invade after his play, making a very weak stone
Comment: You do need to invade some where.];B[en];W[gn];B[fm]
;W[fl];B[gm];W[gl];B[hm];W[em]C[at this point, can I think of g6 as a well-played sacrifice, or was there a better place for it, or should I have saved it?

Comment: Lets go back a few moves and look at some possible alternatives. I've detailed a rather long variation. Shallower invasions tend to be rather easier but it depends on how much territory each player has. Don't forget black has a weak group on the top. Maybe this can expoited or even killed!]
;B[dm];W[el];B[cm];W[cl];B[bm];W[bl];B[am];W[al]LB[gi:a]C[All through this long extension, I don't know if these are alive

Comment: We'll they don't have two eyes so they have to find a way out! Blacks stone above it look weak.]

;B[ok];W[oj];B[if]C[it seems like he can cut, and kill my stones on row 8, but he plays here.  Mistake?

Comment: Well... his position is thin too! The black move does help his group at the top!]
;W[li];B[lh];W[mi];B[kj];W[kk]
(;B[fe]C[again, seems like he can cut and kill, and this move doesn't get him a lot

Comment it keeps his group connected.  The cut and kill is very complicated (see variation) and he probably doesn't need it to win.]
;W[ff];B[fd];W[df]LB[fi:a][hi:b]C[Comment: Too small, what about a or b. Or connect your big grout in the middle.]
;B[gf];W[mq]C[This is a nice invasion and works out well for you. Makes a big difference. With this success you still have an opportunity to win.]

;B[qr];W[qs];B[mm]
(;W[nl];B[ml];W[nk];B[mk];W[mj];B[nm];W[nj];B[ln]C[seems all he has to do is play at m10 instead, and I'm in real trouble

Comment: some of the fragilities in blacks position (mentioned earlier) still exist. I think you are right to express concern!]
;W[lj]C[Comment: Important at this point];B[ms]C[Comment: This sequence is quite painful. Probably could have been avoided!]
;W[ns];B[mr];W[nr];B[lr];W[ps];B[rq];W[sq];B[on]
(;W[mh]LB[qg:a]C[This is too slow I think. Play at "a" in sente first? I think this lost you some costly initative in the end game. With sharp play at this point you can still win the game. See variations]
;B[lg];W[mg];B[lf];W[mf];B[qg]C[This is painful as well. You could probably have played here in sente.]

Comment: No swindle. Good play with your strength and black's greed. Unfortunately not enough to win the game at this stage.]

[sf]C[Final comment: Certainly you got into a little trouble in the beginning. Too much bad shape and not enough looking at the whole board. However you still had a chance to win with two good invasions (left side and bottom right). If you had pressed your advantages at the begining of the end game victory could have been yours! Interesting game. Better luck next time. Hope these comments help. Paul Brennan]
