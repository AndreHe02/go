C[Reviewed by "cgay".  I'm only 5k on KGS and I don't know what the rank difference is between KGS and IGS so I don't know how useful my comments will be.  I'll do what I can.  I tend to get carried away with variations, so don't feel you need to follow them all the way to the end each time.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pq]C[Tsunekawa: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.]
;B[qo];W[np];B[ql];W[qp];B[po];W[fq];B[qf]C[cgay: my teacher says always respond if your opponent approaches a 4-4 point.]
;W[qi]C[cgay: This would be ok if there were no stone at r8.  As it is r11 will end up very weak when black threatens the top right corner with a second move.]
;B[of];W[nd];B[oi]C[Here is where I felt things starting to go wrong. I'm not sure my response was good and now think that the invasion at r11 was premature.

cgay: as predicted :)  And black still has m17.  I think at this point as white I would just try to use the r11 aji as best as possible without trying too hard to save it.  Probably s15 first, to protect top right corner.]
;W[pk];B[no];W[mo]C[cgay: This looks too agressive to me.  It looks like white can be cut at p3 later.  See variation at move 21.]
;B[nn];W[nk]LB[mn:A][oq:B]
(;B[mn];W[lo];B[mf]C[I'm feeling cramped by all of black's influence in the center.]
;W[ld];B[qc];W[qd];B[rd]LB[pc:A][re:B]
(;W[pc];B[rc]C[I thought it best to secure myself a base at this point.

cgay: I disagree.  See variation at move 27.  Note especially that if you hadn't added two more stones to the r11 group your r11 sacrifice wouldn't be too big at this point and you would have more to show for it (a big top right corner).]
;W[pb]TR[pl][cn][ln]C[cgay: small gote.  I would play one of the marked positions instead.]
;B[hp];W[fo];B[kp]LB[lp:A][op:B][mq:C]
(;W[lp]C[cgay: ouch.  Maybe play p4 instead.  Black is starting to look a bit weak there especially if white gets q8.  Or maybe n3 is best since it protects the cut and weakens L4/H4.  See variations.]
;B[kq];W[lq];B[hn];W[dn]C[I felt that black's group in the lower center had vulnerabilities I could exploit later.]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[co];W[dm];B[er];W[eq];B[dq];W[fr];B[gc];W[cf]
;B[cd];W[ef];B[dg];W[df];B[di];W[eg];B[cg];W[ei];B[dj];W[ej]
C[Here I was hoping to counter black's influence and thought I could pressure the black group on the left to build it.]
;B[ck];W[bm];B[ek];W[bi]C[I wanted to cut the base out of black to make attacking the group easier.]
;B[bf]LB[be:B][bk:A]
(;W[bk]C[cgay:  My instinct tells me to atari at b15 instead, to disconnect black.  You clearly can't kill it if you allow him to connect, and you end up with a weak e14 group.  See variation at move 63.]
;B[bh];W[cl];B[ci];W[bj];B[fk];W[eh]C[cgay: What does this move accomplish?]
;B[jc];W[kc];B[jd];W[kb];B[jb];W[om]C[With things settled on top, I thought black would come after my stones on the right next. I hoped to make eye shape and eat up some of his territory.]
;B[pm];W[pl];B[qm];W[on];B[oo];W[qk];B[rp];W[rq];B[pp];W[qq]
C[I was a little worried about black cutting at p3, but thought it could wait.]
;B[ro];W[pn];B[ml]C[I started having delusions of capturing the black stones on the right or bottom.]
;W[qn];B[rn];W[nm];B[mm];W[rk];B[sm]C[cgay: I would atari at o8 first]

;W[gl]C[cgay: Nice move.];B[hl];W[gk];B[in];W[jn];B[lr];W[mr]
LB[jp:B][jq:A]C[cgay: Variation B makes simple life for black.  After this sequence black is dead if white plays there first.]

(;B[jq];W[jo];B[kr];W[jk]LB[li:A][nl:B]C[cgay: Black should atari first at B.  White r11 group MAY be able to make small life on the side.]

(;B[li];W[mj];B[lj];W[nl];B[mi];W[nj];B[ni];W[jf]C[With his groups looking pretty solid, I thought it best to get what territory I could in the center.]
;B[ke];W[ji];B[fj]
(;W[gi]C[cgay: No, just connect your groups with f7 and j3 can be killed if white gets to play there first.  Also some potential in the lower left corner.]
;B[gj];W[hj];B[hk];W[hi];B[gm];W[fl];B[el];W[fm];B[fn];W[em]

;B[gr]C[I suspect I should take f1 here to form a ko. Or perhaps there was another point that I could do that?

cgay: I don't see any way for white at this point.  Needed to keep your groups connected.]
;W[br];B[go]C[cgay: g5 is suboptimal.  Should throw in at f4 first.]

(;B[dh]C[This seemed another small play by black. Was there a threat here I was missing?

cgay: See variation.  d12 worth 5 or 6 points.  Probably biggest for black, as he doesn't seem to have any sente moves.]

Game 112 jbru is removing @ H13
You have typed done.
jbru: 54.5 to Tsunekawa: 73.0

So, in the end, it looks to me that my inability to make any in-roads in the upper left are the biggest thing that hurt me. The right side of the board seems pretty even, as far as territory goes, but black got much the better of me on the left.

cgay: You paid a big price for letting your three groups get disconnected when you played g11 instead of f7.  I think black let you off easy regarding r11.]
