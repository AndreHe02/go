C[I play white in this game. This is my first game on the IGS. I do not know my rank but put 27k as my rank before this game (it should be really somewhat higher.)]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp];B[ec];W[eq];B[qf];W[cg];B[jq];W[mq]
;B[gq];W[pi];B[cn];W[ck];B[en];W[nc];B[oc];W[jc]C[Here I tried not to let space for B to invade.]
;B[hc];W[ld]C[A bit of space to survive and perhaps go towards the center.]
;B[ne];W[ob]C[This following sequence is perhaps  playing somewhat too small at  this stage in the game.

Yes, too small, and also (more importantly) gote.];B[pb];W[nb]
;B[jo];W[mo]C[Not to let B at the same time push me to the corner and gain influence in the center.]
;B[mm];W[pm]C[Protecting the right side];B[ek];W[di]MA[ef][de]
C[Again playing for space to survive, prevent invasion and form eyes at some point in time.

In hindsight I could have been more aggressive and played to either of the X's. What do you think?

I don't agree, as black C11 looks bad for you, especially after E9.]
;B[eg];W[be]C[Here I tried to at the same time protect myself and threaten to invade.]
;B[bd];W[ce];B[de];W[df];B[ef];W[bm]C[Trying to get more area and threaten to connect.]
;B[bn];W[cm];B[dm];W[dl];B[el];W[dj];B[dk];W[cl];B[ej];W[ei]
;B[fi];W[ni]MA[ln]C[Trying to go and meet the white stones coming from the top and getting influence in the center.

This is reasonable, the marked move also looks good.];B[lf]
;W[je]C[Did not dare to go any higher for fear of not connecting. Going for the center and preventing Blacks on the right and left from connecting.

Good sense.];B[he];W[jg]C[I was going for the center so I liked this exchange. My stones would have been quite limited to the top if black would have put his stone to K13 instead of G15. I probably would have gone for L11 or something like that.]
;B[li]MA[jl][hk]C[This is a silly move.  Maybe one of the marked moves would be better.]
;W[ji]C[Now I could progress with the one Black did not try to block.

You can feel lucky that black played so badly here.];B[jk];W[mk]
;B[kj];W[ng];B[ll];W[hj]C[Here I am just trying to take his area, not to get any for myself. Hence my form as a line. My sole concern was to connect to an area that had eyes. And steal his area of course.]
;B[hi]LB[ji:a][hj:b]MA[ii][ij]C[This was a greedy move:  He had no hope of cutting you off this way.  The stones marked "a" and "b" are called a "keima".  One must strike at the waist of a keima: the marked points.  In this case, if black had played the square, you would have been cut off.]
;W[ij];B[ii];W[jj];B[kk];W[hl];B[hn];W[il];B[jl];W[gm];B[gn]
;W[fo]C[Here I tried to again threaten to connect and thus gain a bit of territory.

Very good.];B[fn];W[go];B[ho];W[fp];B[gp];W[fr];B[fq];W[ep]
;B[gr];W[er];B[qi];W[qj];B[qh];W[rj];B[ri];W[kh]C[To secure the connection and possibly form one to the right also.]
;B[lh];W[ih];B[hh];W[hg];B[gg];W[hf];B[gf];W[if]MA[ie]LB[he:a]
C[How about the marked move?  No empty triangle, better pressure on stone "a"]
;B[ie];W[jd];B[ic];W[ib];B[hb];W[jb];B[dg];W[cf];B[ed];W[bo]
;B[an];W[ao];B[co];W[bp];B[ph];W[pj];B[sj];W[sk];B[si];W[rl]
;B[nn];W[oo];B[no];W[np];B[on];W[pn]C[Here I was very happy with my shape.

It is indeed nice.];B[om];W[ol];B[pl];W[ql];B[nl];W[ok];B[nk]
;W[nj];B[mj];W[mn]LB[lm:a]MA[jm]C[Had he not blundered here I would have next atarid at A and then play to somewhere around X to split Black up.]
;B[ln];W[nm];B[lo];W[lp];B[ml]C[And next a couple of crawls for more space off the opponent.]
;W[of];B[oe];W[im];B[jm];W[in];B[io];W[jn];B[kn];W[oh];B[pf]
;W[kf];B[le];W[ke];B[md];W[mc];B[nf];W[og];B[mg];W[fj]C[This idea I found very nice. I could connect or kill some stones. Splitting black up and getting his territory.]
;B[gj];W[fk];B[gk];W[fl];B[hm];W[em];B[gl];W[fm];B[dn];W[hk]
MA[gh]C[X works.];B[ki];W[fh]MA[gh]C[This was nice. Though perhaps X would have been better.]
;B[gi]C[Black is clearly not paying attention.];W[gh];B[fg]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[kq];B[kp];W[mi];B[lk];W[mh];B[oa];W[na];B[pa]
;W[nd];B[me];W[od]C[This was the real blunder ;-)];B[pc];W[ha]
;B[lc]C[This was a blunder.];W[lb];B[kd];W[kc];B[ld];W[gb];B[gc]
;W[fb];B[eb];W[fc];B[fd];W[ga];B[ea];W[id]C[Here I tried to figure out a way to kill the four stones above or the two underneath. Could not figure out how.]
;B[hd];W[kg];B[lg];W[js];B[is];W[ks];B[hr];W[ad];B[ac];W[ae]
;B[cc];W[dh];B[am];W[al];B[dp];W[dq];B[do];W[cr];B[fs];W[es]
;B[gs];W[pg];B[qg];W[eh]C[No good point to playing here.];B[fa]
;W[ia];B[qq]C[How would you comment this sequence in the corner? The result was good, but I thing Black could have done better.

Black should not survive here.  You played well enough to get the correct result.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qr];B[rr];W[pr];B[qo];W[rn];B[qn];W[ro];B[rp]
;W[rs];B[sq]C[I don't see the point of this move.  Black has no chance for eyes anymore here.]
;W[rm];B[po]C[You could safely have ignored this move.];W[qm]
;B[sp];W[so]C[You could also have ignored this move.];B[ss]
;W[qs];B[pk];W[tt]C[Now Black starts playing silly.];B[nn];W[om]
;B[ma];W[mb];B[ka];W[kb];B[bq];W[br];B[aq];W[ar];B[eo];W[tt]
;B[lr];W[mr];B[ls];W[lq];B[ds];W[tt];B[cs];W[tt];B[oq];W[or]
;B[nr];W[ns];B[tt];W[sr]C[No point to this move.];B[dr];W[bs]
;B[ss];W[tt]C[Well, you clearly won by a large margin.  Next time, submit a game you lost.  It is hard to learn much when you play so much better than your opponent.]
