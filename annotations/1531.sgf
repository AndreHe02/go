C[I think my greatest weakness in this game was in the fuseki and the
beginning of the middle-game. I might have been a bit better than white
in local fights, but in the global strategy I was probably weaker.
I would specially appreciate comments about my fuseki and how to improve it.]
;B[qd]C[Hi, I'm dede, 5k in my country rankings. I hope my comments will be useful.]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[cf]C[dede:
This move is a bit too advanced for you. Although it looks bigger then
ordinary shimari, it's lighter and harder to proper use.];W[jp]
;B[qk]C[dede:
this move looks weak. It helpes White to strenghten his q4 stone and
influence from all sanrensen stones. I think better r6.];W[od]
;B[md];W[qe]C[What is the correct joseki answer for this?]
(;B[pd];W[pe]C[dede:
I don't like White's choice of making a wall in this direction. White's
influence won't work well - it'll be reduced by r9 stone. So I'd prefer
a move like p15, building influence od line p, and then use it to
attack n16 stone.];B[oc];W[nc];B[nd];W[oe];B[ob];W[rd];B[rc]
;W[pi]C[dede: I think this move would work better on third line.]
;B[qn];W[qo];B[pn];W[qj]C[dede:
this kind of attack by White only strenghtens opponent stones. Don't
attach what you want to attack. I think White should follow joseki and
play o3];B[rk]C[dede: I'd play s10.];W[op]C[dede: too slow. May be clicko? This move should be definitely on O line]
;B[ok]C[dede: too slow. Black can easily invade down part of the board, or build moyo up there; c6, n3 or k17 for instance.]
;W[kc];B[lc];W[ld]
(;B[kd]C[dede: this move is bad. Black should know, for who after White's m15 ladder would work. Look var.]
;W[le];B[jd]C[This was a pure mistake from my part... I saw it about 5 seconds after making the move...]
;W[mc]
(;B[mb]C[dede:
look variant];W[lb];B[nb];W[lc]C[IMHO white should have tenukied
instead of M17 and get a big point elsewhere in the board.]
;B[ck]C[dede:
The same mistake as with r9 move. Don't help your opponent - harras
him. C6, an invasion at n3 or near. But first of all, Black shouldn't
leave stones k16. They look like ideal target now. K17 would strenghten
them and as a second task , it would start another moyo with d17-c14
stones];W[hc];B[jc];W[jb];B[hd];W[gd];B[he];W[ge]C[dede: now White builds power to attack top left corner...]

(;B[if]C[dede: A very bad move. White has only one eye, so attacking him may be very profitable. Look var]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[bh]
(;B[ch]C[dede: again, Black must consider cut at c17 and ladder.  Look at var]
;W[dg];B[bi];W[bf]C[I knew all those cutting points would be bad some day...]

;W[qi];B[qq]C[White's
moyo at the bottom was impressive... Invading it should be almost
impossible, but if I wanted to have even the slightest chance to win, I
had to try.
To my surprise, I succeeded, as the following sequence shows.

I should probably have invaded it long long earlier, though...]
;W[qp];B[nr];W[pq];B[pr];W[qr];B[lq]C[dede:
Black lives only if White makes a mistake. As you said, it's much loo
late now. For me this game is over];W[or];B[jq];W[iq];B[jr]
;W[ir];B[kp];W[ko];B[nq];W[np];B[mp]C[I
think white did not defend his moyo well enough, as he allowed me to
make that huge group inside it. I think white could have stopped the
invasion completely and killed all my stones there.
Right?

dede: Right.];W[ls]C[This reduced the territory of my group allright, but didn't kill.

The upper corner seemed in big danger, so I decided to defend it. Perhaps I should have played C1 instead?
