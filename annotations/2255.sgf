C[Hello,

I didn't comment much on the fuseki as I don't know much about it, neither on the yose because at that point the game was already decided.

I commented mainly the chuban, and included several variations at various points. Please keep in mind that I'm only 12k (KGS), so I probably missed many things. However, I hope you will find this review useful.

Yann]N[20040131vsC];B[pd]C[Thank you to review my game.

I am sorry that I don't the rank of the White and me (the Black side).]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[ec]C[The 3-5 point is complicated ; it's better to play moves one understand, at least to some extent.]
;B[pk];W[nc];B[pf];W[kc];B[oc]C[I use Black9(at P17) because I want to protect the conner and make white move on O16

--

It is not a good idea, for several reasons. First, it doesn't really defend the corner (see variation) like Q17 would, and it makes white thicker.]

(;W[nd]C[W10 put on O16 as I wish. Is that this White move not too good as the space between L17 and O16,O17 became narrower.

--

Yes, but your corner isn't secure yet, and white's quite well in the top side (if you invade at H17, you may get in trouble and white will enclose the top left corner)]
;B[fq]C[I put Black11 at F3 because I want to maximum expand my land. But I am worry White cut off me between Black11 and Black3. 

Should I put Black11 at F3 or K3 or K4 or L3 or L4? where is the best move for it?

--

Black doesn't have any territory yet, just a moyo, which could get smaller if white makes a pincer at K4. It'd rather play K4 to enlarge black's moyo.]
;W[cd];B[jp];W[cj]
(;B[ej]C[I use B15 to compress white's development and prepare to put at C3.

Is this movement useful and suitable at the moment?

--

I don't think it make much. White can simply defend at C6, and your stone may get a bit isolated.

I'd have played F5 to expand black's moyo (see variation). Besides, it defends well the lower side. Next, white will have to invade black's moyo, which will be painful for him.]
;W[po];B[qp];W[qo];B[np];W[dn];B[cq]C[As White has put a stone at D6, should I still pont at C3 now?

--

D6 doesn't protect against the san-san invasion at C3, so you can. 

However, I think it would be much better to attack white's two lonely stones Q5-R5.
If black played R7 here, it is very severe, because they now have no basis for life, and they have no friendly stone around.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er]
(;B[eq]C[
No, here black must connect at C2 (see variation)];W[cr]C[now I find that I was fail to get the lower-left conner. What's wrong with me?

-- 

You should have connected instead of trying to cut.];B[fr];W[nn]
;B[es]C[Here, you let white choose between keeping the corner (see variation) and letting his stones in the bottom right escape.]

(;W[eh]C[White doesn't do either, and makes a very strange move.
Besides, it has a bad shape (black D11 could be troublesome later).]
;B[qm]C[Now, white's three stone have no choice but run for the center. 
Black's job is either to kill them, or to chase them and make territory by doing that.]
;W[rn]
(;B[rp]C[I found that I have a chance to get the lower-left conner again. But I choosed to move at S4 to prevent White get stable at right conner.

Is this choice correct?

Is the move at S3 is best for my propose?

--- 

You indeed have a choice to make.
I think that if you take the lower-left corner, white doesn't get life at once, but gets just one eye and a much better position, which can lead to a nasty fight (see variation).
On the other hand, taking the corner ruins white moyo in the bottom left part, and weakens white's stones.

I think the best thing to do is to continue attacking white, making territory in sente, and at the right time (just before you think he won't respond) take the corner.

And yes, S3 is very good for attacking white.];W[br]
(;B[co]C[Is this move useless to get back the conner?

-- 

Well, it doesn't seem to work.  Even if you added another move it wouldn't look very good... So better let it be, and maybe have it work later as aji.

But, more importantly, you had a choice before between the corner and attacking the weak white group. You started to attack the group, and your opponent didn't respond. Either you were wrong and it's not in danger, or you are right and you must punish white for being careless.  It is important to stick to your original plan : now should be the time to kill white's weak group. Not doing that is submitting to his will, and that's not a good way to fight... :o)]
;W[do];B[bq]C[It was hopeless. It's better to leave that be, and maybe aiming at invading later thanks to the aji.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[ao];W[bn];B[ar];W[aq];B[cs]C[Now I lost the conner. Is there some better move to get the conner or since B35 at C5 is a definitly wrong begining?]
;W[ap];B[fn];W[rl];B[rm];W[ln];B[jn]C[I put Black51 at K6 to stop the escape of White.

But after that I may give a chance for White to form eye at the right side. Right?

--
No, I don't think white can make an eye, but he could invade your right top moyo, and if you cut (see variation) it would be very painful for black. If you don't, he gets an easy life and many points in your moyo...]

(;W[rj];B[qi];W[pl];B[ql];W[qk];B[qj];W[rk];B[sn];W[pm];B[ro]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[pj];B[pi];W[ri];B[qn]C[Should I use Black67 to eat the White at the moment?

Or I should stop the extending of White at the right side?

-- 

White can't take your three three stones, so that you should have played something else.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[ob];B[qg]C[I used Black71 at R13 as I want to stop the expend of White at the right side.

But I feel the the black seems put too many stones at this small area. Is it?

--

Well, white has completely suceeded in ruining your moyo by now. White can still descend at S17. There's a proverb saying that one shouldn't defend something that's open at both sides.]

(;W[pk]C[Here, I think white souldn't have connected. See variations.]
;B[nj];W[ll];B[on]C[I tried Black75 at P6 to destroy White. Do u think this movement is the best at the moment?

-- 

Well, white is very strong here. He can easily make an eye in sente with S12, and making another will be easy (see variation). At best you can only hope to catch two white stones.]

(;W[nm];B[nk];W[pn];B[oo];W[om];B[nl];W[rh];B[rg];W[jm]C[After W84 at K7, I think White is alive again. Right?

-- 

I don't think white can make a second eye right away, but he can easily run more, and I think you can't hope to kill now.]
;B[jk]C[So I put at K9 to minimize the the expending of White.

--

If white lives and you shut him in, you'll get a wall facing white, so you won't get much territory. I don't know.]
;W[lj];B[lk]C[Is this movement risky?

--

Proverb : "one doesn't cut a tobi" ;o)
Here, he can get an eye and cut your stone.]
(;W[im];B[kl];W[km]C[Is there some wrong move for White to lost an eye?

--

White should probably have played L9 instead of J7.];B[ml];W[lm]
C[That move is very bad. Better to play N7 and get a ko (white has a lot of threats to live, I think). And it's way too big, so that white can't afford to lose it, so he will probably ignore black's first threat.

Either that or white is confident that he can live.];B[hk];W[hc]
C[This move is bad. If white's group is dead (as it looks like), white has lost by a large margin. So white should try to live or resign here.]
;B[mf]C[I jump to N14 to get land. Is the jump too far?

--

No, it's ok (black's quite strong around here). 

But black is really much ahead (around 40 points), so I would play it safe and make sure the white group doesn't come back from the dead and play M4.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[hf]C[I feel that White98 at H14 huge expended it area but I don't know how to compress it.]
;B[ig]C[I just use Black98 to stop White's expend and protect my land.

--

Looks ok.

Another proverb : "there's no point in the center" :o)

Which means that here either you will both make about half of it, or push into the other's and everything will be dame.]
;W[dl];B[fl];W[cg];B[fi];W[mi]C[This is hopeless.];B[nh]C[I think black doesn't even need to answer.]
;W[kf];B[kg];W[pc];B[od];W[lf];B[lg];W[me];B[nf];W[sd];B[se]
;W[sc];B[jf];W[je];B[fh];W[hg];B[hh];W[fg];B[di];W[ci];B[dh]
;W[ch];B[eg];W[ef];B[dg];W[df];B[gg]C[Is that I put Black131 at J14 is better than here?

-- 

Both are small sente moves. J14 gives you a bad shape (empty triangle) but it doesn't matter (you're very strong here).

E4 is gote but quite big, and M4 for peace of mind.];W[gf];B[ff]
;W[fe];B[ie]C[Nice. If white ataries at K14, you can get a good ko (you don't risk much, but your opponent does), see variation. However, white probably has too many ko threats with his dead group.]

(;W[jd];B[he];W[ge];B[if];W[fo];B[go];W[gp]C[White143 is out of my expectation. I think there may be something tricky but I don't know.

--

Well, he can engage in a fight, which he will lose. In this case, you must take care not to let the big white group come to life.]
;B[fp];W[bs];B[ds];W[eo];B[em];W[dm];B[ne];W[md];B[dk];W[ck]
;B[fg];W[gn];B[ho];W[gm];B[gl];W[fm]C[White158 suddenly shocked me! It want to save the White dragon.

-- 

Sure, unexpected moves can be very stressing in yose. But this time, you could get out of it without much damage.]
;B[hm]C[Hopefully I can put at H7 to cut off White.];W[en];B[hn]
;W[el];B[ek];W[hd];B[lp]C[I put at M4 to prevent anymore chance for the alive of the White dragon. 

Is this move necessary?

--

Necessary, I don't know. I don't think it is, but it makes most of white's ko threat to live disappear, and if with this move you are sure to kill, then you clearly have won. 

I would have played it a while ago ; in a closer match, you might not have the time to do it, but here, it's not worth the worries.]
;W[id];B[dj];W[ih]C[White168 make my stones form a bad shape.

--
Yes, but I don't think there's much to fear here.];B[jg];W[hi]
;B[gh];W[ep];B[kj]C[The game finished after Black173. Do u think this move necessary?

Would u like to give me a overall comment? What is my biggest weakness? How to improve it?

Thank you very much.

--

I think it wasn't. But when you are ahead (by 70 points!) and there is lots of aji, better to play it safe, especially if your opponent is skilled at trick plays :)


In this game, I think you played with fire, giving white several opportunities to live or to flee, and you were lucky that he didn't seize them, otherwise the 70-points win would have gone to a very close game.

I think your biggest mistake is the global attack, and as to how to improve it, I'd say play games and get them reviewed ;o) There are also books, but I think they're a bit too difficult for you yet.

Another thing you should try to learn is to count, even very roughly. When white played H17 (move 94), you should have seen that you were very much ahead, and so played more calmly.

If you have any question, feel free to email me.
