C[Hello !

I'll try to give you some useful advice, as far as I can.
Black lost the game because of BIG mistakes, when white played quietly.

Black should try to follow at least one principle :

1- Do not create several weak groups at the same time, especially in the early fuseki stage.

When we see a territory of our opponent, we start to feel unhappy and often invade immediately. This is a commen mistake. It brings us a difficult game and we might risk runing all the time.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[I played the sanrensei a lot lately so now I prefer it because I think I know it better than other openings.]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[np];W[pk]LB[qk:A]C[this contact move is good for black :
- it rinforces black
- it isn't very safe to build a living shape for white

As black, I would have answered at A];B[qj];W[oj];B[oi];W[nk]
;B[ni]LB[nj:A]C[I think I'm doing better then W now.

You can first play A to make white heavy, it gives you also a good strength toword the center.]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[po];B[qp];W[op];B[oq];W[oo];B[nq];W[mo]LB[jp:A]
C[I am still in a better position. Probably I should play one more stone around L3.   But then I looked for a place to attack W :)


White is still open, and you don't need to attack him now. You'd better have extended to A]
;B[fq]C[Is this a correct direction for an attack? I meant to extend and to keep the crowded W group separated from the rest.]
;W[hq]LB[jq:A]C[Pincer. Of course :)

This is not good for white : if black answers at A, he takes the lead in the attack, and chase white out.]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[fm];W[lq]C[too easy for white ...];B[cl]C[???

Black should defend his 3 stones, before attacking.

Play A, for instance];W[eq];B[gq]LB[hp:A][cq:B]C[is F2 better here?

this move or F2 do not make eye space. I would have tried A to develop faster. Anyway it's late ...

Or leave it and go into the san-san at B];W[hr];B[cq];W[dq]

;W[fr];B[fc];W[hc];B[fe];W[ec]C[this is not joseki, black should take advantage of it]
;B[fb]LB[df:A]C[A is a lot better I think :
it builds a big moyo on the left and closes white in the corner]
;W[cf];B[cc]LB[kc:A]C[???
- it's too late : white has already closed the corner
- black has 3 stones to defend, and can attack 1 lonely white stone : A, build a nice moyo on the right]

;W[ee];B[ie];W[kc];B[mc];W[ke];B[hg]C[now black must escape, and defend his stones without building territory.
It's very dangerous because has 2 groups still floating without eye. White could kill the one or the other]

better A to connect the 2 weak groups, and build some shape]
