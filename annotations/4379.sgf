C[Hi, I'm Jan.  Hope you enjoy the review. :)

To summarize the points you should focus on:

- don't play endgame moves ( except in endgame ;)

- if you see no way out of a lost position; leave it alone!
    - you still may have use for it later
    - you will make your oponend stronger if you peek around without plan
    - sometimes you get an idea later how to get out of this ;)

- grab sente if possible and play big points first.];B[dp]C[KingKong [13k\]: moment]

Jan: no. D8 looks pretty lone and White can push at B3.]

(;B[ln]C[Here I wanted to keep the white group under pressure

Jan: Not good. First i think the White group is alive as it stands so White can just ignore your move. 

Second, the move doesn't do anything useful. There is no moyo that can be build in this area and no teritorry that gets secured.

Third if white runs, it destroys any potential territory for black that might be in this area.

So _if_ pushing (as i said, i wouldn't push here) pushing from the other side would make more sense. ( see var. )]

C[I had the feeling that the white group at the bottom was not alive yet, but I didn't see a good way of attacking. That's why I responded to w P17

Jan: Even if the group is not alive (in fact i thing it has enough for two lives ;) I find the area around A much more interesting. It gives support for your group _and_ eats some of the moyo White gets if he plays there.]

You are getting pushed around by white. Just ask yourself after _every_ move: 

- does it need an answer?
