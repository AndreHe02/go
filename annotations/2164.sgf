C[thanks for reviewing our game.  It was played on the turn based Dragon Go Server.

Ben in Black
Dennis is White

Brodie:  Hi! I hope you find this all helpful.  I didn't find an overwhelming amount of things that you did wrong.  Most of it looked fine to me.  There were, however, a number of weak connections that I'd feel quite uneasy with playing.  You might want to watch out for those!]
;B[qd];W[dq];B[qp];W[cd];B[jq];W[fc];B[pj];W[oc];B[cj];W[cn]
;B[cg];W[gq]C[Brodie:  all pretty normal up to here.];B[nq]
;W[qf]
(;B[pc]LB[pc:1][od:3][oe:4][pe:2]C[Dennis: I've been told that a better move might have been to jump out into the center - though I don't always see it myself either.

Ben: I thought about it.  I might have if I had some other stones near by.

Brodie:  Yes, I think that playing out towards the center might be better as well.  I think the reasoning behind it is that this way, Black is likely to wind up completely surrounded.  Alive, and with some territory, but White will have a nice strong wall on the outside, which Black certainly doesn't want.  (see variations)

If black plays at Q15 (2),  he can safely move towards the center, and puts pressure on both of White's stones R14, and P17.  

if Black plays at P16 (3),  he will either get trapped in the corner, like with Q17, or a very complicated fight will start.

If Black plays at P15 (4),  he will simply be cut by white, and the results will likely be very bad.]

(;W[od];B[qh]C[Brodie:  I think a play at S15 to give your group a little more room, or at Q15, jumping in to the center and cutting white would be more helpful here.  The two black stones don't have very much room!!]
;W[og];B[mc]C[Brodie:  I'm still a little worried about the two black stones.  Also, this seems a little risky.   I would advise playing more towards K17, to give yourself a little more space from White's growing wall. I'm not entirely convinced it's a bad play, though, as you can start putting some pressure on those white stones.  I feel it leads to harder fighting than necessary.]
;W[kc];B[me];W[mg];B[oe]C[Brodie:  This looks kind of complicated.  P15 is a very weak connection but Black is putting the two white stones into serious trouble.  However, I think White is  a move or two ahead and can deal with almost any threat.]
;W[pe];B[of];W[fj]C[Brodie:  I was expecting white to play Q16 here, too keep black from cutting.  Even if Black does cut, I think white should still be fine, and will likely kill one of the two black groups.  Both the Black groups are in quite a bit of danger.]

(;B[cl]C[Brodie:  I think helping Black's two weak groups is a little more important.]
;W[el];B[ke];W[id];B[kg]C[Brodie:  This looks okay.  It does work to put pressure on the two white stones, but it can be cut!  Maybe K14.]
;W[mj];B[mh]C[Brodie:  This move is very easy to cut.];W[ng]

(;B[nh]C[Dennis: your P15 group is in danger
a bamboo joint at n14 might have been better.

Ben: I think you're right

Brodie:  N14, or M14 would both help the group out. Also what about the R16 group?  What I was thinking was Q16.]
;W[ne];B[nf];W[pf];B[nd];W[mf]
(;B[lg]C[Dennis: P15 is as good as dead - for the moment, which means m N14 group is fairly safe

the loose collection N15, O16 and N17 are now in danger.

M15 would rescue as many of them as possible.

Ben: You are right, I diddn't see that the P15 group was dead. :(]
;W[ld]
(;B[md]C[Dennis: again, M15 would have been better, I think (though I can't exactly say why)
bamboo joint, I guess

Brodie:  Yeah, bamboo joint.  White wouldn't be able to cut.  Black would either connect at O15 and bail himself out of trouble, or if white captures, simply play N16 on the NEXT move.  This would connect all of blacks stones.  They still might not be safe, depening on how white plays, but M15 is great! (see variation)]
;W[le]
(;B[ne]C[Dennis: cut your losses, let the three go to save the others.

stay away from thickness -- I haven't really known what that means before, but I think I can see it means don't makes moves towards your inside while I'm surrounding -- find a way to escape to the outside.

Ben: right again

Brodie:  Staying away from this kind of thickness is for a large part a matter of efficiency.  There are EIGHT stones in the O16 group now, and they have no room to make eyes.  They aren't really doing anything productive.  They're all in a large weak clump.  In contrast, the 3 stones in the bottom right corner K3, O3, and R4 are very efficient, mapping out much of the bottom and corner.  Those 3 stones do much more than the 8.  That's part of why to avoid thickness like that.  

One idea for a play might be M14...  (see variation)];W[mb]
C[Dennis: too late now :(];B[kj]C[Brodie: I still like M14 :-)]
;W[io];B[jo];W[jn];B[km]C[Brodie: I'd expect white to rush in at L6 or L7!]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[jj];B[jk];W[jl];B[kl];W[ik];B[kk];W[ji];B[ki]
;W[ml]C[Dennis: I'm attempting to use my aji (I still learning the meaning of that term, myself) here as a double threat

At this point I don't expect either of these two stones to live -- just to cause a lot of trouble, I hope.]

(;B[om]C[Ben: I probably should have forseen your attempt to link to your living group in the UR.  P12 might have hindered your attack much better.

Brodie:  I don't mind this play too much.  For me, I'd be a little worried of white jumping in around R7, so I think this is how I would play.]
;W[oh]C[Dennis: I'm not completely secure yet, but lets see how much more damage I can do]
;B[oi];W[ni]C[Dennis: using that aji to cause double threats]
;B[nj];W[pi];B[mi];W[qi]C[sacrifice my stone to gain a little more territory]

(;B[ri]C[Ben: I am not sure why I played here.  R10 would have been much better.

Brodie:  Yeah, this play isn't very good.  R10 would fix everything!!!]
;W[qj];B[lf]C[Dennis: nice forcing move

Ben: Again, I think I was deluding myself thinking that P15 group is not dead, or at least rescuable.]
;W[kd]
(;B[ig]C[Ben: This is an attempt to link up to my C13 group.

Brodie: Right now, white threatens to play at R9 or R8, which will reduce Black's territory quite a bit.  However, I think Black can easily kill the R11 group right now!!  Q12 forces white to connect at Q13, and then Black will play R9! (see variation )

Aside from that, the C13 group should be able to live on its own without too much trouble.  Instead of connecting to it, maybe it would be better to play B15, and try to make it bigger!!]
;W[gg];B[hh];W[hi];B[gf];W[hg]
(;B[ef]C[Ben: H14 might have been better?];W[hf]C[Brodie: actually, I kind of like the way this is going for Black.  There's a loose wall forming, and you could probably jump into the top and invade sometime if White isn't careful.]
;B[ie]C[Brodie I think G15 might be a little better.  This will just be cut anyway, so it doesn't make a lot of progress.  E13, or E16 might be a few other ideas.]
;W[he];B[if];W[ih];B[jh];W[gh]C[Ben: Dennis did a good job stopping me from linking.  I guess it was a rather far stretch.

Brodie: Splitting two living groups isn't very important.  Neither is connection them ^_^]
;B[ij]C[Ben: But like Dennis, now i want to cause some trouble. :)

Brodie:  ^_^   looks fun];W[hk]C[Brodie:  this is probably best for White]
;B[ii];W[je];B[kf];W[ff];B[eh];W[fh];B[ei];W[ej];B[dj];W[ee]
;B[eg]C[Brodie:  I'd prefer D14 ;-)];W[fe];B[ce]C[Ben: My side territory was expanded nicely.

Brodie:  sure was.  In part it was thanks to you attempt to connect earlier.]
;W[pk]C[Brodie:  this has been one of the larger spots on the board for sometime...  it should have been played out moves ago!]
;B[oj];W[ph];B[rj]C[Brodie:  For you group in the corner, maybe P18 or S15 would be good soon.]
;W[rk];B[rf]
(;W[rh]C[Brodie:  for white, I think S15 would be better now.]
;B[rg];W[qg];B[sh]C[Ben: And here is a big ko.  I think i ultimatly won in the end because i had more to gain by winning.

Brodie:  It wold have easier to just play S15 before White, that way you should be able to live, and not have to worry about fighting a ko.]
;W[re];B[qe];W[sj];B[qh];W[pd];B[pb];W[rd];B[qc];W[rh]C[Dennis: somewhere though here I think I mis played and almost lost the game to you here in the corner.

Ben: How so?];B[nb];W[nc];B[qh];W[lh];B[li];W[rh];B[in]C[Brodie:  Hmm, I don't think this is the greatest threat.  I feel white should connect right here.   The corner is worth much more.]
;W[im];B[qh];W[nk]
(;B[rh]C[Ben: I really should have played P18 and contiued the ko a few more turns and gotten some more territory.

Brodie: Yeah, I think P18 would have been good, but what happens if you don't win the ko?  Black is running a little low on ko threats.  M18,  maybe C17... there aren't many good ones left.]
;W[ok];B[ni]C[Dennsi: I've rescued my two stones that I long counted out for dead, now giving me the advantage (I think -- I'm still not very good at counting)

Ben: Now i was scared.  Dennis had a big wall at P9 and i had nothing but one stone at P7 to defend my territory.]
;W[ob];B[ql]C[Ben: Just to give me sente];W[qk];B[mm];W[qm]
;B[qn];W[pl];B[pm];W[rl]C[Brodie:  You did really well here to hold White back.]
;B[de];W[dd];B[rn];W[rm];B[jf];W[jd];B[rc]C[Dennis: That was good!

I waited far too late to get your S12 group. Now I can't.

Ben: I had counted liberties and was very nervous that you would kill my group.

Brodie: I agree, the group was in danger!];W[dl];B[dk];W[cm]
;B[bl];W[bm];B[en]C[Dennis: nice jump deep into enemy territory

you probably already know that you'll lose it eventually, but it helped you later on to reduce my territory by much more than I would have liked :)

Ben: thanks. I figgured i would prevent you from making that getta shape which is very strong.  It threatens to cut at D7, as well as possibly rescuing the long dead J6 stone.

Brodie:  I really like it too! This is great];W[fn];B[fo];W[gn]
;B[ip]C[Dennis: Right there! nice cut into my moyo -- reducing me by quite a bit.

Ben: That's the plan ;)];W[ho];B[hp];W[gp];B[go];W[hn];B[fp]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[hr];B[ir];W[gs]C[Brodie:  This is turning out really well.  Instead of J1, which wasn't very urgent, I think you might have been able to have some more fun with the cut at D7  ^_^]

(;B[is]C[Ben: I was actually a little dissapointed that i diddn't get more of your territory. You did a good job defending.]

(;B[ac]C[Ben: would C17 have worked? see variation.

Result: W+24.5

Ben: that's it.  I think Dennis played very well.  I made a few big mistakes like not realizing when that group was dead, which cost me many bad moves.  thanks again for reviewing our game.

Brodie:  Your game was very interesting, and very well played.  There was just that one problem with the group at the top, like you said.  I think the problem started a little before the group was dead though.  

and Hey!  Jumping to the middle from the very beginning (back at move 15)  might have saved you from all that trouble  ;-)

One thing to watch out for might be playing too many weak connections.  With your group at the top again, you left white far too many chances to cut

I hope this helps! :-)]N[RESULT])
