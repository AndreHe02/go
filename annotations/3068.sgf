C[Hello,

I am very proud of this game, one of my strongest in which I've made better use of attention to life and death and cutting points than before, but I'm sure that my play will show me working under some flawed assumptions.  I realize that my strength at depth reading isn't very strong, but I believe that I am at a point in my development where general tactical advice will still be useful....thank you for your time and patience.  Ohh this game was played at 10/10 with .5 point komi and I played black.  My opponent is 14 k and I am about 19k.

Hello Nathan ;)

my comments will be enclosed in < >

<You are right when you say "that my play will show me working under some flawed assumptions".

 My general impression about this game is that you took a bad start in the opening (fuseki), fought back with a lot of  slackness from White part, with a life-and-death problem missed by both players, and errors in direction. In other words, florxalba should benefit more from the review as he should have won easily.

 Concerning tactical advices, I mentionned the tsumego problem in the lower right corner. A good tactical move with a big impact strategically would have been "getting ahead of two stones" from your U.L. group. At the cross point from two groups , it can make a big difference.
Another move, wich required a little reading will be pointed later (move 21).  

These moves were played (or not played) mainly during the opening. It means that these mistakes are strategy-related. With a more global view of the position, they tend to decrease]

 Sliding to C2 could be an option to seek eye space, at the expense of  strengthening White on the top and on the outside. Another option would be the attachment at C2. Jumping, to D14 for instance, would invite a chasing attack in front of the squared stones, reinforcing White on the left and on the top
