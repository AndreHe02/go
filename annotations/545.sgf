Hello and thank You already.

This is one of my (alias 'mk') first games in IGS, but I have
played
and studied go before joining to IGS. I claimed my rank to be
17k, but in
IGS it is slightly lower (somewhere between 18k-22k).

My opponent 'hake' is 18k*.

If you don't want to dive deep into this game, while it is merely
one of
enthustiasted beginners game, my big questions about the game
are:

- How to prevent opponent from surrounding such a big area (whole
right
side)

- How to play Fuseki so that after about 20 moves the game is
in equal
position. I know some basic corner Josekis (hoshi, komoku, sansan),
but I
concentrate too much in protecting the corners and not the sides.
I also
feel that I give too many protection moves to the opponent.


Sincerely Yours,

Marko

RM: Marko, I think you need to be bold! In this game you had
the opportunity to split up the left and right hand groups, but
instead defended your already strong groups. E.g. see comments
for moves 6, 14 and 20.

You should also avoid local responses too often. Always check
the whole board position before each move - easy for me to say
:-)   see comment for moves 78 and 82.

Enjoy your future games!

;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp]
(;W[cq]C[RM: Because of whites upper position consider a different joseki.
By pincering at C8 the left hand side will become promising for
white.]
(;B[ci]C[RM: Overplay, should be C9. This makes many useful moves sente
for white (e.g. C8, C9, C13, B3)]
(;W[jq]C[RM: Wrong. White's lower group is already safe. Use your strength
to attack your opponent. Then whilst attacking you can make terratory.
Note also that K3 is not urgent. If black gets to play on the
right hand side, he will have a large moyo. Consider playing
R9 before it is too late ...];B[qk]C[RM: Good timing, but a little inefficient. This is where white
could have played to make a base. I think black should play Q8
or Q9  here, as R9 is a little low and so does not make as much terratory
as it could.

Black is far ahead already.];W[mc]C[RM: Not sente. Compare with C13. For example , white can exchange
wC13, bD9 and then return the wN17.];B[cf]C[RM: White is clearly behind now, and black as few weaknesses
to exploit.]
(;W[de]C[RM: Not required, playing elsewhere (Tenuki) better.

Perhaps a brave invasion around C8 is called for ...];B[df]
;W[ee]C[RM: Again this move is unneccessary. C8 is still possible.]

;W[if];B[hf];W[ie];B[gh];W[he]C[RM: Not urgent. White must save the center group instead.]
;B[fg]C[RM: Forcing white to atari must be bad for black.];W[gf]
;B[hh];W[ff]C[RM: No point in playing here. White must avoid playing local
moves automaticaly. Before every move check the whole board position.
Here the J8 group must be saved!];B[eg]C[RM: Black could not respond to white's F14, but attack white's
center group.];W[in];B[hn];W[im];B[ho];W[io];B[en]C[RM: Black's stratagy of calmly taking terratory is sensible.]

(;W[kr]C[RM: Wrong style. This sort of error is important to avoid. It
is a gote sequence. Black gain one or two extra points but forces
blacks defence to attack white. The correct local move for white
is k2. K2 is sente because it threatens the "Monkey Jump" invasion.]

trouble, or allow the light D6 stone to be captured whilst the
C8 stones escapes into the middle.

C8 will reduce blacks terratory dramaticaly.])))

(;W[cg]C[RM: Black must defend, whilst white gains terratory. Note that
C16 is now fulfiling two purposes. It is helping to take terratory
at the top AND the side AND toward the center. This multi-functionality
