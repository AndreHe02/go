;B[pp]TR[sa][rb][qc][pd][oe][nf][mg][lh][ki][jj][kj][lj][mj]
[nj][oj][pj][qj][rj][sj]C[It's considered polite to play the first stone in the marked area.]
;W[dd];B[cq];W[pd];B[dj]LB[pj:C][pp:A][cq:B]C[There is a difference between A (played on 4-4) and B (on 3-3). A has a lot of influence, but doesn't claim real territory (white can still invade at the 3-3 point). B does claim territory, but hasn't a lot of outward influence.

I would rather play at C, because it builds from the influence oriented stone.]
;W[iq]
(;B[jd]LB[lq:B][mq:A]C[What about A? It does two things at the same time (something to look out for): pressuring the white stone (and robbing it from it's good extension B), and making a good extension from your corner stone. See variation.]
;W[fq];B[ep]LB[dn:B][do:A]C[These diagonal moves are very aggressive, and normally used when you want to settle a weak stone. In your situation the white group is weaker than your group when you would play at A or B, because you have the support of the corner.

You are giving white the opportunity to start a fight, which will make both of you stronger. Because white was weaker to begin with, he will profit most.]
;W[lq]C[White plays a too defensive move.];B[nq]LB[qm:C][pn:B]
[qn:A]C[I would like to play at A, B or C. White's bottom group has become strong, and you shouldn't play near a strong group, because there is not much to win there. On the right side, on the other hand, there is a lot of ground to be made.]
;W[qn]C[Look here what happens. White doesn't have to defend his bottom group, so he gets the opportunity to attack you from the other side, getting strong influence at the right side at the same time.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[pi]TR[pn][qn]C[Playing one line lower would be a little bit better probably. The perfect extension from a wall is the amount of stones + 1. Thus the perfect extension from the marked white stones is Q10 or R10. Because of that reason I would like to play there as black.]
;W[qj];B[qi]C[Extending is often the good reaction to a diagonal attack. Another possibility would be Q10, stressing influence and keeping white low.]
;W[pj];B[pf]TR[oj]C[I like the hane at the head of two stones (P10) better. It puts pressure on white, gaining strength for the black stones. Afterwards the attack on the upper right will be possible with more power.]
;W[nc];B[gd];W[fc];B[dg]C[I would like to answer the diagonal move of F17. F16 seems to be a good possibiltiy.

Your stones at the left are stronger than your stones at the top, so I would like to play at the top.]
;W[cf];B[cg];W[bf];B[bg];W[dm];B[cl]C[Again: you stones in the middle left are stronger than your stones in the lower left, so I would play from the bottom (C6 for example).]
;W[cm];B[co]C[Now you need a stone here. Your position is more cramped that when you would have played C6 earlier.]
;W[fm];B[bl]C[It would be better to move out with your bottom group. In that way, you would make it difficult for white's group to connect to the bottom, and you will strengthen your group.]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[do];B[dp];W[eo];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[fn];B[go]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[hm];B[ip];W[jp];B[io];W[hq];B[jo];W[kp];B[ko]
;W[lo]C[Now that you have built a wall, why won't you try to push the weak white group at F7 to it, gaining a lot above it. See the example.]

(;B[mp]TR[ro]C[This doesn't do much. Playing at the marked spot is big.]
;W[lp];B[mo]C[You are pushing white into the center, where you have more influence than he has.]
;W[ln];B[nn];W[nm];B[om];W[on];B[mm];W[nl];B[mn];W[gj]C[Ouch, this makes a big difference. You would have liked to play here yourself.]
;B[fi];W[fj];B[ej];W[ek];B[dk]C[D8 would have given you better shape.]
;W[dl];B[ck]C[Now you are forced to make two empty triangles.]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[kc];B[jl]C[You should defend your two stones at the top. When white cuts them off, for example by playing at E14, they will have a difficult time.]
;W[jm];B[km];W[kn];B[lm];W[il];B[jk];W[qe];B[qf];W[oi];B[oh]
;W[ni];B[nh];W[ne];B[of];W[oe];B[mh];W[jf];B[jc]C[White's move seems to be an overplay. I would try to cut the stone from the other white stones, for example L15. 

Your move doesn't do a lot, because both your stones at the top are on the fourth line. White can get under them from both sides.]
;W[kd];B[gc];W[fd];B[fb];W[eb];B[gb];W[dr];B[eq]C[This is too late. C2 would be simpler.]
;W[er];B[cr];W[lj];B[pl]C[Instead of saving your lone stone, I would try to strengthen your top group. K15, for example.]
;W[ol];B[pm];W[ql];B[qm];W[rm];B[rl];W[qk];B[rn];W[pk]C[Your stones stould no chance. You only have strengthened the white group;]
;B[sm];W[qm];B[ro];W[op];B[oq];W[po];B[qq];W[mq];B[fr]C[This move doesn't help. You can better save moves like this for a ko-fight.]
;W[gq];B[mi];W[mj];B[ki];W[li];B[lh];W[kh];B[kj];W[jh];B[fe]
C[Finally a move that strengthens your top group. A move at G15 would have been more solid. When white cut's at G15, you will have a problem.]
;W[ee];B[ff];W[df];B[ec];W[ed];B[dc];W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[da]
;W[ca];B[ea]TR[rf][ri]C[Now you have secured your top group, but you have ended in gote (that means: it's white's turn). White can choose a big point now.]
;W[ag]C[Luckily, this is small.];B[ah];W[af];B[bi];W[gg];B[fg]
;W[gh]
(;B[np]C[This is not needed. See variation.];W[oo]TR[kb][re]
C[White is only defending one stone. You are lucky he doesn't play a big move.]

;W[ih];B[ij];W[hk];B[lf]C[If you really want to fight, cut at L15.]

[rr][sr][as][bs][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[You had some good fighting in the end, which brought you close.

In the beginning you lost ground because:

- you played from your strong groups instead of from your weak groups,
- you didn't mind your weak groups enough.

When you will become better in recognizing the weak groups and playing accordingly, you will get a lot better.]
