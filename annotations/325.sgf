comments, where Black lost the advantage later on];W[bd];B[bc]
C[Black should defend the cut at B14 and keep the two stones!
After Black B14, white can jump into the corner with B18 (white has to
play B17), but that is not so important. keeping a foot on the left
side is important. After Black B13 (instead of B14) white could start
a Ko];W[bf];B[ad];W[dg]C[This was quite a success for White]
;B[cn];W[cp]C[White C5 would be better. C4 makes it to easy for black to get
a base. White should then use his thickness around D13 to attack the
black stones];B[ck]C[Good. Black succeeded in getting a base. There is no good way
for White anymore to use his thickness around D13];W[lp];B[lo]
C[L5 (Kosumi) is better (also K6 is probably better). Touching
the week white stone strengthens white];W[kp]C[Instead of looking for safety White should probably play N5
(if then Black N4 then White L5 and L4, if Black L5 then White O4 or N6)]
;B[ko];W[jq];B[iq]C[Good!];W[ip];B[jo];W[ir];B[hq];W[gq];B[hp]
;W[hr];B[ho];W[kr]C[Black got nice influence toward the center. I think N4 is
quite an urgent move now.];B[me]C[I do not like that move at all. You are forcing white into
your moyo. I would rather play something like M14 or L14 to get a
really big moyo starting from your territoryy on the right side. I do
not see a good way for white to reduce a moyo of that scale. These
moves also threaten to invade whites moyo on the top.];W[nf]
;B[md];W[nd];B[ng]C[It seems, that you are realizing your mistake here: you give
away your two bad stones at N15/N16, and rather build a moyo. But
whites territorry at the top gets one line larger (and you helped
white to eliminate all weaknesses with N15/N16];W[mf];B[lg]
;W[lf];B[kg];W[kf];B[jg];W[if];B[mp]C[Good move. Black still has a clear lead]
;W[ig];B[ji];W[in];B[io];W[il]C[This situation is quite an important decision point. The
theory says: as you are strong on the right side, you have to attack
the invasion stones from the other side, and push them toward your
strength. I agree: you need a lot of courage to do so, your thoughts
might be: if I push him into my moyo, if he survives, he will erase
it. But: even if he survives, he will live very small, and what ever
he erases, you will get back on the other side (in the area
A10-H10-H6-A6). In reality I think you are so strong there, that he
has no chance to survive.
As I am an influence player myself, I am very often in a similar
situation, and I am playing more and more often from the other
side. So I would propose G11 or G10 or even H10. But your move still
should give you enough to win, as your lead was enormous. I think
after your next move you still got a small lead. But: Please
experiment with the idea, to attack from the other side];B[kl]
;W[ii];B[ij];W[jj];B[jk];W[kj];B[ih]C[This move is not good. You are strengthening white. after the
white extension, white has threats like L11 or the cut at J9 in
reserve. This is quite risky. Play quietly L11 to defend your weakness
and wait for the next white action. Will it be an atari against your
J9 stone? this would help you. Depending on his move you might have to
decide from which side you want to give atari against J11. Keep this
decision open.];W[hi];B[hj]C[Now white has a sequence like L11 followed by N13. This
sequence doesnt quite work yet. White should cut at J9 and keep the
sequence in reserve. Or play G11 threatening J9 and L11];W[hh]
C[White helps you defending against the L11 thread.];B[ki]C[Good! This saved the situation (thanks to whites weak move H12)]
;W[mg];B[li];W[mh];B[mi];W[ni];B[nj]C[Well played];W[gj];B[ik]
C[The black move G9 would be much stronger. Thanks to your last
moves you have nothing to worry about. Are you afraid of  (starting
with black) G9-J9-H9-L9-K8? But after that the white stones have not
enough liberties to do something that could worry you. If you are
afraid to loose your black groups K13-M13 and K11-N11: In the worst
case (which is not really necessary) you could easily give away the  group K13-M13, and only keep the other one. This is far smaller, then  what a move G9 would achieve. If white plays H9 after G9 the situation
is similar as in the game, but better (H9 forces you to make the move
J9 which you wanted to do anyway. But the white group has more
weaknesses after that)];W[gl];B[bi];W[hk];B[jl]C[This is quite a small move, it is not really necessary. N2 (or
even better: M2) would be far larger. Other option: B5, as both of you
would like to play that in sente. Other option: Q18];W[mq];B[lq]
;W[kq];B[nq];W[mr];B[nr];W[bm];B[bn];W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[cl]
;W[ci];B[cj];W[bh];B[aj];W[bk];B[bl];W[bp];B[ej];W[pb];B[qb]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qa];B[se]C[This is quite a big endgame mistake. You should of course play
S19. White must play Q19 and you play T18. White can not play S18
after S19. You just take with Q19 and white has no follow-up
move. You lost this game in the endgame.];W[rb];B[rf];W[rc]
;B[qf];W[ns];B[os];W[ms];B[pr];W[jm];B[hm];W[hl];B[km];W[hn]
C[here is a point, where you should count.
Whites sure points: 46 points (up to row 15) on the upper side. 4
points on the left side. 29 points on the lower edge is 80.5 points
(if you include the Komi).  You got 86 points on the right side. 5
points at the left upper corner and 7 points on the left side. 103
sure points (including prisoners).  Black can make about 10 more points around F12 about 10
more points around F6 and 4 more points by playing T17. The counting
might be wrong by 3 or 4 points but it seems
you cannot loose this game anymore. just move into one area:  either the area around F6 or around F12. And play calmly to the
end. Counting could give you here the confidence to play in a calm
way.];B[fi]C[Good! my first instinct would be to play G5 (partly to keep a
little aji of the stone H7, which otherwise you playd for nothing).  But F11 might even be bigger.]
;W[go];B[fn]C[UUh! a very bad move. This is the kind of move somebody might
try, if he is far behind (even then it is bad). What were you thinking
here? D6 is a move white wants to make anyway. you just gave him the
oportunity to make this move. you are helping your oponent. To attack
you must cut at G5 and G11 and even then white can still connect
around F8. white will not allow you to do anything serious here.
I would
count that move as a loss of about 5 points. Reasoning: If you would play
your Gote sequence starting with F13 directly (omitting F6): after the
sequence White will probably come back here anyway to play D6, and you
would have sente again compared to gote in the real game)
which is probably worth about 5 points. Locally Black D6  takes away a lot of points from White. But F13 is bigger]
;W[dn];B[fg];W[ff];B[gg];W[gf];B[hg];W[jh];B[hf]C[you still got the lead. Compared to the calculation we had
before black gained about 10 additional sure points around F6. so for
sure points it is now 103:90.5. white can still make some additional
points, but you still should have a sure win.];W[he];B[gi]C[This does not look like a very big move to me. I agree: cutting
means, that you will have attacking moves, and that always gives some
points. But if you counted, you knew: you are winning without heavy
attacks. Moves like A14 or T17(T17 is about 4 points in gote) are
sufficient to ensure your win. You should play a relaxed style
now. But OK: G11 is not a bad move.];W[gn]C[That is far to defensive. Especially as white is behind, he
should look for a more profitable way to make the cut at G6
harmless. E.g. playing F10 followed by E9. But you might help him
doing these moves later anyway :-)];B[jf];W[je];B[kh];W[oi]
;B[og];W[ih];B[gh];W[ie];B[mj]C[Please: in a close game like this: before you do a move like
that, check if it is really necessary. If it is not necessary, a move
like that costs sente, which is worth at least 4 points now. Here it
is not necessary as long as you have the extra liberty at M12. Do you
fear white N10? how is the white continuation after your obvious M10
(double atari!) response?];W[ah];B[ak]C[Correct would be A11. Your move gives away 2 points of
territorry (B10 and A9). Be more accurate in the endgame! This will
give you 5-20 more points at the end in every game. A11 looks
dangerous. But calculate it! What are the possible attacks of white?
(A9,A8,A7). Can you answer all these moves? yes! so play A11]
;W[ek];B[dj];W[fj];B[fk];W[gk];B[ei]C[Now the game is nearly over. If you do the count properly, you
also find out, where still points are, which are not safe territorry
yet.
The count. white: 45 above, 4 left, 45 below, 1.5 komi. gives
95.5. White can get 4 more points by playing T17. white should do that
now. so one should count 99.5 points for white. Black: 4 prisoners,
89 points on the right, 6 points left side, 5 points left above. Gives
104 points. I told you before, where you lost the 10+x lead, you had,
when we last counted.];W[jn]C[White is taking away the small sente move, you would have had
here. (which should have been your right). this would be ok, if T17
would not still be open];B[do]C[Now you must play S19 (or T17). Do you see how this takes away
territorry from white? he will have no eye in the corner and will have
to fill Q19. Let me be more accurate: you should play some sente moves
first: D9 and A14 (mybe A5), then you play S19.  In addition: your move is a 2 point loss in sente.  you just hand one more prisoner to white. without it
you might be able to play C5 later. I guess you might this move for a
psychological reason: you invested quite a number of moves in a
possible attack of whites H8 group. But instead of vasting more moves
for that: leave it alone.];W[co];B[el]C[this is another two point loss in sente]
;W[dk];B[kn]C[This is only one point in Gote! (ok it is reverse sente, so it
is not the smallest move around, but still...];W[ao]C[White is also not playing the biggest moves]
;B[af]C[Good!];W[bg];B[eh]C[if you want: this is the loosing move. it is one point in
Gote. S19 wins. probablay also C19 wins (which is also only one point,
but it threatens to give about 2 more points, if white doesnt answer)]
;W[ai];B[bj];W[an];B[am];W[ag];B[ae];W[sc]C[Finally white played the winning gote move]
;B[sd]C[Zero points in Gote. C19 is bigger];W[ca];B[ba];W[ea]
;B[bo];W[ap];B[dh];W[cg]C[Black: 89 + 14 = 103

White: 92 + 11 + 1.5 = 104.5

White wins by 1.5])
