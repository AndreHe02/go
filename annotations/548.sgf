(;B[go]C[White can still invade the bottom right but won't do very much against black's strong position.  Maybe taking the corner is white's best bet.  Black also has the reducing positions at F15 and H11.  The rest of the fight on the bottom left here looked like maybe both sides were playing quickly.  There are still big moves for white and black.  The connection at 71 I think is a very simple and nice play that really solidifies black's position.  Black can play big moves like M6.  White can only invade the 3-3 or Q12.  Both of which leave Black very strong.]
