AB[dp][dd][pp][pd]C[ Dear Reviewer:

I am an AGA 5 kyu whose rating has been tediously stable, even
slightly declining, for a long time.  I would like to identify my
habitual mistakes in the hope of making fewer of them in future :)

This turned out to be a close game.  I lost by half a point.
If you could say where I made both strategic and tactical errors,
I would be very appreciative.

One problem is that I have no clue what to do with influence
on those rare occasions when I manage to acquire it.  Any hints
along these lines would be very helpful.

Sincerely,
             Rick Mott]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[ob];W[qf]C[Black gave me an opportunity here, I thought.

[orionsky\]:
OK, this seems to be a good way to take advantage of black's slow moves.]
;B[qd];W[oe]C[Gave me a shot at sealing black in.];B[hd];W[qb]
C[Too soon for a placement?  I probably should have kept this in
reserve until my outside position was stronger.

[orionsky\]:
This is obviously premature. One way to improve is to become more patient: The possibility to play at R18 will still be there later (aji) and if black prevents it, he lost a move. Either way is better than immediatly losing these stones.]
;B[rc];W[rb];B[re];W[rf];B[nb];W[mb];B[qc];W[pb];B[sd];W[od]
;B[pc];W[sb];B[pa];W[qe];B[qa]LB[pe:a]C[Oops, a liberty or two short. :)

[orionsky\]:
In retrospect this sequence can be regarded as a success since black is now completely sealed in. However, there remains a serious cut at a (Q15).]
;W[qn]LB[qk:a]C[Should this have been high kikari to balance better with the upper
right influence?  Or should I have played on the left side in the
big area?

[orionsky\]:
I would have played here too. It combines well with the influence in the UR corner but it may be too far for an even game. The "honest" move would rather be around a (R9).   A high kakari has the disadvantage that there is no good continuation in the corner (3-3 does not work well).]
;B[pj]LB[on:a][np:b][nj:c]C[[orionsky\]:
Nice opportunity for white to play at a (P6). If black defends the corner, white will cap the lone black stone at c (O10). If black defends his invasion, the corner will be sealed at b (O4).]
;W[nq]C[I felt I had to ignore Q7 and hope to catch it between two walls
after the lower right was finished.  But it's on the 4th line,
so it can run out easily.  Hard to play influence in a 4-stone
game :)];B[qq];W[oo]C[Black obligingly lets me confine him again.

[orionsky\]:
The game goes very well for white.];B[po];W[pn];B[op];W[np]
;B[oq]C[[orionsky\]:
Very bad moves by black, never push into a knight's move when you don't want to cut!]
;W[nj]LB[on:a][fq:b]C[So I can at least try to throw a scare into him, but this felt
like an overplay and didn't work out well.  What would have
been better?

[orionsky\]:
Again patience is called for. I would protect my cuts at a (P6) and see how black will proceed. If he runs out with his stone at Q10, building new influence at b (F3) is good.]
;B[oi]LB[mh:a][pe:b]C[[orionsky\]:
White should play at a (N12) for better shape. Furthermore, white would then have time to protect the cut at b (Q15), should this become necessary.]
;W[ni];B[oh];W[mf]LB[of:a]C[Strange move.  Trying to support upper wall and keep black in.

[orionsky\]:
It seems better to defend at a (P14) and let black out. This would leave less aji and black still has a hard time.]
;B[ol]C[Looks good, but white can cut.];W[ok];B[pk];W[pl];B[ql]
;W[pm]C[Now black has to live inside.  I was unable to prevent this.
I got a really nice wall, though.  It was almost enough :)]
;B[rl];W[rj]C[Try to take away an eye, but maybe R11 or S11 would be better.

[orionsky\]:
Only move if white wants to kill.];B[rh];W[qh];B[rg]LB[ri:a]
C[[orionsky\]:
Very risky, a (S11) makes a simple life.]
(;W[qg]C[This move may be wrong.  B (R11) works, I think, but it's tricky.
Is my analysis of the variation correct?];B[ri];W[nl]LB[qi:a]
[qj:b][sf:c]C[Could have taken R11 in sente first, I think.  I was concerned
with making the wall solid.

[orionsky\]:
The sequence white a (R11), black b (R10), white c (T14) seems very important since it maintains blacks shortage of liberties in the corner and black still needs to live.]
;B[qi];W[fp]C[Where is the best place to go?  Should this have been somewhere
on the left side instead?  I thought to approach the single
stone and build some moyo potential from the wall.

[orionsky\]:
Again this move is very good.];B[eq];W[cn]LB[fq:a]C[Probably bad, F3 or E6 better?

[orionsky\]:
Indeed, this move is very bad! Your main achievement in this game is your middle moyo and with C6 you invite black to undermine it. Consequently you should play at a (F3)]
;B[fq];W[gp];B[gq];W[hq];B[hr];W[iq];B[ir];W[jq]C[So much for bottom moyo :)]
;B[dn]C[[orionsky\]:
Good move by black.];W[co];B[do];W[bq];B[cq];W[cp];B[cr];W[br]
LB[cl:a]C[Small, should play outside somewhere.

[orionsky\]:
Yes, should rather be at a (C8).];B[fn];W[gn];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl]
;W[cf]C[I was unsure what to do at this point, how to make best use
of the influence, so I jumped into a big open area.  Was there
something better?];B[bo];W[bn];B[bl]C[[orionsky\]:
Now the game is suddenly difficult for white.];W[ao];B[el];W[fc]
C[This seemed like a good idea at the time, but maybe 4th
line would be better?

[orionsky\]:
Hm, it is rather your stone at C14 than black's that is in danger]

the stones...];B[pe];W[ci]C[got sente to try to live inside.  Was this a good idea?
Should I have reduced with some play around G9-G10-G11
instead?

[orionsky\]:
Reduction does not seem to be enough but if black now plays at a (B15), the matter is also settled.]
;B[gi];W[hi];B[gj];W[hj];B[ce];W[fk]C[Would hane at G9 be better?

[orionsky\]:
Yes, since the two white stones at C14/C11 are dead.];B[gk]

could destroy my center territory.  Now I'm in trouble.
Where did I go wrong (first)?

[orionsky\]:
The first mistake was surely not to block at F3
So maybe its a good idea for black to kill white at a (B12)? :)
