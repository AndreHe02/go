seppos: Comments to the rewiever: This was a long (about 2 hours)
and interesting game with my friend neWay. He is at least a bit
better player than me and usually wins our games. But this game
was very close to the end and I managed to win this by 3.5 points.
I felt that the game was finally decided at the endgame. I wrote
comments, thoughts and questions about some moves to give some
ideas what i was thinking about the game. :)

Thanks in advance, seppos

Hi seppos:

I thought you had a good game until your blunder #67.  Fortunately,
W did not fully take advantage of your mistake and were able
to recover.

The game was close going into the endgame and the lead kept switching
back and forth - luckily, you came out ahead in the end.];B[cp]
C[*neWay*(10:40:18): kah mä sulle sitä samaa toitotan.

seppos: Traditional response to finnish good luck's wish. ;)]
;W[oq]C[N: FYI, the MFGO opening (pro) library has 44 games (of 6000)
with this position and...];B[qp]LB[dc:A]C[...none have this response :)  The most common move was at A.]

;W[qq];B[rp];W[qe]LB[ep:A]C[N: Maybe it's just me, but I'd prefer to play around A.]
;B[dc]C[seppos: I didn't know how to properly approach white's thickness
at upper side, so I decided to take the last corner. Would F3
have been all right?

N: I would've played D17 also.  More often than not, occupying
a corner is big.]
(;W[fp]LB[ep:A]C[N: I'm not sure if I would have played this.  I would have played
at A and invite B to make a pincer (and possible overplay) and
then try and seize the initiative.  See variations.];B[eq]C[seppos: I thought it's hard to pincer F4, so I decided to go
for profit instead.

N: Looks good to me:)];W[fq];B[ep];W[fo];B[jp]C[seppos: Now I couldn't resist the pincer. :)

N: This looks more like an invasion than a pincer :)]
(;W[lq]LB[jn:A]C[N: I can't recommend this move.  Playing at A looks better.  Or perhaps leaning on the corner group first then playing A-see
var.];B[hp]LB[jn:A]C[N: I think the one-space jump to A is better]
;W[dn];B[bn]LB[cn:A]C[seppos: B6 is low but secures the corner?

N: I would've play the same move.  Playing at A is too dangerous.]
;W[pc]LB[in:A]C[seppos: Is this proper move, because battle is still going on
at upper side?

N: You're right - W has to play around A and get an attack going
(or seize the initiative).];B[im]LB[eo:A][fn:B]C[seppos: I thought that was good move, strengthening my weak group
and weakening white's.

N: Excellent.  If you want to be agressive and start a fight,
push at A and then cut at B!];W[gn]C[N : A must.];B[lo]LB[dl:A]
TR[im][hp][jp]C[seppos: Odd-looking move but I couldn't find better. :)

N: This doesn't look right.  What I'm thinking is that W's stones
want to move out, so B should play around A.  Your marked stones
are light and you be easy to take care of.];W[kp];B[ko];W[jq]
;B[ip];W[gl];B[jd]C[seppos: I felt that move would have been too big for white, but
still I was uncomfortable because my upper side group was quite
weak.

N: Again, I would've played the same move.  I have a hard time
seeing how W can attack your group and make profit at the same
time.];W[ld];B[di]C[N: The board looks better for B.];W[jn]
;B[in]C[N: W 40 looks more like a thank-you move than a forcing move.]

(;W[pj]TR[im][in][ko][lo][jp][ip][hp]C[seppos: Both I and neWay thought after game that this move was
too near black 's strength. neWay thought that Q11 would have
been better.

N: Agreed, and 42 leaves an "open-skirt".  I'm not sure that
I would have played Q11 though.  To me, W's plan of action should
somehow involve an attack on B's marked group (which is difficult
for me to think of!).

I'll put in some variations for thought's sake.];B[gi]LB[gj:A]
TR[oi][pi][ph][oh][og][pg][pf][of][oe][pe][ne][nf][ng][nh][ni]
[mi][mh][mg][mf][me]C[seppos: I liked this move. :)

N: Good move, I would've played at A myself.  I'd want the fight
to head into W's marked area, and make W 42 look really bad.
On the other hand, W42 could end up helping in the attack :)]
;W[hk]
(;B[km]LB[jk:A]TR[jn]C[N: Solid move.  A would put more pressure on W and hopes to capture
the marked stone on a larger scale.];W[jl];B[jm];W[de]
(;B[cd]LB[ce:A]C[seppos: This seems good..

N: What's wrong with A?];W[ce];B[cg]C[seppos: ...but I'm not sure about that. Maybe F17 and getting
profit while attacking would have been better?

N: you're right F17 is better, the result in the next few moves
are painful for B.];W[ec]C[seppos: Expected attachment...];B[ed]
;W[dd];B[cc]TR[gi][jd]C[seppos: I thought that I can handle this fight because it is
in my moyo.

N: However your marked stones are not that strong.];W[fc];B[ee]
;W[ef];B[gd];W[fd]C[seppos: This starts white's sacrifice sequence.]
;B[fe];W[ge];B[ff];W[gf];B[fg];W[hd]TR[jd]SQ[hk][gl][gn][dn]
[fo][fp][fq]C[seppos: So, black gets a lot of profit, but white gets a very
nice position. Fair trade?

N: Sorry, seppos, I think this trade is much better for White.
If we go back to W48, W was invading your moyo.  He not only
reduced it but he made profit and built a moyo himself.  Your
marked stone is also left stranded.  Lastly, W's marked group
has not been significantly weakened.

This board position now favors W.];B[hc]C[seppos: I hallucinated when I did this move, I thought white
cannot hane at J17. Very very bad reading. :(


N: Even professionals hallucinate at times:)];W[ic]C[seppos: And of course white punished.]
;B[jc];W[hb]LB[ib:A]C[N: This looks a little passive - why not descend to A?  This
would have made it harder for B to deal with.];B[ib];W[gc];B[lb]
;W[lc];B[kb];W[mb]C[seppos: Horrible shape for black.];B[id]
;W[hc]LB[ig:A]C[N: I would've played A instead.];B[if];W[hg]
;B[kf];W[ke]LB[lf:A]C[N: Bad move, it ends up peeping at a bamboo joint.  Might as
well play at A first.];B[jf];W[lf]
(;B[ji]LB[lg:A]C[N: Playing at A looks better for it does 2 things - reduces W's
area and is a leaning attack against his group.

However, it seems you have recovered quite a bit from you blunder
of B67.];W[lh]C[seppos: D18 now would have killed white... but also white would
have been able to cut black's lower group and white would have
won resulting semeai? So I hoped white would answer my next move...

N: Sometimes, hope is not enough:)];B[kh];W[db]C[seppos: But he decided to live. :)]
;B[cb];W[eb];B[be];W[hi];B[hj];W[ij];B[hh];W[gj];B[gh];W[da]
C[seppos: Endgame move?

N: Hmm...I think W can live without it.];B[li];W[mh];B[qi]C[seppos: Now Q10 was really bad positioned.

N: This is painful for W.];W[qj];B[rj];W[rh];B[ri];W[cl];B[qh]
;W[er];B[dr];W[fr];B[rg]C[seppos: neWay thought after game that he should have stopped
my reduction to lower left earlier.

N: I think B is leading by a few points (the endgame is not my
strongest area).];W[cr]C[seppos: ... but he had some plans against my corner.]

at A?]
