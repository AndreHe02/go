C[nomad380 [?\]: Hi
Oslito: Hello, I will try to make review for white, I will start everytime with O: , please look for comments also in variants, have a good time :)
Also, I'm sorry for my level of english :)

The review is made up to move 108.

I hope it will be usable for you, if you have any question let me know.

In general: 
In opening: try to play in open areas
In whole game: try to see oportunities to take sente and play in big point in other areas of board
In fight: try to control numbers of liberties of each group.

and..... solve problems, like from www.goproblems.com 

and play, play, play.... and enjoy greatest game over the world :) Good Luck!]

(;W[jd]C[O: It is often better to play on 3rd line, when it is open to enemy stone... and connect on 4th line... to have shapes closed on ends at 3rd line... with possible territory maped on 4th line.]
;B[pj]
(;W[nc]C[O: Good, it finish the shape, but.... there is big open area on the left...]
