C[I'm StarryEyed, playing black. IGS rates me at 26k but I don't
have the * yet. This was probably my longest and hardest fought
game to date.];B[pp];W[dd];B[dq];W[pd];B[fd]C[you started a ONE-SPACE HIGH APPROACH to the star point]
;W[df]C[w one space jump];B[ic]C[the joseki play is k17];W[mc]
C[white is expanding but not to hard];B[ec]C[the joseki move is d17]
;W[dc];B[co];W[cj]C[both players are makeing good moves];B[di]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[bi];B[dj];W[ck];B[ff]C[I'm reasonably happy with all moves so far. Am I right?]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[qn];W[kp]C[W extension seems short. Star point or further?]
;B[qf]C[Preferred this to extending lower left because I anticipated
w corner play then strong extension on right.];W[qe];B[ph]C[Afraid to extend longer.]
;W[pj];B[pl];W[nj];B[qj]C[Happy with this outcome.];W[gq];B[hp]
C[i see you like the sholder hit];W[hq];B[gp];W[iq];B[fq];W[qq]
C[w is going for the 3x3 point];B[qp]C[Corner was enclosed, but W threatened connection underneath.
Could I have played at Q3? Probably not. I think beginners tend
to play 3-3 invasions too early, though this one seems smart.
What's the right response for B?];W[or];B[pq];W[pr];B[rq];W[rr]
;B[qr];W[qs];B[nh]C[Fighting ko over such piddling territory seemed unwise. 47 felt
better than O8 for attacking W stones on right while strengthening
the threatened upper right side.];W[kc]C[I thought this was a terrible move. Shouldn't W connect weak
middle stones to bottom and cancel any black influence on lower
right side?
there are better moves but it did take a point that you wanted later .]
;B[cm]C[Ok, maybe I didn't think 48 was so terrible at the time since
I didn't pounce on O8.];W[fp]C[Seemed like a questionable cut considering B strength in this
area.];B[fo];W[ep];B[eq];W[eo];B[fn];W[dn];B[dm]C[Sure enough. W result is terrible so far.]
;W[go];B[ip];W[en];B[em];W[gn];B[fm];W[io];B[jp];W[jo];B[jq]
C[I was happy to attack the low white stones and threaten to dominate
entire lower left, but in the end couldn't kill these.];W[jr]
;B[kq];W[kr]C[Still not bad for black since 70 allows central penetration.]
;B[lp];W[lo]C[...or so I thought. Fighting the ko seemed way too risky (variation)]

(;B[lq];W[lr]C[But this doesn't seem much better. I'm now forced to attack the
dead group and no longer see a way to attack G3-J3 which looked
dead before.];B[cn];W[nm]C[now count freedoms of your stones . you have reduced w to 2 and you have 3 and a ko.  a play at n6 sets up a trap play that you could try .

Well, at least I'm still very strong in the left corner.];B[dk]
;W[gm];B[eg];W[bg];B[gl]C[Looking to build territory in left center. Is this correct?]
;W[hl];B[hk];W[il];B[gj];W[jd];B[id];W[je];B[kg];W[ho];B[dp]
;W[ie];B[he];W[ig]
(;B[if];W[jf];B[hf];W[jg];B[hh]C[The cut at 95 gave me the result I was looking for. Was that
correct?];W[ji]C[Now B left and right center stones are disconnected, but that
may not have a big impact on territory?];B[jk]C[Hoping to break up large W center.]
;W[jl];B[le];W[nd];B[ne]C[Hoping to make a smidgen of territory in upper center. Happy
because it looked like W would get most of this before.];W[pf]
;B[pg];W[oe];B[nf];W[kk];B[qc]C[I didn't see this move until just after making B109. I was confident
that I could live here, possibly even connect at S15.];W[pc]

(;B[qd]C[Now I think S15 would be better here.];W[re];B[pb]
;W[ob];B[qa];W[qg];B[rf];W[rg]C[B119 was a terrible misread of the ladder. I only saw W-T14,
B-S13.];B[rd];W[sf];B[pi];W[oj];B[rb]C[Would W have killed at 125? It looked like it. Invasion not as
successful as I hoped  yes 125 would have killed
.];W[kh];B[qh];W[ko];B[kf]C[Suddenly fighting for life instead of territory.]
;W[ol];B[pm];W[qk];B[rj];W[pk];B[rl];W[rh];B[ri];W[lh];B[mg]
;W[lg];B[lf];W[mi];B[nn]C[Whew. I live and get a decent sente move]
;W[mp]C[I almost fell asleep on this one...];B[do]C[but didn't.]
;W[mm];B[oo];W[mn];B[om];W[nl];B[qq];W[rs];B[rk];W[mq];B[fp]

;W[hi];B[hj];W[ef];B[dh];W[dg];B[fh];W[gc]C[Ouch. Didn't see this. Don't know how I could have avoided it.]
;B[fc];W[hd];B[hc];W[ib]
(;B[jb];W[jc];B[gd]C[h18 here is better];W[kb];B[ia];W[hb];B[gb]
;W[ja];B[ga];W[ha]C[would have saved you 2 points of area];B[sd]
;W[si];B[sj];W[sh];B[pa];W[oa];B[of];W[no];B[on];W[me];B[mf]
;W[md];B[oi];W[ld];B[ss]C[211 is not needed now a7 is will get you a point makeing 6 points also note that b-a7 w-a8 b-a6 is the correct play]
;W[nr];B[gr];W[ir];B[hs];W[is];B[fs];W[hr];B[gs];W[an];B[ao]
;W[am];B[ql];W[ke];B[og]C[This made me sleep easier, but was it necessary?
no not needed and it lost you 1 point of the 6 you need to winyou could have played c19 w-b19 b-d19 w-b18    that gives you 1 more point and white loses 2 points  so 4 points of the 6 you need to win. we now look for 2 more points]
;W[bq]C[Yawn.end game seem boreing but close games are won or lost in end game play. 1-2 points here or there add up]
;B[bp];W[cr];B[dr];W[es];B[fr];W[da];B[ea];W[ca];B[mh];W[lj]
C[Seems like neutral O11 saves a point of W territory. But maybe
W wanted to sleep well too.];B[op]C[not needed play e15 here another point for you now at 5 points]
;W[ee];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[W won by 5.5 (with 0.5 komi). Seems like my 3-3 invasion was
a good idea, but mis-executing it cost me the game. in the games i play less then 10 points the rank is about the same so you are stronger then 29kyu. so you needed 6 points to win lets see if we can find them in the end game play.
go back through the play and we find 6 points for the win. white could also play for some of the same points.
over all it was a great game for both of you.])
(;B[hb];W[gb];B[ha];W[jc];B[gd];W[jb]C[This seems better?]))
(;B[re];W[qd];B[rd];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb];B[rg]))
(;B[hg];W[if];B[ih]C[Is this sequence better? Lots of weak black stones, but similar
territory in left center and chance to connect to stones on right.]
