C[reviewer: adum (3D KGS)
reviewee: black

i reviewed for white. general comments: first enclose a group before trying to kill it. a couple of times you play moves to take eyes away on the edge when your opponent can run into the center to his advantage. now, there are certain cases when you play to take eyes away at the edge to force your opponent to run, so it's a little hard to know when to play to enclose your opponent in a small life and when to make them run. as a rule of thumb, i'd say that enclosing is better unless you have a good chance of attacking a running group to kill it or for big profit.]

adum: yes, it's fine];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce];W[df]C[reviewee: can i hane at c14?

(;W[id]C[reviewee: is it good to press at j16? please show me some variation.

adum: this is not the best move. the idea is that you don't want to touch weak stones. later you may wish to attack at a spot like G18 instead to take away eyes]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[gd]C[again, this white push just helped black make shape]
;W[ge]C[this cut just helps black run out by sacrificing a stone. you're going to be in deep trouble because of this move.]
;B[fe];W[gf];B[ff];W[gg];B[fg];W[eh]C[reviewee: protect my cut and treat to connect.

adum: you don't have any good moves at this point. this is probably no worse than anything else]

(;B[nc]C[big mistake by black. now white can fix his shape]

(;W[oc]C[reviewee: attack cause have the wall. do u agree?

adum: you should go back and fix as in variation. but locally, this move is fine]
