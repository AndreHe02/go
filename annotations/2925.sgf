C[Thank you for your review. I am the white side in this game.]

;B[ep];W[cm];B[dm];W[cl];B[dl];W[dk]LB[ck:B][cn:A]C[This hane looks dangerous.    I'd be worried about black playing A and then B

As white, I'd like to attack the black stones in this corner if possible.  To do that I need to make both sides strong.   If white's corner is already alive, then instead of D9, how about playing K3 to make the other side strong ?

If thite's corner isn't strong enough yet, then I like C9 instead of D9 so as to keep white stronger than the middle black stones.  As soon as white introduces a weakness by playing D9, it becomes harder to think about attacking the black stones.]
;B[ek];W[dj];B[jq]C[This K3 is exactly where white would have liked to play to make his base.]
;W[jo]C[White 20 good or not? Where is better?

looks ok];B[ip];W[qf]C[I think I like P3 better than R14.  P3 both makes something for white and starts to compress black's position.  R14 doesn't quite make something for white.]
;B[qd];W[nc]C[O17 invites black to play P15 and split white, followed by pressing at either N16 or Q13 depending on which side white defends.  As white, I'd be more comfortable playin R11 and make a comfortable base.   If black responds to that at O17 or nearby, white can go on to the next thing (such as P3 !) without worrying about being attacked.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qh];B[lc];W[cf];B[cd]C[
For black, I'm tempted to play N16 instead of C16 since it looks like a one-move settlement.]
;W[fc];B[df];W[dg];B[ef];W[ce];B[ed];W[jc];B[le];W[lb];B[kc]
;W[kb];B[mb]C[I think I should cut the black.

yes];W[ke]C[why not white cut at N17, since it captures the stone and saves white's stone ?]
;B[mc];W[db]
(;B[cb]C[See variation for stronger response.  Given that black had stronger response, I might play white H16 instead of D18, and be patient.]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[ge];B[ib];W[jb];B[ic]
(;W[jd]C[how about w J16 instead ?  see variations  (by the way, I find that using kgs instead of winmgt for looking at sgf files is easier.  what do you use ?)]
;B[hd];W[gd];B[he];W[gf];B[if];W[kg];B[eg]C[because this black E13 is sente, I might have considered white C13 instead of C15 earlier.]
;W[dh];B[ih]C[it's painful for white to have the two sides split by black like this.  That's why J16 would have been so much better for white than K16 .]

(;W[gh]C[white's worried about possible wedge by black at G13 later.  So for white I might consider H13 before G12.  Please see variation.]
;B[eh];W[ei]C[as white i'm even more nervous about the G13 wedge.  So instead of E11, I might consider H11 for white which makes the white G14 stones stronger while making the black J14 ones weaker.]
;B[fi];W[hi]C[
In other words, I like this white move without interjecting D11 first.]
;B[ej];W[di];B[ii];W[hj];B[lf]
(;W[kf]C[Should I connect here? or at K13 is better?

Maybe, but what about cut at F12 ?]
(;B[li]C[now the white L13 stones don't look as happy to trade for the black D14 ones as they would have been if white had cut at F12 instead of connecting at L14.]
;W[fh];B[fj];W[ij];B[ki];W[bd]C[Is that black is already dead and white 80 at B16 is not necessary?]
;B[bc];W[be];B[da];W[fb];B[fd];W[gc];B[cg];W[bg];B[ch];W[bh]
;B[hl]C[instead of this black H8, how about black N12 ?]
(;W[il]C[if whtie really wants to give up the K18 stones, then how about K10 instead of J8 ?]
;B[hk];W[ik]C[k10 looks possible instead of J9];B[im];W[kk]
C[Is White96 good? But I worry when I escape, Black can get a lot of land at the bottom.


Think about blocking at K7 instead of L9 ...];B[jm]C[... to prevent this]

what if black had played O11 instead of Q10 ?]
