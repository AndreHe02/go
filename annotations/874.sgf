C[I am white.];B[oe];W[dp];B[ee];W[pp];B[jq]LB[jo:A]C[It is the first time that I see black1,3,how to beat black's intention?

SGF>>>  I have seen it a few times but it is not common.  Clearly B is playing for influence and leaving himself wide open to invasion of the corners with the risk of letting W get a lot of points there., so B needs a lot of compensation elsewhere, OR the opportunity to enclose the corners on a large scale himself.  W needs a strategy which prevents B from enclosing the corners in the natural flow of the game but at the same time does not let him close in W in sente.  The two star points at the bottom seem like a reasonable start.

I do not like this B move. It seems to contradict the two 5-5 poiints. Capping this stone with 'A' seems like it would immediately negate a lot of B's influence.  Consider the sequences shown as a variation for the next move.]

(;W[ec]LB[dc:A]C[This just "feels" wrong to me but it is hard to say why.  I think it is going to help B gain thickness more than W. I prefer 'A'  See variation.]

;B[cg]LB[oc:A]C[This does not seem urgent as it is not a threat against the W group.  I would play 'A']
;W[cf]LB[oc:C][dg:A][cm:D][jo:B]C[This seems to do nothing but strengthen B when he responds at 'A'.  'B' and 'C' both seem more attractive to me.  'D' seems to me bigger if you are going to play on the left side.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[dg];W[pj]LB[jo:B][fq:A]C[With 'A' played the cap at 'B' is no longer playable, which makes an invasion at the top undesirable. Therefore  this move seems necessary.  However, overall it seems as though W has lost his sense of direction.]
;B[cl]C[The left side does not look that big to me but this move does look like sente.]
;W[dr];B[qn]LB[nj:A][qq:B]C[This seems misplaced and contrary to B's apparent goal of playing a moyo game.  How about cappign at 'A' followed by an invasion at 'B'?]

(;W[qo]LB[lq:A]TR[fq][jq]C[This move seems to disregard the triangle stones.  I would play at 'A']
;B[pn];W[nq];B[op];W[oq];B[oo]
(;W[rn]LB[pj:A][mo:B]C[This move secures a big corner but does not take accoutn of the outside.  In particular, it weakens the stone at 'A'.  I prefer a play at 'B to split B in two.'.  See the variation to see what happens if B invades at the 3-3 point immediately.]
;B[rm];W[ro];B[ph]C[28--32 white good or bad?];W[ql]LB[ql:B]
[mo:A]TR[pj]SQ[fq][jq]C[Too early? As long as the cut remains B has to worry about it.  With the two marked stones still weak I would prefer a more indirect splitting attack..  This move leaves W with a weak group and makes it hard to gain any advantage.  The point 'A' looks even better now.  With the triangle stone being high a connection by B at 'B' is not really sente.]
