C[H: hi, i'm Herv√©, Giroro in KGS. If possible I'd like to get advice on how to handle a few white "aggressions". I noted where. And also, advice on the attack.
Thanks.];B[pd];W[op];B[dp];W[dc];B[ce];W[di];B[fe];W[gc];B[cl]
C[H : maybe alittle shy on this one? C9, D9?

yip:
D9 would be joseki, and looks fine.  C8 doesn't help the lower left corner at all (it's still wide open), and doesn't exert pressure on D11, either.]
;W[df];B[de];W[ed];B[ef]C[H: i 'dind't want to just connect submissively, but the cut is still there, so i'll be forced to come back to it. As a bonus for white, I kinda reinforce him.

yip:
I don't think connecting at E15 is submissive.  Maybe it would help to think of it as gathering strength.  White is forcing black to connect here, and in doing so, weakens the stones on the left.  Black can settle easily after connecting, so why give white a chance to leave weak spots?  After E14, now white is being forced to connect as well, which he won't mind.]
;W[dg];B[eg];W[eh];B[ch];W[ci];B[bh];W[dh];B[ee]C[H: we both have weird shapes now. But I feel that I somehow managed to steal his base, and I have B17. So i'm not unhappy but it feels weird.

yip:
But black loses sente here, and the white stones are connected.  White's still fairly safe, since B11 threatens to capture the B12 stones.]
;W[hi]C[H: now the difficult question : how to attack this thing?
I thought first that I could keep white separated by playing around J15.This option seems to invite white to play C6 and start a fight here, which i don't like.
Or maybe plays around F9 to try and develop the lower left corner. But then white could sketch a link between his center and upper stones, which would attack my  E15 stones.


yip:
White's not going to connect to the top for a while yet.  But if black doesn't play in the upper left, white can play around B17, and force black to either run out, or play at B11 (much more submissive than E15 would have been!).  A play in that corner would take territory, secure the group's base, and maybe even threaten the white stones at the top - they're still a bit thin.

Remember that strengthening your own group can weaken the opponent as a side effect!

E8 could be a good move as well.];B[jp]C[H : in the end I played this move. The idea is to develop the corner hoshi stone while reduce the takamoku's influence. And maybe later there will be better options for attacking the center white stones.

yip:
I'd prefer settling the upper left first - none of the groups there are very strong yet.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qp]
(;B[qk]C[yip:
This lets white settle the group easily.  It'd be more interesting to punish him for not making the extension...]
;W[qi];B[qn];W[qm]C[H : how to handle this proprely?

yip:
Take advantage of it by building thickness.  Since the upper white group seems more secure, it seems to make sense to let it connect there, and use the power gained to damage the lower right corner.]

(;B[rn]C[yip:
Connecting at Q9 would be much better.];W[pk]C[yip:
This is huge for white!  The black stones are very weak now, while white's position is solid on both sides.]
;B[ok];W[qj];B[no];W[np];B[pg]C[H: the idea is to build a bit more influence, in order to attack the center stones. I could have played maybe D3 but it's only territorial. In that situation i really didn't know what else to play.


yip:
Aside from the earlier comments about the upper left, there are several other big points.  Around K17 is large for both sides - if white plays there, S17 becomes a huge point.

The S6 stones are still weak as well.  Q13 helps a little, though another move would be needed (white P10 separates the groups otherwise).

It's still too early for D3 (if white invades, black gets a huge territory on the bottom, and the D12 group is in a lot more trouble).]
;W[pf];B[og];W[of];B[ng];W[qg]C[yip:
I'm not sure what white has really accomplished here by pushing from behind...]
;B[hg]C[H: here there is still a little problem of direction, since I push white towards my moyo. But i definitely want to prevent connection with the uuper side. If i build power here, maybe i'll be able to do something on this upper side, also.
Any comments on the attacking sequence would be appreciated.


yip:
If you're truly worried about white connecting to the top, apply more pressure to the stones on the upper side (such as with G16).  H13 looks awkward, and pushes white towards the area you want to make territory.]
;W[ji]C[yip:
This doesn't look much better - where does white think he's running to?

Capping at E8 is more interesting, since a black play at c6 makes the corner look overconcentrated - and still open to an invasion later on.]
;B[fj];W[gh];B[ih];W[hk];B[gm];W[oj];B[nk];W[nm]C[yip:
Black probably has to let something go at this point.  Trying to capture the white stone outright is unreasonable, because of all the cutting points.  To be aggressive, black could connect, and chase the white stones out...]

(;B[mn];W[mm];B[ln];W[on];B[oo];W[pn];B[qo];W[ol];B[dq]C[H: well, now white is kinda linked up, so i wanted to make territory here.

yip:
While it's not a small move, there are a lot of more urgent points still around.  The O13 stones could be in a lot of danger now, in addition to the other large points mentioned earlier.]
;W[cn]C[H : again, how to handle this properly?

yip:
I believe the usual response works out alright...]

(;B[mj];W[nf];B[mg];W[kj];B[mf];W[im];B[lm]C[H: safety move... not sure it was necessary, and B4 is huge and maybe sente.

yip:
It looks like black can be cut off without a play around here, but M4 seems as though it would be better; it would help make territory, and solidly connect.  

As it is here, white can play M4 in sente, and black has to connect along some neutral points.]
;W[io];B[ip];W[ho];B[hp];W[cp];B[bo];W[co]C[H : i lost many point in a few moves]

(;B[ml];W[rp];B[ni]C[yip:
What does this move accomplish?];W[rc];B[bd]C[yip:
This move doesn't do much, either.  Black's hardly going to get any territory around here, and white is not going to be in a rush to play in this corner either (he can't gain a lot).

If black is worried about the group as a whole, connecting with a play around H16 seems much better.  This also helps turn some of the center into territory.  S18 and B3 are also very big for both sides.]
;W[cc];B[hc]C[H : this looks bad after white's answer. I thought i could get eomthing here but there was nothing.. S18 is surely bigger anyway.]
