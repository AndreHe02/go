C[Hello, this is a game from 1st round of 10th Individual Cup of
Serbia played between Lazar (L) and Dusan (D). Thanks for reviewing
game.

reid: After making my review, I went over some of this game with my teacher: Jiang Ming Jiu 7P.  I have added his comments.  It is interesting to see where (and how) my original comments are incorrect.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[qp];W[dd];B[kq];W[qj];B[pk]C[L: What is the most usual (and probably the best) sequence for
white to play here?

reid: This is a fairly new pattern that is currently being studied quite a bit.  I think what white played is reasonable, but it needs a much stronger player than myself to be able to analyze this in depth.

Ming Jiu: Who knows?  Nobody knows...];W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[qm]
;W[rm]LB[nc:C][qg:A][pm:B]C[D: Is it better to play w A b B w C ?

reid: so then the question is: does white get compensation for black's thickness in the lower and right parts by attacking Q16?  I think it's difficult - white A is too far away and white isn't strong enough in this area for a severe attack.  If I were black, I think I'd welcome this variation.]
;B[qn];W[qf]C[reid: For Ming Jiu's comments, see variation.]

(;B[qh]LB[fc:F][nc:C][qc:E][rd:D][pj:A][rn:B]C[D: What should have I played instead of this move?

reid: Black is investing heavily in the lower side and right-side thickness.  To continue building there, he would like to keep the option of playing at A.  That may not be possible after the attack at R12.  Indeed, in this game, white gets A which weakens black's thickness considerably.

We can anticipate white A which makes white almost alive already.  So R12 isn't really a splitting attack.

Black could try just A directly, and black B is also big (and threatens white's eye space).  Black C, white D, black E also seems reasonable (after which black is thinking about F).

Ming Jiu: as we saw in the discussion of the previous move, black A is good enough.]
;W[of]LB[qc:D][pg:B][nj:C][pj:A]C[L: Q10 maybe better than P14, or there is maybe some better move?

reid: If white A (instead of P14), black B looks like trouble for white - now black may have time to get a splitting attack going.  I think P14 is natural and good.

Ming Jiu: White should play at A (good call, Lazar!).  If black B, white jumps easily to C (O10), reducing black's carefully built influence.  After black B, white still has the D (R16) for easy life.]
;B[oh]LB[nc:B][qe:D][rf:E][rh:A][pj:C]C[reid: If black wants to attack white here, he needs to prevent the connection at A (S12). Also, white is now attacking the corner (Q16).  Black P12 makes black very busy.  He doesn't have time to handle everything.

Black could come back to C now and see how white responds.

Another option for black is to play B (instead of P12), white C. black D, white E.

Ming Jiu: black should push at C now.  This is even better for black than if he had just pushed at C two moves ago.]
;W[pj];B[oj];W[rh];B[pg];W[rg];B[pf];W[pe]C[L: Tenuki instead Q15?

reid: I don't think tenuki is a good idea now.  This fight is pretty hot and white needs to continue.  White seems to get a good result in the game with Q15.]
;B[oe];W[qe];B[od]LB[lo:A]C[L: What is the right strategic move for white, now?

reid: Black has a wall. but it is full of cutting points.  The upper right corner (which was black's originally) is now up for grabs.  White R16 will be a big move soon, but it isn't urgent right now (black wants to make use of his wall instead).

White's next move (probing at A) seems reasonable.

Ming Jiu: The game is better for black now.  White has too many stones on the second and third lines.]
;W[lo]LB[ko:A]C[Ming Jiu: Perhaps A (L5) is a better reducing point.]
;B[ko]LB[mp:A][qq:B]C[D: N4 better ?

reid: A (N4) seems to be a natural response.

If black wants to attack white, he probably should not attach.  "When you touch me, you help me".  A contact move usually ends up helping the other player get stronger in the area.

It's hard to find a move that attacks white effectively, so perhaps N4 is a better idea.  Black will wait for a better opportunity to develop.

Ming Jiu: Black L5 is good.  N4 is not so good because there is still corner aji at B.]
;W[kn]LB[ll:E][jm:D][ln:C][kp:B][lp:A]C[L: L4 more efficient?

reid: L6 is a natural response.

Ming Jiu: L6 is OK, but white could also consider A, black B, etc, to white E (reid: hmm, seems kind of heavy to me).]
;B[ln];W[kp]LB[ok:D][pq:B][qq:A][pr:C]C[reid: now migh be a good time to probe with A to see how black responds.  B is likely, and white can probe again with C.  Blacks responses in the corner may change how white plays in the L5 area.

Ming Jiu: Before black commits to a direction with M5 and L6, he must probe at either A or D to see which direction black wants to go.]
;B[jo]C[L: M3 now?

reid: m3 seems a bit heavy.  K4 (the game move) looks better to me.]
;W[jp];B[lp];W[lq];B[mo]C[Ming Jiu: this result (taking M5) is very good for black.]
;W[jq];B[mq];W[kr];B[mr]LB[rp:B][qq:A]C[D: Who is better at this point?

reid: I think this is a good result for white.  The black N5 stones are too close to the Q8 stones, and F3 is now isolated.

Ming Jiu: This is good for black.  Now there is no corner aji.  If white A, black B stops white cold.]
;W[io]LB[hp:A]C[reid: I would play this at A instead to attack the black F3 stone.  With J5, black has a nice probe at H3 later.  I think white starts to fall behind with this move.

Ming Jiu: the hane is better than A (reid: oops!).];B[in];W[np]
;B[oq]LB[mp:A]C[Ming Jiu: just connecting at A is probably better.  The shape may be ugly (especially after white K6, black M5), but the result is still good for black.  Later, a white cut at A could be significant.  A stops the corner aji just as well as P3.]
;W[jn];B[lo];W[hn];B[im]C[reid white helped black too much here.  And F3 still has too much aji.]
;W[ho]LB[hd:E][fm:C][hm:A][fo:D][dq:B]C[D: What is best black ca do in bottom left corner , D3 ,C3 ...?

reid: Because black has H3, he seems to do fine with D2.

Ming Jiu: Black must turn at A (reid: none of us saw that one coming!).  If white B, black plays C for even more center influence.White probably needs to answer at D, so black can then make a truly impressive structure with E.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[hq]C[L: wG4, bG3, wJ2; is it right combination?

reid: black may take J2 instead of G3, then white still needs to connect.

D: Is E4 better then this?

reid: H4 is good - it is a vital point for both sides.

Ming Jiu: White G4 might be a better way to go here. It seals black in and helps connect the white stones around the outside.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[gq];B[gp];W[fr];B[hp];W[ip]LB[gm:D][fo:B][go:E]
[fp:A][eq:C]C[reid: Ming Jiu and I also looked at white A (instead of J4), black B, white C, black cuts at J4, white D, black E.  The conclusion was: this is dangerous for white.  He must kill the black stones which is hard to do.  After white J2, black can get a ko here, and the white stones on the outside are also under attack, so it's hard for white.]
;B[eq];W[cr];B[ds]C[reid: So in the end, white has invaded black's moyo, but black is alive in the lower right, and white has helped black move his moyo out towards the center.  White's J5 group  is still not alive.

Black seems to be better, and it seems to be because of J5 (instead of H4).]
;W[jd]LB[fo:A]C[reid: K16 is big, no doubt.  But J5 is floating with only one eye.  I think white needs to settle this group with something like white A.

Ming Jiu: White must play at A now.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be sente - black is already alive.]
;B[fc]LB[ik:E][hl:D][il:C][hm:B][fn:A]C[reid: again. the fight for the J5 group is hot right now, so black should attack with A.  As white runs out with B, etc, black secures more center territory to black E.

Ming Jiu: black must play at A now, since white missed F5.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[lc]LB[hd:A][fn:B]C[reid: Black invites trouble with this move.  The F16 stones are heavy, so he needs to play at A to attack white and to make shape.  If the F16 group can get strong, it should help black when he attacks around B (F6).

Since the corner is still open, neither side can consider the top area (around N17) as big or important (except for eye space, perhaps).]
;W[hd]C[reid: white gets the critical point.];B[ff];W[ig];B[gg]
;W[le]C[Ming Jiu: gote?];B[ld]C[L: Should I defend my weak group in center, and then make points
on the left side while attacking black's group?];W[qc]LB[ii:A]
[ik:D][hl:B][il:C]C[reid: If white wants the corner, he should just take it without making the M15-M16 exchange.  That exchange helps black more than white.  Also, R16 leaves a bit less aji than R17.

But the corner is not the urgent issue at the moment.  The center fight is urgent.

This position illustrates a common weakness that we amateur player have: the positions are very unsettled, yet we want to take sente and play somewhere else.  Professional players don't do that because they don't like being pushed around (it may seem like a pro tenukis in the middle of a hot fight sometimes, but deeper analysis almost always shows the 'tenuki' actually has some relation to the fight, or that the shapes are more resilient than they appear at first glance).

The proverb says "play the urgent point, not the big point".  The big point is the point you take when you have no more (good) sente moves left - it's your last resort.

If I were white, I would play at A (J11) instead of M16.  This helps to stabilize the top center group, attacks the black F14 stones, and helps to reduce the black center moyo - a triple threat move!  Without the M15/M16 exchange, there is much more aji left in the area around O17.  J11  also makes it harder for black to attack the J5 stones, and there may even be some future potential to use the K6 cutting stones.

Ming Jiu: Nobody wants to play at B?  it's huge! (reid: Ah, after white B, if black pushes at C, white can hane at D).

Ming Jiu's comments end here.];B[ke];W[kf];B[je];W[ie];B[jf]
;W[jg];B[kg];W[hb];B[gb];W[kd];B[lf];W[if];B[me];W[ii];B[hj]
LB[ch:C][gi:B][gj:A]C[D: My idea was to get strong in center while attacking his group and look for a chance to play F6.
Is there some better move then this?

reid: Heh, the time for F6 was about 25 moves ago (black 67 or so).  Now black has made an investment in the F14 stones, and he doesn't have time to think about F6.  Black's only hope to attack is that white is also in trouble.

If black wants to attack (and thinking about F6 is thinking about attacking), he needs to be careful to not leave weaknesses behind.  I think pulling back a bit to A (G10) or maybe even B (G11) is better.  With B, black may be strong enough to launch a diversionary attack (a 'leaning' attack) with C and hope white helps to strengthen him so that F6 becomes possible.

White and black are both thin here.  This kind of game really becomes a gamble.  It's pretty hard to say that either side is ahead, it just depends too much on how the fighting goes (and who makes the most critical mistakes).]
;W[hi]LB[gh:A]C[reid: I'd probably try A instead of H11, just because it looks like a better shape move.  But it's pretty hard to read out what's going to happen.]
;B[gi];W[ki];B[gk];W[ij];B[ik];W[fj];B[gj];W[fo];B[eb]LB[ce:C]
[fe:B][ge:A][jk:D]C[D: I did'n know how to attack w group because it can make eye with A.

reid: Instead of killing, it's usually  better to go for incremental gains while threatening to kill. Even if it lives, you don't much mind a white play at A because your answer at B (F15) gives you a good peep at C (C15) for later.  So black should play D to fix hs weakness and enlarge his center territory.]
;W[fh];B[gh];W[jk];B[jl]LB[hl:A]C[reid: now black has a weakness at A.]
;W[kk];B[kh];W[jh];B[lj];W[li]LB[kb:C][hh:B][kj:A]C[reid: white A would be an easier way to secure life (B and C are miai).]

(;B[km]C[D: I did'n see geta at N7.
Is it possible to kill this group with b N8?

reid: Hmm, looks complicated.  See variation.

This was an interesting game with a lot of good fighting.  Howver, both sides tend to leave the fight too soon, before the groups are settled.

I think the important lesson to take away from this game is to settle your groups before launching the next adventure.  It is too difficult to keep track of several groups that aren't yet alive or weaknesses that you have to watch out for.  "Play the urgent move, not the big move".

Perhaps the best demonstration of this is the white move at M15 followed by white R17.  M15 was the wrong direction (towards blacks thickness) and helped black more than white (especially when white tenukis!).  Instead, the simple jump towards the center looks better.  Similarly, white needed to play F5 much earlier to enclose black and stabilize his J5 group.  Since he didn;t, black should have attacked with F6 instead of launching a new group with F17.
