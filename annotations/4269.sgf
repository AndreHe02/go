C[DMD: Dear reviewer, I played this game as Black on KGS. It was a very fast blitz. I know that sending fast games for review to the Teaching Ladder is discouraged but I am trying these days to improve my level of play particularly in fast games. The reason for this is that I'm a rather slow player who loves playing on Dragon Go Server where games may long 3 months or more. When playing fast games, I lose much more often than when I play slow games, with equal-level opponents. I am not much interested in the complicated sequences that I missed. When playing blitz games, I obviously can't read 10 moves ahead ;-) I would like to get your help on spotting those evident, simple and solid moves that I obviously missed and that I should have seen without even thinking a second. Thanks in advance for your help.

TN: Hello, my name is Eric (TomNook on KGS). Thanks for providing me with my first game to review. =)

I have gone through and tried to point out the obvious moves as you requested; however, I am only around 10k in strength, so there are certainly things which I have missed. Although you said you are not too interested in the complicated sequences, I have included a few anyways. Like yourself, I prefer slower games; but getting a feel for complicated situations in blitz games goes a long way (in my opinion) to strengthening your slower play. I suppose my point is that blitz games ought not to be neglected when it comes to studying longer sequences.

I hope you find the review helpful. Feel free to contact me on KGS with any questions, or e-mail me at <reninspace@yahoo.com>.]

(;W[jc]C[TN: As far as I know, White cannot play tenuki from the lower-right joseki and get away without some disadvantage.]

(;B[kq]C[DMD: As White did not finish the joseki, I hesitated in playing Q6 to try to "punish" her for that. But then, I thought that I would ake the risk of letting White take my P3-P4 group's base away. So I played safely. What do you think?

TN: White's lower-right stones are weak in comparison to your P3-P4 pillar since White omitted the joseki move at R6. So there is no reason for you to play safely here. I think you are correct to play a knight's move here to attack, but I am not sure Q6 is the right point.]

(;B[nd]C[TN: After this move White starts grabbing up sente endgame points. You could connect the stones in the middle with this move or M8. White can't stop you from playing both, so better here to take sente with something like Q1 or N9.

My comments stop here. Overall my main comment would be that you need to keep your eye on big moves as much as possible. Of course, it is a lot easier to say that than to actually do it---I know in blitz games I often make small, unnessecary moves out of paranoia---but it is something we all have to work at.

I hope my comments will be useful to you. Thanks again for letting me review the game, and I hope you enjoy. =)]

TN: Although it helps establish a base, your stones are not yet closed in. When you have a way of making it into the center or into open space, always try that first before settling down and building a base along the edge of the board.

I think here your first instinct should be to move out towards the middle---not to start making eye-space on the side.]
