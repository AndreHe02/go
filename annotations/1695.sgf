C[Hi, and thanks for reviewing games for the GTL. I'm currently 8k on KGS, in the process of advancing one rank each month. My goal is to keep this up until 4 or 3 kyu, then get to dan level by spring next year. Due to my working hours, I play exclusively on the internet. In this game I play black, and tho I am able to identify some flaws when reviewing my own game, I much appreciate the comments of someone stronger. Thanks in advance. I've tried to make my plans and thoughts as I played and reviewed clear, so you can make a better judgement on what areas to focus on.

Hi, my name is Peter Hoehe. I am a 1 kyu in Germany. Thanks to let me make a review. I try to point out the overall strategy. I hope you find my hints useful. But bear in mind, that I am only some stone stronger than you. And the gap is still closing. My nick on KGS is go4fun.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[pj]C[I know too little fuseki, and the sanrensei opening is what I feel most comfortable with. I'm probably not spotting it's strenghts and weaknesses, and wouldn't mind a few pointers on how to play on from it, in general terms.]
;W[jp];B[fc]C[I never quite know how to respond to K4. Why doesn't white go D10, especially in a game like this, with no komi? But then I'm not comfortable playing there myself, so perhaps that's why white plays like this. Anyway, the approach from outside seems ok, there's usually enough room to break up the side after it.
g4: This is OK. In most cases kakaris are bigger than extensions.]
;W[cg];B[jd]C[Here my thoughts (please point out the flaws of them) were to extend this far, as the only useful reply I could thing of for white was h17, after which I could do j17 or similar, then jump into the corner with c17. If white does not split, I have much potential for territory.
g4: That's quite right. The other possibility after bH17 is to cap with wH16.]
;W[nq];B[oo]C[The Takemiya kosumi, a little experiment I'm running. Seems to work for me in most games, probably more because people never face it than that I'm any good with it...]
;W[qq]C[g4: Too early I think.];B[qp];W[pq];B[mp]C[This seems very good for me, getting solid stones both aiming up the right edge and towards the center.]
;W[qc]C[I expected the n3-m4 exchange first.

In review I see what whites plan with this early invasion probably was; to create some situation where my stones on the top would be weakened so the potential of the big f17-k16 gap would dwindle.

I had no clue when I played tho, and was happy to build up more towards the center and sides for some small white territory.

g4: This is a matter of taste. Black will build up a big moyo. This might not be easy to defend, but if it gets territory black has a lead. I would not play this as white.]
;B[pc]C[g4: Wrong direction I think. Blocking at R17 will form the big moyo.]
;W[qd];B[pe]C[Felt this was most consistent with my previous aims and plans.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
(;B[cl]C[And I tenuki, probably at the worst possible time. What moves should I play first in the upper right?
g4: As I mentioned, I would have blocked the other side. You have the chance to play R15 now, and get still a nice moyo, see var. The proper move in this situation O17 might by too slow.]
;W[cj];B[co]C[Too late I realize that the space is smaller than I thought
g4: If you realize this you may play C6. But this move is not bad.]
;W[cp];B[mq]C[With the white bottom left corner easilly defendable, I try to create havoc on the bottom side.
g4: This seems to be sente. So it is very good. White should have exchanged N3 for M4 first.]
;W[np];B[no];W[mo]C[unexpected. I should probably play m5 and m4 here, but saw the potential for immediate profit.
g4: M5 and L4 is the proper answer. White has to defend against P2 first. Then you can play either K5 or O7. (see var)]

(;B[oq]C[g4: risky now. With wO2 this is helping only white (or gote)]
;W[nr];B[or]C[n2 instead?
g4: N2 would be a failure. White P2 secures the group.];W[mr]
;B[op];W[lp]C[Got the corner back, and have potentially useful moves at n6 or l3 later. Wasn't too pleased with whites influence on the rest of the bottom, but you take some give some.
g4: The corner is big. But the bottom is much bigger. So I think this exchange is in white favour.]
;B[fq]C[A bad habit I'm trying to elliminate, I know this isn't wise, the black stones on the left and this stone will probably both have to run, and white can get a good splitting attack. Not sure how to handle the mess I made on the left without giving white huge immediate profit on the bottom tho.
g4: Correct analysis. If you played the other possibility in the corner, you would have no trouble invading there. And of course this is not good.]
;W[eq]C[g4: Timid. E5 seems natural, spliiting black.];B[fp]
C[g4: I would be tempted to advance faster with F5. When you play in the area of the enemy, you should be prepared to give up some stones to build a living group there.]
;W[en]C[A good move by white, splits me decisively, and is also a potential ladderbreaker for the opposite corner.
g4: Hard for black now.];B[iq]C[g4: Black must be very confident on saving both his groups. If this fails, white will get very strong there AND get the territory. If you are not sure of living, you should leave the situation and wait if you can read it out, or use the aji.]
;W[qf]C[And now I get the hurt for my tenuki.
g4: White cannot do very much here. The right side was still open all the time. So white cannot expext much there. The bottom left needs much more attention. If black lives there, the game will be soon over.]

(;B[pg]C[Was this my error, or jus tthe followup?
g4: I would exchange P14 for R13, and then play E5 or F7 or F8 perhaps. (see var)]
;W[pf];B[qe]C[g4: Do not. This looses one liberty you might need.]
;W[re];B[of];W[qg];B[ph];W[nd]C[Considered p16, but didn't like white getting a wall from o18 to o15.]
;B[nc]C[Spotted the snapback too late.
g4: P17 would have been better];W[oe];B[oc];W[nf];B[og];W[mc]
;B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[kc];B[na]C[Wrong to live at once? My thoughts was to secure the group from any and all further attack so I could attack white in turn.
g4: I would consider K18 instead. So the black stones on the left are connected with the upper group. Now white has L18 in sente, which is unbearable.]
;W[kb]C[g4: Of course];B[la];W[lf]C[g4: Better at M15.];B[me]

(;W[ne]C[g4: Better to block at M15];B[mf]
(;W[le]C[g4: White is giving up the 4 stones in order to get a wall.]
;B[mg];W[lg];B[md];W[ld]C[g4: K15 is shape.];B[ng]C[Do I have to play at o13? Now white have all but elliminated the potential of my two stones, do I have any salvaging move?
g4: This is too slow. But the problem is not that move but the 4 before. You had let white build a wall, and got 9 points in return. That isn't it worth.]
;W[dc]C[Perfect. Big, thick, and makes a good basis for attacking me.]
;B[ib]C[Figured if white blocked l19, I could live and continue attacking m13
g4: White is much stronger than black. So white will attack. The game is easy for white now.]
;W[hc]C[g4: Unnecessary. I would press from above.];B[ic];W[gc]
;B[ka]C[Secured what I could.
g4: First force, than live. The could mean playing H16 first. If white L19, black G16 and living.]
;W[ie];B[qh]C[Bad timing? The right seems big for me.
g4: Locally the shape move is S12. But globally the upper left is much bigger. A white move around H12 wins at once. And white can't invade into the right side very far.]
;W[id]C[When white keeps playing after I tenuki, I know I've made a mistake... What move in the area did I have?
You could have played H16, wG16, bH15, wG15, b H14.];B[jc];W[je]
C[g4: much too slow. Now black can't break thru, so H11 might by great.]
;B[gb];W[hb];B[fd]C[g4: Adding stones to a dead group is never good.]
;W[ge];B[ha];W[fb];B[ga];W[fa];B[ia];W[eb]C[Nothing more to do there, just gotta push some fight to that area to exploit the cut.]
;B[mn]C[Expanding my area while I can.
g4: Biggest are the moves in the bottom left.];W[lo]C[Expected m3]
;B[kq]C[See no other use for the n3 stones now, take the cash while I can.]
;W[lq];B[jq];W[hp];B[ip];W[ho];B[hq]C[g4: Pushing thur at J5 seems better. So you can use the aji of attacking the white M5 group. It has only one definite eye.]
;W[io]C[My big chance];B[jo];W[kp];B[jn]C[g4: This looks completely different now. These 2 stones are too weak. They have to look after themselves. So you cannot expect to attack white.]
;W[ln];B[mm];W[im]C[g4: White should keep pushing.];B[jm];W[ll]
C[g4: M7!];B[lm];W[km];B[kl];W[kn];B[il];W[kk];B[jl];W[lk]
(;B[gm]C[Is there an option that cuts good? or atleast better?
g4: You have to decide what you want. This seems as if you are going for a kill. Would be great id it works. But I don't think this is an option. So what to do?
I think it is sufficient to use the threat of the kill while entering the center with the bottom group. I try in the var.]
;W[gn];B[hn]C[Wanted atleast one eye while I could get it];W[fo]
;B[in];W[fm];B[go];W[gp];B[gq];W[go];B[eo];W[fn];B[do];W[ep]
C[Can I do something with the corner here?
g4: This is a great result for black. White has 3 (!) weak groups and you only 1. I would play F2 or E2 to secure the bottom group completely. Just look at the var.]

(;B[gl]C[g4: Good];W[ek]C[g4: Thin];B[kr]C[Going for the kill while I have the liberties
g4: Better to gain some more liberties with striking thru the knights move with E8. It leads to a situation similar to the var.]
;W[hk];B[hl];W[gk]C[Suddenly it doesn't look good. I read out the sequence as it was actually played, couldn't spot any flaw with my moves, and they worked. In the following sequence, could white have done anything to limit me more?]
;B[ij];W[ik];B[jk];W[jj];B[fl];W[el];B[fk];W[gj];B[fj];W[gi]
;B[ej];W[dk];B[kj];W[ji];B[lj];W[mk];B[mj];W[nk]C[Didn't expect white to try to save those stones; this seems like a safe win for me.]
;B[eh];W[fh];B[dh]C[g4: D10 first];W[di];B[ei];W[ch];B[ef];W[fg]
;B[df];W[eg];B[dg];W[cf];B[fe]C[And I get to save the stones, tho it's probably too late to kill anything.
g4: Better to play F14];W[ff];B[ee];W[de]
(;B[ls]C[g4: This involves good reading now. White has 6 liberties. Black has 7 and has sente. But 1 liberty they share. So it maybe seki. But if black plays M2, white has to take a stone at N3, loosing another liberty. So white will loose, if black plays M2.]
;W[gd];B[ns];W[dj];B[ms];W[fi];B[lr];W[nj];B[mi];W[om];B[nn]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[ql];B[pl]C[Yes. Horrible.
g4: Why? Both grouos are secure. But white should not live there anyway.]
;W[ok];B[pm]C[g4: R10];W[qm];B[pn];W[qj];B[rk];W[rj];B[rm];W[rl]
;B[rn];W[sk]C[Thought white q11 made two eyes, see in review that I could play s12 safely.]
;B[pi];W[rh]C[White has many cutting points, but for all my reading I found no way to do anything but create a long chain of false eyes but still connected to life.
g4: Now its too late. You had always the sente move at S12.]
;B[bp];W[bq]C[Should I play d6 first?
g4: As long as you can read it out, you shoul not. This is a perfect ko threat. But you shoul play C3 now.]

(;B[bo];W[cr];B[dn];W[em];B[bk];W[bm];B[bj];W[bi];B[am]C[Other options?
g4: Difficult to read out. I would try D7, but this seems to by good too.]

C[Here I live with d8, never spotted it, thought I lived this way too.]

;B[kg];W[jg];B[kf];W[ke];B[jf];W[if];B[hg]C[Hoping for a few points trough semedori or something. See later that it also creates ko threats.]
;W[hf];B[er];W[dr]C[Here I do a count, and realize I'm too much behind to catch up with any fancy endgame moves.]
;B[ri];W[rg];B[qi]C[Want white short on liberties and eyes.]
;W[si];B[qk];W[ni];B[lh];W[ol]C[Big, but I'm losing anyway]
;B[sh];W[sg];B[pa];W[fr]C[My chance, what can I play from here? Thought about t17 and t15, but counted too many outside liberties for white.
g4: There is nothing to do left. Once S13 is played, there is no more aji.]

;W[rc]C[White WANTS a ko?
g4: ? P19 settles the matter.];B[sa];W[sd];B[sf]C[g4: Great]
;W[sb];B[ak]C[probably the wrong place to start.
g4: It's ok.];W[aj];B[sc];W[qn];B[qo]C[Painful, I can see white getting many threats here.
g4: So play S5 instead.];W[sb];B[rf]C[Internal threats first]

;W[sb];B[sl];W[sm];B[sc];W[on];B[po];W[sb];B[db]C[Error, but where else? If white e17, there's a white threat at e16 again.
g4: E16 is not big enough. But O12 is a good place for white. So you could have won probably with S5 as I mentoined before.]

It was very interesting to me. My only advice can be: Don't create too much weak groups. This addresses both of you. 
During the game both players seemed to be not aware of the posibilities to enlarge territory while attacking a weak group.
I hope you enjoyed my comments.
