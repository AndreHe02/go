C[First of all, thank you for taking the time to review my game - it is much appreciated.

I play black in this Game on the Dragon Go Server - at the beginning of the game we were both equally rated (hence the even game) , but it turned out later that my opponent was actually stronger, so unsurprisingly I lost the game by a significant margin - however, I thought that the game was at least even until my reading let me down during a midgame fight. I gave up when I made a stupid mistake in the endgame but my opponent was 50 or so points ahead anyway.

Feel free to add comments wherever you like - this is the first time I send in a review so I was a bit unsure as to what to write.]
;B[pd];W[ee]TR[ec][ce]C[This is not a common approach for opening. Is not clear what intention could have because is to far from corner to have a "set-base" approach and has no real plan to deal with center. A better approach could be e17 or c15. This is the kind of movements that seem to be big, but are really small.]
;B[pq]TR[dc][cd]C[Good, but I would have take an approach to try to push from corner with C16 or d17.]
;W[fp]C[I thought this move was unsound or at least very difficult to use for a player of my opponents' level, but as the continuation shows I did not  manage to take advantage of it.

-------
Right, this is a very important moment. White movements gives you a lot of space to invade.]

(;B[pk]C[I will prefer to play here more directly d4. Some simple variants shows that even with an small territorial benefit the space in the bottom ceenter for white wouldn't be that big and minimize its influence is fairly possible.]
;W[jj]CR[cg][di][dl][dp][cq]TR[be][ce][de][ff][gg][hh][ii][ik]
[hl][gm][fn][fo]C[I was stunned - my opponent was going for a 'pure influence' Game ! Not an opening I expected at this level !

----
In few words: this seem to be an agressive position but really is an small an unbalanced one. Consider the potencial space (triangles) for white is very open for invations (circles).  Black is a bit better. Remember that the center stone really has small territory and worst: has no base to settle.]
;B[jd]SQ[cc][cp]C[I was not sure what to do next, but I thought a 'double wing' expansion just could not be bad -  I thought that I was doing better than my opponent now.
-----
not bat at all, but taking space in white territory is URGENT because the only way the white opening can make sense is if he get settled! 

C4, C17 was urgent.];W[jp]TR[dj][cp]SQ[jk][il][jl][hm][jm][gn]
[jn][fo][go][jo][gp][hp][ip]C[Maybe the shimari was bigger than the corner approach now, but I just wanted to see how he would handle that odd F4 stone.
-------

Look out the mojo for white... LITTLE. White needs at last two movements to make it better (triangles)... Invasion is more urgent!]
;B[dp]C[I was not sure how to approach this oddly placed stone so I opted for the hoshi point, which seemed a fair enough but did not yield great results  - any ideas ?

---
Exactly not the best one.. c4 was better. Now white can make you enter in a Joseki with one time less]

(;W[do]C[This is bad, touching a weak stone is not right way to attack. Right lines in the variations.]
;B[co]C[Simply c4 is better, when the other side has a bad form, creating complications may no be the best option. "The rich man doesn't need to fight"]
;W[cn]C[Should I have cut this double hane ? Or played E5 atari ?

Whites searches for complications.];B[bo];W[bn]C[Here I think I would have been better off with E5....]

(;B[dq]C[this exchange has helped white to activate k4 and create influence but the main problem here is that d3 is too small. e3, e4 are better... but you are right to think e5 is the best option.]
;W[ep]C[A natural one];B[eq]C[Again, too small. Still is urgent for you to invade.]
;W[fq]C[helps white to activate k4.];B[fr]C[this is big, but is more a yose movement.]
;W[gr]C[The corner was alive, and though I was not overly happy I thought it was time to tenuki


------------
Right, is alive but a tenuki here, as you did, forces you to keep sente for not to loose f2 stone and make that movement a waste of time.]

(;B[dd]C[A standard approach to 5-5, I believe
----,
yes, but playing d17 is also standard and is related to k16. now white can separate your groups. See the variations for other approaches.]
;W[ed]
(;B[de];W[df];B[cf];W[cg]C[Again, should I have cut here ? Or leave the aji as done in the game ?
----------------------

I would suggest the cut... any place!
see variations]
(;B[bf];W[bg];B[ec]C[trying to avoid being totally sealed in as in the lower corner but missing the strong white reply.

----
Exactly... the problem is that black has no base at all, the pair of units needs one more time to settle. D17 was fairly better.]
;W[dc]C[right, as it happens this will reduce your conrner.]
;B[cc];W[db]C[I realized too late that after WC5 BC16 WB15 things would not look very good so I had to go back and connect which left me with a tiny corner]
;B[cd];W[fc];B[cb];W[eb];B[qo]LB[gf:B][hg:A][pn:C]SQ[ff][gg]
[hh][ii][jk][jl][jm][jn][jo][jp][iq][hr]C[A shimari seemed like a good idea right now though I did not like the way it was working with Q9...

On a side note - do you know an easy way of estimating the point value of certain areas/ moves  ? I have great trouble even getting a rough idea ...

----
About this shimari, again it's LITTLE. With the results of the left corners the stones at k10 and k4 became very actives and look at wihte moyo! You helped it to become stable. I think it was urgent to use the ajis at triangles in the upper left position with a reducing movement at A or B.

I also could prefer something more up like C];W[ph]TR[pe][qe]
[re][se][pf][qf][rf][sf][pg][qg][rg][sg][qh][rh][sh][pi][qi]
[ri][si][pj][qj][rj][sj]C[as there is no danger over white moyo, he tries to reduce yours.. is a logical movement. since he has lots of space. Remember that you can invade if there are 20 points free around.. as white has 24 here, he gets in: if you let him create a shape is an invation, but if at last he can take points away from you is a reduction.]

(;B[pf]C[This is the proper way to deal with the 4th line invasion , no ?
----------
Precisely reducing area for invading, now is just a reduction]
;W[qm]C[I did not believe this stone would be able to come alive with my surrounding strength so I immediately challenged it with the Q7 contact play.

Should I have cut off it's base to then chase it out, perhaps?

------------------ 
right this stone should get death,]
(;B[pm]C[... but you only touch weak stones to kill them, not to attack them. P7 was stronger and points to reduce white moyo by the extensio over 7th and 8th lines.]
;W[pl]
(;B[ql]C[this is very bad since you let the white stone connect with k10 and start creating  an influence area.]
;W[ol];B[rm];W[ke]LB[ol:C][pl:B][om:D][qm:A]C[From now until about move 86 the stones are played in quick succession, unlike the way it is usually done on DGS. This was because both me and my opponent were online at the same time for a few hours, and so we could play quickly. Unfortunately for me, I was not reading ahead enough due to this, and desaster ensued.
----
this  movement of white is simple: since A is gone and B,C are cutting over black groups and can easily create a strong influence with D.]

(;B[kd]C[seemed like the correct reply to L15 shoulder hit from above
---
good, but m16 sunds better to me.];W[md]C[... but this move left me a bit puzzled - should I try and connect underneath with N17 ?

-----
No, m16 is better. see variations. N17 is passive.]
(;B[le];W[ld]C[A logical cut.]
(;B[me]C[I think m 14 to (threaten to) trap the l15 stone would have been better


---
not as strong and you may think, see variation.];W[ne];B[kf]
;W[je];B[nf];W[nd];B[nh];W[ie]C[I was surprised about this stone - the ladder works for him anyway, so why add another stone ?
--- 
simply to be sure you can't win time by threats over that group, I think he has foreseen a bit of the next movements so he secured his weakest point there.]

(;B[pc]C[I took this chance to tenuki and protect my open corner, but with hindsight a further move in the fight was necessary

********************************
Right,  
this movement may be considered a big step into the defeat. to small and very unnecesary. this was the time to attack. see variations.]
;W[of]C[the only real virtue of this movement is that lets white stones to find a escape but as you saw, it also has a little trick. black still have here  some good movements. see variations.]

(;B[oe];W[mf]C[I would have been better off taking the P14 stone, that much I know now ...]
;B[lf]C[this group has no future at all... the main problem is that now is almost sure white will scape so your weak groups die.]

;W[oh];B[pg]C[Things go downhill from here ...];W[mh];B[ni]

;B[oi];W[qk];B[qn];W[pi];B[qj];W[qi];B[rj];W[ri];B[rk];W[mj]
C[Ok after this bad series of moves, I tried to , take a deep breath and look for the biggest point, and I think I found it (?)
I did not give myself good chances at this point, but I wanted to at least give it a stab...

--------------------
notice how white was just making the liberties bigger while was surrounding you your groups.

The game is over from here. white is clearly up.];B[mq]C[Is this a good extension from the shimari ? Or should I try to be bolder ?


you could even play m3.];W[bq]C[I dont know what rode me to play the next move..

this movement blocks your main eye point and also make use of the weakness of f2.]

(;B[ao]C[not that bad, may be even from a practical point of view is the right choice. the main point is that gives your unit 2 more liberties.]
;W[cp]C[Fortunately, I managed to wriggle my way out somewhat thanks to the aji at D5]
;B[an];W[bm];B[dn];W[eo];B[bl];W[dm];B[am];W[en];B[cq];W[br]
;B[bp];W[ck];B[cr]C[right,.. is sad to say but I found no way of saving f2. everytime I tried the whole group in the corner collapses.]
;W[er];B[dr];W[fs];B[bs];W[ar]C[Again, I tried to look for biggest plays since I thought the corner was pretty much settled]

(;B[rg]C[bad. the triangle group is alive because of the death of your square group, you could win a few more points making a moyo in the lower right center with m6 or p7 even.]
;W[cl];B[mo]C[Any better ideas to reduce his large center moyo ?

Thanks for the review
Suggestions are more than welcome.


AH

The reasons of defeat:
1. no invasion when necessary:  you gave white the times to settle his groups and to activate stones of too little influence making them bigger.
2. bad choice of josekis: the upper left selection of sequences was almost the worst you could.
3. no reduction movements: you tried to stabilize small points already sure instead of taking big ones.]
