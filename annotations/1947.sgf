C[Hi, this is polki, 6k* LGS, from Hong Kong. I lose
badly in this game >_<  Pls point out my mistakes.
Also, my opponent wanna see the review, so pls
review for BOTH sides.

Hi Polki,

I think this is a very interesting games, especially for a review... Both of you lack a good sense of "direction of play" in the opening... I will point this out in detail...

Direction of play is hard to understand, but it's worth the effort... if you can get a better feeling for the right direction in the opening, you will improve for sure...

I will review for both sides, as requested.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq]

(;W[po]LB[dd:A]C[maybe this move is not good, black take 3 corners
later

--

it's not a problem, that B gets a third corner, but you choose  the wrong corner for attack. in this situation, W wants to attack aound P16, to keep B low on the right side...

To illustrate this further, I added a possible continuation of the fuseki, where white takes the empty corner instead of attacking...]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[pj];B[cd];W[ed];B[ec]C[I would suggest a pincer here for B... E17 is also good, because it takes secure territory, but in combination with R16 a pincer works fine...

if you want to pincer, I would think about H16 or J16...];W[fc]
;B[dc];W[fd];B[cf];W[od]C[Is k16 better?

--

hard to say... both moves have good and bad aspects... if you play K16, Black will take the corner with P17 or O17... so I would prefer the actuall variation in the game...

on the other hand, B can make a severe pincer in the game variation, attack ing both groups...

I cannot tell which one is better, maybe just a matter of taste...]

(;B[ld]C[the idea of a pincer is good, but I don't like M16... it allows White to make an extension from his wall to K16... this is an excellent distance for White...

I would prefer playing L16, this attacks the 2 W groups more ballanced...]
;W[jd]C[This is the perfect extension for W... now the pincer stone gets under pressure...]

I don't :)

well, L18 looks normal, but K14 isn't bad either...because W has a defect at J16... Capturing the center stones in a ladder as shown in the actuall game is huge for Black, because he builds excellent power in the center...]

I don't think you can gain much in the center, because it is open around O9 and O5... that's why M3 is bigger...

thx a lot

--

You lost the game in the early midgame... I pointed out your general mistakes in the fuseki, which were the root for further problems...

You gave territory to black in exchange for influence... after B messed up your top, you were already behind... after this it was already hard for W...

The game was over after you lost the bottom left corner... it would have been ok, if you gave it to B, but losing the fight was too big... 

I hope you can gain something from the review... if you like reading books, I can suggest the excellent work "direction of play" from Takeo Kajiwara... I think it will help you overcome your fuseki problems...

enjoy,
Bommel
