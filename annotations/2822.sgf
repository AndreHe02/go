C[REQUEST FOR REVIEW



White: Raine [16k KGS\]

Black: oceanfrog [17k? KGS\]

Review for: White



This game turned out to be very close, and I barely eked out a victory, though I probably should have lost.  The trouble I had in this game was that I was relentlessly attacked and surrounded, and in a couple of instances, killed.  Thankfully my opponent was poor at turing a large potential moyo into territory, or I easily would have lost.



The reason for this, I think, was due to mistakes in fuseki.  I've studied little joseki (which will show), but I think I made some poor decisions concerning direction of play.  I also have a tendency do misread cutting points and miss when a weak group is getting attacked.  If I could get some fuseki and direction comments, I'd be happy.



Note:  This game was reviewed by us afterwards.  I left those comments in the game file, as well as the variations we discussed.

s: Hello, my name is Sam Tregar and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'm just a 7kyu (KGS and AGA) player myself, so please be aware that better players would likely disagree with my comments.  If you have questions please email me at sam@tregar.com or find me on KGS as samtregar.  I'll prefix all my comments with "s:".]
;B[qd]C[Raine [16k\]: Hello and good luck.];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq]
;B[cf];W[ch];B[ef];W[ck]C[My first error...  I abandon my corner stone and it gets surrounded.  F16 is better here, I think.

s: F16 is definitely the standard reply here.  The reason is that if black gets to play it then white might be dead in the corner.  Even if white lives he will be completely sealed in, which is considered a big loss.]
;B[fd]C[Raine [16k\]: Too timid on my part, perhaps...

Raine [16k\]: No, I think I needed to ensure ownership of the corner.

s: Good move.];W[ec]C[oceanfrog [17k?\]: hi



=====



Is there a better way here?  I don't see an effective cut for white.

s: you're in a difficult place here due to the earlier mistake.  I think this move a good way to start, but I can't say for sure that it will be successfull.]
;B[fc];W[be];B[ce];W[cd];B[bf];W[fb]C[Raine [16k\]: Seems like there's a bit of lag.]
;B[bd]LB[gb:A]C[s: This is very small. Black should seal white in with A.  There will be time later for little moves like this.]
;W[bc];B[ae]LB[oc:A][pj:B][po:C]C[s: this is only a good move if black thinks he can kill white here.  That seems unlikely as white has a number of ways to secure two eyes.  Given that this move is much too small for the opening.   Better to tenuki (play elsewhere) around A, B or C.]
;W[gb]LB[oc:A][qo:B][jp:C]C[s: I don't think this is needed now.  Instead, play a big move like A, B or C.]
;B[ic]C[s: this looks small to me.  It doesn't gain much territory or much influence.  Both players are too focused on this fight and are missing bigger plays.]
;W[co]LB[oc:D][pj:B][qo:C][jp:A]C[Here I'm aiming at K3, or an attack at R5 if he plays there first.  Striking at R5 now probably would have been a bit better though.

s: I think you're overconcentrated on the left side now.  You've played a lot of stones there for comparitively little profit.  Janice Kim 4p, the author of a good series of books, has a phrase: "rush to plant your flag."  It means you should try to be the first to play in the biggest area you can find.  That means a play around A or B in this case, I think.   Another option would be an attack on one of the corners, as in C or D.]
;B[ed]C[s: terrible move.  This is an end-game move at best.  It gains nothing.]
;W[db];B[ac];W[ab];B[ad];W[bb]
(;B[de]C[Raine [16k\]: I don't think this play was needed...  You're already very strong in that corner.

s: no kidding!  All these moves are much too early.];W[jq]C[s: this is a good move, although perhaps a little passive.  I would prefer an attack on the corner now, I think.]
;B[mq];W[qo]C[My second mistake.  N3 gives black a strong wall along the bottom, and playing close to that wall is a bad idea (I immediately get pincered and closed in).  Q6 is the best attack in this corner, I think.  Perhaps striking at P17 here is the best move.

s: This doesn't look like a mistake to me.];B[qm];W[oo];B[mo]
;W[np]LB[om:B][pm:C][nn:A]C[s: This is the bad move, I think.  You need to keep running to the center to live since you won't have room for two eyes here.  Maybe A, B or C.]
;B[mp];W[oq]C[s: Another bad move.  You don't have room for two eyes here so you have to run to the center.]
;B[or];W[nm]C[This is immediately cut off.  O6 would have been better, though it would make O4 and P3 useless.  P6 is probably best.

s: Yes.];B[nn];W[on];B[om];W[pm];B[ol];W[qq]LB[pl:A]C[s: Another stange move.  I would continue at A. It seems that you'll make two eyes for certain that way.]
;B[qr];W[rm];B[pl];W[pn];B[ql];W[rq];B[pp];W[qp];B[op];W[no]
;B[mn];W[nq]C[Raine [16k\]: You're a pretty good fighter...  I ended up with no influence here.]
;B[nr];W[rr];B[qn];W[po]
(;B[rn];W[pr]C[oceanfrog [17k?\]: that hurts];B[ll]C[s: very poor move.  Is black worried about the lone white stone dividing his groups?  That doesn't seem possible.  This move is in effect no better than a pass.]
;W[jo]C[I think this extension is important, because it blocks the wall at N6.

s: Yes, this is a good move.  However, you'll also need to do something about the upper right corner soon or risk a huge moyo developing.]
;B[jm];W[in];B[hl];W[fi]LB[oc:A]C[I don't know about this play.  I needed to cut black before he formed a diagonal across the board, but on the other hand, invading at G6 is now easy for black.

s: This isn't terrible, but I think there are much more urgent moves.  I would start with A.  You really don't want to let black secure the last corner!]
;B[gn]
(;W[gg]C[Raine [16k\]: Here's where I start overextending myself.  {smile}

s: This move doesn't seem to serve any obvious purpose.  It's not an attack on the black group - the group already has life.  It's not an extension of white's territory, as far as I can see.]
;B[hp]C[s: Good.  Black takes advantage of white's lack of focus.  This group is now under serious attack.]

(;W[hq]C[oceanfrog [17k?\]: you have improved a lot since july, but why did you drop from 11k?

Raine [16k\]: Agh, that's the issues with the rating system.

Raine [16k\]: I was 15k established three days ago.

oceanfrog [17k?\]: what if I cut here]
(;B[ip]C[oceanfrog [17k?\]: left

Raine [16k\]: You did.  The tower peep ensures a cut.

oceanfrog [17k?\]: G3]
(;W[jp]
(;B[iq];W[gq]C[Awful.  J2 is much better here, because it blocks the horrible cut coming when black plays J2.  I don't know if the K4 group is still strong enough to live, but completely avoiding the fight was a bad idea.]
;B[ir];W[im]C[s: This is a common mistake, adding more stones to a probably dead group to try to save it.  Instead, play someplace else.  It's possible that you'll see a way to save the group in the future.  If you don't at least you didn't make things worse!]
;B[il];W[gm];B[hm];W[hn];B[go];W[fm]C[Another wasted play, perhaps.  More importantly, it means that I've wasted six plays and a huge quantity of territory in the vicinity of K3.  Ugh.

s: I agree.];B[jr]C[s: This doesn't seem necessary.]
(;W[lr]C[oceanfrog [17k?\]: white's chance is very slim here

Raine [16k\]: Yeah, I'm dead.];B[mr];W[kr]LB[oc:A]C[s: Completely useless.  Black should ignore this and play A.]
;B[ks];W[ls];B[js];W[kq];B[jn];W[jk]C[Raine [16k\]: Here's where I finally realized it and started with forcing moves.

s: This play is just making black stronger without doing anything good for you.  I believe this is also "aji keshi".]
;B[jl];W[kk];B[kl]C[s: not needed.];W[gp];B[ho];W[nl]LB[oc:A]
C[s: Why try to save this stone?  Surely there are better things to do now!  Like A, for example.]

oceanfrog [17k?\]: could you go back];W[gf];B[he];W[nc]C[Next on the list is this invasion.  I think this play is okay, since P17 gives black a very severe pincer and playing out from the O10 group doesn't give me enough territory.

s: Finally!  This, or something similar should have been first on the list.  The proverb says "first corners, then sides, then middle."]
;B[hf]LB[qb:B][pc:A][qc:C]C[Raine [16k\]: I should have ignored this.

Raine [16k\]: This move does prevent that...

Raine [16k\]: And it activates my K9 stones.

Raine [16k\]: They need a lot of help.

oceanfrog [17k?\]: you have to move here

Raine [16k\]: Yup, on second thought, I like this move.

oceanfrog [17k?\]: or I can goj12];B[oe]
(;W[if]C[Raine [16k\]: This was expecting too much...  It abandons my O17 stone.



=====



This does have the feel of abandoning my stone at O17, and I probably should have followed up with L17 instead.  Still, J14 does close off the H15 group from the center.

s: Your invasion at O17 was very big.  Abandoning it means giving black an entire corner for free.]
;B[ke];W[kc]C[Hm.  L17 now the best I can do with black L15 in place]
;B[jd];W[ie]TR[kc][nc]C[Raine [16k\]: Useless on my part.

s: Yes.  You need to focus on saving the marked stones.  If they die black will certainly win.]
;B[id];W[jb];B[ib];W[me]C[Whoops.  Should have taken the corner.  I would instinctively play Q18, but is that the best invasion point?  Can I try for Q17 or even R17?  R17 is a bit far I think, but corners are strange and I am sometimes suprised at what's available.

s: Q18 looks good to me.  The others might gain more but are probably more risky.]
;B[ob]C[Raine [16k\]: Horrible exchange...];W[oc];B[pb];W[pc]
;B[qc]
(;W[nb]C[Another poor move, it abandons my stone at N15.  Extending at N14 is possibly better, but the cutting points M16, N16, and O16 are really bad.]

Raine [16k\]: Review?

oceanfrog [17k?\]: ok

oceanfrog [17k?\]: iI guess it will be half muku game if black ends correct

Raine [16k\]: {shrug}  Could have been...  I'm not very good at endgame either, actually.

oceanfrog [17k?\]: could you goback a little ?

Raine [16k\]: You have control.

s: My feeling was that black was in the lead during the opening and middle game up until the point when he allowed you to invade the upper-right.  All game he was in control of this area but somehow he didn't end up with much points there!  Throughout the game both players ignored large empty areas focusing instead on relatively small fights.

s: I think you would benefit from reading other people's games on GTL.  You'll see the kind of moves which are good for the opening and you'll learn to look for them.  Soon you won't be tempted to get caught up in "finishing"  a corner instead of playing a big tenuki.  Also, you should study life and death problems so that you won't add stones to already dead groups.

s: Thank you for allowing me to review your game.  I hope it has been helpful.]
