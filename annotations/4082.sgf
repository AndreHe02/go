C[H: Hello my name is Holger and I will be reviewing this game. for black.
All my comments will be preceded by an H

In summary, you concentrated too much on killing the white stones. You should instead look more at the overall board position and decide the best move from there. Also think of the other players reaction to your moves and how they will effect her position.]

;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re]C[What could I have done in the sequence 18-29 instead of the huge mistake I made there? I just wanted to defend the area below it.

H: This is not a mistake by you. You lost the corner but you have secured huge territory on the right side.]

;W[oo];B[on];W[mo];B[mn];W[ln];B[lm];W[kn];B[km]C[Was there any way to invade the huge moyo on the lower left?

H: It's quite late now. The moves 71 to 79 only strengthend white's position. Black only gained about 6 points]
;W[gh];B[bi]TR[cl][eq][fq][gq]C[H: This does not work. Black needs more space for an invasion. Try one of the marked positions.]
;W[bg]C[H: This move attacks on both sides. B11 has to be secured and white threatens to reduce the top substantially.]
