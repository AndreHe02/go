C[Hello thanks for reviewing this game. This game is the best game I think I have ever played, but I can't help but wonder there are mistakes i didnt see though I won.

[JB\] Hello, sure we all make mistakes :-) I hope I can help.
In summary, I think you have been a bit too agressive, but black did not take advantage because he did several big mistakes, even started a ko when he did not need to.
You need to keep a sight on the territory balance, playing safely when you are better, and taking account of weak and strong groups.]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[cp];W[qd];B[ep];W[cm]C[[JB\] Usually I would't play so close to black because it is quite strong here, probably D10 is adequate though I would play Q5 now.]
;B[ck]C[[JB\] Now I would go out with E7...];W[ci]LB[dl:a][el:b]
C[[JB\] ...because of black D8 (A) or E8 (B) now.];B[ek];W[em]
;B[fm]C[[JB\] G8 looks better.];W[fn];B[gm];W[en];B[el]C[[JB\] G9 looks better. Black lacks some shape concepts; this is good if G9 is black but this is not (still) the case.]
;W[gn]C[As you can see these stones are baseless because of C7. But black did not take enough advantage of this.]
;B[ce];W[df];B[cg];W[dh]C[[JB\] These moves are a bit dangerous for a kyu player, but if you read them out it is ok.]
;B[dg];W[eh]C[[JB\] See variation.]
(;B[cf];W[eg];B[cc];W[hd]C[[JB\] This one looks good, it makes good use of the relationship to R16 and E13 while affecting the center black group in some way.]
;B[nc];W[lc];B[pc];W[qc];B[jc]C[[JB\] I think black has first to support his stones in the top right before attacking, unless he plans to abandon them. We kyu players tend to be afraid of big moyos, but the white space at the top by no means is territory yet.]
;W[le];B[je];W[kg]C[[JB\] I am not sure about this one. Pressing the black group directly would hurt the 3 white stones (D17, D14 and H16). On the other side, going directly after the 2 black stones at O17 and Q17 would make them worth, so probably this one is correct.
As you can see, I cannot find big errors so far, though black has allowed white to play more actively.]
;B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[id]
(;B[ic]C[[JB\] I don't like this, an ampty triangle is rarely good. Connecting at K16 is safe, see variation.]
;W[jd];B[gd];W[fd];B[ge];W[fc];B[fe];W[ee];B[dd];W[ed];B[de]
;W[ef];B[db];W[gb]
(;B[kb]C[[JB\] Of course black has to play L16 here (see variation) unless he changed his mind again and wants to help O17-Q17.]
;W[kd]C[[JB\] L17 looks possible also. Black has to defend at M18.]
;B[mb]C[[JB\] Maybe M18 better (more eye space)];W[lb];B[la]
;W[mc];B[nb];W[kc];B[jb];W[he];B[gg]C[[JB\] Big mistake.]
(;W[gf]C[[JB\] Small. White could even play at H11. I put some variations, if in doubt H12 would work too.]
;B[gh]C[[JB\] Nonsense! There are plenty of bigger points.]
;W[fj]C[[JB\] This is the kind of move it looks difficult to say it is bad. It looks good because it aims the cutting point at F8 (though usually it is bad to play by a cutting point), separates the black stones and attacks G12-G13. It also prevents black G10 which would help black establish his stones and create a big influence diminishing white's.
But you may also play hane at H7, attacking the black stones while reinforcing yours, preparing D3 and gaining some influence on the right side which is still open. A stone directly on Q10 would be good too, given the white influence, to make territory on the side, but I think that assisting the white group on G6 is a priority.
Anyway this is quite subtle and your move has several good aims as I pointed out.]
;B[fi];W[ei];B[ej];W[gi];B[gj];W[fh];B[fk];W[hi];B[hj];W[ij]
;B[hk]C[[JB\] You did not play bad moves, but black made things quite easy for you.]
;W[qo]C[[JB\] I still prefer H6 (sente) and then you can choose. If you want to go on the side, I still prefer Q10 (Q9 maybe). If black now pincers your stone at Q8 your influence may be useless.
Meanwhile, if you play Q10 and black R5, the lower side is still open and you are in advantage. Your only weak group is G6.
At this point the territory balance is even, but you have a lot more influence. So it is worth to use it (not for making territory with it of course :-)]
;B[mq];W[hp]C[[JB\] As you can see, the exchange R5-N3 makes this move less powerful. See next variation.]

(;B[in];W[hm]C[[JB\] Because of J6 this is dangerous, a fight may arise. Notice that since you are in better position you should not welcome a fight.]
;B[hn]C[[JB\] And because of this point, your white group is in danger now.]

;W[bq];B[cq];W[br];B[bm];W[am];B[cn]C[[JB\] Black is attacking with a weak group. The same you did before. It is quite difficult to analyze such a fight, there are many variations and anyway you should not have started this fight.]

;W[dp]C[I found that without this move was my saving grace,  but at that moment i thought i did something wrong.

[JB\] Your group is dead with this move. SEE VARIATION.
In a semeai with no external liberties, the group with an eye wins, and you cannot make an eye (you would need 2 moves) while black has one.
Here you can play A3 instead, fighting a ko to make the eye you need by connecting at B1 if you win the ko. In that case this would be a seki.
The next black move was the wrong one.]
(;B[bs];W[ka];B[ja];W[cs];B[jk];W[kl];B[bs]C[[JB\] Again, black should have played A3.]
;W[km];B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[cs];B[eo];W[aq]C[[JB\] Good, ko now, or seki if you win the ko.]
;B[bs];W[kn];B[ln];W[cs];B[dn]C[[JB\] Wrong one! It is not a threat and gives you time to fill B1.]
;W[bs];B[kr];W[jr];B[lr];W[kk];B[nl];W[om];B[nn];W[on]C[[JB\] You could play P5 instead, but this from a local point of view. Probably this way is better, though it makes things easier for O8 group.]

;W[ok];B[nk];W[oj];B[oi];W[pi];B[oh];W[ph]C[[JB\] ...but instead he is helping you to make territory, while his stones cannot do anything against the bigh white influence. He is pushing you along the line of victory (4th), and at this point you won the game. He should have invaded before.]

This has been my last comment. The game was won many moves ago, because you play quite well anyway and black did not notice (or did not know how to punish) your errors.]
