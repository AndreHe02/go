C[Dear Reviewer,
in this game, I thought I was doing well, but I lost in the end by 1.5 points. I played black.
The game was very peaceful and there was almost no fighting.

H : Hello, I'm Herve. My comments will be marked with this 'H'.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[dj];W[jp];B[mp];W[gp];B[pj];W[op]
;B[oq]LB[pn:A]C[H : bad move. In this position, you want to attack the lone white stone. What is he doing here anyway? It's the place where black has the most stones!
Well, when you want to attack, you do NOT play contact moves.
A seems ok tome. It is patient, but attacks at the same time.]
;W[pq];B[pp];W[nq];B[np];W[or];B[oo]LB[pd:B][pj:A]C[H : now white got a ponnuki, black's wall is too close to the A stone, and is not working well since there is B. That's why you should not play contact moves on lone stones you want to attack. It only helps the opponent settle his stone.]
;W[oq];B[om]LB[jc:D][cf:B][qf:A][lq:C]TR[pj][oo][mp][np][pp]
[qp]C[H : this is way too crooked. Don't you feel you put too many stones at the same place?
You should play either : 
A or B if you want do develop one side
C if you want to put pressure on white.
D is also a big point, but A is better (uses the wall).
I'd go for C I guess, since it cuts the two white groups.];W[lq]
C[H : Now white is connected.];B[jd];W[ld];B[fd]LB[fc:A]C[H : I'd rather play at A here.]
;W[hd]
(;B[df];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[ff]C[Was this sequece (26 to 29) ok?

H : certainly not. Black allowed white to make Fifth line territory ! I made a few variations starting from move 25]
;W[gd];B[dm]LB[qf:A]C[H : too crooked again. A is better];W[dh]
C[H : Now white does it again ! Going to the place where there is the littlest room to live. He is certain to be attacked...]
;B[eh]LB[fh:C][ci:A][fj:B]C[How should I defend here? Would A have been a better response to white's invasion?

H : Your question is excellent. Because it shows that you don't know what is right to do in this situation. The white stone is so weak. Why should you defend anything? Attack !
A is good since white will be forced to run away, and you can chase him. You could also play B, or my prefered : C which is severe.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[cj];B[dk];W[ck];B[cl];W[cg];B[cf];W[bf];B[be]
;W[bg];B[cd]C[H : the result is pretty bad. White lived without trouble, while he should not have even dared to come in this place.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bl];W[bk]
(;B[gn]LB[bi:A]C[H : A dosn't look apetizing? ;-)];W[bi];B[eq]
LB[qf:A]C[H : somwhat KO, since going to the sansan would be very big now for white, but A is huge.]
;W[hg];B[jf];W[gf];B[gi]LB[qf:A]C[H : this move accomplishes nothing. A is still there.]
;W[hi];B[hj]C[H : no, see why next move];W[ii]LB[jd:A][jf:A]
C[H : white is happy to be strenghtened, and now can attack the A stones.]
;B[le]C[H : so you are now forced to lie on a lone white stone, which will (again) strengthen him]
;W[me];B[lf];W[mf];B[pg]LB[kd:A]SQ[jd][le][jf][lf]C[H : Now the square group is under atttack. It would be better to do something about it. If white were to play A, your eye shape would be somewhat gone. Play at A yourself.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[oe];B[qf];W[qe];B[pe];W[re];B[rf];W[pf];B[og]
;W[pe]C[H : bad exchange. White got a huge corner, while you could still invade at sansan before move 68]
;B[mg];W[kd];B[ke];W[jc]TR[hg][hi][ii]SQ[jd][ke][le][jf][lf]
C[H : white got a huuuuge upper side. It is the result of the triangle stones being strengthened, and so the square stones attacked.]
;B[lj];W[jm]LB[hq:A]C[H : now white and black are "battling" for the few points in the center. But it's usually wrong to seek points there. Yose moves are on the sides of the board. A seems to be a big point right now, for black to play.]
;B[lm]LB[jo:A]C[H : not aggressive enough. At least threaten to cut the white stone, or even better, cut it and launch a fight, you are strong in the area ! Play at A for example.]
;W[lp];B[mo];W[hl];B[fl]LB[bb:4][se:1][hq:2][qq:3]C[Here I wasn't sure where to play

H : well this is a move not worth much, if we speak about yose. There are no points here, and it is totally gote. You could play at the numbers (1 being my prefered and so on).]
;W[gk];B[fk]C[H : don't defend this, it's too small.];W[gj]
;B[fj];W[hn];B[hk];W[gl];B[ik]LB[jk:A]C[H : yes, but no... if white plays A, your three stones are gone.]
;W[gh];B[il];W[im];B[kk]LB[bb:D][se:A][qq:B][gr:C]C[H : ok, so here there is an important point for yose : you didn't make ANY point with that sequence. Neither did white. You just saved 4 stones, but there were not even there in the first place. So basically, you play stones on dame points. Worth zero points. Good yose points are the letters.]
;W[fo];B[eo];W[fn];B[fm];W[hm];B[gm];W[en];B[dn];W[fp];B[go]
;W[ho];B[hr]SQ[ep]C[H : too far away, this should not work, because you have the square weakness. see variation a few moves later.]

;W[mn]
(;B[nn];W[mq];B[no];W[ln];B[mm];W[ki];B[li]LB[bb:B][se:A]C[H : don't answer this ! this move is worth 1 point in gote, while A is a good 6 points in sente, and B is around 4 points, also sente.
Sente is very important, if you only answer your opponent's moves, you cannot win.]

[km:B]C[H : Your stone is not in atari, so this move is 0 points, gote. There are still a lot of other moves to play.]

;W[cr];B[br];W[bs];B[dr];W[aq];B[cs];W[ie];B[lk]LB[kj:A]C[H : If you play A, you don't lose a point. It's important, and you should know it now sionce you loste by one point.]
;W[if];B[af];W[ag];B[ae];W[fg];B[eg];W[gg];B[kj]LB[lk:A]C[H : now what's the deal with having played A before? Looks weird, no?]

[sp][aq][cq][sq][ar][cr][sr][as][bs][ds][es][ss]C[H : general advice : 
- Do not attach to weak opponent stones, you should attack from a bit further away
- in the endgame, be careful.... there are usually not many points in the center, it's better to concentrate on the sente moves on the sides.
- try to think about attacking more than defending, especially when your stones are strong around.

I hope that this will be useful to you. Do not hesitate to ask questions to me by e-mail.]

(;W[de];B[ce]C[H : etc...])
(;W[dq];B[ep];W[cp];B[do];W[cr]SQ[gq][fr][hr][gs]C[H : or white could simply do that... Now what? My guess is that black's corner is gone, and that the square stones will not live.]

(;W[ak];B[bh]C[H : here white is dead.])
(;W[bh];B[ak]LB[am:A][bm:B]C[H : it's a ko, but a difficult one, since white has two local threats by escaping at  A then B. But it's still a flower viewing ko... ;-)]

(;B[gd];W[hb];B[he]LB[gp:B][jp:A]C[H : This could be one interesting variation, if only the A white group was cut.]
)
(;B[hb];W[gd];B[jb]LB[fd:B][ld:A][pd:A]C[H : this looks ok. Black is settled, the power of the white A stones is nullified, and B has a lot of aji.]
