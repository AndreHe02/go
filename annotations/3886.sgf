AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi,

When I was playing this game,after 30-40 moves, I thought, that I can't win it. And I was very surprised when the score showed, that I won by 9,5 point.
I would be very greatful if you could show me what allowed me to win the game. I think that the ko gave me this chance, I played it  on purpose, because I've never played ko before seriously.
This was my first game on 3 stones, so I didn't know, how to play that too.

Thaks for review.
Paul



Hello Paul ^__^

Basically, we win a game because our opponents make more mistakes than we do. Therefore, in this review, i will show you where/what are your mistakes.

KO fighting is a difficult issue! even for a dan player. So, if possible, i would suggest you to avoid playing it. What you should focus is the fundamental of go.

Hope it helps
Jane];W[cd]LB[ec:B][ed:A]C[Jane:

The concept of a handicap game is for black to stress on building up influence and playing a fighting game as black's already had more stones on the board. So the key is to attack (not kill) white. Keep white groups seperated and make them live as small as possible. 

Normally, b approaches at A or B is natural. I will show you some simple josekis here.]

(;B[cj]C[Maybe better move would be Q19 or K4.

Jane:

I don't understand Q19.. i think probably you mean Q10 and K4. Both are ok and better than C10.]
;W[ec]
(;B[pj]C[Jane:

Q10 is ok. IMO, K4 is a bit better. It works together with C10]

Black at A is good. It works fine with your moyo.

No M10/H10 are not good. They are meaningless.
