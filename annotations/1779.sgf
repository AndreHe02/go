C[I'm embarassed to say that I neglected to set the right handicap here.  I should have taken 4 stones against white.

SC:  I will preface my comments with my initials SC:

SC:  Overall, black tends to make small defensive moves when a counter attack would accomplish much more.  Be sure to look through all of the variations I have added as well as my comments.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dq];W[pd];B[ck]C[SC:  This is move aims to make a big Moyo on the the left side. This is a fine opening strategy, but it is best to stay with a strategy once you have started with it.  So, choose carefully.]
;W[fc];B[df]C[SC:  This continues the Moyo.];W[db];B[cc];W[ic]
C[SC:  Both sides have about the same amount of territory gained here.  Black ends with Sente since there is already a stone at C9.  This means that black gains more from this exchange.]
;B[jp]SQ[pj]C[Not sure if this is better than invading the opposite side at R10 or approaching the corner in the lower left.

SC:  This is not the biggest point currently.  I think a move at Q10 would be better here.  Black doesn't want white to create a large Moyo on the right to oppose Black's on the left.  Approaching either corner on the right is also good.]
;W[gp];B[eo]C[Is this too high?  Perhaps a corner enclose at C5 or D5 would be better?  Or should I have tried to make a base on the lower right?

SC:  I think C5 or D5 is better.  Black wants to keep the stone at G4 from getting a base.  Black's stone at K4 can always run into the center if it can't get a base.]
;W[gn];B[co]TR[dm]SQ[eo][dq]C[I'm told this "dog's head" is a bad shape, but I don't recall why.

SC:  The three marked stones are too close together.  This is not efficient.  Playing at the triangle would also keep white out of the left side and be better shape.]
;W[lp]
(;B[jn]C[SC:  Black runs out into the center.  Black could also counter attack white.  See the variation.]
;W[hl];B[ln]TR[ko]SQ[lm]C[SC:  I think that M7 is better.  The current shape is vulnerable to a white play at L5.]
;W[no];B[nm]C[At this point I felt black is no longer in danger

SC:  This seems safe enough for now.];W[pm];B[qf];W[jl];B[ll]
TR[gp][gn][hl][jl]SQ[lm][mk][jn][jp]C[It seems I didn't believe it enough, though.  Looking at this, it seems that a double appoach at O16 or O17 woul have been bigger than continuing to run out in the middle like this.

SC:  Again, Black's stones are too close together.  Imagine four black stones at the squares.  Black would be farther out into the center while using one less stone.  This means an extra move to use at R11.  Also remember that white's marked lower side stones also have no base.  Black has been passivly running away and has never tried to put any pressure on these stones.]
;W[ol];B[nl]SQ[kj]C[SC:  This looks like an attempt to make an eye.  Black doesn't need to make eyes in the center yet.  L10 would start to attack white's weak group.]
;W[kr]
(;B[iq]TR[nq]SQ[kr][lp][no][pp]C[I felt that I needed to make stronger connections here, but this looks a little slow if I felt like connecting t o the lower left.

SC:  Black decided long ago to run this group out into the center rather than try to make a base on the lower side.  Don't do a partial job of running into the center then change to making a base.  As much as possible, finish a plan.

If Black really wants to make a base for this group, then attack white. White's marked stones are only loosely connected and probably can be cut apart.  O3 looks like the key point to start attacking these stones.  See variation.]
;W[gr];B[fq]SQ[lj]C[SC:  This just forces white to connect.  Black still needs to run the lower side group out into the center.  M10 is good.]
;W[gq];B[fp]C[I had sente, and I did this?   Maybe I thought G5 wouldn't work to separate white.

Still, the upper right double appoarch is being ignored.

SC:  G5 won't work to seperate white.];W[em];B[dn]TR[ek][qi]
SQ[cm]C[This seems wrong to me now.  Is there a better placement to stay connected to C9?  Would D8 work?

SC:  C7 looks like the best way to stay connected.  E9 is also a good local option since it starts to secure more territory on the upper left side.  Finally, R11 is still good.  Remember that your best move may not be right next to your opponent's last move.  Also, if your opponent wants to cut apart two of your strong groups, don't worry.  Let the cut happen and take profit elsewhere.]
;W[ir]C[SC:  Now white's two lower side groups are connected together. This makes the stones around G6 strong while black's stones around M6 are still weak with no base.  It is now too late for black to attack the stones around G6.  All that is left is running away or being surrounded.]
;B[go];W[ho];B[fo];W[pj]SQ[iq][jp][jn][nm][nl][ll][ln]C[SC:  Black keeps making small, half-hearted attempts to run the marked stones out into the center.  Meanwhile, white is making territory up the left side while pressuring this group.  White is gaining a lot and black is not.  One of the main reasons black lost this game was because of this group.  White gained much territory while pressuring this group.  Black eventually saved the stones but got no territory from them.  I have previously noted some places where black could have counter attacked as a way to help save this group.  Be sure to review those variations.]
;B[qc]SQ[qd]C[Does this invasion make more sense that the double approach? J17 looks awefully far away...

SC:  I would prefer the double approach here.  With this move, I would expect White to seperate black by playing at the square. By the time black finishes living in the corner, white will have a wall facing down the right side and the stone at R14 will be dead.]
;W[qh]C[SC:  This is bad for white.];B[pf]SQ[qd]C[Now it appears black is on the defensive rather than continuing with the corner invasion.  I must have felt the stone at R14 was threatened.

SC:  Even if R14 is threatened, playing at R16 is a better way to defend both R14 and R17.  Here again we have very small moves aimed to running out into the center.  Running away must be done with bigger, looser moves like small knight's moves.  You have to be willing to risk some of your stones being cut off as long as you can save the rest.  Here, however, black doesn't need to run.  Just connect to the corner stone.]
;W[mc]C[Now black has lost the chance to do anything at the top, right?

SC:  Black won't get any territory on the top.  A reducing move at L17 is possible.  Black would have to expect to sacrifice some stones to make a reduction work.  See the variation starting next move.]

(;B[rg]C[SC:  R16 still better.  Also, see variation.];W[rh]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qa]C[This looks too timid.

SC:  Black does need to prevent the Atari at R18.  I would prefer the solid connection and play at R18 here.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pe]SQ[di][qq][lj]C[SC:  This is very small.  All of spaces marked with squares are better.  See variation.]
;W[di]C[SC:  White sees that black would like to play here, so white plays here first.]
;B[dj]SQ[cg]C[I was afraid playing a contact move would make white stronger here, but I was more afraid of white having too much room here.

SC:  I think that C13 is better.  This is a wide enough gap for white to seperate Black's side groups.  Accept this and work on securing what you can.  This contact play will make white stronger and thus is a bad idea.]
;W[fi];B[ff]TR[gk]SQ[di][fi]C[SC:  This move doesn't do much.  If black wants to cut off the two marked white stones, then G9 is the right side to focus on. C13 is still the best move locally.  R3 is still the best move on the board since it will gain much more than black can lose of the left side.]
;W[bi];B[ci]C[SC:  Don't try to cut here.  This is small and just encourages white to move up towards B14 and reduce black's top left territory.]
;W[ch];B[bj];W[cj];B[od];W[ci]C[White doesn't like to fight ko here?]
;B[oc];W[bk]C[Well, it looks like I made a mistake earlier because the black stone at B10 dies  and it doesn't look like I got anything out of it.

SC:  Black played several contact moves here and managed to strengthen the weak white group without any benefit to black.]
;B[cl];W[aj];B[bl]C[The cutting point at D9 is probably more important to protect that this incursion, right?

SC:  Actually, this move is better locally since it secures around 6 points.  Connecting at D9 saves only one stone.  R3 is still better than either of these choices.]
;W[dk]
(;B[ej]C[This escape fails.  What would be better?

SC:  Better is to sacrifice the stone and do something worth more.  See the variation for a good local option.  R3 is still a good option as well.]
;W[fk];B[ei];W[eh];B[fh];W[ek];B[ig];W[ij];B[nj];W[kj];B[lj]
SQ[mh][oh]C[Does it make more sense to start a fight here or connect to the upper right?

SC:  Black won't get any territory in the center and this group has no base on the side.  White's central group is connected to the lower right side, however, so it is stronger than black's center group.  Thus, black should keep running and connect to the upper right.  N12 and P12 are both good options.]
;W[ge];B[fe]C[SC:  B14 is better locally to defend the upper left corner.]
;W[je];B[le]C[SC:  This is a reasonable reducing move.  However, B14 and R3 are still worth much more.]
;W[ld];B[ne];W[hh];B[gg];W[oh];B[nh];W[jh];B[hg]SQ[bf][cb]C[I'm not sure I needed to connect here yet.  Would continuing right with K13 or L13 be better?

SC:  Black doesn't need to connect the left top group to anything else, so these moves don't really accomplish much.  B14 and C18 are better ways to help this group.]
;W[lg]SQ[kg]C[Black's upper right group looked largely cut off when I was playing, but would a move near P13 make sense here?

SC:  Again, black can gain more by attacking.  You don't always attack to kill.  Generally, you attack to make some other gain while all your opponent can do is defend.  Here black can attack at L13 to connect the central and top right groups.  As mentioned before, connecting the top left group is not necessary.  See variation starting next move.]

(;B[eg]SQ[cb][bf][qq][kg][ng][fr]C[SC:  This is small.  The marked moves are all worth more.  See variation.]
;W[dh];B[dg]C[I don't know the purpose of this move.];W[gh]
;B[bf]C[If I'm going to ignore the atari at F13, I probably should have found something better to do than this.

SC:  This is worth more than the one stone at F12.];W[fg];B[ng]
C[This is not a ko threat.];W[fh]SQ[ig][hg][gg]C[So white wins the ko

SC:  But white wins very little.  If white wins a 1 point ko while black makes a two point move elsewhere, then white has actually lost.  A black stone at B14 is worth much more than white gained with this ko.  Black does need to worry about white cutting off the three marked stones.]
;B[bg]SQ[gf]C[I'm not making territory here.  Looking at the board, this isn't my weakeast group.

SC:  Connect at G14 to save three stones and reduce white's center.]
;W[ni];B[mi];W[oi];B[mk]TR[cb][fr]SQ[kk][ok][on][mo][kq][im]
[ke][ki][gd][kg]C[SC:  This connects, but also fills in a potential black point. All of the squares look like Sente moves for Black.  Both of the triangles are valuable Gote moves for Black.  Finally, R3 is still good.]
;W[mh];B[li];W[mn];B[mm];W[ko]SQ[ln][jn][jp]C[SC:  Remember back at move 19 when I said that this shape was vulnerable to a white attack here?  Poor shape in the begining may not cause trouble for the next 100 moves, but it WILL eventually be trouble.]

(;B[jo]C[This is probably the wrong side to connect the double peep, as these four stones eventually die.  (Or at least, I think they would have died.  I resigned before then.)

SC:  Don't just think defense.  Always look for a way to attack while accomplishing your current goal.  See variation.]
;W[kn];B[km];W[jm]C[I think black's four stones J3 and K4-K6 are dead now.  There doesn't seem to be enough room to make two eyes.  Of course, white has a lot of holes at the bottom, so maybe it's possible.

SC:  They are dead.  Black can still get some use from them by playing Atari at M5 and N5, then starting to reduce the corner at N4. See variation starting next move.]

(;B[kl]C[SC:  See variation.];W[lo];B[nk];W[lm];B[mg];W[lh]
;B[ln]SQ[gf][nb][qq][fr][cb]C[SC:  This is a most another 1 point ko.  Don't bother until all other moves worth more points have been played.  All of the squares are better choices.]
;W[fr];B[er];W[cb];B[bc]C[SC:  Now white has played two of the spaces I pointed out for black.]
;W[ed];B[ee];W[dc];B[ce]C[SC:  I don't think black has to play here.]
;W[qg];B[re]C[SC:  Connecting solidly at S14 prevents a white Atari at T13.]
;W[sg];B[rf]C[Is connect here better than T14, allowing white to start a ko?

SC:  Yes,  the ko isn't worth enough to waste ko threats on. Save them for a bigger ko.]
;W[sf]C[SC:  This is worth 1 point in Gote for white.  Black should be glad white gives up Sente for this.]
;B[se];W[sh];B[qq]C[I never know when to invade the 4-4.  Any rules of thumb?

SC:  A 3x3 invasion gives your opponent a lot of outward facing influence.  Usually, this influence is worth more than the corner points gained by the invasion.  The time to invade a 3x3 point is when this outward influence won't do your opponent much good. Here, white already has a wall of sorts from L2 to R11.  Building another white wall inside this one won't do white any good.  So, only black will gain from this invasion.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qr]C[I couldn't find this in my joseki resources.  Is this move a mistake for white?  If so, how would I respond?

SC:  Yes, I think it is a mistake.  Black should move up the right side now.  See variation starting next move.]

(;B[rr]C[SC:  See variation.];W[pr];B[sq];W[rs];B[ss]C[SC:  This is very bad.  Just move up the right side.]
;W[qs]C[SC:  This is also bad.  White should capture at T2.]
;B[rn];W[sr];B[rq];W[ss]
(;B[po]C[SC:  R6 is better.  See variation.];W[qn];B[on]C[SC:  Very bad.  Black is abandoning the seven stones in the corner to save the one stone at Q5.  An invasion should expect to sacrifice some stones.  If lose half of your invading stones while the other half live, you still have a sucessful invasion.]
;W[sp];B[rp];W[rm]C[I resigned here on the assumption that the black group in the lower right is dead, and losing it would be too much.

Perhaps that's premature, as white's territory at the top is still only loosely sketched out.

Would it have been possible to invade/significantly reduce white on the bottom?

SC:  Yes, an invasion at R3 has been possible for most of the game.  Be sure to look through the variations I have added that demonstrate this.]
