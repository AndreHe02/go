C[Hello, I'm only 23kyu so there are some obivous mistakes me and my opponent made but I think this game might be a good example for how to live in a corner and opponent territory invasion. However, I'm sure both could be done way better so this is why I would like to have this game reviewed.]

;W[dc];B[jp];W[jd];B[qj];W[cj]LB[ak:1][bk:2][ck:3][dk:4]C[Maybe to defensive/passive fuseki? Would D10 be better?

I don't think this fuseki is too passive. Black (B) and White (W) have spread their stones evenly over the board, which is the aim of fuseki.
Of course, this spread does not mean W will get the top half of the board. B can easily play in the top half. (But that is OK. W can also easily play in the bottom half.)

C10 and D10 serve the same purpose, so it is only a matter of style. 

[The next part may be a little harder to understand. Don't worry if it doesn't help you a great deal now, it's just for your information. :-)\]
C10 is on the 3rd line. The 3rd line is perfect for making territory. D10 is on the 4th line. The 4th line is good for making influence. Depending on what results you want, you can play C10 or D10. Here, territory moves or influence moves are equally as good. However, as you get stronger, you will notice that 3rd line will be better in some circumstances, and vice versa.]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[cm]C[D8 is weak. It lacks liberties and must be strengthened if it is to be useful to W. For stones to be strong, they must have sufficient liberties. D8 must connect to C10 to support itself. (By connecting, you have more liberties and more strength.)]

Summary:
1. make sure your stones can either connect, or make life by itself.

2. when blocking your opponent, step back and make a barrier so your opponent cannot spread far.

3. Be careful on line 1. See the examples of the tricky things that can happen.

It was an enjoyable game to review, and i hope i have made useful comments that will benefit you in your future games.]
