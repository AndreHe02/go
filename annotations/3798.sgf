C[Hallo!

This is one of my last games on KGS. Feel free to judge it. To make it easier, I have detailed questions to certain circumstances within the game. You do me a favour if you could answer them.

If there are other things to say or mistakes etc., please, only talk about that if you feel a strong reason (e.g. heavy mistakes) for it. Usually I don't get too much benefit if better players overload me with advises ;). It's better for me to concentrate on the real important things.

Thx for your effort in advance !!

Hello,
I didn't play for a long long time, but I will try to help you the best that I can.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[cc];B[kq];W[dn]C[What's the reason for White D6? I mean with the following play Black gets some real comfortable territory. Wouldn't be White C6 more aggressive and effective here for White or what could be a reason to play that?

Answer :
The formation in the bottom is made to invit white to invade it and form territory during a chase. White doesn't seem to want to play this kind of game, so he try to over concentrate your stones and bet the game on the influence of its stones.

C17 is an invitation toplay around D16 and been chased also.D6 will be able to help more if it is on the 4th line.]

[bm][cm][dm]C[Isn't the white stone at C10 one line too far? Well, I know that invading within the triangled area isn't senseful now, but just for my understand of playing technique: Could you show me a sequence to split white (if it's possible at all)?

Answer :
The stone is too far, yes.]

;W[nf];B[ng];W[mf];B[mg];W[lf]C[Is it alright to push white that way? I mean white gets some real comfortable territory.]
;B[pl]C[What do you think about this move? I wanted to make sure I get something decent territory around Q4 and wanted to make white Q11 harder to live/escape.


This tactic is good, but risky.];W[lg]

;W[li];B[mj];W[lj];B[mk]
(;W[lk]C[Ok, now there is another crucial point: Where do I play next? I have the feeling I need a reduction or invasion move to reduce the white's moyo...but where is the best and safest location? Please show me an example-sequence.]

Answer :
yes, not bad.

White could have been a little more combative, for example with a move in K3.]
