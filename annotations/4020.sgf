AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hi 

My name is Slava Kozin (zloy), and I will make a review for this game for Black.

-------

this is a game I played on IGS with a 3 stone handicap.

It is quite hard for me to ask any concrete questions, but I would like to know where I made some obvious mistakes.

Perhaps in general, you could give me some pointers in which areas I should focus my study on.

Thanks in advance for your time reviewing my game.];W[pp];B[dj]
LB[cj:B][ck:A]C[When you play as Black a game with a handicap, you basically have to play a defensive game. You already have an advantage at the beginning of the game. Just try to keep this advantage through the game. "Star" points are good, but I prefer "A" or "B".]
;W[fq];B[er]LB[dq:B][dr:A]C[It is OK, maybe a little too aggressive. Just try to protect what you already have.]
;W[cn]
(;B[en]C[You just pushed White to make a base. To get an access to the center is a good idea, but first you have to save your corner. You already have an advantage (handicap). Just keep it.]
;W[bp]
(;B[co]C[The attack is a bad idea - White will build a base.]
;W[bo]
(;B[cp]TR[co][dp]C[This is a very bad shape for Black - Black is overconcentrated, has very few degree of freedom. This shape does not make any eyes either.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cr]
(;B[dn]C[It is too small for Black. Black lost this corner, but still has two others.]
;W[cm]
(;B[cl]C[Black plays to aggressive. Black does not need to attack White.]
;W[bl];B[dm]TR[dn][en]C[Bad shape];W[ck];B[dl];W[bk]
(;B[cj]C[Try not play side to side with more experienced player - you will loose in close fighting because of the difference in skills]
;W[fr]
(;B[ep]TR[cl][dl][dm][dn][en][co][cp][dp][dq]C[Black is overconcentrated here, but from the other side - Black has a nice wall. Try to use this wall. Push White on this wall.]
;W[dr]
(;B[eq]C[Just give this stone to White - It is not important. You can get more scores in other places. You do not have save all stones to win game.]
;W[es];B[fp]C[Again this move is too small, makes Black overconcentrated, and does not make a good shape.]
;W[hq]
(;B[gp];W[kp];B[pj]C[it is much better.];W[io]C[You can just ingnore this move]

(;B[hp]C[You are helping White to take a bottom. This move is really small.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[jo];B[jp];W[kn];B[jq];W[gq];B[ir];W[hr];B[jr]
;W[gs];B[jd]C[Good];W[hm]
(;B[hn]C[Do not play "contact" go.];W[in];B[ho];W[cf]C[You should not ignore this move. Protect the corner]

(;B[im];W[jm];B[il];W[fc]C[Now pay attention - White use the same tactics to attack your corner as before, but this time you have missed one move. Should you learn on mistakes?! Try to study joseki - Openning combinations in the corner: http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm]
;B[fe];W[ic]
(;B[id]C[Wrong direction - It is better to take sides - more scores and easier to protect.]

[js]C[Game 58 raga2504 is removing @ T15
Game 58 raga2504 is removing @ R17
Game 58 raga2504 is removing @ N3
You have typed done.
tetubosi: 128.5 to raga2504: 41.0

Summary:
1. You have to study good and bad shapes. Try to understand why good is good, and bad is bad.
2. Study Joseki (opening in the corner): http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm
3. Take corners first, than sides, than center.
4. Try to recognized which points are more important at every moment in the game. Make a big move instead of small. I see that you can recognize these moves. Probably you just played too fast. You do not have  to save all stones and answer all moves of your opponent to win the game. Try to play slow games. Take time to think.
5. Learn about balance on the board. Your stones are overconcentrated. Learn how to use walls (it is connected with the balance on the board). Probably some books will help you here.
6. In the handicap games try to play more defensively, not very aggressively. Keep the distance - it prevent from close fighting where you will have disadvantage. To improve you fighting skill, try to solve go problems: goproblems.com 

Hope it will help you to improve your skill.

Thanks.])
