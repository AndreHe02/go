C[Hello and thanks for reviewing my game.
I felt as if I was ahead most of the game but I ended up losing my 2.5 pts.
I'm not really sure what went wrong so any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I will give this a whirl i have never done this before and i am only around 12k so there’s no way my review is going to be perfect but might be a good suggestion.]

It looks about impossible to kill white from here but in varation i do see a way with white next move to get a KO or maybe kill it look at variation]

in a real game i might be able to make life in there as white but i really don’t know its more of who i was playing to say 100% there is a path i can't but i also can't say there isn’t one.]
