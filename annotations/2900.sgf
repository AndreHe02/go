C[Josh: This was a tight game and well-played in my opinion. I have offered a few comments through the game about things you may wish to consider. There are two ways in which white could improve: (1) attack from a distance so that you do not help to strength your opponents groups as much, and (2) think more carefully about endgame moves, white gave away numerous points in the endgame making it much closer than it should have been.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[oq];B[op]LB[dd:A]C[J: Playing near D16 is probably bigger than responding to whites kakari.]
;W[np];B[oo];W[no]C[J: White would play Q3 in the common joseki. It seems that O5 is a poor move because it is "pushing the cart from behind" i.e. black can always extend and stay in front.]

(;B[nn];W[pq];B[qq];W[kq];B[qk];W[dc];B[nc]C[J: A solid move, but I wonder if it is too slow? If I were playing black I would prefer to play somewhere on the left to disrupt white framework.]

(;W[dd]C[J: I don't like this move too much. The problem is that you are letting black build a moyo on the top.]
