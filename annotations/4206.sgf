R: Old days R7 is the first choice, but nowadays many professional players do  as your selection.
 Both players did perfectly until this move.];W[mq]C[I think this is not good because I can defend H3 invasion point.
R: As shown in next depict, this point is weekness of the black  point . if Ko of white site is strong, then  this would be vital point.]

R:b31 is a standard move. 
I think 16-c is a move.]

(;B[bh]C[R: 73 is  a bad move, must connect 13-2,  because black connect in next move.  That means the order of move is opposite.  if white comes c-12, then black responds b-12.]
;W[oq];B[oo]C[R:In this move black lost one move. 
In Kou it is so often seen, therefore it is very important  in Go game.
I explain it again.];W[ns];B[nq]C[R: If black connect the former branch (black 73) p-5 is vacant, But now black stones is in. That means two lost (one move  and one point) , even if black had won in Kou.]
;W[ch];B[cg];W[oq];B[dj]C[R: I think white  must  respond  this move.  For th e central part  of black became so  strong by capture of 4 white stones]

R.:As  white 3 stones are connected to upper left corneris,  .]

R: This time white did a mistake. O17 or something which makes separation of two black stones is suitable.]
