C[frs (19k): I played White in this KGS game, and I ask you for a review.

I've added a few comments and variations to this SGF.

But I can't summarize, what is needed to improve my Go skills. Thus I ask you to provide a few hints where and when "my priority settings of goals" should be adjusted.

In particular I'd like a review about the missed chance for a ko fight (at move 207) and the lost White group (around D4).


Thank you very much in advance,

Frank (frs)

tsjanl:

Hello Frank,

Thank you for sending in this game. Although it is a game you won (not recommended for the Go Teaching Ladder), there are a lot of interesting points to comment on.

I'll concentrate this review on what I think is your main weakness: missing the urgent moves. You are a good attacking player, but forget too often that you need to secure your groups beforehand.

I will not give too much variations of fights. Firstly: I am sure that I would make a lot of mistakes in it, secondly: you can learn more at this moment from strategic principles.

Regarding myself: I play for one and a half year now, and am somewhere around 10k (Dutch ranking). A stronger player will find a lot of mistakes in this review. You can find me at KGS and Sensei's Library under the name tsjanl.

I hope you'll enjoy the review. If you have questions or remarks, feel free to email me.

Jan-Willem Swane];B[pd]C[tsjanl:

Before we begin, I'll start with some strategic points that will form the background of this review.

Especially in the beginning of the game, you can ask yourself the following questions at every move.

1) Do I have a weak group? If yes: make it more secure.
2) Does my opponent have a weak group? If yes: harrass it.
3) Is there a big move? If yes: play it.
4) Is there a move on the border of two moyos? If yes, play it.

How do you recognize a weak group? 
1) A weak group hasn't a lot of directions to expand to
2) A weak group has not enough eye shape

There is one situation where urgency is absolute. When two weak groups are neighbouring each other, there is no other choice than attacking from your weak group the weak group of the other. It is so important, because you do two things at the same time: making your group more secure and threathening the other group. 

Failing to do that in two situations gave you a lost position. Only your fighting skills made you save the day.]
;W[dp];B[cd];W[qp]LB[pp:B][pq:A][qq:C]C[frs: Right direction? Or at A ?

tsjanl: Your move is OK. A, B and C are other options.

At your level the first four moves shouldn't be too much of a concern. Playing in two corners at 4-4, 4-3 or 3-3 is almost always ok.]
;B[id]LB[ic:A]C[tsjanl: Black is playing the high chinese fuseki (although a move at A (low chinese) is more usual). The idea of the chinese is to threathen to create a big moyo (potential territory) at the top. In that way he is inviting white to invade. Black is hoping to gain while chasing the white invading stones.]
;W[qf]LB[ec:A][kc:P][nc:C][qc:G][ed:B][cf:I][df:H][nf:E][of:D]
[ng:F][pi:L][qi:M][cj:R][dj:Q][pj:N][kp:J][kq:K][oq:O]C[frs: Where should White play?

tsjanl: Your choice is a good one. 

Of your suggestions I do like:
N: works good with your stone in the lower right;
J or K: copycatting black
O: securing the corner and threathening to extend to N

Other interesting possibilities are Q and R, which I added.

Moves I do like less:

G: it gives Black the opportunity to build a strong wall towards his other two stones
A, B, C and P: it's better to attack from the open side at this moment
D, E, F: too high
I and H: from the uninteresting side, because C16 is low on the left
L and M: too far away from R4 and Q16];B[qh]LB[nc:C][qc:B][of:A]
C[tsjanl: Now that black has played a pincer, white has three main possibilities: A (which you played), B and C. 

A invides a fight, because it is difficult to settle your stones, while the black stone at R12 is weak too.

With B you grab territory, but Black gets a wall towards his other two stones.

With C the game will get more agressive. Advantage is that you play more inside Blacks territory and split Black in two.

See variations.]
(;W[of];B[ne]LB[nc:C][qc:B][nd:A]C[tsjanl: Black plays his stones very high (4th and even 5th line). That will give you attacking possibilities later. If he would have answered at A, a later invasion at B would get less interesting. His move also leaves C as a weak point. But before you attack you have to strenghten your own group.]
;W[oh]C[tsjanl: Good move. A good example of a stone that gives more safety to your own group while attacking the opponents weak group.]

(;B[rf]C[tsjanl: I don't like this black move, because he is pushing you into his weak corner and doesn't give his stones on the left much security. (See variation).]
;W[re];B[rg]LB[qe:A]C[tsjanl: Here I would connect solidly at A as white. Black's corner is starting to look very weak. (See variation).]

(;W[pe]C[tsjanl: This one is very bad because of Black's answer.]
;B[qd]C[tsjanl: You let Black make his corner more secure in sente.]
;W[qe]LB[oe:A]TR[qf]SQ[pe]C[tsjanl: Now you are forced to create a empty triangle (the marked stones). This is a weak and inefficient shape, because it has just a few liberties. Compare it with one of the previous variations, where the squared stone was at A.]
;B[pg]C[tsjanl: Bad move by black, because he is forcing you to make a move you would like to play anyway.]
;W[og];B[kp]C[tsjanl: A unwise moment to tenuki (play elsewhere) for Black. 

Black's group on the right is weak (it doesn't have a lot of eyespace and can only move downwards. So playing around there is urgent.

See variation.]
(;W[mp];B[hp];W[cg]LB[df:A][cj:C][dj:B]C[tsjanl: Still the right is the most urgent. Also locally, I don't like this move too much. It's to far away from blacks corner and too far from the stone in the lower left. A, B and C are better options.]
;B[cn]LB[ci:B][hp:A]C[tsjanl: With this move black is trying to create two weak white groups, because the lower right stone hasn't a lot of room to expand because of A. Besides that, a move around B later puts pressure on the lone white stone.]
;W[fq];B[cp];W[cq];B[bo]LB[fo:A]C[tsjanl: What to do now? Let's have a look at the position.

White's corner in the lower left isn't secure, and he has a lone stone on the left.

Black has three weak groups: in the lower left, on the bottom and on the right.

Black is threathening to get a lot of influence on the right side.

What should you do?

The most urgent thing to do is securing your lower left. Furthermore you would like to keep the two black groups at the bottom separated. Thirdly, you would like to prevent a huge black influence on the left and get a lot of white influence at the right.

I would play A. It does three things at the same time: strengthening your own weak group, putting pressure on blacks weak group, and keeping black groups seperated. See variation.]

(;W[en]C[frs: I'm not sure, where to move ... 

tsjanl: I do like the direction, but you have to realize a knights move is a weak connection. You can use it for attacking, but for defense it's less suited.]
;B[dj]C[tsjanl: Now black is putting pressure on C13. That's why I didn't like that move. But the gap he leaves between his stones is big and his group in the lower left is weak. I would try to split the stones.]

(;W[di]C[tsjanl: The problem with this move is that it doesn't gain you eyespace.

For an alternatives, see variation.];B[ci];W[dh];B[fj]LB[cj:A]
[ej:B]C[tsjanl: I don't think it's wise for black to leave the cut at A and the gap at B.]
;W[fg]LB[ed:A]C[tsjanl: An attack at A could be better.];B[fe]
C[tsjanl: Black plays on the fifth line again. This will give you possibilities later. But at the moment your group still is in big danger.]

(;W[hh]C[tsjanl: This could be the moment to exploit Black's weaknesses. See variation.]
;B[mq];W[nq]LB[pj:C][qj:A][qk:B]C[frs: Should White ignore this local fight? Alternative at A, B or C instead?

tsjanl: Well, you have come in a situation where there are four urgent situations: saving your weak groups on the left and bottom left, defending the bottom right and attacking blacks group at the right. In general, that means trouble.

I am not sure what I would do in this situation. But I would choose defending instead of attacking.]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[pj]C[tsjanl: This is why a move around R10 was urgent twenty moves ago. Now black's group could get strong, and your upper right group could get in problems.]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[qm];B[qk];W[nj]LB[mj:A][nk:B][pm:C]C[frs: How can White deny Black's access towards tengen?

tsjanl: Go is not a game of reaching tengen first.

With your move you leave a cut at C, that could be quite disastrous. See variation.]

(;B[lf]C[tsjanl: This is a very bad move by black. It doesn't secure territory at the top, because it's too high, and it doesn't put enough pressure on white's groups.]
;W[dl]LB[cj:A][hr:B]C[frs: Trying to split Black's base ...]
;B[cl]
(;W[km]LB[ok:B][dl:A][ln:C]C[frs: White L7 tryies to deny Black's access towards tengen and tries to claim White territory around N7 (but without attacking). Wrong timing of White's goal? What should be White's goal instead at the moment?

tsjanl: Wasn't your plan to split Black? If you don't play a follow up to A, you only have helped Black to secure territory. (See variation).

Furthermore, L7 is too lose. Black can still walk in at B and C.

See variation.];B[om]C[tsjanl: Bad: black peeps when he can cut.]
;W[pm]C[tsjanl: Black has given you this connection as a present.]
;B[np]C[tsjanl: A risky cut, because Black's group at the bottom isn't very strong.]
;W[no];B[op];W[lq];B[lr];W[lp];B[kq];W[pq]C[frs: Securing the corner.]
;B[oo];W[mn];B[nn]
(;W[mo]C[tsjanl: Because of the cut at L2, there is a nice sequence for white that is better then saving a lone stone. (See variation.]
;B[rm];W[rn];B[ol];W[ok];B[ml];W[lk]C[frs: Once again, White relies an eye-stealing strategy. Thus White tries to deny Black's connect via tengen.

This is not eye-stealing (N7 would be), but it is a good move, forcing black to try to live inside white's territory.]
;B[pk]
(;W[pn]C[tsjanl: I don't believe this is needed, so you could still play K2. See variation.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[nk];W[oj];B[ln];W[mm]C[frs: after counting liberties, a try : N7]
;B[on];W[ko];B[lm];W[ll];B[kn];W[jn];B[mk];W[mj];B[ns];W[os]
C[tsjanl: Q1 is better.];B[kr];W[pr]C[tsjanl: Here is why Q1 was better. You have to come back to play another move.]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[gr]C[frs: Big move. :-(  When White could / should have prevented it earlier?

tsjanl: Yes, at move 27 for example. This is a perfect example how leaving a weak troup can come to haunt you much later.]
;W[fr];B[jo]
(;W[lo]C[tsjanl: You don't need this one because of the snapback. See variation.]
;B[hn]C[tsjanl: White's weak group has been cut off now. It has to fight for itself. Black's group isn't in danger anymore.]
;W[go]C[tsjanl: I would still try to exploit the weakness at G3.]
;B[gl]C[tsjanl: Black should connect.];W[ik]C[tsjanl: You still have two weak groups. I do believe that F3 is bigger trouble than h12, because the latter has a lot of places to run too, because white is strong in the center. Still G3 is best.]
;B[pp];W[qq];B[jg]C[tsjanl: This move threathens to disconnect H12. K11 would prevent that.]
;W[de]LB[dc:A]C[frs: White at A instead?

tsjanl: The problem is that your group on the left still isn't securily connected and doesn't have eyespace. Playing at A could put your group in danger.]
;B[dd];W[rc]LB[ji:A][gq:B]C[tsjanl: As big as this is, you still have two groups to take care off.]
;B[rd];W[sd];B[bg];W[bf];B[bh];W[pb]LB[cf:A]C[tsjanl: The cut at A is dangerous.]

C[tsjanl: This move does nothing more than winning one point. You know the alternatives.]

;W[jk];B[gi];W[hi];B[bq];W[ji]C[frs: White needs eyes or connections for the F12 group. Is it more important than the corner at B2? (Finally White lost all groups around D4!)

tsjanl: F12 is already connected. D4 is urgent now, espceially since black has played B3. (There is no danger in bM9, because of wO8.)]
;B[cr];W[dq];B[dr];W[gn];B[hm];W[hr]C[frs: White tries to cut and kill Black group around L2 !

tsjanl: White should try to defend his own group. G3 still seems possible.]

Let's count. The triangled group has 6 liberties, the squared 3. The only danger is the lack of liberties of the circled group. Solve that, and you win (see variation).]

You were very lucky to win the game by such a big margin. If black would have saved his right side group, he would have won.

I am going to give you two advices.

Take care of the safety of your own groups before you start attacking. If you manage to do that, you will get a lot stronger. You will see that if you attack from save groups, your attacks will be more forcefull too.

Take care of your cuts. Defending them looks slow, but it is almost always worth it.

Enjoy,
