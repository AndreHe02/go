Comments are marked "al>"

As a double-digit kyu, my comments may be brilliant, as well as rubbish. Don't take my statements as facts, rather  examine them and see if you can find even better ideas.]
;W[qp];B[qg];W[oq];B[dj];W[fq];B[cn]C[al> A pincer at H3 is another option, since there is no white stones to run to upwards. It would also give black the opportunity to interfere with white's ambition to build a moyo along the bottom.

al> However, since black is so much ahead, the potential white moyo shouldn't be so much of a worry.

al>The black stone at D10 makes me feel that C6 is not optimal, although it is purely my gut feeling. It is if as black get a little cramped, so to speak. But I might just be blabbering here - some stronger is welcome to comment on my comment.

al> I would also consider K16 or K10, or some other bold move while there is still a chance.

al> Handicap stones should be used to create influence which can eventually be transformed into territory - white cannot invade everywhere.]
;W[iq];B[qj]C[al> To me, R10 feels a bit too slow. K16 or K17 looks better - as in "find the largest open area, and play in the middle of it".]
;W[fc];B[hc];W[cf];B[fd]C[al> I think E15, because it attacks both white stones at the same time. This way, black has made a choice, which is perfectly reasonable, of course. Only, with E15, black could get a sense of how white thinks, by judging the answer. It is a little more open, leaving more possibilities.

al> The choice black has made, naturally, is to capture the white C14 stone, since white f17 will only get stronger, as will black, from this kind of contact play, leaving black with a wall with which to crush C14 - maybe (se comments further ahead).]
;W[cc];B[cd]C[al> I would play D17 here. With C16, white gets the corner as well as a not so enclosed stone at C14, which can easily slip away between black's fingers. Black gets a wall in return, of course, but C14 may destroy to wall's potential, if black is not careful. And, besides, D17 would split white's groups, and that is often something that creates opportunities.]
;W[dc];B[ed]C[al> Black might push with E17 before playing E16, If white saves F17, black gets an enforcement, by playing G17, of the left border of a potential moyo along  the top.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[ci];B[df]C[al> I believe that this is attacking from the wrong direction. Not to play to close to thickness is a thing to remember (and also the point of a proverb). You should push the opponent towards your own thickness by applying pressure from the opposite side.

al> Since the black B15 stone is underneath white, black C10, with the threat of a possible stab at B12 could be an option. It is not critical to capture the white group - by chasing it from the south, and  blocking it's escape attempts to the north, black gains a good framework around the top and lower left side.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[dh];B[eg]C[al> D14-D13-E13 forms an open triangle, something to be avoided, since it is not considered an efficient formation.

al>Apart from that, look at the black group: nine stones, enclosing three points, while white has the opportunity to push downwards, and probably live, while destroying potential black territory along the left side. This is what comes from attacking from the wrong direction.]
;W[eh];B[gh]C[al> Another proverb to keep in mind is: "Corner, side, center". As I am sure you already know, it is easiest to build territory in the corner, and hardest in the center. nevertheless, it is all too common to imagine making a big moyo in the center while letting the opponent grab the corners and sides. Don't know why - I do it myself more frequently than I would like to admit..


al> Possible new proverb: You ALWAYS overestimate the amount of territory you can gain in the center. Just let it go. Secure the corners and sides, but keep enough presence in the center to be able to destroy the opponents chances of getting territory there. A living group along the side, with a tentacle or two stretching into the middle of the board is ideal.

al> Black would gain more by stopping white from going further down the left side, so I consider C10 to be the urgent move here.]
;W[fi];B[jd]C[al> Again, this is too close to thickness. It is not the black stones on the left that needs reinforcement, it is the stones on the lower left side, or, disregarding them for a moment, the stones in the top right corner that needs supporting.

al> If black plays at O17, it would take some guts for white to try to invade, or even reduce, the top.]
;W[nc]C[al> Now, white can do this, because the corner is still open.]
;B[lc]C[al> Again, the attack should come from the opposite direction. The corner is what is vulnerable, and also worth more points than the upper side. Since black has a strong presence in the top left, P17 is a strong answer to white O17.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[al> If you have the choice, it is a good thing to split the opponents groups when possible. Also, since black is so strong at the top, there is a good chance of capturing the white O17 stone, thereby creating a huge territory up there.

al> Thus, I advocate playing Q17 instead of R16.];W[pc];B[od]
;W[oc]
(;B[fg]C[al> I don't understand black's move here. To me the important thing would be to keep white out of my potential territory around N14 by playing O16.

al> However, C10 is urgent. Even if white should reach out from O17, black gains points around Q14 and J14 anyway, albeit not quite so many. But if white plays C8, black could lose the D10 stone and a lot of points.

al> Furthermore, F13 would be better at F12, since the ladder (if white cuts at F13) works for black.]
;W[gi];B[pm]C[al> C10 first. Aside from that, I like Q7 to be at R7 instead, to be in line with R4. Looks more solid. After that, it would be easy for black to reduce white's bottom potential from both sides, by extending from R7 and D5 into the center.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[po];B[jg]C[al> Following up with R7 would avoid a similar situation as the one around C10. White can stretch to S8 here.

al> K13 does not extend the boundary of black's potential territory, nor threaten white in any way, thus handing over sente to white without compensation.]
;W[md];B[fn]LB[eo:A]C[al> C10 first. Also, this form invites a cut from white at "A". Black F5 would give better shape.]
;W[mf]C[At this point I was torn between trying to cut White off from the middle of the board or protecting my left side with a move such as M15.

al> The left side is fine witout protection. White could play L15, but that's about it. C10 would be a better way to protect your potential points. R7, too. With those two already in place, I would play around O12 here, to gain points to the right.]

(;B[ng]C[al> The reason I would play O12 instead of O13 is that this is too close to the enemy and consequently easily attacked. If white tries to attack O12, then black can run to O10 or N10, outlining territory instead of getting stuck in a contact fight.]
;W[ne]
(;B[oe]C[al> P15 creates an open triangle again. P14 would be better shape.]
;W[of];B[pf];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[se]C[al> C10 and R7 still more urgent. T15 is an endgame move which is worth, like, three points. O14 looks lucruative, though.]
;W[ke];B[je];W[kg]C[By now White has a grip on both sente and the middle that I never did figure out how to diminish.

al> You are doing OK - remember that there are not many points in the middle. But take a moment to figure out how much black would gain by playing O14. It also threatens with the follow up of black O16.]
;B[og]C[al> O14 would have worked, too.];W[nf]C[al> white should have sacrificed P14 for a reducing move around O9.]
;B[mg];W[lg];B[jj]C[al> There are no points in the middle, so there is not much accomplished by stopping white from getting there. Imagine white responding with O9 now - wouldn't you rather have let white get K10 in exchange for playing around O9 yourself (O10, for example)?]
;W[jh]
(;B[ig];W[fk];B[dl];W[cj];B[ck];W[hk];B[in]C[al> If you are leading - enlarge, if your are behind - reduce. Black is in the lead, so should consequently strive to enlarge his moyos, rather than to reduce white's. J6 should be around O9 instead of inviting white to stretch into that area.]

al> You have lots of territory on the sides, and can gain even more. I have scetched out where the most secure points are, approximately. A, B, C, D, E are all moves for black to enlarge his territory (triangles). At the same time, those exact points are white's most efficient reducing moves. Your opponent's critical point is your critical point is a good proverb to remember.]
;W[gm];B[mj]C[al> Good! O9 or O8 would have been even better. That is, if R9 had been in place.. Imagine a white play at R8, for instance - that would hurt.]

(;B[jo];W[ko];B[kn];W[gn];B[eq]C[White has now cut my major groups apart while connecting his.

al> Splitting, or connecting, live groups is rather pointless, so that is not a cause for you to grieve, or for white to celebrate.

(;W[rm];B[nl]C[al> M8 or N7 would be better. O8 strengthens the white stones that areclose to the vulnerable black group in the middle.]
;W[nm]C[al> white should have played N7.];B[mm];W[on]C[al> As white, I would have played P8 instead of P6. Beacuse black played O8 before the cut, it is in the prefect position to be ataried (sp?)

al> If black had started with N7, the follow up to white O7 would likely have been black O6 instead of O8. So O8 was the wrong move in advance, so to speak.]
;B[ol];W[rl];B[rk];W[ik];B[jk]C[I couldn't seem to get away from White's grip on sente.  I considered moving around G18 or N18, but it seemed to me that would lose any hope of connecting my right side and middle groups.

al> As said before, there is no need or purpose of connecting live groups. G18 and N18 are sente, since a slide to P19 and E19, respectively is a natural follow up.

al> This game was decided in the endgame. Black was in the lead, but white got to reduce, and then follow up by getting those large endgame points (lots of them in the upper middle left, especially. I think black may have been kind of misguided in the midgame, thinking in terms of connecting groups instead of figuring out where the points were.

al> Things went fairly well, anyway, until the pre-endgame.

al> Try to stop once in a while and guesstimate where the points are. It is not so easy just by eye, so use the edit mode, if your are using a go client with that function. Figure out where the secure points are, and where the potential points are. Then it is easier to evaulate different moves.

al> Of course, it is easier to use this method while replaying game archives, then when you are playing live, so practice your reading by reviewing played games.]
