C[EmTom: Hi!

Thanks in advance for your review. There are no specific questions in the game. Please chose important moments and most important mistakes. We will also appreciate ideas behind moves you'll suggest (even more than just moves).

I hope you'll find this game interesting as we did :)

P.S. Please review for both players.];B[pd];W[qq];B[dc];W[cq]
C[CG: This is very slow opening for white. According to my pro game database, black wins 72.7% of the games.]

(;B[he]C[CG: I think R15 is more important. White may still invade the left side or play D18, so H15 is not as big as it looks. If the upper right corner were already secure, the a move at H15 would be a very good move as it would threaten the two white stones.]
;W[je]C[CG: My idea would be to play S15. This strengthens the two white stones indirectly by taking away blacks base in the corner.]
;B[kb]C[CG: This again looks premature as the upper right corner is still weak.]
;W[jb];B[mb]
(;W[kc]C[CG: White can also play O18 and capture the two stones.]
;B[nb];W[lb];B[md];W[di]C[CG: Good invasion point, but the white group is still thin.]

(;B[ck]C[CG: This is the wrong direction. The move does not make territory and might drive a white group into the black moyo. I think black must try to attack on a larger scale (see variation).]

;B[ee];W[gd];B[gf]
(;W[hf]C[CG: In fighting positions, it's important to avoid unnecessary moves. White has to connect, so he should play F12 immediately and keep any ataris in reserve. After F12, capturing the stone with H14 and connecting with H16 are miai.]
;B[gg];W[fh];B[hg]
(;W[if]C[CG: This looks like an overplay. H16 would be good enough for white.]
;B[hd];W[jh]C[CG: What is the meaning of this move? Since it does not capture the cutting stones, it just weakens the white group on the left. Try to avoid unnecessary moves like this, especially in fighting!]
;B[ii]
(;W[fb]C[CG: Looks dubious. Usually G18 is better, but I think it does not work here either.]
;B[gb];W[eb];B[fc]C[CG: Good!];W[ec];B[ed];W[gl];B[hj]C[CG: Better at J8.]
;W[fk];B[gj]C[CG: Ouch. What is the meaning of this move? This is aji keshi. Since white can not make two eyes locally, black should still play J8.]

;W[cp];B[im];W[db]C[CG: I would rather play a local ko threat like G3.]
;B[il];W[cc];B[gk];W[pn]
(;B[ql]C[EmTom: Ok the only question. I was ahead at this point but i had to do something about whites big potential. Is this move a mistake? It seems that troubles start at this point. Any other suggestions?

CG: It's not that clear that black is ahead - white still has to reduce the quite impressive right side moyo. I think R8 is a good invasion point - it should be easy to make live.
A move around N4 would be another invasion point, but not necessarily a better one.
Actually, it might be best just to play M8, making miai of reducing the right or lower half of the moyo.

This kind of position is quite dangerous: You just won a fight on one side and you think winning the game is now very easy. You start to make slack moves, and soon you are in trouble. This happened to me more than once ...]
;W[qm];B[ol];W[ml];B[qj];W[pk]
(;B[pl]C[CG: Ouch. After N8, you should better not try to run away but live on the side.]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[qi];B[rj]C[CG: It's important to play S7 first as this move is sente for both sides.]

;B[oh];W[of];B[pg];W[pf];B[qf];W[ph]
(;B[rg]C[CG: As you have seen in the game, this does not connect, so P13 was the only move.]
;W[og]
(;B[rh]C[CG: This was your last chance to play S7. If I read correctly, this makes the difference between life and death.
The bad news is that white would be still ahead since your upper right corner would crumble to barely two eyes.]
