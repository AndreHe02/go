C[I am sending the record of one of my recent games, the result is not
untypical, so clearly I am doing something seriously wrong. i was
playing white, the game was on the kiseido server and I was supposed to
be 15k, now 16k a game later.

I felt that the game was fairly even up till aout move 42 the end of the
fuseki. The sequence up to 49 went seriously wrong leaving me 20 to 25
points behind. From here on I managed to narrow the gap a couple of
times move 56 to 78, and then the sequence up to move 90. was white 78
correct it looked right, but the continuation didn't work, for me. White
154 and 156 were ridiculous. Black 185 was very bad I should have played
that first, but in the end I was already a good 12 points behind and it
just affected the size of defeat. White 194 was stupid. By the end I was
shocked by the size of my defeat during the game I thought about 12 or so.

Thanks for looking at this

Please send me any questions.];W[pc];B[pq]C[[rr\]  I don't like this move by black.  Because the White stone is on the 3rd line, black should play on the 4th line.]
;W[dd];B[qe];W[oe]TR[mc][nd]C[[rr\]  Moves on the 5th line should be avoided in the fuseki.  Instead, play on the 3rd or 4th lines, like the marked locations.  Black will then extend to the star point, H10.]
;B[pg];W[kc]TR[oe]C[[rr\]  Since the marked stone is on the 5th line, White should have played on the 4th line, probably at the star point (K16)]
;B[ec];W[df]TR[dc]C[[rr\]  First of all, I don't think that black needs to attack this corner like he did.  But, since black did, punish him!  White is strong in the upper right, so force black to white's strength.  Before extending like white did, white should have sealed off the corner with D17.  Black would have then made a 2 point jump to H17, and white would have the better of the exchange.]
;B[hc]C[[rr\]  The corner is still open.];W[ep]C[[rr\]  nice move by white]
;B[cm];W[dq]TR[hp]C[[rr\]  It is usually better to extend in this position.  Leave the option of jumping into the corner until later.]
;B[gq];W[cq];B[bp];W[iq]TR[en]C[[rr\]  White is still very weak here.  I would touch blacks stones.  But by doing that, black will get a huge moyo in the lower right.  I think I would start by jumping out.]
;B[go]C[[rr\] black has seperated 2 of whites groups.  This is very hard for white.]
;W[io];B[mq];W[fr];B[fq];W[gr];B[eq];W[er];B[dp];W[cj]C[[rr\]  H3 is sente and a very important spot to play.  It keeps white connected.  After H3, white can then play C10.
BTW, nice job at connecting white's stones.];B[ek];W[ei];B[dc]
;W[bc]TR[cc]C[[rr\]  I prefer the hane at C17 instead of the small knight's move.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[bb];W[be];B[ck]C[[rr\]  black shouln't contact here.  Both black and white are strong.  Black should play on the right side instead.  much bigger over there.]
;W[dj]C[[rr\]  White should ignore and play on the open right side.]
;B[ie];W[pl]C[[rr\] good spot.];B[qj];W[po]C[[White comment\] I felt that the game was fairly even up till aout move 42 the end of the fuseki

[rr\]   W about 31 points on the board
B  about 36 points on the board
add 5.5 points for komi, and the game is very even right now.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]C[[rr\]  Black gets a big gain here.];W[rn]
;B[ql];W[pm];B[pk]C[[White comment\] The sequence up to 49 went seriously wrong leaving me 20 to 25 points behind.

[rr\]  I don't know if it is really that bad.  Black is still open at the bottom on both sides, and white can really eat away at some points.  The lower right was nobody's territory, but black had more influence there to begin with.]
;W[qd]C[[rr\] White gets a big gain here, about the same as blacks lower right gain.]
;B[re];W[nm]TR[ok][ml][mo]C[[rr\]  This move seems small, with no real purpose other than to escape.  If white makes one more point jump, it becomes a little lighter.  Look at any of the three marked locations for other suggestions.  You may have to sacrafice one stone if you play in the marked locations, but you will be able to escape.]
;B[kj]C[[rr\]  I don't see the point to this move either.  Black can connect to any of the three groups, but it doesn't get territory.]
;W[ke]C[[rr\]  Good territory making move, while countering blacks Moyo]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[fe];W[fd];B[gd];W[ff];B[ge];W[gf]TR[bk][nk]C[[rr\]  This last stone is helping black more than it is helping white.  Hane at B9 is bigger, as is anything that helps white's lower right group.]
;B[hf];W[jf]TR[hi]C[[rr\]  Not sure of white's intention here.  If black's moyo is a concern, come at it from the left side.]
;B[jd];W[kd];B[jc];W[ng]C[[rr\]  Good];B[ni];W[nk]C[[rr\]  Good.]
;B[ok];W[kl];B[kk];W[ll]TR[kn]C[[rr\]  White's previous move was nice and light, this move is heavy as a rock!  Continue to play light in this area, it isn't under attack yet, well, not too much yet.]
;B[mk];W[ml]C[[rr\]  See previous statement.  There is no eye space around O8, so keep your connections out to the J5 stone.]
;B[nj];W[lp]C[[White comment\]  was white 78 correct it looked right, but the continuation didn't work, for me.


[rr\]  Good.  This is a good use of the wall white just built.  In most cases, use walls to push your opponent against, but here, it is good to extend from it.]
;B[lq];W[mp]TR[kp]C[[rr\]  This is more a matter of style, and I haven't read this out, but I would have played the other way.]
;B[np];W[kr]TR[no]C[[rr\]  When black hanes, it is good to push back]
;B[lr];W[kq];B[nq];W[mh]TR[no][mn]C[[rr\]  I don't know that the white group is safe yet.  I would play one of the marked spots first.]
;B[nl];W[nn];B[no];W[ko];B[ig];W[jg];B[ih];W[rd];B[sd];W[sc]
;B[se];W[rb]C[[rr\]  Lets take another look at the score now.

White:  59 on board  (rough guess)
Black:  70 on board  [again, rough guess\]
with 5.5 komi, still a close match, the black lower left side is much bigger than it looks, and where white should focus attention.  Getting the two monkey jumps on the lower left side are also very very important.]
;B[pe];W[pd];B[of];W[nf];B[gg]C[[rr\]  I don't think this move is sente for black.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[ef]C[[rr\]  This is a very very small move.  If black captures, white re-captures.  there are other moves on the board that are bigger.]
;B[gi];W[dn]TR[sk][sq]C[[rr\]  Monkey jumps on the right side are bigger and sente.]

C[[rr\]  Whoops.  This looks like a mistake];B[jm];W[km];B[jj]
;W[jh];B[ik];W[oh];B[ph];W[rl]C[[rr\]  The monkey jump ends with white sente.  This move is gote.]
;B[rk];W[rm];B[ro];W[bq]C[[rr\]   White about 75 points on the board + 5.5 komi
Black about 72 points on the board + 6 prisoners.

Unless I'm missing something, white is ahead now];B[og];W[ne]
;B[nh];W[bn]C[[rr\]  I don't understand what white is trying to do here.]
;B[am];W[cn]C[[White comment\] White 154 and 156 were ridiculous

[rr\]  Yeah,  I hate it when that happens!];B[an];W[al];B[bo]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[ip];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[ka]C[[rr\]  Gote move.  Look for sente when you can.]

[rr\]  There are bigger moves than this.  See marked locations.]
;B[mo]C[[white comment\] Black 185 was very bad I should have played that first, but in the end I was already a good 12 points behind and it just affected the size of defeat.  
[rr\]  yeah.  I missed that one too when I was reviewing the game.]

;W[im];B[hm];W[jm];B[ld];W[le];C[[rr\]  Black had several very good end game moves.  I think that white was ahead up until the end game, where white lost several key points.]
