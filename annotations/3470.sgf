C[Hi,
my name is Angelina,
I am 15k on IGS
In this game, I play white against an opponent who is 17k (no handicap), and I lost by 1/2 pt.

I was always behind, I never managed to take advantage.
I think I lost this game mainly because of wrong strategic choices in the beginning (am I right ?).

Babibo : 
hello Angelina
This game was a moyo competition so strategy is very important. Both of you missed a lot of big points that expand one's moyo while reducing the other's
Black played well in the beginning, and you were far behind at move 30. But you caught up in the chuban, by making your own moyo, that black could have invaded plenty of times, but failed to do it.
This kind of games is very hard to handle. I have shown many variations so you can understand 2 important things : 
- sente
- the balance of power and influence. 
Kyu players (including me) tend to overestimate the importance of secure territory, and underestimate the value of influence and power because they don't know how to use it.  I hope the variations will help you change your vision of go. 

If you have any questions, please e-mail me at remi.vannier@tiscali.fr]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[cp];W[dd];B[iq]C[Babibo : black chose the low chinese fuseki. This opening, like the "san ren sei" is moyo-oriented. I personnally prefer the chinese fuseki because it seems much harder to invade. 

* moyo : large area of influence that could turn to a very big territory if not invaded]

(;W[qn]LB[jd:A][dj:C][pj:E][dm:B][ep:D][eq:G][nq:F]C[Babibo : Good
A, B, C, D & E are also possible
you should not F or G. By invading so deeply, you could be attacked very severely]
;B[nq]LB[pj:B][rp:A]
(;W[qk]C[This is slow. See variations.]
(;B[di]C[Babibo : very big move. However, it is a bit far from C4]

(;W[ck]LB[cg:E][ck:A][cn:D][dn:C][ep:B][eq:F]C[Ang: here I made my first big mistake (right?). Are E3 or E4 better ?
Same question for C6 or D6.
I was thinking also of C13

Babibo : I don't think this A is a mistale. It is clear that you have to invade now or black's moyo will be too big. See variations. You can see that it is very hard to invade the chinese fuseki.
All the spots you suggested are possible, but the ones I prefer are A & B, then C, or D maybe. I would not play E, but I'm not sure it is bad. And  F is too deep]
;B[dm]
(;W[ek]MA[cg]C[Ang: here I play towards the center because I don't want B to build a large moyo in the bottom-left, but it doesn't seem to work very well. Maybe C13 is better ?

Babibo : Very good move];B[cf];W[bi]LB[fd:A][jd:B][fm:C]TR[ck]
[ek]SQ[cf][di]C[Ang: here I hesitaded between playing this move (B11), protecting the top-left corner, getting the big point K16, or sticking to my first idea and play F7. Which is best in your opinion?

Babibo : B11 is a bad move, I think. what you want to do now is to attack the squared stones. By doing that, you will reinforce your triangled group which is very important to reduce black's moyo in the bottom
A is the correct move to attack the black stones, I think
C is possible if you prefer to reinforce your triangled group a bit before attacking the squared stones, but you may prefer to see how things go before reinforcing black too much. C will be useful only if you manage to buid a moyo in this part of the board. So if later in the game you don't need such a move, you'll prefer to invade deeply around E4, or reduce with J5
B is a little bit off-topic];B[fc]C[I don't know if this is the good move, but it is the correct area to play in since one more move by white in the area would kill the black stones for sure]

(;W[ee];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc]
(;W[dg]C[Bad move : overconcentrated];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce]
;B[ed]LB[jc:B][fe:A]C[Babibo : your shape is overconcentrated. So many stones for so few points !
Black can be very happy with the result.]
(;W[fd]MA[jc][fe]C[Ang: maybe simply F15 ? or K17 ?
the atari is not good. It leaves weaknesses that you'll have to patch. Thus you'll lose sente]

(;B[gc];W[gd];B[hd];W[he];B[id]C[Ang: I am trying to build a wall, but I am  running behind B. Wrong strategy ?

Babibo : It is often wrong to buid a wall on the fifth line while the opponent builds secure territory on the 4th line. Try to avoid this. And it is also wrong to run behind. Try]
;W[ie]
(;B[nc]
(;W[fm]MA[nd][pf]C[Ang: I played this move (F7) because I wanted to attack, but maybe it was too soon. Was it better to answer O17 instead (Q14 or O16 for example) ?

Babibo : I think it is better to exchange Q14 for K16 first
But clearly, F7 is a very big move. Suddenly, you are in the game again]
;B[fp];W[pf];B[kd]C[Babibo : bad shape K16 is better];W[jd]
;B[jc];W[je];B[ic]
(;W[me];B[hm];W[gn]MA[on]C[Ang: I guess this is the wrong direction. Maybe P6 would be better, right ?

Babibo : Since you can't prevent black from connecting, this move is bad.
I think you'd better try to expand your moyo, either at P6 either at H8]
;B[hn];W[rp]LB[hk:A]C[bad. Fortunately, black answered !]
(;B[qq];W[nn]C[VERY big];B[mo]LB[lm:A]
(;W[mn];B[kn]LB[hj:C][hk:B][lm:A]C[Babibo : here I can't find any good move for white to expand his moyo on the right. so B (H9) or C (H10) might be better]

(;W[lo]MA[hk][kk]C[Ang: my first idea was to play in the middle (something like H9 or L9). But I was afraid of playing so far and I preferred reducing black's bottom (without success).

Here, you have more to win by extending your moyo];B[lp];W[ln]
;B[kp];W[em]C[Wrong direction again. G9, H9, or L7 seem better]
