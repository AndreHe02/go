It depens on the style of go you like to play. If you like fighting, this is probably not a bad move.]

[MW\] Well, you did quite well. You managed to keep all your groups alive. Without the unnecessary moves at C17 and D18, you would have won this game with 0.5 points :-)

Generally I would recommend you to keep your groups low and safe in the beginning and then start attacking the weak points of your opponent.
It's far more easier to attack from strong groups than from weak ones. And don't be overprotective in the end :-)]
