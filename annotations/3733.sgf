C[I have not played for few months as I have very little time recently, but I hope I can be useful.]
;B[ee]C[Nothing wrong with this move in 9x9 game, but somewhere in a corner like C3, G3 might make more sense --- you would stake some territory immediately.]
;W[df];B[fg];W[eg];B[ff];W[cd];B[db]C[The connection to  E5 is too loose, it invites cut  at E7.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fd]C[May be sneak under white stones? E2? F4-E5 are connected...]
;B[fe];W[fh];B[gd];W[gg]C[You gave your opponent chance to get in your space bu doing some unnecessary moves... You should be more in more attacking mood and not connect stones that are already connected --- you just waste your opportunities this way. Now I'd try to get him in upper left corner.]
;B[fc]C[F7 might wait. G6 is not a ladder, but white is too close to the border, too confined to do major damage. G3 is eating away at your territory in a major way, you should block it.]
;W[dd];B[gc];W[he]C[Here we come...];B[ge];W[gf];B[eh]C[This is very wrong. You should memorize this pattern --- you ar caught easily here and you give your opponent a chance to put stone at D2, protecting his corner.]
;W[dh];B[fi]C[This is unnecessary. After you have a little practice you'll see how easy you make for your opponent to chase you along the edge.]
;W[ei];B[gi];W[gh];B[hf];W[if];B[hg];W[hh];B[hd]C[You could do this before, without putting H3-H4. Long overdue.]
;W[ie];B[ih]C[This does not threaten anything, does not force your opponent to do anything but capture your stones. Dead stones (like H3-H4) can sometimes be useful as a threat if you surround this group from outside,but   once they removed off the board, they are gone.]
;W[ig];B[bd]
(;W[be];B[cc];W[ad];B[bc];W[dc]C[Big mistake. White gives up liberty and invites forcing moves.]

C[I do not see the point, D2 and E1 are already connected....]
;B[ac];W[bb]C[Or another path...]
(;B[ae];W[ab];B[af]C[gangrel has resigned the game.


Interestingly enough, white does not have eye exept for H3....

You should also try to play on 13x13 and 19x19 boards, the game is quite different on them.
Good luck!])
