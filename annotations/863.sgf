C[I am klimber - 21K* - white

Hello klimber. I hope you will find this review useful. I am sorry for the delay, but I had trouble with my email-accounts and recieved your game very late.   Please note, that my suggestions are my own humble opinion. Feel free to experiment and have fun with Go!]

This move is not appropriate. Try to make good shape at the side. See some of the possible variations.

If Black plays, for example, his next move around Q10 you will have no base and will have to run in the center while Black will gain points at the top.

One of the most important things in this game is to make a living shape. That is a shape where you have/could make two eyes to live.   When invading try to make a living shape by extending along the side - if possible.]
;B[cf];W[rd]MA[of]C[----
It is good to try to make good shape, but the stone at P14 is definitely misplaced.]
;B[qc];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc]
(;B[bc]MA[hc]C[----
This point and H17 are miai - that is kind of equal. Usually you do not play these kind of points this early. Also I seems to me, that H17 is better for Black. See variation.]

(;W[pj]MA[of]C[----
You could have played this stone without the move at P14. P14 is not totaly useless, but it is not a very big move. Instead you could have played a big point somewhere else.   Another important thing is to play efficiently. :-)

Now an urgent play is variation];B[cn];W[co]MA[dn][dj]C[----
Another classical joseki mistake. Remember that you should play efficiently? This move forces Black to play efficiently. The correct answer for Black is to play D6. This makes the relation to D10 an ideal = very efficient extension.

Also you limit your chances to invade the black formation, because of the strength Black will gain from your attachment.   You usually play this move if you want to make Black overconcenrated. For example, when D10 is at D9 or D8.

A better play for you would have been to play around F3 or F4.]
;B[dn]C[----
correct];W[fq]MA[cq]C[----
ok.   But it is important to know, that an invasion at C3 is still possible. At least Black could get a ko. But the timing for such an invasion is important. Right now, you do not have to worry.]
;B[hq]
(;W[kc]C[Was this a good move?

----
These kind of points are always good. This move prevents a big black extension and threatens a follow-up in the black corner.

Maybe one point to the right would be better. Just a matter of taste. The danger is the small weakness of the group to the left.

On the other hand. Black has now the chance to build a framework at the bottom.

With this in mind a play around O3 seems more important to me.]
;B[hc]
(;W[gb]C[----
This is not really necessary. Just jump to L15];B[hb]
(;W[cb]MA[bb]C[I was worried about eyes...would m15 be better?

----
Clearly your eye-space is limited.
Hm, I think a hane B18 would be better to make eyes.   But I dislike the idea to live small at the edge and being shut in. Black can press from the outside and make the moyo at the left side even bigger.   My suggestion is to move to the center and attack the two black stones while moving.]

(;B[ig]C[----
I think Black is favoured. He managed to build some influence which supports his left framework.

Also, your group is not really alive.]
(;W[qn]C[----
Certainly a big move, but with the problems at the top it is more urgent to play there.]
;B[ql]
(;W[qj]MA[hq]C[would p6 be better...more forcing?

----
Clearly, this move is too passive.

I think p6 would be what Black wants you to play. Then you would force him to make territory at the bottom.

It may be not a bad idea to invade the corner. Black would get a lot of strength wich would be supported by h3, but h3 is very far away and you could invade right away.]
;B[ol];W[on];B[po];W[pn];B[rp];W[mn];B[mp];W[ml];B[nj]C[would p9 be better...trapping
area?

----
comment see next move]
(;W[oh]MA[nj][ol]C[----
You are rigth. The two black stones can be cut. You should try it and see what happens. You are strong in this area so the fight favours you.]
;B[nh]
(;W[og]C[would p11 been better...i was worried about q13

----
I think you should use the cut. See variation. And give away a stone here. To capture Black is woth a lot more.]
;B[oj];W[no];B[np];W[ko];B[kq]C[i am forming eyes...but he is getting territory

----  true. But You have to, now that the black invaders escaped... Otherwise an invasion at the bottom would have been possible for you.]
;W[kk];B[io];W[jm];B[hm];W[fo];B[fm]
(;W[jp]C[this was bad move i think now...better
at O13..and cut

----
I do not know, if o13 would work.

This move is bad, because it is so small.

S17 or a reduction of the left black moyo would be bigger. A reduction would lead to fierce fighting, but is your only chance to catch up.]

Both are small moves. The problem is that you made Black very, very strong. The moyo is now very solid.]
