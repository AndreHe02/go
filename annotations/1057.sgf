AB[pd][dp]C[tsja: Dear reviewer, thanx in advance for looking at my game. I'm 19k on KGS (a bit overrated), Sindbad is 21k. I played white, and made some stupid, costly, mistakes. Despite that, I think there is a lot to learn from this game for me. I would like it if you could concentrate on strategical aspects.

**Will try.  Mistakes build experience, experience prevents mistakes.  You seem to be aware of the ones I saw for the most part.]
;W[pp];B[pn];W[np];B[qk];W[dd]C[Good, take the corner he gave you.  He is building on the right side though.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[jd];W[fq];B[hp];W[fo];B[dn];W[dr];B[fp]C[The idea here is to build one eye on the side with influence to center.  There might be a joseki, but I think  e-4, g-4, e-5 makes a nice exchange that splits black groups.]

(;W[cq]C[tsja: I have the impression this is not the good answer.

**see variation];B[eq];W[er];B[gq];W[fr];B[cp];W[bq];B[bp];W[dh]
C[tsja: Is c12 better?

**Depends, if black extends to e-14, then make a base c-9.  It may be a better move considering the thickness in the lower left.]

;B[ba];W[ee]C[tsja: Could Black have ignored this and get a living group in the corner?

**Yes, but his sacrifice built a fortress on the right and top side]
;B[fe];W[aa];B[md];W[ba]C[tsja: The cost of B n16 and B r13 is huge, but the upper left is also big. Was W r14 better?]
;B[qg];W[jq];B[gr];W[gj];B[fl];W[hl];B[jf]C[He took your good move.]
;W[go]C[Small.  O-6, R-17 are big as is K-5 (which is huge right now.]
;B[ho];W[gp];B[ep];W[gm];B[jp];W[hq];B[iq];W[ir]C[tsja: stupid #1.

**Well, you lose two point instead of gaining it.  In the meantime, 10 points await you in your corners which are weak.]

;B[og];W[oi]C[tsja: Is this too far?

**No, but again, P-9 feels bigger, as is R-17 and R-5];B[ok]
;W[mk];B[nj];W[mj];B[ni];W[mi];B[nh];W[qc]C[tsja: Was it better to protect my lower right corner first?]

(;W[hb]C[tsja: Is this too small?

**Yes, although you are in endgame.  Keeping sente is vital.  Granter your score is very low now.  Still practice keeping sente at endgame.

Also, the monkey jump at A-9 will freak out a low skilled player.]
;B[hc];W[ga];B[ib];W[ha];B[ia];W[fa];B[he];W[ge];B[id];W[ee]
C[tsja: I have the impression this was not needed. Or was it a good safety?

**Waste of sente, your group was still one move ahead in safety.]
