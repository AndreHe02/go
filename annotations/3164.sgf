C[To the reviewer:

This is the first tournament game I've played that I wasn't shaking uncontrollably from the beginning. I felt relaxed and content going into this game.

However, I must have made some mistakes, because the score was a landslide. I don't know what exactly to look for, so please comment on whatever may have caused me to be so far behind!

[gromit\] Hi, I'll do my best to point out where it went wrong. If some points remain unclear, don't hesitate to ask me again.]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[od];B[pf]C[[gromit\] that's ok, but you can also think about pincering, which would at the same time extend your shimari (UL corner)]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[rb];W[mc]C[This should have been at M17, right?

[gromit\] Yes M17 is standard, and safe enough.];B[qj]TR[jc]
C[[gromit\] Since you did notice that N17 was a bit cramped, moves around K17 become quite good for B: extending the upper-left corner and putting pressure on white.]
;W[qm];B[jd]C[I don't know why I played this move, other than I liked how it looked. I wanted to play K17, but this move looked nice. Is there some substance to this instinct? If so, what is it? If not, what should I have done?

[gromit\] K17 is slightly better: both are good extensions but K17 puts more pressure on W (no possibility to slide underneath). Moreover if W jumps out K17 can be followed by K15, whereas K16 is more complicated to follow up.]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[kc];B[kd]LB[ib:B][dj:A]C[I didn't like this move, and I still don't. I wanted to either play A or B. I didn't like the idea of marching towards a certain nidan bane, but I did it anyway, because I thought it was "right". Comments?

[gromit\] B seems the most natural, keeping pressure on W by removing his life base, and reinforcing the upper left moyo.

A is a good global move, but not urgent.

The move played is building thickness, but facing nothing and reinforcing W.]
;W[ld];B[le];W[me];B[ie]LB[hb:2][ib:1][jb:3][hc:4]TR[id]C[Was this the right move in this situation?

[gromit\] if B reinforces, the solid connection at J16 is better (otherwise the 1-4 sequence is sente for W).

W being almost alive at the top it seems a bit slow, but the idea of connecting is not bad.]
;W[cj];B[fq];W[hq];B[cn];W[dn]C[[gromit\] Up to now W plays quite well for a 12k.
Here, the other direction seemed more natural, since the long extension is at C10...]
;B[dm];W[en]
(;B[cq]TR[cj][cp]C[[gromit\] B is suddenly giving back the choice of the side to W. C4 was enough.
If B ends strong on the left, W lower side is still open and the marked C10 stone might also come under attack (see var.).]
;W[co];B[dq];W[cm]C[[gromit\] B ends up with the bad end of the stick.
W is now strong on the left and the upper side thickness will become less useful.]
;B[jq]TR[ic][jd][kd][ie][le][dm][cn][nq]C[Was this move too greedy?

[gromit\] No, it seems possible. But a classical approach move against lower right corner was possible too.

Trying to use the thickness and aji of the marked stones will soon become important too.]
;W[gp];B[fp]TR[mq]C[[gromit\] B should first get a base on the side. If W answers by protecting the corner, then B can try and attack H3.
Now B will reinforce the H3 stones and thus weaken K3...];W[go]
;B[np]TR[mq][nq]C[[gromit\] When playing in the opponent's sphere of influence play more tightly...]
;W[lq]C[I expected this move, but I don't think that helped me. What sequences would have been better for what followed?

[gromit\] Well you "asked" for that move!];B[kp];W[nq]TR[lp]
C[[gromit\] I think that W M4 would have been even more severe.]
;B[oq]TR[fo][lp]C[[gromit\] B wants too much.
Simply connecting at M4 and fleeing towards the center is enough. Later B has F5 to cut through and some aji might remain in the lower right.]
;W[op];B[mq];W[nr];B[mr]C[I misread the following sequence. Should this move have been at M4?

[gromit\] Well, yes.];W[mp];B[or]C[I missed his descent to O1. Should I have played M4?

[gromit\] Yes, M4 is still better.];W[ns];B[ms]C[Again, M4 was probably the move here as well?

[gromit\] yes :)];W[no];B[ks]C[[gromit\] The 3 stones are not important, and cannot be saved... Jumping out to the center becomes urgent!]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[ls];B[gq];W[cg];B[ib];W[jb];B[dg]C[[gromit\] The exchange doesn't seem to be enough for B. F5 and the aji of the two B stones of the lower left could be interesting first.]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[ia];B[eh]TR[dm][cn][fo]C[I felt that fighting over the territory at the bottom was smaller than the influence in the center. On top of that, if he invaded the top, I was going to invade the left side. Is this correct, or should I have defended the top?

[gromit\] I think W would gladly trade a few points on the left (B cannot get that much) against the top. However, if B hopes for a revival of the left side aji, then why not.

Answering might feel passive, but I guess it would have been natural.]
;W[di];B[fj];W[hb];B[hc]CR[dm][cn][fo]TR[fj]C[[gromit\] That is not coherent!
B played as if his moves were sente, so if W plays tenuki, then B must have some follow up on the left side. Going back to the top is admitting that it was bigger than the left side.

Starting with F5 or C8 would at least keep white under pressure.]
;W[gb];B[fc]C[[gromit\] same as before.];W[ji]C[[gromit\] W is a bit greedy, F7 or G7 helps the left and lower sides. B cannot close his central territory with only one move.]

;B[jg];W[jf];B[if];W[ig]C[[gromit\] W is greedy...];B[ih];W[hg]
;B[kj];W[kh];B[jh];W[lh]
(;B[ii]C[Should I have connected at G17 here? I'm pretty sure my group in the center will be fine...

[gromit\] G17 means some points. About the safety of the center group, see var.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[fd];B[ed];W[hd];B[ge];W[id];B[he];W[je];B[cl]
C[[gromit\] Now B must gain big there...];W[bm];B[el];W[bl]
;B[fo];W[gn];B[fn];W[hr];B[jn];W[fm];B[gm];W[em];B[hm]C[Was there a better move to capture the White group? I looked at F8 and G8, but this felt the safest.

[gromit\] G8 is a little better, but it's ok.];W[er];B[eq];W[fl]
;B[ek];W[qh];B[rf]TR[ph]C[I felt I was ahead, so I tried this instead of fighting. Territorially, was there a better move here?

[gromit\] Let's assess territory:
B has about 10 points in the UR if S14.
The UL will be small to keep the center, let's say 10-15 pts. The center is 15 pts.
And the lower side is about 35 points.
Total 70-75 pts for B.

W has about 15 pts on the left.
About 25 ont the top, and about 35 in the LR corner. Plus komi and prisoners 10 pts
I'd say that W is thus about 10-15 pts ahead...

B thus has no choice and has to be aggressive. Q12 is the standard moce.]

[gromit\] Yes. But B should die here...];W[qr];B[ro]C[[gromit\] Connecting is sente (W will have to protect R2) so B should have done it.]

;B[sk];W[sn];B[rj];W[rn]C[I think I lost more with the san-san invasion than I gained...

[gromit\] No, B didn't have anything to lose. But B could have gained with S3 (may not be enough to win though)]
;B[cf];W[bg];B[bf];W[gk];B[hj];W[qb];B[fb]C[Should I have played B4 now?

[gromit\] B4 looks a bit bigger, but F18 would have been sente for W, so, it's ok.]

Even though I knew I had lost this game shortly after White played M6, I didn't feel too bad about it. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to kicking myself once you shed light on the proper moves.

In advance, thank you!

[gromit\] It's not much in the endgame that B lost this game, but rather on the lower side: even if B finally captured a W group there, W built a huge lower right corner. The upper side tickness was also underused since W played first on the left side. B tried to bargain the upper side versus the center, but the gain wasn't big enough.
Choices of direction were the ones that decided the outcome of the game: the upper side thcikness choice at L16 wasn't simple to put to use, and the choice in the lower left was probably not very coherent with that strategy.

Technically, B could have turned the tables in the lower right, so please work a bit on your tesuji/life and death.

Good luck, and enjoy.])
