C[Hello!

I play black in this game, and i lost by 0.5 points. Looking back over the game (as with any close game) i can see quite a few places where i could have picked up that extra point, but that isn't my main concern. When i play especially in the middle game, there are times when I really don't know where to play, and probably end up making a mistake. The exception to this is 
when there is a fight going on, and i have clear objective of saving/escaping/killing/cutting off a group then i feel more comfortable. Consequently, in my game there are alot of fights ^^;.

btw, when you are refering to perticular stones, could you please use it's coordinates and not it's move number. I find it much easier to find the move that you are indicating this way. Thx.

(This game was played on KGS)

Anyway, i've rambled on for long enough, so i'd just like to say thanks in advance for reviewing my game for me =) .

[wallace\] I'll do my best to add clear and complete comments, anyway if that is not the case please feel free to ask me, either by e-mail or on KGS.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pj];B[qg];W[qn];B[cj]TR[jd]
[ql]C[[wallace\] ok, I'll start with a minor comment, but I'd say that R13 was not urgent (it's miai with a move around R8) and thus that if you choose to play it you should probably have an idea to follow up...
Let me explain, C10 is big but not urgent, however now that R13 is played, moves around K16 and/or R8 become very hot. (also because W R6 was a bit overextended to my taste).

If B K16 for instance, and W D10, then B will build a huge moyo in the top right by attacking W right side group.
If after K16 W reinforces on the right, then B can follow up at F17 and then, depending on W answer, decide to invade or not the left side, and at which point...

However, I'm not saying that C10 is bad, just that it's not very consistent with R13.]
;W[nd];B[ld];W[me];B[le]C[[wallace\] B should not make his stones heavy and reinforce W.
If the corner is judged as safe (which I don't think it is) than B should rather extend directly towards the edge.]
;W[og]
(;B[fd]TR[hd][og]C[[wallace\] After W P13 there is definitely a problem in the corner :(
Moreover B is over extending (the natural extension would have been H16) that's why it wasn't worth adding M15

at that point I think B should simplt play Q17 to protect the corner and threaten to connect underneath with M16 (see var).]
;W[fc];B[gc];W[ec];B[gd];W[cg];B[cm]C[Up to this point i think my moves are alright, what's your opinion?

[wallace\] Well, see my previous comments.

B ended up fine on the top thanks to W's reinforcing moves at F17 and such... but W is also not so bad.

There's a crucial question remaining: what happens in the top right...

There will also be important moves around F13 to enlarge B upper side (or W upper left) and help/attack the left side group.]
;W[lf];B[ph]C[Better at k4?];W[oh];B[pi];W[oi]
(;B[jp]TR[oh][ph][oi][pi]SQ[qc][oj][qj]C[[wallace\] once again, K4 is not bad, but not coherent with Q12 Q11.

The exchange of the marked stones only reinforces W if B stops there...

So either B plays it to continue on the side (with R10) or to cut W in two (with P10). See vars.

Playing K4 before the Q12 Q11 sequence would be possible too.

Noite that Q12 Q11 don't help if W invades the corner (for instance at R17 (and if Q17, R15)]
;W[gq];B[ql]C[i split the r6 stone from the rest of the white group, so i can attack it :)

[wallace\] yes, not bad.];W[oo]C[[wallace\] better to simply jump out. keima leavse too many weaknesses here.]
;B[ol];W[ok];B[qj]TR[nl][nm][om]C[[wallace\] Why not continue to split W? (any of the marked spots)]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[pk];B[rj];W[pl];B[qm]
(;W[pn]C[white should have played q7 here?

[wallace\] yes, see var];B[pm];W[om];B[nl];W[rn];B[rl];W[nk]
C[[wallace\] wrong direction, W should help the weak group]
;B[nm];W[on];B[mk];W[mj];B[nj];W[oj];B[lj]TR[lm][mn]C[i wanted to streathen my 08 group so that i could start attacking p6

[wallace\] good idea... but that doesn't work... see var.

Better to simply help the O8 stones by playing N6 (or even M7) and start closing the net around P6]

(;W[mi];B[ll];W[nq];B[op];W[np];B[mo];W[no]TR[mo]C[[wallace\] This exchange is BAD for Black: either cut, or leave the threat as is, but don't help W protect this cut.

By the way, cutting directly seemed possible];B[lq];W[rp];B[rq]
;W[ro];B[qr];W[or];B[pr];W[pp];B[pq];W[nr];B[sr]C[better at s4? it would take away one of whites potential eyes, but would it be harmful to me?

[wallace\] you probably mean T4. Then there is NO eye here for W (if T4 then T6 and T7/S7 are miai)
T2 is good: you live unconditionally, W will (should) die :)]
;W[sp]
(;B[sq]C[[wallace\] ???
This doesn't help B in any way :(

;W[lm];B[ln];W[ml];B[mm];W[lr]
(;B[kr]C[[wallace\] remember that W has no eye at T5 yet... so it's enough to let W get one eye here in gote (losing the initiative).
See var.];W[mq];B[ls];W[ms];B[mr]C[after i played this i realised i would probably lose the ko, because i white has a few ko threats from the fight leading up to this...

[wallace\] yes but you don't have anything to lose in that ko! So play it...]
;W[nn];B[km];W[lr];B[kq]C[i protected here, but i think i should have played a bigger point, so that i could reap a nice profit from white ignoring it to save his group, what would be a good move?

[wallace\] Exactly... you cannot lose much here, so try to gain!

There are lots of possible threats now that you're strong in the center.
C3 comes to mind (if W doesn't answer C4 is big and attacks W)]
;W[ks];B[df]TR[pc][kf][fg][bp]C[This is one of my  "i don't know where to play" moves, what would have been better?

[wallace\] in that region, F13 is better: it enlarges B sphere and threatens to invade at C14/C15

otherwise, any of the marked spots...];W[sn]C[not nessisary, right
p1,t6 miai for life?

[wallace\] yes :)];B[cf];W[ce];B[bf];W[be];B[ee]C[i got a good result only because white played t6

[wallace\] true... but you could have played D14 instead of L3 and get the same result without W mistake... so it's reasonable to get something from your attack on W.]
;W[kf];B[je]C[This is another move i'm unsure of. i wanted to keep white out of my territory, and l15 would not do that well, and be bad shape. This is the best i could come up with.

[wallace\] well, K15 seems good. you take territory with a reasonable shape. Seems natural. The only question is: can B jump as far as J15 (which would then be better).
Well, I think so, but it's not so bad.];W[jf];B[if]C[j15 better?

[wallace\] Why?
if J15 W enters B territory too, so J14 is a good try to stop him... giving even the possibility to give up the two M16 stones if necessary...]
;W[ke];B[kd];W[ie];B[jd];W[ig];B[hf]C[[wallace\] Don't you think the result is better than J15 for B?]

;W[ni];B[kh];W[lg];B[ji];W[kj]TR[li][lj]SQ[hi]C[[wallace\] same here, better cut W off (H11)...

;B[ij];W[dg];B[fh];W[fg];B[gj];W[bg];B[af];W[dj];B[di]C[[wallace\] a bit too thin... if W crosscuts he'll probably make eyes.

;W[bi];B[bk];W[ag];B[dh];W[ch];B[ah]C[[wallace\] not necessary!
A12 and A1Ã  are miai... only one eye here.];W[hi]C[this was unexpected, white lives from here, right? or is there something i'm missing?]

(;B[fi]C[[wallace\] very small! see var];W[em]TR[gb][pc][bp]
C[fight's over, and i'm again lost for where to play...

[wallace\] the fight was over the previous move.

B4, Q17 are big
W top left is also not so safe...];B[dn]C[i came up with this, looks very bad look back over this game..

would the slide at b4 be any good here? or the 3-3 invasion?

[wallace\] yes. the slide if you hope to build center; the invasion if you don't.]

;W[ai];B[bd];W[dc];B[bb]C[i win the first ko, so i start another one... bad idea, no?

[wallace\] well, if B simply A18, then he still needs to win the ko again (W will take), so B18 is better than A18.

If B simply A16, then the ko was not won by B (who gave a stone at C17).]

[jo][ko][kp][lp][jq][qq][rr][rs][ss]C[[wallace\] I think that was a good game for B.
Don't worry about losing it by half a point...

B had a good game because he attacked a lot. He should have killed twice (may be a little work on Life and Death problems could help), but still got an advantage from the outer strength he got.

This strength was put to good use by attacking again... but the 2 times B didn't kill he let W live SENTE!
That is one big problem I saw for B. L3 and F11 were two moves thrown away that B could have put to use much better. (well T6 was given back, but...)

One other problem Black had was that if the attack failed (as in "not killing W") B didn't have a backup plan. It is important to realize that Go is a game of territory, thus when attacking gives you strength, you can use that strength to build territories.
Either very big ones, where W invades and you attack again :)
Or, when the game comes closer to the end, smaller ones (like in sliding at B4).

Strength can also be used to invade, and the territory W manages to get in the lower left at the end shows that B missed something there (no 3-3 invasion, plus a strange cut).

Some tips to pogress would be: - get better at L&D (that's even still something 9ds work on!). When I was at your level (or a bit higher) I made a quick jump when my attacks started killing big opponent groups :)
- get strong before attacking: B left the top right and middle left group quite weak, and W attacks there could have been very painful. Be careful of "amarigatachi" too, the shape left after an attack. It's better to stop the attack early and end strong than continue and if it fails get scattered around...
- use strength to build and invade when there are no targets to attack: at the end you must have more territory than your opponent.

Good luck and keep fighting if that's your style. You should progress a lot soon :)
