(;W[rd]C[R:white should select 11-Q instead of w-11(16-S)
. 
     Black should select 1-Q instead of b-12(17-R)]

R.: A is vital point. There is no option except A in this game.]

[fp:C]C[I didnt know what to play now. A, B and C came to my mind, but I dont know what is thw bigest

R:As each point (A, B and C ) is so good, .I don't know the best position. 
However,  B is somewhat suprior and C is middle and A is somewhat inferior. 
In other word, C is safety  mode and B is challenging mode.]

R. Hane is good move,  A is slack.];W[mo];B[mn];W[lo];B[lq]

;W[ff];B[cj];W[be]LB[gc:A]C[How to fix this shape ?
R:B13 is routine answer for this shape.
however, upper part is very important.  

Or should I play some big moves like A.
R.: Now living of   balck stones in the left side is very important t. Therefore, A is too small.  Black's 65 move is good]

(;B[je]LB[ln:A]C[I think this is bad move. Maybe I should first play A.

R.:A-escape is not big.  The reason is Geta tesuiji.];W[ln]

R: A is big. But  to live (both white and black are not living) or not is very important.]

;W[bf];B[bg];W[ql];B[rc]LB[mf:A]C[A is bigger I think, because it reduces white moyo and builds my teritory. And moves around A are sente for white because of M17.
R: Also I think A is a little better than b131..];W[me];B[ne]
