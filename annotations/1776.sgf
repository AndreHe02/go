C[Thank you for taking the time to review games, and thanks in advance for advice you can give me  based on this game.

I've not taken much time to comment on my moves in this game, what I'd prefer is for you, as a stronger player, to point out where I had better alternatives; in choice of where to play, how to play there, and perhaps a few hints on what direction is, as applied to this game.

I'm currently 7kyu on kgs, playing alot online and advancing one rank each month. In this game I play white, and lose to an 8 kyu player with 0.5 komi.

Hi, I'm one kyu on KGS.  I hope I'm strong enough to give useful comments. I'm going to review this game in three stages, in the first I won't have looked forward at all, the second will be after I know what happens, and the third will be extra bits I add later.  I find this approach is useful because it allows you to see which mistakes you should have spotted, versus ones that I only catch on the second round.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]C[This is perfectly ok.  I personally find it a bit easy on white becausee K4 is useful for two reasons now.]
;W[dj]C[Ok.  I would have K4 instead.];B[jq];W[nc];B[lc];W[qf]
C[This is very popular on the internet now, but it has some complications.]
;B[pf]C[O16 would have probably been better];W[pg];B[of];W[qe]
;B[nd]C[P16 is joseki];W[qj]C[all looks good];B[fc];W[ee]C[I've seen this a lot recently too, but it seems more appropriate when you have more moyo building potential]
;B[id];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc];W[ie];B[jd]C[These three moves sacrifice a lot in exchange for the moyo.  They are certainly consistant with E15, but I don't like how much damage you've done to O17.  Go back a few moves and you'll see you could do things like L17.]
;W[je];B[cc]
(;W[cd];B[dc];W[kd]C[still feels like ajikeshi to me, plus you're getting lots of cutting points.]
;B[kc];W[md];B[mc]
(;W[pe];B[oc];W[ne];B[od];W[oe];B[me];W[mf]C[I'd have played J10 or similar instead
--
on second review, I think this is ok];B[le];W[ke];B[ld];W[lf]
;B[dh]C[now is time to test your moyo];W[eg]C[wrong direction I think.  You're thickness is the wall on the 15th line.  So you should be attacking from the outside (e.g. F10).  That way if black escapes you can play E.g. G3 to make a great moyo
--
on second review, definatly the wrong direction, F10, E11 or similar.]
;B[ei];W[fh]C[good followup move];B[ej];W[dk]C[you can also consider a one space jump there]
;B[ek];W[cm]C[high seems better than low here
--
on second review, D7 is much better here, by going low you reduce your points for no gain in strength]
;B[cq]C[though now you get the benefits of low :-)];W[cp]C[despite K3, I'd be tempted by D3]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[fr];B[ds]
(;W[br]C[This doesn't seem right.  Wouldn't F1 be better?];B[cr]
;W[om]C[What happened to F8, attack on E9?  I don't like M7.  
--
this move seems too moyo focused, and it forgets about black's weak group.  Remember the proverb is "make territory through attacking", so you should be attacking E9, hoping to make some useful territory somewhere.  I would be looking at e8 etc, shifting black to the center before pincering K3]
;B[ql];W[oj];B[pk];W[ok];B[pj];W[pi];B[dl];W[cl];B[fl]C[I think black got the better of you for the last few moves]
;W[jj]C[Your moyo seems to small and too easily reducable.]
;B[hj];W[gj]C[probably an overplay now. but ok];B[gk];W[gi]
;B[ik];W[hi]C[good];B[mp]C[dubious move by black.  It is a good point but you're only one move away from sealing the center]
;W[po];B[pp];W[qm];B[qn]C[Lots of little dillemmas in this sequence, where I spendt most of my thinking time.

[ss]C[So, with komi you would have won.

Overall I think you went for a center moyo very early in the game, and this is a dangerous strategy because it means black has points while you just have a potential that is easily erased.  You also missed a few moves that were worth a few points and settled/didn't settle a few things you should have.

However you did make good use of a number of opportunities, especially the Q6 sacrifice.  And having decided to go after a center moyo you were quite consistant about keeping it.]
