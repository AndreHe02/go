C[Ness: Thank you for reviewing my game.  I thought I played pretty well, but I still came up 13 points short.

I think that your biggest problem is that you are not very good at seeing the right direction of play.

What is "direction of play"? it is a general feeling for where you should be putting your stones. Where on the board the big moves are. What sort of result you should be aiming to get, rather than the details of the tactics you should use to get there (your tactics seem to be relatively good). So it is at the whole-board, instinct level of Go.

Although I say it is instinct, it is not something you automatically know, it is something you have to learn. Partly by thinking what is happening in your own games, but study can also help. Perhaps one of the best books about this is "Set Strong at the Opening". It is a lot of full-board opening problems, and for a lot of them, the way you get to the answer is to look at the board, spot the important direction of play, then that tells you where you need to put a stone. Even if GSATO does not use the word 'direction' much, that is what is going on in its explanations.

"Get Strong at Attacking" may have more examples of finding the right direction of play in the middle game, but I am less familiar with that book so am not completely sure. Also, "The Great Joseki Debates" talks about direction of play a lot.

You need to study direction of play until it has become instinctive for you.]
;B[cd];W[od];B[dq];W[oq]C[Making a massive over-simplification, at this stage in the opening you have two choices: 

* either you play a move that continues your plans

* or you play a move that gets in the way of your opponent's plans.

Generally speaking, it is better to get on with your own plans, and not worry too much about your opponent.

What is your plan here? See the variation.]
(;B[qp];W[pn]C[One very important time to think about the direction of play is when you choose which joseki to play, so now, or even last move when you chose how to approach the corner. However, this is not the best example in this game, so I won't analyse it in detail.]

(;B[qn]LB[qo:A]C[This is a small mistake. If you want this kind of result, it is better to play A. See the variation.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[pm];B[ql];W[jp];B[qe]LB[ec:A][ok:B][qk:C]C[Again, you choose to go into white's area rather than to build your own.

I would rather make a shimari around E17 (A).

One problem with your play is that all your stones on the right are low on the third line.

Note that white B is probably a forcing move that you will have to answer at C. Yet another stone on the third line.


Here is one clear part of direction of play. The stone on R8 (under C) is a low, strong stone. This makes the whole of the right side boring for both players.

Because it is Black is low, he cannot make a big territory on the right (especially when white has the B-C exchange up his sleeve), so it is not interesting for black.

Because black is strong it is not interesting for white to try to make territory near here. Black can just ignore any white moves round here, so white can only do stuff in gote. Now, if black was weak, white might be able to find moves that both expand the white area and put pressure on black (make territory while attacking). That would be interesting, but white cannot do that here.

So, right side boring. Don't play there!];W[qc];B[qh]LB[pg:A]
C[No! You really have to play on the 4th line (at A) for the proper high-low balance.]
;W[kc]LB[lp:B][hq:A]C[Ness: So far, so good, I thought.  I have some territory, he has some territory...but I wasn't sure what to do next.

Well, the white stone are working a little bit better than the black stones at the moment, because all the black stones on the right are low, but of course, it is only a small advantage.

(That is one thing about direction of play. Direction of play errors tend to be quite small, perhaps only one or two points each, but if you can train yourself to instinctively recognise the right direction of play throughout the game, then you will pick up a few points here and a few points there without much effort, and that might make the difference. For example, in this game, you only end up 13 points behind after 267 moves.)


So what should you do here? 

Well, guess what, I still think that making a shimari in the top left is a good move.

But if you want an alternative, you could consider H3 (A). After you have played A, an invasion at B might be a good follow-up, since it splits white into two groups, neither of which are very strong.


That is another aspect of good direction of play. You want to play moves now that will give you the chance to play more good moves in the future. 

Notice that this is not quite the same a sente. A sente move is a move that the opponent must answer now, or he will suffer a big loss immediately. A move with a good follow-up is a good move now, and if the opponent does nothing now, you will be able to play another reasonably big move later. 

This is something you might notice if you look at professional games. They don't just play good moves. They always seem to be in a position where they have several good moves to choose from next. Now in my games, I sometimes get to a position where I can't think of a good move to play. There was something subtly wrong with my earlier moves. That just doesn't happen to pros.]
;B[pl]C[Ness: I'm not too happy with this move, but I felt I wanted to do something about the white wall.

This is slow, because the right side is still low and uninteresting, and it is not clear that you have a good follow-up to this move. So if you want to harass the white area at the bottom, H3 is better.]
;W[ed]C[This is a good move.];B[nl]C[Still a bit slow.];W[df]
C[Ness: I felt W made a mistake here, because while he has been making outside influence, I have been getting into the middle.

No. I think that both of white's last two moves where better than both of your last to moves. 

White has been expanding one side of his moyo at the top, while putting pressure on your corner. (Next, you defend the the corner at the top in gote, so you must have been feeling the pressure.)

You have been expanding your area on the right, but that is smaller than white at the top, and you have been putting a bit of pressure on white at the bottom, but only a bit. (You might like to think a bit about what happens if you invade around M4 or N4 now. White can probably handle it, but but this might still be a good plan for you, since white will have to work hard to cope with it.)]
;B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[bf]
(;W[of]C[Ness: ...but now somehow his territory looks very deep

Yes. White has found the right direction of play here.

When there are two moyos next to each other, like the white one at the top an the black one on the right, then a play at the junction on the two moyos is normally the biggest move on the board. (There are lots of problems in Get Strong at the Opening where that is the right answer.)

In fact, white might have been able to do even better here. See the variation.]
;B[oh]LB[jd:B][nh:A][co:D][hq:C]TR[bf][df]C[Again, this is slow. The black area does not get much bigger, and you do not expand the white area much. If I was white, I might play A next to expand the top more.

So where should you play?

If you are worried about the area at the top, a reducing move like B is probably the best way to deal with it. 

On the left side, the marked black stone, with the white stone over it, is another example of a low, strong black stone. So the left side is boring.

What about the bottom? Well, there is the idea of invading the white area immediately, but I prefer C. After C, it would be really good for you to invade the white area, so white probably has to defend (but it is hard to find a really good defensive move for white). Then you play D to make a shimari, and you have already extended in front of your shimari.]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[do]LB[fp:A]C[OK, so white has approached your corner. You have to choose how to answer. Time to choose a joseki means time to think about direction of play.

In fact, we have already thought about this three moves ago. On the left there is a low, strong stone, so the left is boring. At the bottom, you want to get some more stones, so that you can invade the white area, and then white has to struggle.

So I want to play F4 (A). See the variation.]
(;B[dl]C[Ness: What would you recommend here?  I didn't like this move much but I wasn't sure what to do.

Exactly. You should now understand that this is the wrong direction of play.]
;W[gp]LB[eo:B][fo:A]C[This is probably slightly wrong. White wants to join his two weak positions together, and the one-point jump to A does that better. 

You should be aiming to keep white separated, so you should be thinking about playing A or B yourself.]
;B[co]C[Ness: For the next ten moves or so, we were both under time pressure.

This is not a good move.];W[cn];B[dp];W[dn];B[bo];W[bn];B[fr]
LB[fo:A]C[The second line is the line of defeat!

What are you doing? Your corner is perfectly safe. You should still be trying to separate white. Can you play A?]
;W[dj];B[ck]C[Is this black stone really important? Why are you trying to save it? If white does try to capture it, you can probably just play B11 in sente and give it up on a small scale. 

I think that a reducing move at the top is probably bigger.]
;W[cj];B[fl];W[hl];B[gk]
(;W[hk]C[Now we see white getting the direction badly wrong.

White should not be trying to attack to kill. White should attack to make territory. See the variation.]
;B[gj];W[dh];B[hj]LB[gh:A][hi:B]C[This is also wrong. One of the decisive questions in the game is how bit will the white territory at the top be. The bottom middle area is not interesting. It is basically just neutral points. No one is going to make any territory around L8.

So you want to run as far into the top area as you can. You should probably play the one-point jump to A, or at least play B.]
;W[ij]C[White is still getting it wrong, and pushing you into the white moyo.]
;B[ii]LB[gg:B][hh:A]C[So again, you want to move in the direction A or B and reduce the white area as much as possible while living.]
;W[jk];B[jj];W[ik];B[gg]C[Ness: The clock reset around this point.

Good!];W[gm];B[fm];W[fn];B[ji]C[Good. This is a thick move. Now the black group is strong, and black has no worries anywhere on the board. After you have played this move, you can concentrate on making white worry.]
;W[rf];B[qf];W[re];B[qd]C[Ness: My next few moves seem wrong to me...

I'm not sure. I think this is OK.];W[rd];B[pc];W[pd];B[rg];W[qb]
LB[mc:A]C[You finish in sente, which is good. Also, the 'dead' black stone at Q17 means that a black move somewhere like A is a bit of a threat. Which makes an invasion anywhere along the top more of a worry for white.]

Yes.];W[ih]C[Ness: I was worried when he played here but it worked out fine actually.]

;B[jo];W[io];B[ge]LB[gh:A]C[I think  that A would be better. It is not clear that this whole white group has 2 eyes.]
;W[gh];B[fe];W[de];B[pq];W[nn];B[mn];W[or]C[Ness: I was glad W played here, I thought it was slow.

It is a very big endgame move.

If you think white needs to defend in the top left, why didn't you play there instead of Q3.]
;B[bh];W[bk];B[bl];W[bi];B[eg]C[Ness: I was happy with this attack...

Yes, you play well here.];W[ff];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch];W[cf];B[bg]

;W[ga];B[fb]C[Ness: ...though he managed to reduce it a lot.

(Better to play atari, one above, first.)

That was quite a big gain. 

By my estimate the score on the board is now about even.

The only problem is that it is white's turn to play ...];W[ok]
C[And white correctly finds the biggest move, so you are still a bit behind.]
;B[ol];W[nk];B[kk];W[kl];B[kj];W[ll]MA[ap]C[Ness: Now I think I should have played A4 first.

No. 

a) white can just ignore you, and

b) it is better to play G6 first.]
(;B[gn]C[Well done for seeing this move.];W[fo];B[hm];W[im]
;B[hn];W[in];B[gl];W[pj]C[The moves you try later, I think that they work now. See variation.]

LB[rr:A]C[People really ought to know how to answer the monkey jump. 

In this case, A is right. You either get sente by ignoring white's next move, or can play R1 next.]

Yes.];W[rq];B[rp];W[sr];B[qm];W[pg];B[qg];W[ph];B[qj];W[al]

Well, not really. 

Actually, you should try all this a bit earlier. Say, after 162.]

"Make territory while attacking" is one of the simplest ways of getting the direction right; and just playing random moves which threaten the opponent, but which don't actually achieve any gain is one way of getting the direction of play badly wrong.

If white can make this much territory at the top, he won't care that black has probably lived.

Hmm, white might worry a bit that the white stones at the bottom are getting weak, so perhaps that last move should be at G6. Mind you, with all the white territory at the top, white can probably give up the 4 stones around D6 and still win the game.]

Black is not ahead or anything (you can't expect to have a lead after only 7 moves) what I mean is that it will probably be easy for black to find more good moves as the game goes on, and white will have to work hard.]
