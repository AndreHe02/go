J: Hello. My name is Joe and I will be reviewing your game. All of my comments are marked with a "J:". If you need any further clarification on anything or you have other questions, please feel free to email me at "schmee007@yahoo.com".

It was a pleasure to review your game.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[oc];W[qo];B[pl]LB[qk:A]C[J: A pincer works great here with the upper right shimari (corner enclosure). 'A' works better as an extention and still applies some pressure on R5.]
;W[np];B[pi]LB[po:A]C[Was this extension correct?IS A better?

J: You should worry first about the corner. W could easily settle here by playing at Q4. A move at Q5 is much better, since it also splits W's stones.]
;W[pf];B[po];W[pp]
(;B[qp]C[J: This is normally the wrong side to atari.];W[op]
;B[qn];W[qq];B[ro];W[qr]C[WHo got profit after this exchange?

J: Locally, I think w came ahead slightly. Black had the first move, but w has a large corner. 
On the otherhand, Q3 has slight aji that w must worry about.

The reason B is better off is from the Q11-Q14 exchange. W's stone feels wasted, while B is stronger.]
;B[lc]C[J: This is slow. If you want to stress the top then you need to play more towards the left, since you are already so strong there with the shimari.

You might consider G16 if you wish to stress the top. I would prefer to approach the upper right with D15 here.]
;W[ic]C[J: W marked off the territory you decided you didn't want.]
;B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[jq];W[cm];B[mr]C[Was  this move too early?

J: Not at all. Since a B move at P2 is not acceptable, W must respond here. You are strengthening your group in sente.]
;W[nr];B[mq]C[J: W does not need to respond to this move, since there is no way to make Q3 live. You might consider leaving this area for now.]
;W[nq];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg]C[J: W has a pretty strong presence in the lower left. You might consider playing D14 to play a little tighter.

If W plays normal with E16, then the joseki follow-up of C9 is too thin.]

(;W[cj];B[ec];W[db]
(;B[ch]C[J: This move does not do much. You should continue to press on the top. 
See variations.];W[gd];B[ed];W[fb]C[J: W is all connected and you have a floating group.]

(;B[dj]C[J: Not much is available in the center, I would play B10 first to help settle.]
;W[dk];B[di];W[ek]TR[ec][ed][de][cf][dg][ch][di][dj]C[WAs the marked group weak?

J: B can ensure 2 eyes with 1 move at B13. This group can also still run to the center. I would not consider this weak. 

This would be a good time to further develop the moyo on the right.]

(;B[bj]C[was this a good move?

J: Perhaps, if you think that you are weak :)];W[bk];B[ci];W[rh]
;B[rj]LB[qg:A]C[was this too passive? A instead?

J: This is fine. A move at 'A' would split the w forces up, but 1 force would be strengthened as you try to keep them seperate. It is better to force W into a small area then to let him try to run in your territory]
;W[ph];B[qg]C[good move?

J: Not really. Part of W can become strong while he attacks this stone. I would prefer a play at P11 to pressure this group.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[og];B[qf];W[qe];B[pe];W[of];B[re];W[oi];B[pj]
C[J: W never had any territory here. W is happy enough just to reduce you.]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[mp]C[who's better right now?

J: I prefer black for not having any weak groups, otherwise the game is still very playable for white.

This would also be the time to prepare for an attack on the weak group. K16 would be an interesting start.]
;B[lq]C[J: Empty triangles are not usually a good thing. I prefer either L3 or L2.]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[ke];B[nh]C[should i leave this for ko threat?

J: This seems ok for now. The fight is headed in this direction, and this stone may help.]
;W[oh];B[lh]C[J: I would view O12 as a forcing play and leave it. Any moves to stop W from connecting and possibly profit in the meantime should be played now, such as M15 or N14.]
;W[mf];B[gh];W[jh];B[mk];W[mi];B[li];W[mh];B[lj];W[mj];B[lk]
;W[nm];B[ck];W[cl];B[bl];W[ak];B[al];W[cj];B[ep];W[eo];B[ck]
;W[fr];B[er];W[cj]C[how big was this ko?

J: If W connects, he gets at least 2 captures + 4 pt territory. If B can capture he gets about the same. There is much more to lose for W, since his largest territory is here, and a b capture here would allow a safe b play at B5 (another ~10 pts)]
;B[pr];W[ps];B[ck];W[qj];B[qk];W[cj];B[do]C[J: This removes some of your potential here if you win the ko :(

M15 or P1 are both nice threats.];W[co];B[ck];W[qi];B[aj];W[bn]

(;B[pk]C[J: This is small. Better to fight along the sides where your territories meet. D2 is huge.]
;W[dr];B[gr];W[es];B[fs];W[go];B[he]C[good move?

J: W just threatened to push down on your territory with H4. I would respond to that immediately.

This move does not threaten to cut any stones, and if you were to reduce this area, it would be best to do start around K18.]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[jf];B[ik]C[J: This feels like a dame (neutral) point. No player is likely to get territory here. This move does not expand any of your frameworks, and does not cut into W's.]
;W[fi]C[J: This move is not dame, since you could have played F10 earlier to secure a few points.]
;B[fh];W[gj];B[ii]C[J: Dame again.]
(;W[ko]C[J: W is reducing from the wrong side.];B[jo];W[kn]
;B[hp]C[J: I think you are lucky to get this move.];W[ho];B[io]
;W[gm];B[ej];W[fk];B[jb];W[jc]LB[ib:A]C[A better?

J: I like this better, see continuation with 'A']

;W[fj];B[im];W[kl];B[ds];W[cs];B[cr];W[cq];B[br]C[J: B1 is a safe way to avoid the ko, and you would still keep sente.]
;W[es];B[nj];W[ni];B[nk]C[J: You can connect this group out. The ko is really big right now.]
;W[ds];B[lm];W[km];B[mm];W[rp];B[qo];W[mn];B[rq];W[rr];B[sp]
;W[sr];B[sq]C[J: In the end-game, it is best to play moves you think your opponent will respond to. While this is worth a point, it is gote, and there are bigger points.]
;W[kp];B[kq];W[jk];B[il];W[hj];B[ij];W[ih];B[jj]C[J: You need to spend 2 moves here to get 1 point. B's biggest move here is at B17.]

;W[da];B[ae];W[fa]C[I think this exchang was bad for black, was it?

J: W responded to every move black made. So every capture is balanced by w playing in his own territory. W was not able to reduce B's territory any further, so this was not horrible for black. 

These moves were better left as ko threats, however.];B[je]

J: Yes];W[ia];B[hi]C[J: Another dame point. You do not need to connect, since each side is completely alive.]

Thank you for the review,by the way I have five questions here for you, please answer them .

1.HOw was my opening?
2.How was my middle game?
3.HOw was my endgame?
4.Overall, how did I do?
5.What do I need to improve on?

Thank you!!!!

J: In this game you had a better opening and middle-game than your opponent. You were leading by quite a bit coming into the end-game where you lost a lot of ground.
In the endgame, you played many worthless moves and several small gote plays. If you would take a little more time and look for moves that eat into your opponent's territory, it would make a big difference. A poor endgame is a horrible way to lose a game after a hard thought out opening and middle game.]
