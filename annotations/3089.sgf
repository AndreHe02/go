C[Mathieu:Thank you reviewed my game.you are a helpful person.

Please point out my mistakes which I cannot discover by myself.

I am white in this game and my opponent is "the many faces of go"(level 5).
(excuse me,my english is poor because i am just a young french boy^^)

M:  Hi!  I'll precede all of my comments with "M."];B[qd];W[dp]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[po]C[Was w6 good?Wasn't R5 better to try to take the corner?

M:  Q5 emphasizes influence.  R5 is more territorial.  As you have played two 
4-4 points (for influence), I like your choice.];B[pl]LB[no:C]
[mp:A][oq:B][qq:D]C[A pincer ...i didn't known what to do?run away or play r3?

M: A search of pro games shows that N4 is the most popular response.  P3 and O5 were also played.  R3 is possible if you want a base, but it is too early to be shut in.]

(;W[np]C[I played this move to exert pressure on the black stone and to run away.is this move correct?

M:  Black can either split white's stones or connect underneath, so this does not exert too much pressure.]

(;B[ip];W[jc];B[fq]
(;W[cn]C[M:  Since the J4 stone is in place, consider E3.];B[dr]
;W[cq]C[M:  The corner is big, but neither your group nor black's is threatened right now.  Your O4 group, on the other hand, could use some help.  You should consider not answering D2 locally.]
;B[lq];W[qq];B[pi];W[ci];B[dk]
(;W[ck]C[M:  Don't think of D9 as an attack on "your territory;" it is not your territory.  The move is a reduction move, and black hopes to get some influence out of it.  Attaching underneath just gives black what it wants, and you earn maybe 2 points of territory.]
;B[cl];W[bk];B[dl];W[oe]LB[fo:A][nq:B]C[
i wanted to play O3 or O2 to take the corner But i dont know why i played this
 move.It seemed good for me.

M:  It is a good reducing play that works well with your position on the top.  F5 and O3 are other good moves right now.]
;B[en]
(;W[bl]C[M:  Good -- once shut in, your C3 group is in trouble.  However, C2 is a better response, as it nets territory and makes the white group secure.]
;B[qr];W[qp];B[qf]
(;W[md]C[M:  I feel that N17, which treats P15 lightly, is a strong move, as it makes it more difficult for black to invade on the top left.]
;B[nr];W[qm];B[rr];W[rq];B[ql];W[pm];B[gd]C[M:  Again, this is not your territory.  Attaching underneath will not earn you much.  

M:  The Q5 group is very unstable.  How will you resopnd to S5?]

(;W[gc];B[fc];W[gb];B[fb];W[db]C[M:  This leaves a lot of aji in the corner.  C17 looks like something for black to aim for.]
;B[gl]C[M:  Black wasted a move for you.  Black's F17 stones need support.  White's Q5 stones are also unstable and could be attacked more directly.]

(;W[lo]C[If W66 was in H11,was it a good move?

M:  Not especially.  Black just connects.  M5 reduces his moyo.]
;B[gi];W[kl]C[M:  This needs to be at the top, to make a base for the K17 stones.]

(;W[kd]C[Is w78 necessary?

M:  I don't think so, but it's certainly safer.];B[nb];W[mb]
;B[rl];W[rm];B[mk]
(;W[ml]C[M:  Wrong direction.  You have very little territory below N8, and L8 has lots of freedom.]
;B[nk];W[lk];B[jm];W[kj];B[jl];W[ir]C[i wonder why i played this move...^^

M:  Again, all the moves in the sequences I've played out are suspect, but at the very least, J2 has some aji if not responded to.]

(;W[df]C[I close here but was it necessary?

M:  Yes, leaving it open gives black a lot.  

M:  Thanks for letting me review your game!  Overall, your play is quite good.  As always, you should study life and death problems.  You may also find it helpful to think about the difference between "moyo" and "territory."  Several times, you defended your moyo as if it were solid territory, and in every instance, black gained from the encounter.]
