C[My games against this opponent tend to have a similar flavor: I take territory, he takes influence, then I desparately try to make life in the center.  I start out with thickness in the center, but I don't know how to turn that thickness into life.

So how do I go about turning a solid row of stones into a living group?]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[qd];W[dp];B[oc]C[Very typical opening for me these days.]
;W[po]LB[pl:A]C[PEM: I think a pincer would be good here. For instance A (Q8) will serve both
as a pincer, and an extension from the corner enclosure.];B[qo]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[pj]C[Already white is playing for influence.]
;B[fc]LB[qh:A][cn:B]C[PEM: A (R12) is perhaps a bigger and more urgent point. White will
probably not want to ignore it, so Black should get around to play
first on the left side as well.
Also, I think playing the approach from the inside is better, since
Black is low and strong on both the upper and lower side, making these
very uninviting places to play for White. My choice would probably
be B (C6).];W[df]
(;B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[cj]C[Was this an appropriate choice of joseki?

PEM: It's a bit low, on a side where Black already is low.
See earlier variation for an alternative.];B[fq]LB[ej:A][cn:B]
C[How is this kakari?

PEM: It's playable, but again, first capping at A (E10) as a forcing move,
to see White's response may be better. Kakari on the inside (B,C16) may still
be an ption, although it's less inviting now compared to earlier.]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq]C[Appropriate joseki?  Or does it make C10 too efficient?

PEM: This is too slow and low. Black is already strong on the lower
side (with the O3 stones). And furthermore, black ends in gote so
white gets to play E10. As the proverb goes:  "Never let your opponent
perfect his moyo", which is what happens. (See variations earlier about
how to avoid this.)
But leaving these two stones now may be painful, so maybe Black doesn't
have much choice...];W[ej]LB[qh:A]C[Ominous.  I don't know how to reduce that huge framework.  So I just avoid it.  How would Black go about reducing this?  Should Black play to avoid giving it to White in the first place - or were these good trades?

PEM: Very difficult to do anything about the left side now. The big point
now is A (R12).];B[qg]C[PEM: A bit short, but still ok.];W[og]
;B[rj];W[ri];B[qi];W[qj];B[rh];W[rk];B[si];W[pi];B[ld];W[lc]
;B[kd];W[oe];B[od];W[qe];B[re];W[qf];B[rf];W[pd];B[pc];W[pe]
;B[mc];W[cb];B[cr]C[PEM: Good, to ignore Whites move at the top.]
;W[lp];B[lr]C[Too small?  What's bigger?

If to defend here, M3 is probably better. But right now, White played
tenuki on the lower left side, so playing there is probably bigger.]
;W[mr]C[PEM: The wrong side, should be L2.];B[lq];W[mq];B[mp]
;W[mo];B[np];W[no]
(;B[dl]LB[co:A]C[PEM: The weak spot is A (C5). (See variations.)]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[dm]C[This looked hopeless, so I abandoned it.

PEM: Not that bad, as forcing moves. Playing C5 is still an option.]
;B[bq];W[bp];B[dq];W[cp];B[br]LB[ff:A]C[PEM: Too small and not urgent at this point. Much more urgen to expand
towards the center now, for instance with A (F14).];W[kp];B[jq]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[rn];B[ro];W[fe];B[lh]LB[lg:A][kh:B]C[Too far?  I'm trying to learn to play faster moves.

PEM: Good thinking, but maybe slightly over-extending. A (M13) or B (L12)
is pehaps better.];W[lf];B[kg]LB[mf:A][ne:B]C[PEM: Not the best continuation. These stones risk becoming heavy.
A (N14) is better. Note that Black B (O15) threatens to capture the
P15-stones, so it's hard for White to fight back here.];W[kf]
;B[jf];W[jg];B[jh];W[ig];B[ih];W[hg];B[hh];W[lg];B[kh];W[gg]
C[Here it is.  The thickness I mentioned at the beginning.  How do I go about turning this into a living group?

PEM: With great difficulty. These stones are way too heavy. To make life
within the opponents sphere of influence, you must learn sabaki
("fancy footwork"), that is, play lighter, more flexible moves and make
eye-shape. This is however difficult, so it's better to avoid these situations
completely, if possible. ;-)];B[ll]TR[hm][im][hl][il]C[Is this too far?

PEM: The wrong direction. You should stay away from White's strong stones
and perhaps strive towards your friendly stones at J3.
It's hard to know exactly where the best point is, and to read out the
continuations. Maybe somewhere at the marked points (H,J-7,8).
Black should have a flexible attitude here; if he can reduce the center
enough, it may be better to sacrifice the H12-stones.];W[lj]
;B[kk]C[PEM: The same kind of move as earlier. This is a strong move, to be played
where you have a strong position. On the defense, contanct moves like L10 or
N10 is better in this shape.];W[kj];B[jj];W[jk];B[ik];W[jl]
;B[il];W[jm];B[ln]C[PEM: A mistake. J7 is the urgent point here. The objective is to rescue the center stones, the M8-stones must be abandoned.]
;W[im];B[hm];W[hn];B[gm];W[gn];B[in];W[io]C[Misread there];B[ji]
;W[hj]C[We played it all the way through, but I think the game's over, really.

I don't think it's necessary to comment beyond this, but if you have some extra energy, I won't complain.  :)]
