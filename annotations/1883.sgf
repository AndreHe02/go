C[My weakest point is strategy, so I suppose most of my mistakes will be strategical in nature...]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[oc];W[nq]LB[jq:B][pn:A][qj:C]C[In this position, black can play A, white B then black C.

Black will have a nice moyo on the right.

For this reason, white O3 to split the moyo at point C is much better.]
;B[lq]C[I think white's O3 works well with D4, and the prospects of white getting the whole lower side didn't look good, so I pincered.
I believe white made a strategical mistake by going to the 3-3 invasion next, so I think the game was favorable to me at least from now.]
;W[qq]LB[fq:I][oq:G][or:E][po:C][pq:A][pr:D][qn:H][qp:B][qr:F]
C[Black should play A to H at the lower right, then approach the corner at pont I.

(When I say A to something, I mean the sequence, "black A, white B, black C" so on and so forth.)]
;B[qp]LB[pj:A]C[I suppose this is the right direction to work with the upper shimari.

Sorry, this is the wrong direction, this move is valid only when there is a stone at point A.]
;W[pq];B[op]LB[mo:C][nr:B][qj:D][rq:A]C[White A is wrong.

In this position, sente is important.

So white should play B, black to seal at C, then white split the moyo at D, capitalizing black's mistake (R4).]
;W[rq]TR[lq]LB[np:A][nr:B][pj:C][qn:E][rp:D]C[Oops, I don't know this variant of this joseki... I had to improvise (I faintly remember having serious problems if I played S4 here, so I didn't.)

Point A is crucial as to reinforce the weak marked stone at M3.

If white responds with B, then black has the chance to play C.

Later on, white D then black E, this is sente for white.];B[oq]
LB[or:A]C[This is a common mistake, avoid trying to "push" like this.

You lose the chance of play at A instead, moreover, this move can be use as a ko threat if a ko pops up.]
;W[rp]LB[fq:C][or:B][qn:A]C[White gives black 2 choices, A or B.

Black B is correct, if white A then black C to develop the lower side.]
;B[ro];W[or];B[np];W[pj]LB[qh:A]C[Good move by white, this move reduces the influence of black's wall to a large extent.

For the next move, I suggest black A, forcing white to move in the direction of the black's wall.]
;B[pl]C[My senses were screming that this Q8 is way too close to my wall, but I was very worried about white cutting at R5, so this Q8 was in fact to protect the cutting point (OTOH I don't know how well it succeeds in that). Yet, perhaps there would have been a much better move elsewhere?

The cut at R5 is not as big as you may think, even if white may another move on top of R5, say R6, how much more you think w gets locally?]
;W[hc]TR[pj]LB[cc:D][cd:C][cj:B][fq:E][qh:A]C[Black A is big, it aims to attack the marked white stone at Q10 and expands the territory of the top right corner.

From my shallow understanding of Go, a move that you can see the points the clearest (e.g. A)...

Most of the time is preferred over moves which you can't really tell how many points you can get... 

In this case, black B. Even if White plays at B, there is still a lot of invasion points (e.g. C or D).]
;B[cj]LB[qf:A]C[The vision of white playing there was too horrible, so I hurried playing there myself.

White A is huge, white should aim to settle the shape here before moving on to other big points.]
;W[kc]LB[cg:B][cm:C][qh:A]C[Still black A, you are sure to get point B or point C (the term "omiai" describes this situation), so what is the hurry playing here?]
;B[cn];W[fq]TR[cn]LB[cg:B][qh:A]C[Black should still go back to A, assuming the marked black and white stones as some kind of sente exchange.

Since black can still play B, with the possibility of entering 3-3 at lower left, you need not worry too much about the invasion at C8.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]LB[qh:A]C[I would consider all these as slow moves, point A is so urgent but you give it a miss.]
;W[df]LB[ec:B][qf:A]C[White should considered A as top most priority.

Locally, white should play B to secure the points, move that still leave behind weakness (3-3 in this case) are usually inefficient.]
;B[cc]LB[qh:A]C[I wonder what I was thinking of when I made this... The right side looks now bigger.

Yes, I emphasized black A too many times.];W[dc]LB[bb:E][bd:A]
[bf:B][cb:G][da:F][db:C][eb:D]C[Black should play A to G to make the corner alive.]
;B[be]LB[bf:A]C[I post you a question here, what if white play A?]
;W[iq];B[pg]LB[qh:A]C[Seems like I realized that soon after.
My plan was to make that white stone to run and gain profit both in the upper and lower sides by chasing it. The chase succeeded perfectly, but I'm not so sure if it gave me that much profit I was hoping for...
Perhaps I should have attacked the upper and lower sides first to get more influence and then chase that white Q10 stone. My problem is that I'm not very good at making that type of forcing moves in these situations. Any suggestions?

My move is A.];W[bq]LB[mj:B][nj:A]C[White should play A or B here.]
;B[co]TR[bq][pj]LB[nj:A]C[B3 is yose (which means end-game move), responding to such a move definitely means "slow".

Black should give white a cap at A, the marked white stone is as good as dead.]
;W[dh]TR[be][cc]LB[bf:A]C[Locally, to make sure that the 2 black stones are dead, white A is better, D12 is far too greedy.]
;B[mf]LB[nj:A]C[My thought here was: Let's enlarge the moyo and at the same time build influence to attack the Q10 stone.

If white can play L14 here, I don't see your purpose of "reducing" is achieved here.

My simple and straightforward move is at A, if white try to escape, you will tend to get move to the left direction, thereby reducing the white potential at upper left.]
;W[nj]LB[cd:B][lj:A]C[Black A is better, high chance that you can captured the white group.

In any case that white managed to survive, you probably get some kind of profit (wall or points etc) and a sente to make the winning move at B.

This is enough to win.];B[nl]C[This is what I call "inefficiency", using wall to make points, you can *never* get enough to win.]
;W[mq];B[mp];W[qi];B[qg];W[lj]LB[kh:C][mi:A][mj:B]C[Black should continue to attack by A to C.]
;B[ll];W[cb];B[cg]C[Good move, save B15 stone by sacrificing C17 stone.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[cd];B[ke]C[This was some kind of poor attempt to attack the upper side to get influence to attack the white running group in the middle.. Not a very good attack, though. I'm just weak at this.]
;W[oh];B[og];W[bd]LB[if:A]C[Still some kind of yose, if the middle weak piece is not completely settled, still early for such kind of move to decide the boundary.

White A possibly better, making some points while trying (or providing some support) to connect the middle weak piece.]
;B[cf]LB[jj:A]C[Black should continue to pressure the middle white group by A.]
;W[lr]LB[ql:A][qm:B][rl:C]C[If I were to play, I possibly play A to C to make eye and settle.

Remember, safety first...];B[kp];W[mc];B[nd]LB[nb:A]C[Locally, A is bigger.]
;W[if];B[jg]LB[ig:A][ih:C][jh:B][ji:D][ql:E][qm:F][rl:G]C[My sequence for white, A to G, protecting the points at top left and safety for white's group.]
;W[jj];B[ig];W[jk]LB[ql:A][qm:B][rl:C]C[Isn't white A to C more clear cut?

The marked stone is dame, meaning zero in value.];B[jm]LB[hf:A]
C[Still the idea of making points using wall...

Point A not big? 

This maybe why you lost by 0.5 point.];W[gj];B[hf];W[gl];B[id]
C[The chase is almost over. Basically I got some profit around the O6 area and something in the upper side (plus the lonely J14 stone). It didn't result in such a big profit as I expected...]
;W[ic];B[jd]LB[qk:A][rn:B]C[K16 might not be sente, point A is huge, it sort of prevent white from playing B.]
;W[jc];B[hp];W[hq];B[fo];W[nb]TR[fo]C[Huge, what F5 did is to cut white's return path to the bottom, but to me, this white group is more or less alive, so your strategy to cut is wrong.]
;B[ob];W[rk];B[rl];W[qk];B[ql];W[so];B[rn];W[rh];B[rg];W[fe]
LB[kr:A]C[White to win more by playing A.];B[kr]C[This was a very nice idea from my part to reduce white's lower side.]
;W[mr];B[hs];W[sg]C[Tenuki'ing was extremely clever from white. I didn't expect that, and I lost probably the same amount of profit as I gained with the monkey-jump.
White T15 looked so frightening that I couldn't help myself but to block in gote.]
;B[sf];W[sh];B[rf];W[oa]C[Oh dear...];B[pa];W[na];B[pb];W[ip]
;B[go];W[do];B[io];W[dn];B[dm];W[gp];B[ho];W[gr]LB[ap:E][aq:C]
[ar:D][bs:F][gd:B][hd:A][lb:H][mh:K][nc:G][nh:I][ni:J]C[Now I have sente. What to do?

Maybe Black A to K, you still have a slight advantage.];B[ei]
LB[di:A][gh:B]C[I tried to be too smart with this move, and it was a mistake.

Oh yeah, possibly why you lost, locally black A is the move, but rather a helping move to me...

Let's look at it this way, if you can play B anytime (if say when white play A), white can't possibly get many points here.]
;W[di];B[ci];W[ej];B[fi];W[gh];B[fj];W[fk];B[ge];W[dk];B[ck]
;W[gd]C[A3 looks so inviting now... Why didn't I play that? I would have probably won the game with that simple move.

Yes, you are right, A3 is sente 3 points.];B[ff];W[gs];B[js]
;W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[nc];W[mb]LB[mh:C][nh:A][ni:B]C[If black play A to C, likely that you won.]
;B[ad]C[I actually thought this was sente...

Well, the rest of the game is just yose, so I don't think there's anything more interesting there.
(Naturally, as I lost the game by a mere 0.5 points, probably if I had played something different in yose I could have won.)]
;W[ac];B[ae];W[mh]LB[ee:A][ef:C][fd:B]C[Black A to C is 4 points.]
;B[ng];W[ef];B[fg];W[fh];B[ii];W[ce];B[bf];W[eg];B[hd];W[fd]

;W[dj];B[ns];W[nr];B[ms];W[os];B[ks];W[pr]LB[qs:A]C[I post you a question here, what if you play A?

Is this a seki or a ko to kill? Think about it, this can be quite fun.]
;B[rs]C[Just a foolish attempt at making seki...];W[rr];B[qh]
;W[sj];B[pi];W[ri];B[oi];W[nh];B[ph];W[pk];B[lg];W[qs]C[This is not necessary.]

If white lost the game, this is the losing move, clearly white should play A first.

If you don't take the ko, play A (if white stick the ko, you play B), I think you are the one who won by half point.]

C[In conclusion, few advice for you.

1) Never make a move without getting the direction right, think again, which side to develop.
2) Never use wall to make points, try to drive a weak piece towards the wall instead.
3) Never give up, unless you know the margin is too big, for this game, you did have chance till the very last few moves.]
