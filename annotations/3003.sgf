C[Thank you for review my game.

I am White in this game. I always plays bad in White side. My win ratio when I play black and white is 6:4. What's wrong when I use white?

z: Game first reviewed by zenjutsu (4k* on IGS).  Comments will be proceeded by "z:".

z: Please always remember that I am only 4k.  Treat my comments not as the truth, but rather just as food for thought.  I'm here to help you brainstorm so that you can find your own answers to your questions.]

[ol]C[z: Black does not stick with standard joseki, which would be either of the square-marked points.]

(;W[eq]C[z: I don't think that it is safe to play away from LR corner. While black's play may not have been standard joseki, this does not mean that it failed to reinforce his stones and force white to consider reinforcing his in turn.

z: Additionally, this approach invites B to play the pincer (which he does) and that will easily seperate your stones and potentially develop into a threat.]
;B[hp];W[qo];B[rn];W[qj];B[pk];W[jq]C[z: I'm not too certain about this stone.  Feels like it should be at L3 to be safer.]
;B[qq]C[What can White do to counter back black's invation at 3-3?

z: Perhaps play S5 instead of K3, but then a peep along the bottom is still open.]

(;B[pr]C[z: Greedy.];W[rq];B[rr];W[rp];B[nr];W[mr]C[White 24 is too strong?

z: I don't think so.  But a higher ranked player could provide a more firm response.  Personally, I like the play.]

;B[or];W[lq]C[Is White 50 good to place here?

z: I think so, but I think the real error that led to this mess was playing P5 instead of P4.  Sometimes playing the aji-free stone is the best stone.]
;B[kq];W[kp];B[lo];W[ln];B[ko];W[kr];B[jp]
(;W[kq]C[z: I'm not 100% certain, but I feel that J4 was playable and still safe.  However, this appears nice and solid also.]
;B[ip]C[z: I prefer J5.  It protects against the potential future cut at K5.]
;W[hr];B[qk];W[cj];B[gr];W[ir];B[gq]
(;W[cm];B[ep];W[qe];B[qg];W[jc];B[ce]C[z: I'm not the best at score estimation, but let's do a quick guess at the score anyway.  I currently have B at about 50 points. W at about 75, plus sente.  Neither has any real opportunity to build much in the center.  W should easily win this game, in my opinion.]
;W[gc]C[z: I am uncertain which is more valuable at this point in the game, this stone, or N16.  However, I feel that W is currently FAR ahead, and N16 is the easier play with less complication. Thus, I would take that route and just coast to an easy victory.]
;B[oc];W[od]C[z: Q16 MUCH safer than this stone.];B[nc]C[z: W fortunate.  B is far enough behind that it would have been worth trying to complicate the match at Q18.]
;W[pb];B[nd];W[oe];B[lc];W[mf];B[qd];W[re];B[le];W[pi]C[z: I don't like this stone at all.  It feels like W is not yet strong enough to try this.  What is the goal of this stone?  It won't capture, it won't gain territory.  It might reduce, but reduction is better achieved at P13 or Q12 than here.]
;B[og];W[ni]C[z: Now W has built a weak group that is heavy.  You have given yourself wholly to making those three stones survive.  That is a heavy burden.  Now, B can ride that burden to build some good advantage.]

;B[kn]C[z: B is adding pressure.];W[kd]C[z: No.  This is bad timing.  The lower right corner is far too valuable to play elsewhere right now.]

;B[jf];W[ki];B[ri];W[rh];B[qh]C[z: I think B could have safely played S14.  However, B has completely turned the tables on the score.  I now estimate B ahead by 20 or more, so a conservative play like this is not out of line.]

;W[id]SQ[be][he][ej][ch][bo][eb]C[White 148 is a unnecessary move, right?

Where should white play at the moment?

z: Right.  This is not very threatening to B.  Regarding where to play, I've marked a few ideas, although I'm certain you can come up with more.]
;B[jg];W[jh];B[hg];W[eb];B[ec];W[fb]C[z: W could have safely D18 here.]

z: Locally, it is an overplay, as B quickly shows.  If you feel the need for a local play, something more conservative would be good.  However, B is dangerously close to playing E9.]

;W[ma];B[na];W[la];B[me];W[fd];B[pe];W[pd];B[pf]SQ[pa][ea]C[z: Bad.  This is only 1/2 point.  This should be THE last play of the game.  There are still the marked points to play that are more valuable.]

;B[pl];W[ie];B[nh];W[iq];B[oi]C[z: Another wasted play by B.]
;W[tt]C[Black win

Thank you very much.

z: In my opinion, W lost this game by not realizing that a large lead was held early in the game, and playing safe to maintain that lead.  The crucial two errors were allowing the bottom right to get to ko status, which allowed B a huge advantage, and trying to force life too deep in B's territory on the right side, as well as the F9 stones striking into the center from the left side.  W's play is not unlike my own: stronger fuseki, weakness in knowing when you hold a lead, and a few key bad judgements that completely reverse the tide of a game.  I fully believe that if W keeps on playing, studying, and loving the game, than W will be giving me go lessons in the near future.  :)

z: Thank you for sharing your game with me.  If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask.  I wish you the best in your games.]

z: I wish I had a good answer.  Were I a stronger player myself, I might be able to provide a firm "yes" or "no".  As it is, I am not certain that this is the place to play to punish B for his non-standard play.  However, had B played either of the square-marked points (more traditional joseki play), then your stone would be considered the traditional response.  Taking that into consideration, I would say that this is a good stone.]
;B[rn]SQ[qj][qk]C[But I worry after Black stand at S6, White's corner is still can be invated

z: True.  However at this point, W can prevent B from building something on the right with a stone around the marked point.]
