C[in this game black put up a good fight in an even game against a player of approx. my strength. also there are no specific questions added to the game. for these two reasons this review is fairly sparse. mainly only general strategic comments i felt i could make confidently are added. i hope they're useful. mark]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[pk];W[nc];B[pf];W[qc];B[qd]C[this gives away points. the shape is overconcentrated. the common move is Q17.]

;W[qn];B[cn];W[bp];B[fc];W[ch];B[ej];W[hq];B[fq]C[i believe this is a dangerous move which just causes problems for black. both F17 and K4 are lonely stones, so i would focus on a move lending support. it might be possible to treat K4 lightly for now, but not F17. that's why i think J17, K16, or possibly L3 would be much better here.]

;W[ep];B[fp];W[eq];B[er];W[gr]C[white could have played F2 or D2 here.]
;B[fr];W[em];B[dl];W[hm];B[iq]C[H4 is worth considering here. a cut is possible. the move played only asks white to strengthen himself.]
;W[hp];B[lq]C[white could ignore this and take a big corner with B2. whatever black was planning to do with the bottom left group should be done here instead.]

C[the fight resulting from the black invasion at F3 has resulted in a weakening of the middle left group, and a "weakish" middle bottom group which is now too big to give up. the bottom left corner is at least a source of several ko-threats for white. 

for these reasons white now has a better position, but it is not yet hopeless for black.

here i would much prefer to see F17 recieving some support. maybe J17 or D18 instead?]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf]C[dangerous shape. because of the presence of C12 white could have answered B15 here. i suggest B14 instead.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[df];B[bf];W[jd]C[any additional thickness that white can create from attacking the F17 stone also weakens the weak black groups further. that's why white's position is much better now. this was the last comment.]
