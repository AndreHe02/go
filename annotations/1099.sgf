C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing this game.  I have no idea where I'm going wrong, but it seems as though no matter what I try, I end up falling far behind early on and having to try to catch up.  If I attack my opponent, I end up with weak groups; if I try to keep strong, stable groups, I end up conceding a big moyo to my opponent; and if I try to build a bigger moyo than my opponent, my opponent is able to attack effectively while I'm not.

Ted Schuerzinger,
Fedya on KGS

Dear Ted,  thanks for giving me the opportunity to review  your game. It was quite interesting.
Here is a quick summary:
I think you played too timid. You let Black invade and press on your groups without showing real intend to give something of the pressure back or exploit the weaknesses of the black groups. Black pushed you around like he wanted to. Show more confidence in your fighting skills. Of course you have to *see* your possibilities first. Maybe this is where my comments can help you.
Moreover, instead of punishing your opponent for having weak groups you make him stronger with some "attacks".
My suggestion for becoming a stronger player is to solve a lot of Go-problems. Good books are "Graded Go Problems For Beginners 1-4" or the "Get Strong At..."-Series.

Hope I could help,

(;W[jc]C[Fedya: I wanted to prevent Black from playing here, which would work well with the stones at D17 and D14.

===
The idea to prevent Black from playing here is not too bad. But you have to keep in mind, that Black may invade and try to use his D17-group to push you around. Certainly, that group is thin and you have a lot of moves there.
You correctly decided that the upper side is the big side.
Another idea would be to play nearer to your cornerstone. This would prevent a Black approach from this side and would give you a good base. Especially in correlation with your komoku stone (Q3).  My choice would be N17. See variation.
A suggestion: try to think different in your future games. Your first thought should NOT be "How do I prevent my opponent from playing a big move?". Instead try to figure out how  you could make your groups save, make a good base for them and which moves provide a good follow-up for you.  Just playing where you think Black wants to play is a sure strategy to end up with weak groups. ;-)]
;B[nc]
(;W[ne]C[===
Hm, I think this is too timid. The usual idea in this situation is to make the invader overconcentrated. See variation]
;B[lc]
(;W[gc]C[Fedya: I thought this looked good for me.

===
This still looses the initiative. I think you should put the invader under pressure. As long as Black has to respond, your white stone is not in immediate danger. Moreover by attacking Black you have a good chance to take care of your K17 stone too.]
;B[pb]C[===
Now, Black is not in danger anymore. Instead you have two weak groups to care for.]

(;W[pj]TR[pd][ne]C[Fedya: I thought I didn't need to respond to Black's last move and could develop normally.  Stronger players have told me I should play lightly, which is why I didn't play this closer to the stones at O15 and Q16.  Besides, I didn't think Black could play in there and make a living group.


===
I would have played R17 or try a play at R18. The idea would be to play some moves Black has to answer whilest gaining a more stable position for your own stones.

Playing lightly is very good style in some cases. For example if you want to reduce a moyo. Or if you are under attack. If you play lightly you are willing to sacrifice some stones in order to make other stones stronger. Overextending is not playing lightly. ;-)
Your move would be good if there wasn't the black group in the corner. With the help of these stones it should be easy for Black to invade.]
;B[nq]C[Fedya: I don't think I've seen this approach to a 4-3 stone before.  Isn't it better to play at Q5 or R5?


===
You are right. This would be the usual approach move. I think Black wanted to build a moyo around his corner stone at D4.]
;W[po]C[===
Generally, this idea is good, but now all your stones on this side are on the fourth line. It should be easy for Black to invade. Try the low shimari at R5 instead.

Hm, on the other hand - this move puts more pressure on Black.]
;B[nn];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[jq]C[Fedya: Thankfully, Black didn't play a pincer attack in the J3 area with his last move.  Every time that happens, I seem to get the short end of the stick.  I'm hoping to play something in the C10 area as soon as possible.

===
Very good! This move is also a big threat to the very thin O3 group.]
;B[kr]
(;W[jr]C[Fedya: Not yet -- I didn't want Black to play under my group and force me to get two eyes in the center.

===
Why not? It is Black who will come under pressure. Press him to the second line and threaten to split the O3-O6 extension. Your Q3 - Q5 group is really very strong. use it to attack.]
;B[kq];W[jp]C[Fedya: I was worried about the hane at K4, followed by the hane on the other end at K1.  I also didn't play the L4 hane, because I was worried about a cross-cut.

===
Yes, this could become messy.];B[qm]C[===
Hm, Black is begging to be split. ;-)]
(;W[qn]C[Fedya: I wasn't certain of the best way to respond to Black's attack at R7.  In situations like this, if I've tried to counterattack, by playing something like Q7, I invariably end up with weak groups.  But when I play like this, stronger players tell me I'm playing too passively.

===
You are playing too passively. ;-)
Q7 is just the right idea.

You are too concerned with the corner. This white corner-enclosure has good potential to attack the thin black group.  If you want to play for territory play R5 instead of Q5.

Some principles:
-"cut where you can cut". When you can cut, your opponent usually ends up with two weak groups. Which leads to:
-a weak group between two weak groups is a strong group
 -never let yourself be sourrounded in the corner. The corner would no longer play a part in the game. Try to break out!]
;B[pm];W[rj]C[===
This move does not help your positions. Again you are too much concerned of "your" territory. Try to get the initiative. A good way to start would be to split the lower right group or to invade at the left side]
;B[pn];W[qo];B[qg];W[og]LB[pd:A][ne:A][pj:B][rj:B]TR[qg]C[Fedya: I wasn't certain of the best way to respond to Black's last move.  I thought I had a choice between trying to prevent the R13 stone from connecting to the group at the top, but ending up with two groups (the two stones at A and the two at B) split apart; or connect my stones but give up territory on the side.  I opted for the latter.  Besides, I should end up with influence, and stronger players *insist* that influence is a good thing.

===
"connect where you can connect"
I think you came to the right decision. If Black can cut you, the game is lost. Especially with the sourounding  black groups. If you stay connected these black groups are still good targets.

By the way: I am not sure if Black should be able to live there whithout hurting the O17 group. The invasion is maybe too deep.

The O3 group is also still weak.];B[qd];W[qe]C[Fedya: I guess I should have let Black connect R16 and R13 instead of trying to do two things at once (kill the R13 stone and make territory).  But I was told by a stronger player that I need to make more "dual-purpose" moves.

===
Yes, you are right about the dual-purpose moves.
But I can't see where you are trying to make territory. This is a good move to attack the black invader.]
;B[pc]
(;W[od]C[===
I think this move should be at Q15];B[nd];W[cj]C[Fedya: I thought I had sente and could play here.  I think it's bigger than S15 anyhow.


===
I think so too. S15 is an endgame move. And  black S15 does not connect the Black stones. But there is still potential in the surrounded black stone.]
;B[cl];W[cg];B[cf];W[bf];B[be];W[bg];B[ci]
(;W[bi]C[Fedya: Again, I wasn't certain of the best way to respond to Black's attack.



===
This is too passive. You want to reduce the side and stay connected with the center. Do not try to live a small life here.]
;B[di];W[ch];B[dh];W[ah]C[Fedya: Thankfully, Black didn't play here.  But Black should still be able to make life difficult for me trying to get two eyes.]
;B[dg]
(;W[af]C[Fedya: Thankfully, Black lets me get my two eyes.

===
I think you had two eyes here. ;-) see variation];B[dj];W[ck]
;B[dk];W[bl];B[bk];W[bj];B[bm];W[ak];B[dm]
(;W[ge]C[Fedya: Again, I had sente, but am not certain of the best idea.  I thought I needed to do something to shore up the two stones at G17 and K17, as well as make if more difficult for Black to get territory in the center.  Would E16 have been better?  F6?  S15?  O10?  N15?

==========
I think it is a good idea to make this group stronger and to counter the great black influence. That would be a good situation to play "lightly". For example by playing H14.   But the group at the top is not in immediate danger, so another idea would be to take the initiative and try to split the black group in the lower right!   E16: this is not a real threat to Black and only makes him stronger. Right know  you have the good move at B16 to cut a big slice out of Black's corner later. (see variation . this is a move to keep in mind) Don't force Black to defend here by playing E16

F6: You have this move later. Right now, the upper group is more in danger. So a move around G15 is much more urgent than F6

S15: A good idea. Should be sente and saves your group. Or try S16. Still the threat to cut at Q14 might be dangerous.

O10: This is really small.

N15: Small];B[fd];W[gd];B[gg]
(;W[eb]C[===
Your white group is not in immediate danger.  After sticking out your head at the top, you should come out with the group at the bottom and nullify the influence of the strong black wall.]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[db];W[re];B[rd];W[fe]C[Fedya: I have a feeling you're probably going to criticise this move.  In retrospect, I obviously should have played at O10 (or something for the group on the right side).

===
Yes, this is a very small move and only helps Black to become stronger.

I still think the best two options are splitting the black group in the lower right or nullify the influence of the black wall.

I don't see your P13 group is in danger.];B[ee];W[er]C[Fedya: I thought this was better than letting Black play at F2.  And of course, I didn't think there was any problem with my group in the upper right since I had played S15.

===
Still it is an endgame move.];B[dr];W[fr];B[gn];W[kp]C[Fedya: I should have played something like G5 instead.  I didn't realise how much territory Black would be able to take away after playing at H4.  However, I felt I needed to do something to prevent Black from getting too much territory in the center, and this move allows me to jump out into the center next.

===
Hm, this move helps Black to become stronger.];B[lp]
(;W[jn]C[===
Your groups at the side are not in immediate danger, so another idea would be to play a move in the center.   This move also would be playable without the L4-M4 exchange.]
;B[hp]C[===
This move (small knight's move) can be cut.]
(;W[hq];B[gp];W[gq];B[ip];W[iq];B[im];W[jm];B[jl]
(;W[ks]C[Fedya: I thought this was a must, since it's no longer certain that I can get an eye in the center.  Stronger players insist that when one plays a pincer against you, you can run out into the center and get one eye there -- but it seems it never quite works that way for me.


===
That rule applays only in the opening. If a game/situation is played that far you may have to seek eyespace at the side.
Still, I would try to put Black under pressure. This move helps Black to solidify his group.

You can always make two eyes by playing for example G1.];B[lr]
;W[ls];B[ms];W[js];B[nr]C[===
Now Black certainly lives here and it is your corner group which finds itself under pressure]
;W[pr];B[kl]C[Fedya: Clearly, I screwed up somewhere.  I thought I had a good position before, but now it looks terrible.  Black has three corners, as well as much more territory in the middle than I can hope to get.]
;W[lo];B[mp];W[io];B[hn];W[in];B[hl];W[ds]C[Fedya: I played this because if I let Black play at E1, I'd eventually have to play at H1 in gote to prevent Black from making a seki on the bottom.  This takes some territory from Black, *and* is sente for me.

===
It is certainly a big endgame move.];B[cr];W[cs];B[bs];W[es]

(;W[pi]C[Fedya: I think this is where I screwed up.  I could have saved all the stones if I had played at Q14 instead.  But I'm still losing by 20-30 points.

===
Maybe it is a matter of good form. Earlier in the game I would have choosen Q15 instead of P16.

But your right. You are far behind...];B[of];W[ng];B[nf];W[pf]
;B[me];W[oe];B[mf];W[mg]TR[mg][ng][og]C[Fedya: I played this because I realized the ladder is in Black's favor.  Allowing Black to capture this group would lose the semeai, but this move loses the semeai as well.]
;B[qf];W[pe];B[rf]C[Fedya: Realizing that I've lost the semeai, I resigned.  Even if I had won the semeai, I would have been trailing by a bundle anyhow.

yes resigning is the only move now. :-(])
