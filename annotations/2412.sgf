C[B: This is a game I played recently on the Kiseido Go Server. I am playing black, and would be grateful for any advice or pointers that you may identify.

Denis: As usual, I tried to make my best for this review but don't take my comment as the only true.

Notes: Many comments are from the requestor of the review, the Black player. They have been prefixed by B:]
;B[qd]C[B: I have recently been trying opening on the 3-4 points.]
;W[dd]C[B: I expected this as an attempt to prevent me playing a Chinese fuseki (which I don't know).]
;B[dq]C[B: I like to play a diagonal fuseki when given the opportunity.]
;W[pp];B[oc]C[B: Since white took the fourth corner, I played a shimari.]
;W[jq];B[pk]C[B: I felt that I could extend a little further from my shimari than in the other directions, and this also prevented W making a double wing formation.

Denis: Good.];W[qm];B[ph]MA[jq]LB[jd:A][do:B][cj:C][dj:D]C[B: This seemed a little passive but I didn't want W to be able to play a pincer against Q9.

Denis: Don't worry about that now. You can extend on the other direction at A (so you have the double wing). You can also make another shimari on the opposite corner at B, but the marked stone is already at a possible extension from that shimari so that's not as good. A third possibility is to take position on the left border at C or D.]
;W[co];B[do]LB[ck:A]C[Denis: I would have prefer a pincer like A.]
;W[dn];B[eo];W[en];B[cp];W[bo];B[gq]C[B: The tsuke nobi joseki is at least solid which i feel fits in with a 3-4 point fuseki.]
;W[dj]C[B: This seem s a little narrow.

Denis: Not at all. I think the result is favorable for white.]
;B[fc];W[kc]C[B: This seems a loose play by W since I can extend to J17.

Denis: I don't agree. W must play on this side. He cannot let B play another move. If B approach from the left, W answers on the right and if B plays on the right, W can extends on the left. So I think that a good and flexible move.]
;B[ic];W[md]C[B: W has no really good continuation];B[oe]C[B: I felt that this gave me a strong and light shape in the top right]
;W[id]LB[kf:A]C[Denis: Too early to attach. White must escape in the center at A.]
;B[hd];W[jd];B[mb]C[B: Narrowing W's eye space.

Denis: There was not much! and you don't have much either for your group on the upper left. I think it's more important to make it stronger now.]
;W[ib]C[Denis: Not sure that it's correct. W cannot attack now because his group is weak. So I think it's more important to make it stronger before attacking the black group on the left.]
;B[hb];W[jc];B[hc];W[ja];B[kb]LB[db:A]C[B: And again

Denis: Yes you take the eye. But your group on the left is heavy and weak. You should have moved toward the corner, this was more important (e.g. at A)]
;W[lb]C[Denis: useless. White must jump toward the center.]
;B[lc];W[ld];B[mc];W[ka];B[la];W[eb]C[Denis: Beside the weakness of the W group on the upper side of the board, This is good.]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[fb];W[db];B[ff]C[B: The black group may be a bit heavy but this seems light.

Denis: Again, I don't agree. The exchange is clearly good for white. White took a good corner, and B has a heavy group with nothing. I certainly would not call this "light".]
;W[hf]C[Denis: dubious. White must jump in the center from this weak group. But cannot press black like this, because black will counter attack and make his group stronger.]
;B[he];W[if];B[ie];W[je];B[jf];W[kf];B[jg];W[gg];B[gf];W[hg]
;B[fg]C[Denis: The fight is starting to become complicated!]
;W[gi];B[gh];W[hh];B[fh];W[ii]C[B: This seemed to bring this attack to a suitable end for the moment]
;B[cf]MA[jf][jg]C[B: I decide that attacking the W corner would take some territory and give my group eye space

Denis: No problem with that. Thought I would have prefer to continue in the center and may be try to escape the 2 black stones to cut white.]
;W[df];B[ee];W[dg];B[de];W[ce];B[dh]C[B: This may have been wrong, but c16 seemd risky at the present]
;W[cg];B[ch];W[bh];B[fi];W[fj];B[cd];W[bf]C[B: I'm not totally happy about the continuation, or was I being over optimistic by attacking here

Denis: Indeed! you were (too optimistic). But you also missed 2 opportunities to take profit from white mistake.]
;B[bd];W[be]C[Denis: Not very good.. Now black can attack the corner.]
;B[bb];W[ac]LB[cb:A]C[Denis: Another bad move. White should play A.]

(;B[ad]MA[dd][dc][db][eb]LB[cb:A]C[Denis: Not good. The fight is in the corner. You want to kill the 4 marked white stones so you don't care if white connect this stone. With this move you don't take liberties from white and you don't add any new one for you. You should play A. See variation for a possible continuation. Black really missed the opportunity in the corner.]
;W[ca];B[cb];W[ba];B[da];W[ea];B[ed];W[ab]C[B: B17 was probably better looking at it now

Denis: Not for white. But indeed for black.]
(;B[fa];W[bc];B[ha]C[B: Make eye space and leave J19 for later

Denis: Too slow. Your group is alive and there are move important points elsewhere.]
;W[lh]C[Denis: Good for white. He must take the 2 black stones to connect his 2 groups.]
;B[gj];W[hi];B[ej];W[ek];B[fk];W[el];B[di]C[B: didn't like this empty triangle but it seemed appropriate]
;W[cj];B[mq];W[lp];B[mp];W[mo];B[lo];W[no];B[lq];W[kp];B[kq]

C[B: and make life];W[qq];B[qr];W[rr];B[oq];W[op];B[kj]MA[ho]
[io][ip][jp]LB[hl:A]C[B: B4 probably had become necessary but W had the makings of a big moyo on the right so something like this was more important. I also saw it as being a ladder breaker for F6.

Denis: B4 is certainly big. But you should have considered escaping the 4 black stones. BTW you have the big moyo on the right, not white.]
;W[hl]C[B: And so did White

Denis: White is more interested by the 4 stones I think.];B[hj]
C[B: Maybe I could cut White's centre group off

Denis: ?];W[ij];B[ik];W[hk];B[jk];W[ki];B[ji];W[jh];B[il];W[hm]
;B[fm];W[fn];B[em];W[fl];B[dm];W[cm];B[ng]MA[jf][jg]C[Denis: ? Bad move. You must escape your weak groups in the center (but not the 2 marked stones, they are already dead).]
;W[mj]C[B: This seemed like an Ooops moment.

Denis: I can imagine that :-)];B[om];W[pl];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk]
C[B: This was good W foced me in the direction I wanted to go and straight through the gap]
;W[lk];B[nl];W[nm];B[mm]C[B: He either lets me connect through to the midle or I make a mess of his corner.]
;W[nn]C[B: The corner was more important

Denis: Correct];B[ll];W[kl];B[kk];W[km];B[lj];W[mk];B[mi];W[nj]
;B[ni];W[oj];B[pj]C[B: White didn't read the ladder];W[li];B[oi]
;W[qk];B[qj];W[jn]C[B: Couldn't quite connect with these four

Denis: Correct];B[im];W[in];B[lg];W[kg];B[mh];W[jj];B[lf];W[me]
;B[nd];W[rk];B[rj];W[qs];B[pq];W[rq];B[ps];W[bq]C[B: This was another Ooops moment

Denis: But you forgot to play B4 as you suggested earlier. And you had sente several times to do so.]
;B[bp];W[ap];B[cq];W[br];B[er]C[B: I thought this made C2 and G2 miai for a second eye to D4 E4.]
;W[cr];B[gr];W[dr];B[eq]LB[ep:A]C[Denis: Good reading. But you should have played A instead to have your 2 eyes.]
;W[fs];B[es];W[gs];B[hs]C[B: H2 would have killed the Black group

D: yes, but Black H1 is not making it living either.]
(;W[is]C[Denis: White H2 would also have killed black. See variation. You are fortunate that white didn't see it.]
;B[hr]C[B: Since W didn't I connected and made the second eye. That was a let off

Denis: ? didn't understant your comment.];W[js];B[nr];W[kr]
C[Denis: White should not start this KO now. This represents 0.5 points and there are bigger points elsewhere.]
;B[ls];W[np];B[nq];W[ns]C[B: I don't know why W played this

Denis: So why did you answer?];B[ms]C[B: I didn't need to play this. I could have taken sente.

Denis: Yes. this is not necessary.];W[os];B[rl];W[rm];B[sk]
;W[ql];B[rs];W[qo];B[mf];W[le];B[ke]C[B: this was premature. If I'd played o15 first and if W hadn't answered it. O14 looks big for W as well

Denis: I think white would have been crazy not to answer if you'd played o15 first.]

;W[qf]C[Denis: Another Abuse. Hey guys, which game are you playing? Is this still Go?]
