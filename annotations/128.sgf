(;W[ic]LB[hc:a][jc:b]TR[cj]C[A rather uncommon pincer. In this position white generally prefers to pincer at a or b, even so with the marked stone on the third line 'a' might be questionnable (see variations)]

;B[db];W[cc];B[pj]LB[hf:a][ie:b][kd:c]SQ[db][cc]C[This move is very big, but if white attacks black's weak group with a move like 'a', or 'b' he might be able to build a moyo on the upper side, while taking points on the left side.

You should exchange the two marked stones only, if it really allows you to settle your group, else omit it, leaving the possibility of invading the corner later at san-san.
Once you exchanged the two marked stones, perhaps you should exchange b for c, somewhat taking off the pressure from this group, before playing Q10.]

(;B[pf]LB[qc:a][kf:b]C[Usually with a two wing extension from a star point, the best invasion point is 'a'. (see variations)
Trying to build up the center seems natural, but as white can enter around 'b' threatening your upper side group, your strategy might fail, even more if tou create another floating group.]
