C[Hi,

After looked through your game, I made some comments as white point of view.
Overall both sides played very well, building big moyo.

The mistakes that white always made are:

1. Gote moves, lot of white's moves are too passive. (check it out in the game)
2. Direction of play, remember to play from weaker side and look for the weakness of the opponent.

To recover these mistakes, I recommend playing through the pro. games and studying Fuseki. I believe your games will get better.

Enjoy,

(;W[md]LB[ql:B][gc:A][kd:X][kc:X]TR[dd]C[W8 is a little slow. It could be played at 'X' make a good connection with the marked white stone or ignore it and play some where else such as A, B or C]
;B[fo]LB[po:A]TR[dp]C[Black 9 aims to build a big moyo.
The marked white stone is not really in danger. White should switch to play inside black future moyo. The better place for this job is playing in the center of the moyo. I would play at 'A'.]

(;W[kk]TR[gq][fo][fm]C[Wrong direction!

Enlarged from the strong position is not big as it looks. Before playing the move, you should look at the overall position, find a vital point to play, consider the opponent's weakness.
In this position, the marked black stones are weak. White should find a way to attack and gain something.]

I will stop the comment here.
Hope this would help you to improve.
