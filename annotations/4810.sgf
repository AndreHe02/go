C[$ hi, i m Sylvain (sylvainc on kgs). I'll do my best for this comment, if any questions remains, asked me on kgs. my comments will be precedeed by '$'


Dear Reviewer,

In this game on dragon go server I was black. White played many splitting attacks and I was often forced to find the best shape moves to correctly defend.

Although I won the game I am not sure I played the best shape moves to get the best position. 

Furthermore, white played many erasing plays and the game was very small scale. Black had 5 different living groups and this made it very interesting for me in the early endgame. 

Again I am not sure I played the early endgame that well.

Therefore, for this review I am hoping you can help me mostly with making good shape and the early endgame.

Of course any other tips are welcome, my opening for example can surely also improve.

Thank you,

[qd:B][cn:D][fp:C][fq:E]C[Trying the mini chinese, although I wonder if it works well with the black stone in the upper right?

Perhaps if at A (Q16) instead of B (R16) it is better than to play the mini chinese on the left?

$ this is my favorite fuseki, R16 is ok, no problem with that.
$ with C at high position the aim will be attack D stone, instead white can play low at E]

It actually turned out I won quite confortably. 

I would be curious to know from a stronger player if there were still other tesuji or big plays black could have made at this stage.]
