C[This SGF file was generated by GnuGO. I m aluin (black) and I m playing against the program GnuGO (white) which is said to be about 9 or 10 kyu.

I played almost every move on instinct, so that can explain some big mistakes.

This is my first review, any comments to assist in developing my reviewing skills would be appreciated to allfather@mts.net

Review only to move 80, after that there was not much until the obvious mistake at the end.  The game was over all well played.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp]C[This is a good classic opening.  I don't like to comment much on any opening, this is part of a style that I feel everyone should choose.

I prefer bq17, br4 for an opening myself.  

To get stronger, learning the techniques on defending /attacking a 4x4 opening will be very beneficial as you progress.  It is always good to try something new.]

LB[kp:D][lp:B][np:E][kq:C][lq:A]C[Playing A is a good way to try and squeeze whites stone at o3.  Some variations I like are B, C, D or E.

A- D will play out in the same or simiar way.

See Variation at E]
(;B[lq]C[Feeling strong enough on the right side];W[qq]LB[qp:A]
[pq:B]C[From 2 teachers of mine I do get 2 possibities with the pattern every time it shows up.

Please see variations.]
(;B[qp]C[i want to build a wall facing the right side to gain influence.]
;W[pq];B[np]TR[op][oq]C[This can be bad for either side.  When this appears the first thing one should do is try and cut.  Chances are it will cause some bad shape for your opponent.  Especially if black gets to play first.]

(;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[This variation is same as before.];W[ne];B[pf];W[ng]
LB[ic:B][le:A]C[In the fundaments of go, it teaches you to first make a base.  The fillowing is still true.  The extenstion at B, as opposed to play A right now will be more valuable.  W will have 2 groups to worry about and B has a better potential for making life.  

Variation B: This will force w into making life.]
(;B[le];W[jc]C[That is what i wanted to play but I had to push him with M15 (I thought)


It would have been a good idea to play there, as I said a few moves ago, it does create a base first.  what he has done now is take away your base and now you have to run and fight for a living shape.]
;B[lg];W[ni];B[ph]TR[lc][le][lg]C[to secure territory here

It is a good idea, but now you have to worry about the middle group.  They are getting weaker.]
;W[gc]LB[cn:B][fp:C][fq:A]C[B is usually a bad place to play, it is the closed side of the board and you are in your opponents area of influence.  

A and C are on the open side.  The most common variation at C.]

(;B[cn]C[I wanted to use this to pressure D4 and make him play in the bottom, to build territory on the left side.]

;B[om];W[jr];B[kr];W[rq];B[rp];W[je];B[kb];W[kh]C[he didnt respond to L18. was that a mistake ?

Nope, this is better if a strong enough wall is built towards the middle.  Lots of territory will be gained, and your group will be forced to live with very few points.]
;B[jb];W[gk]C[w means to capture lots of territory in the center.]

(;B[gn];W[km]C[large and may aim to cut your okeima later on]
;B[hb];W[il]C[now center is pretty much surrounded.  May stones were used.  Very ineffective and can be reduced very easliy]
