C[Hi, I am pto from Finland. I heard that you had to wait for the review quite some time. I hope my review will be worth the wait.]

C[Up to this point the game proceeds steadily. This white stone however is too slow. Marked black stones erase white moyo and white has to counter. I am not sure if black can tenuki here, I might take K4 next.

I have heard that marked black shape lives if black can play 1 or 2.]
;B[hb];W[gb]LB[hc:1]C[This exchange was not good for black.  It actually made his group weaker. The natural continuation would be 1 which gives nice shape. 

Playing tenuki here means that black admits that this was not correct direction and tries something else.]
;B[cf];W[cc]C[White is cautious and plays solid. Now this corner is like a small rock.]
;B[ef]C[The only move for black in this situation. Cgoban score estimation gives black +70 lead. White has to enter now.]
;W[jq]C[I was just about to play there.

Anyways, this start doesn't look too bad for me.  The board looks rather evenly distributed up right now.  At this point I decided to chase this white stone and in the process build a wall facing the left to create a huge moyo.

pto:
Sounds like winners plan to me. Black bottom right corner is solid so black can concentrate on building the left side.]
;B[hq];W[lq];B[mo]C[j5 was much better right?

pto:
This corner is still strong enough so the other direction would be better.  Now black is forcing white to ruin blacks territory.

Before playing J5 black should concider sequences J5-H4-J4-H3 and J5-H4-J3 and their followups.
H5 might be safer in some situations, and rich man should not pick quarrels, as proverb tell us.]
;W[io];B[ho];W[kn];B[ko]C[pto:
One of my own proverbs is: "stick to the plan stupido", stay focussed on what is important and what  the plans was.

Build the wall with H6. It is rock solid stone that builds  territory and adds presure on white.]
;W[jo];B[lp];W[kp]C[pto:
What happened? Suddently white has beautifull shape and black shape is crumbling. Go back and track how black gave this to white.

Rule of thumb: always try to make opponents shape a little bit weaker. You dont need to attack it, just add some defect on it. It is like putting money in bank.]
;B[mq]C[Black tries to fix his shape but it is already too late.]
;W[lo];B[hm]TR[io]C[Now white group is alive and black has only one stone left to use for his plan. This is a bit too thin because of marked white stone. Consider white sequence H6-G6-H4 for example.

I would say that blacks plan "to chase this white stone and in the process build a wall facing the left" has failled. Reason is that black attacked white group directly, white survived the attack, and there were no wall building in the process.]
;W[el]C[White dives deep, too deep if he had even single weak group on board. Might be too deep anyway: F9 is strong responce.]
;B[fj];W[gl];B[hl];W[gk];B[fk];W[fl];B[hj]C[There is not much point in playing thin stones like this. Rather fix some weakness. D9 for example fixes one and allows black to develop some fourth line territory. If white descents black is in a bit better position for playing this stone.]
;W[gj];B[hk];W[gi]C[Here black plays in wrong direction. This wall is pretty useless. Black could have used this presure to develop his left side.]
;B[cl]C[g14 a better move for me?

pto:
There is not much attacking left in this game, this build the territory which decides the game.]

What is the purpose of this stone? D6 now I think.];W[ec];B[fd]
;W[fc];B[de];W[eh];B[dh];W[ei];B[di];W[gd]C[pto: Again black ended up in bad shape.]

C[pto:
Good judgement from white.];B[pn];W[qm];B[qo];W[ro];B[ob];W[pb]
;B[ke]C[pto:
either make territory with D6 or fix shape with P17. Dont leave your stones like this.]
;W[mn]C[pto:
This negates everything from earlier black ladder breaker.]

;B[ac];W[dn]C[I was actually about to play this instead of a17, but I though he would respond to a17

pto:
At this point of game keeping sente is the most important thing. The second most important is taking the sente when you dont have it.]

[ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[I thought I was ahead.  The area on the right looks deceptively small.  Anyway, I think him getting to d6 first is what cost me the game.

pto:
D6 did not decide the game. Black lost because his group had worse shapes.

Go trough this game again and note every stone that white captures. Observe why it was captured and think how that could have been avoided. Ask if that stone was usefull at first place.

You might want to check "Shape Up!" by Charles Matthews in http://gobase.org/studying/articles/matthews/shape_up/, if you have not read it already. I haven't but I should.

Great game overall, good luck with your go. Never lose your spirit of fight.]
