C[Overall comments:  Your opening is excellent, but in the middle game you were not able to attack effectively.

You had several opportunites for good attacks that could take territory, but they didn't happen.  Letting white capture your 5 cutting stones let white take territory in the center instead of you, costing 10's of points.

Still, you were a little ahead going into the endgame, but white played a better endgame, and caught up.]

;B[qi];W[on];B[mp]C[Looks like a professional game so far.]
;W[nc]
(;B[nd]C[This is the first move I don't like.  It strengthens your corner, but it strengthens white's side more.  A good general rule is that when you attach to a stone, you make it stronger.  So, attach to stones that are already strong, but don't attach to stones that are weak.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[jc]
(;B[oj]C[This is a nice attacking move, but I would play somewhere else first.]
;W[hq]C[Since white ignored your last move, your focus should now be on attacking the group to the right.  But your move gives up a lot on the lower left.  The best way to attack the lower right is to respond to move 22 in a way that builds thickness.  Then your attack will be much stronger.  See comments on the next few moves.]

(;B[rm]C[JR: Bad timing? In retrospect a move on the botom seems called for.

When you make an attack, you have to think about where you will gain a benefit, either in territory or thickness.  Since this group is not surrounded, it will not die, so the purpose of this attack would be to chase it into the center and solidify the territory on the bottom, or expand the territory in the upper right.

But white's more already breaks up the territory in the lower side, so your potential benefit there is smaller.  If you could make an exchange, taking this group, but giving white a big lower left corner, it would be ok, but it is very difficult to kill this white group.]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[rl];B[qo]C[you gained a little in the lower right, but are losing a lot in the lower side.  You will need to get a lot of compensation from the attack.  This means that you need to build thickness now.]
;W[lq]
(;B[mq]C[This is not good.  It just takes a little territory and makes it easy for white to settle on the lower side.  You should make thickness here for your attack.]
;W[kp]
(;B[hp]C[I would want to continue to keep white separated, by extending downward.  Since the lwoer right 3-3 point is still available, the stone at f3 can take care of itself for now.]
;W[ip]
(;B[iq];W[io];B[hr];W[jq];B[gq];W[ln]C[Now it looks like your attack on the white stones to the right gained very little.

It is good that you use your sente for the left side, and it is good that white is not thick at the lower left.

You should be thinking about cutting at n6, and perhaps peeping at q8 first.]

(;B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[ce];B[ef];W[de];B[eg]
(;W[cg]C[This is a mistake.  White should take territory at the top.  You won't defend here, so this cut will be available later.]
;B[ch];W[bf];B[fd];W[ck];B[kd]C[Good.  Expand your center framework.]
;W[kc];B[ld];W[lc];B[me];W[ie]
(;B[jg]C[You should capture at n17.  sente and makes you thicker.

This shape looks a little strange.  You need to worry about the cut at F15, and this move doesn't increase your territory by very much.

Your stones on the left are quite weak, after white's move at c9, and there are two cuts to worry about.

This move should be one point to left, at J13, to help your left side stones, and eliminate the cut at f15.]
;W[fe]C[This cut is very big, and lets white catch up.];B[ee]
;W[ed]
(;B[ge]C[This move starts a ladder that doesn't work for you, so it only weakens your other stones.

You should think about a ladder breaker, threatening the gourp in the lower right.

Or find some other local move.];W[ff]
(;B[fc]
(;W[gg];B[hf];W[hg];B[if];W[gi];B[ej]C[This is good for black, since white's cutting stones have to run away, and both black groups will live.]
;W[gk];B[dl];W[cl];B[em]C[Black is ahead at this point.];W[dh]

(;B[fg]C[JR: :( Agent of my own demise

This is a huge mistake.  The upper side is bigger than the left, so you prefer to give up the left.

See the variation.  If white wants the left side, you get very thick, and have a very strong attack on the center white group.]
;W[gf]
(;B[he]C[JR: I felt this had to be bigger with some attack on the white group on top

However in retrospect I think the alternative works out OK - in that I think black might live on the top anyway.

All the black stones need to live, so you can attack white's center group.]
;W[di]
(;B[dr]TR[fg][dg][eg][ef][ee]C[I hate to give up group at e14.  If white's center group is weak, it will be easy to expand your right side territory while attacking it.  If white's center group is strong, he can easily reduce your right side territory.  Those 5 stones are much bigger than they look.]

;W[la]
(;B[gn]TR[dg][fg][eg][ef][ee]C[It's too bad you need a move around here.  It takes no territory, and just defends your conenction.  If the marked stones were alive, it would be a sente attack.  Now it is just dame.

I would try c3 first.  White will likely answer.];W[ri];B[rh]
;W[rj];B[qg];W[mi]TR[dg][eg][fg][ef][ee]C[Again if the marked stones were alive, white could not play so deep, since you could play to the left of 100, attacking, and swallow it up.  Letting white get strong in the center is a huge loss.]

(;B[nh]C[This is timid.  If you are ahead, this move is fine, but if you count, you find that white is a little bit ahead now.  You have several forcing moves against the connection below, so you can try to swallow this stone.]

;W[ml];B[nl];W[mm]C[Now it looks like white will make some territory in the center.]

yes. The game is very close.];W[il];B[im];W[jl];B[jr];W[kq]
