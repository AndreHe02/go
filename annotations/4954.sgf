C[Hello reviewer =).  I am Timotei, taking White against nyanya.  I would like to know exactly how I struggled so much in the later half of this game, and a covering of mostly the beginning and early middle-game would be very nice, though of course, if there was somehow a way to overturn the game later on, that would also be lovely!  Thanks a lot :D.]

Both players need to work on playing more careful, solid moves without leaving weaknesses.

(;C[White's stones at the bottom are useless, because they can't be used to attack Black. Rather than try to save them, it's better to connect at 1 and sacrifice them, getting solid territory on the right in return. If Black caps at 16, White can invade with the sequence up to 21. If black 21, then white 16.]
