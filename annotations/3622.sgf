C[Much of my problem (it seems to me) is that my go style is very different from the "regular" style.  Many of my moves seem to lack confidence and as a result, I get pushed around a bit in the early and mid games.  I lost by 2.5 points, but could have won if it wasn't for a few (stupid) sente/gote mistakes in the endgame (you don't need to comment much on these plays).  I am mostly looking for help with my opening and midgame, where I can't entirely identify my mistakes.

<T.J.> In general it was an interesting game and I saw plenty of good ideas that could use a bit polishing and you're good to go. The resulting board is rather dull-looking and is telling me neither of the players like complex fights much, which is pretty much the opposite to my own play style.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[cn];W[cl];B[cp]C[Ok, I have almost no knowledge of joseki.  I feel like I came off poorly in the following series of moves.]

(;W[cq]C[Perhaps this was my mistake - too hard?

<T.J.> Depends on my mood whether or not to play such moves. If you want to try and see which of the players can read further, be my guest and squeeze something nice out of it :).]
;B[dq]C[<T.J.> This can give some very interesting fight variations (which I can't foresee). I'll try something simple.]

(;W[eq];B[dr]
(;W[co];B[bp];W[do];B[bo];W[cm];B[bm];W[dn];B[bn]C[After seeing what was going down, I decided some thickness wouldn't be a bad compensation for black taking my corner.  I didn't play a reinforcing move next - Should I have done so?

<T.J.> It's hardly thickness with the cuts and both sides open. E2 is necessary - and sente (locally at least).]

(;W[ce]C[I see now that I should have played this at E2.  This seems to have been a big mistake.]
;B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq]C[Not sure how long I should go on like this, but I figure pushing on the second line can't be that good for black......

<T.J.> It's a difficult question for me too, but you probably stopped chasing at a good time.]
;B[gr];W[op]C[I understand approaching the 3-4 stone is a good thing to do.  I also hoped something good would happen in relation to my thickness to the left.

<T.J.> Seems to work ok.];B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[mp]C[One joseki I do know.  This seemed to reach over the direction I wanted so I thought it would work well.]
;B[hq];W[ir]C[Good or bad?  I assume bad.....

<T.J.> Initially it looks like a good idea, but the cut isn't much of a threat to black as of now, and for white to work optimally it's too low.]
;B[iq];W[jr];B[hr];W[jq];B[io];W[go];B[im];W[gm];B[jp];W[kq]
C[Should have gone at L4?

<T.J.> Would've been safe.];B[dd]C[<T.J.> This is a really poor attempt. You should never ever touch your opponent's stone like that unless you have a certain planned outcome for it.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[db];B[ed];W[dh];B[ef]
(;W[df]C[<T.J.> This move I don't like. Nowhere urgent to patch such small holes yet.

Let's see where this move could've gone...];B[eg];W[di]C[<T.J.> Here's again too slow. The same points as shown before.]
;B[dg];W[cg];B[de];W[cf];B[eb]C[I should probably have taken this point myself, but when?

<T.J.>  It's not that severe, but it would've been been better than those 2 previous commented moves. As I showed before, it's probably better to jump on the other side rather than push with this.]
;W[jd]C[An attempt to negate some of black's thickness to the left.

<T.J.> Likely close to my move.];B[da]
(;W[cb]C[<T.J.> Empty triangle. See my suggestion for variation.]
;B[ca];W[ba];B[ea];W[bc];B[ge]TR[ic]C[<T.J.> This is completely unreasonable. It's just too ineffective against K16.]

(;W[md]C[<T.J.> I believe this was one of the big mistakes as it shows no interest towards the corner (and will not gain much)]
;B[nc]C[<T.J.> Correct punishment - and exactly where you should've played.]
;W[mc];B[nd];W[hc]C[<T.J.> Shows sense for a good shape. Good move.]
;B[mb];W[lb];B[nb];W[kb];B[of]C[<T.J.> Too small.];W[pj];B[qm]
;W[pg];B[og]
(;W[qk]C[<T.J.> First-glance wisdom says I would've played this one towards the open top instead. If you prove my intuition wrong, please send back the file with the punishment sequence ;).]
;B[pf];W[qg];B[qf];W[rg];B[rf];W[rl]C[I feel like this was bad.  Didn't do much but strengthen black......

<T.J.> Maybe so, but there's not much to be done for the corner anyway.]
;B[rm];W[pm]C[<T.J.> This doesn't work. It's already cut into every direction.]
;B[pn];W[om];B[ql];W[pl];B[rk];W[rj];B[sl];W[oh];B[sg];W[rh]
;B[nh];W[ni]C[Wasn't sure about this, but black backed off.  Good or bad?

<T.J.> A decent double hane. Seems reasonable to back off.]
;B[mh];W[bl]C[Wanted to seal this up.  I feel like this was big for me to keep the area on the left side.

<T.J.> A good one, with good timing.];B[mi];W[nj];B[me];W[le]
;B[lf];W[ke];B[kf];W[jf];B[hg];W[gi]C[<T.J.> This move I like, it instantly builds your own territory and nullifies the direction black has been playing to with the past 10 moves.]
;B[jg];W[if];B[ig];W[he];B[gd];W[hd];B[gc];W[nr]C[Figured this was sente, versus P2 which is not.  I have made a number of sente/gote mistakes earlier and tried to pull myself together around this time.

<T.J.> You made the right choice. A point or two more isn't worth gote.]
;B[on];W[nn]C[Too bold?

<T.J.> Well, the N8 is pretty much no man's land, so this move doesn't do much, bold or not.]
;B[pp];W[nm]C[Here is one of my sente mistakes, I feel.  Should have played at P5, then here.]
;B[oo];W[no];B[np];W[jn]C[<T.J.> Black is too cautious with the response to this.. Even after white cut at J6 the center won't be any more white's or black's as it is now.]
;B[in];W[km]LB[ij:B][hk:A]C[Deliberated for a while on this move.  After the peep, I wasn't sure how to best make use of my next move.  Considered L4 and L5 and K7.

<T.J.> It works, however I might have taken the time to go towards the center from the left.

A builds your territory and seems like a move black should respond to. B is more straightforward, but risks a bit of your own land (after black A)]
;B[mj];W[mk];B[lk];W[ml];B[hb];W[ib];B[ga];W[kp];B[jo];W[ko]
;B[jm];W[kn]C[Maybe I should have let black capture and played at L8 (or elsewhere) instead?

<T.J.> Yeah, a move like H9 is more important for now.];B[ll]
;W[lm];B[kl];W[jk]C[Hoped I could get him to do a defensive move.  Figured I could connect/make use of this stone no matter what.

<T.J.> The idea is nice but unfortunately black's response was really good. Not really necessary to even mention it, but a move at around H9 would've changed the winner of the game.]
;B[hj];W[gj];B[hk];W[hl];B[gk];W[fk];B[gl];W[fl];B[hm];W[hi]
;B[ii]C[I spent tons of time pondering this black formation in the center.  It looks like something should be capturable, but I could never figure out how.  Didn't want to start anything if I was just going to lose stones.

<T.J.> I spent a good while aswell, but couldn't come up with anything even remotely useful.]
;W[fh];B[fg];W[gn];B[hh];W[gh];B[hf];W[qs]C[super monkey jump.  I love this move (perhaps too much)]
;B[qr];W[ps]
(;B[or];W[os];B[op]C[Did black need to do this?  I don't see why.....  But I will take advantage of it.

<T.J.> Certainly not. A mere ko.];W[rr]C[Should have been at S1?  I read this out wrong and lost a few point because of it.

<T.J.> S2 is good, T3 was the mistake... (although comparing the alternative result, it doesn't seem to make any difference in points)]

<T.J.> Doesn't hurt to try if the situation seems interesting, does it.. Useless though..]
;W[je];B[lc];W[ld];B[ic];W[id];B[jc];W[kc];B[ho]
(;W[em]C[<T.J.> Well seen from this far away. I first thought this is probably unnecessary, but it actually turns out you will need it, after the dame at H6 is filled. For that this is a bit weird though. Might try a simplier solution, such as F5 in the future.]
;B[nf]C[Did black need to do this?  I didn't see anything here that I could do (there was plenty of potential but I couldn't work out anything useful)

<T.J.> Certainly not necessary as far as I can see.];W[tt];B[tt]
