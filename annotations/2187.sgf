C[Hello reviewer,

I just picked up the game after a long hiatus.
I didn't think I was so far behind when it came to the end.
Any comments will be greatly appreciated.

Found 0 observer.];W[qp];B[cd];W[pc];B[cj]LB[ec:A]C[Normally, c10 would be a good idea, but I think it's too early in the game for b to move here. Rather, when you put a stone at c16, it might be best to follow it up with e17. Claim the corner.]

C[Don't ignore moves like this. He's attacking your corner.  Again, 'A' instead of  K16.]
;W[de];B[dd];W[ee];B[qm]LB[op:A][oq:B]C[This is a bit too wide of a princer to be of any real threat to W. A and B are both good moves.]
;W[qj];B[pp]LB[op:A][oq:B]C[Don't butt heads here. Don't start a needless fight if you can help it. And still, A and B are better moves.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[oq]C[Do you see why this is bad for you? You not only allowed him the corner, but you allowed him to start making a wall and a large part of the bottom. His wall is useful and alive, I'm not so sure about your own.]
;B[jq]LB[iq:A]C[This move might be better at A. Mainly, because it would make his invasion into your side a bit more tighter and harder to deal with.]
;W[gq];B[fq]C[This is joseki, kinda. But I'm not sure if it was the wisest choice. This allows W to make a wall and make himself stronger. k3 is kinda out there and W has a strong corner. So, it isn't to your advantage to help him gain the rest of the side.]
