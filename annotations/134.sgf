C[9x9 games are a fine way to start playing Go.  They are quick
and you can get a lot more games played that way.  This small
of a board removes a lot of the strategy in Go, however.  Move
up to 13x13 and 19x19 as soon as you can.  It is best to play
a variety of sizes right from the start, not focus on 9x9.

Also, I don't know who played black.  It is helpful to play as
many different opponents as you can.  Each person will have a
different style and you will learn more by being exposed to many
players.  Computers are OK as opponents, but they are not a great
substitute for playing a human.

a corner, like at one of the squares.];W[dc];B[fg]
(;W[fc]TR[dg][cf]SQ[gd]C[This is too close to white's other stone.  In the beginning it
is best to spread stones out to "sketch in" areas of potential
territory.  Later, each side will fill in the "sketch" with real
lines of stones.   Playing at the square still starts to take
the upper right corner, but it also undermines black's center
stone.  Playing at one of the triangles starts to take the lower
left corner.

it is still connected to the upper right corner, but pushes into
black's area better.   A more difficult move would be to invade
black's lower left corner.  See the variation for an example

white can expect to get the 24 spaces marked with squares while
black can expect to get the 35 spaces marked with triangles.
This sort of estimated score is important to do in your mind
regularly throughout the game.  Now white would need to do something
drastic to win.  A desperate invasion might work]

at the triangle does lose Sente for white, so save that for after
playing at 18.  In the end game, play all of your Sente moves
first, then play a Gote move];B[df];W[dd];B[cf]C[I don't think that black needs to connect here, so black should
play somewhere else instead.];W[dg]C[This is a bit late to make an invasion.  It probably won't hurt
to try, but it would be more likely to work if started before
black has such solid line of stones.];B[eg];W[cg];B[bg];W[bh]

plays elsewhere rather than waste another move on them.  I agree

move and keep trying to make your stones live.  If you agree
that they are dead, it is OK to give up on them at this time.
Just be sure you played here because you know they are dead,
not as a reflex response to black.];B[ae];SQ[bc][id]C[White passes

White should play at one of the squares if he wants to finish
out the end game.];B[ic];W[ib];B[id];W[hb];W[eh]C[It is unusual to go back to these stones after abandoning them
a few moves ago.  If you thought that they still had potential
you should have continued with them then.  If you know they are
dead then you can't accomplish anything with this move.];B[fh]
;W[di];B[dh]SQ[bc]C[Someone should play at the square to be really finsihed with
the end game.  Since black is a head by a large margin, it isn't
really critical to do this however.

This game go off to a poor start for white in the opening.  After
that it was almost impossible for white to catch up.  It is important
to make frequent estimates of how much potential territory players
have.  Once you are obviously behind it is often too late to
react.])
