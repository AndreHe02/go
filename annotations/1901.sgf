AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Reviewed 15sep2004 by Allan Wickberg, allan@igs, to the best of my ability (which is somewhere between 15-20k).

Comments are marked "al>"];W[ec]LB[dc:A][mc:C][ed:B][jd:D]C[I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do in the beginning of a handicap game: should I defend (as I did, A/B), or ignore and concentrate on another corner (C/D) and claim some territory?
what's the recommended tactics for a beginner?


al> Generally, I think the best results are achieved by using the handicap stones for building territory, rather than fighting. White usually sprinkles stones all over the board, trying to split black's  groups. Because of black's head start, white has to capture to win.

al> Now, since beginners usually are quite inconsistent in their playing (I think you need to get up to maybe 10k at least to have the routine to play with equal strength from game to game), handicap may yield a little more unpredictable results than with stronger players.]

(;B[dc]C[I tried to keep him out of that corner. would it have been better to keep him in that corner?

al> D17 is ok locally  for defending the corner, but black should use his stones to create influence that can be used to create territory. Black might do well by ignoring white's stone and play something like k17, r10, k3, or c10 instead, evetually connecting along those lines, framing good pieces of territory. It doesn't matter so much if white manges to take some of the corners. In that case black will still have time to grab lots of points along the sides and in the middle.]
;W[qc]C[al> Don't be stressed by white attacking the corners. There is still plenty of time to make territory. Play lightly, not grouping your stones too close together. Think of it as building fences, with the poles quite far apart at first, sketching frames around certain areas, then gradually tighten the fences by putting more poles (stones) in between the initial ones. Thanks to the handicap stones, white shouldn't have a chance to prevent black building huge territories (should the players be of equal strength).]
;B[qd]TR[qm][qj]C[al> Imagine the two stones that black has played so far being at, for instance, r10 and r7 instead. Compare the potential territory framed by those stones with what white has achieved with his two stones. By playing r16, black loses tempo and concentrates his stones too much, getting "heavy".]
;W[jd]LB[nc:C][pc:A][md:B]C[squeeze him into the corner or attack K16?

al> White is the one that benefits from fighting at this stage. Black has more important things to do - building territory.]

(;B[pc];W[rd];B[re];W[pb];B[rc]C[I guess giving him a double atari here is not a bad idea?]
;W[nd]LB[qb:A][nc:B][oc:C]C[was it too small-minded to take R17? Does white have a chance to come to live in the upper right corner? Variant B looks much better to me now...

al> black wins the corner, but...]
(;B[qb]TR[gq][jq][mq][cm][cj][cg]C[al> ...again, imagine if the six stones that black has played this far were spread along the sides instead. The investment would pay off better that way - maybe 40-50 points, instead of the 10 points in the corner that black has now.]
;W[ob];B[oc];W[nc];B[oe];W[de];B[ce];W[ed];B[eb];W[fb];B[df]
;W[ee]C[al> Playing contact moves this way creates a lot of weak spots. Remember that stones connect along the lines, not diagonally.

al> But more important, by fighting like this, black enforces white's position. Even if black would get both corners, about 20 points, white would have won the territory along the top, which amounts to at least as much, probably more. So black is really doing white a favour by fighting like this.]
;B[ea];W[fa]LB[da:C][db:B][ef:A]C[A is definitely the wrong move!]

(;B[ef];W[db]C[ok, lesson learned...];B[cb];W[da];B[ca];W[cd]
;B[cc];W[bd]LB[bc:B][be:A]TR[ca][cb][cc][dc][dd]C[I shouldn't have played A as it's pretty clear what happens to the marked group]

(;B[be]C[al> I will not comment too much on the fightning - the only way to learn to avoid these standard mistakes is to make them (often enough to start remembering why they happen :) The golden rule is to stay connected.]
;W[bc];B[bb]C[please let me sacrifice one more stone!! ;-)]
;W[ab]LB[ge:D][me:C][oh:B][jj:E][cm:A]C[I think A was a little bit too well-behaved.
Maybe I should have extended from the right upper corner to B? Or confine/attack White with C/D?
what if I had taken the center? Maybe too big a move for a weak player...

al> C and D would make white defend and secure his territory along the top, while black leaves most of the board open for further attacks. Of the moves suggested, A is probably the best, outlining some territory for black, who has lost a bunch of stones and still only has 10 points to show for it.]

(;B[cm];W[jj]LB[dh:A][di:B][ei:C]TR[df][ef][ch]C[I guess B or even C would have been better than A. they're still close enough to the marked group and radiate towards C7. what do you think?

al> I think c12 would give better shape, and prevent a cut a c14. If black plays A,B, or C, white could undercut at around c12 or c10 and cause all sorts of trouble.]

(;B[dh];W[dj]LB[ci:A][cj:B]TR[hg]C[Was A too cowardly?

al> Not as such, since the black group is a little too open due to the possible cut at c14. Had d12 been at c12 instead, black could have had the choice of either attacking whites stone, or playing elsewhere.

al> However, since white has the opportunity to ubild a huge moyo extending from the top into the board, it is more important to split white. H13 appeals to me, although it is probably still more important for black to outline more territory as explained earlier.]

(;B[ci];W[cj];B[ck];W[bk];B[bl];W[cl]C[why did white do that?

al> test move :)];B[dl];W[dk];B[cl];W[el];B[bj]C[al> This is going in the wrong direction, chasing small points. Apart from all the open areas, e7 could be big. Preventing white from playing f14 would also be big, in terms of destroying white's potential territory.]

;W[bo];B[cn];W[eh];B[dg];W[ff]C[al> big point for white!];B[bp]
;W[cq]LB[ao:A][bq:B]C[A is unnecessary...]
(;B[ao];W[eq]LB[cr:B][dr:A]TR[dp][dq]C[B would have prevented the worst, I guess. I think the marked group is already lost.]

(;B[dr];W[cr];B[er];W[fr]LB[fq:B][ds:C][fs:A]TR[dp][dq][dr]
[er][ei][ek][fm]C[I think that group definitely lost.
Or do you see a way out?
A/B/C don't lead me anywhere...

al> It is easy to focus too hard on the group that is currently under attack. White has several weak spots that could be used by black for breaking out, into the middle of the board, reducing white's chances of building terrotory there. I feel that it is starting to get equally urgent to prevent white from gaining territory as it is to build territory for black. The right side, bottom and lower right corner is still wide open.]

(;B[fs];W[ds];B[es]C[you definitely learn the most if it really hurts ;-)

al> indeed :)];W[gs]LB[me:C][oh:D][fl:B][bq:A][kq:E][mq:F]C[maybe it would have been better, to work towards the center with B, C or D or claiming some territory with E/F than extending the lower left corner??

al> I have difficulty in judging what is more important at this point. However, C invites a split - it should, if anything be played at n14 instead. D is neither securing territory nor really a threat to white. I think D should rather be at r12 instead to make some points. As I pointed out earlier, white's middle left stones has some weak spots that can be exploited.]

(;B[bq];W[fm];B[di];W[ei]C[ok, he's nailed me in...

al> not quite - black has a double atari at e9.];B[kq]C[al> You should extend very cautiosly towards thickness. This might be stretching it a little bit too far. Maybe n3 is better before l3. If white plays o3 now, black is in a good squeeze.]
;W[jq]C[al> white would be better off playing o3 instead, thereby attacking both the black stone at l3 and the corner at the same time. It would be very hard for the black stone to live so close to the white wall.]
;B[jr];W[ir];B[js];W[ip];B[jp];W[iq]LB[ko:B][kp:D][lp:C][kr:E]
[is:A]C[What do you think about B and C?
Any other Idea?

al> B, I would say. But it has to be followed up with o3 to avoid a split. If white gets in between the corner and the black group things might turn rather troublesome for black.]

(;B[is];W[kr]LB[kp:B][lr:A]
(;B[lr];W[kp];B[lq];W[jo];B[lp];W[op]C[what do you think about the fight moves 99-111? did white really profit? how would you have defended?

al> I would probably have answered with r6 here, trrying to squeeze white and hopefully being able to build territory on the right side in the process.]

;B[mq];W[np];B[oo];W[mo]LB[on:B][pn:A]
(;B[pn]C[al> black got the corner and a bit on the side, white sealed off the center somewhat. o7 is an interesting point for both players now. Black has to get a tentacle into the center now, to try and reduce white's territory. The double atari at e9 still exist.]
;W[on];B[om];W[nn];B[pm];W[qo];B[po];W[qn];B[qm];W[pl];B[ql]
C[al> This is going in the wrong direction. White is leading, therefore black's priority should be to destroy territory for white. (white's prio should be to enlarge his territory). Black's lower group is safe, so it would be better to push from the top right group, threatening to run out in the center at the same time as mayeb getting some territory along the right side.]
