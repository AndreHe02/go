C[This game is part of my effort to get back into go. At one time, I was right around AGA 20k, though now I think I'm not that much stronger than the person I played today. :(

Anyway, thanks in advance for the review.

(;W[jp]C[How would one typically take advantage of this type of play? This is no enclosure to speak of, but I didn't feel like taking the time to think it out, so instead...

---

* There is nothing to take advantage of, it is a good move which aims to neutralize your shimari and prevent you from playing around here (which would be a very good extension for you). See variation.]

(;B[cf];W[ce];B[df]C[Should I just review joseki for ideas to respond?

* White 8 was a poor choice. Black 9 a good response.];W[bf]

(;B[bg]C[
* The problem with this is you end up kinda and don't get to extend in the middle to secure your moyo, but this hardly mattered in this game because of all the fighting that started around here.]
;W[bd];B[ch];W[ag];B[ah];W[af];B[ad]C[
* If this is a search for ko, then there are bigger plays and you should save it for later (when you actually have ko threats). If this is trick play then: save trick play for handicap games. Choosing to start an even game is like saying that "yes, I believe my opponent's strength is roughly equal to my own", but if you were really playing someone you thought was your match you would also expect him to see this and so you wouldn't attempt it.]

---

* There is nothing to regret. White has lost already. He is obviously weaker than you and cannot judge the importance or order of moves.]

C[My opponent resigned here.

I won this game more on White's failure to seize advantage of weakness, rather than my own skill. Any other suggestions as to what I could do to improve my game?

Areas I could use some help: Opening and endgame. I think just continuing to play will asssist in the midgame fighting.

Thanks again (in advance) for the review.

* Your opponent had no chance - even from the beginning this was apparent. Overall you consistently played bigger moves while your opponent worried about trifles. He constantly tried futile things like cutting the bamboo joint, protecting when he should have given up, falling for easy tricks, following you around etc. Did you not see this yourself? Even if he had killed your M1 group, even if he had taken over your upper-left corner, even if he had made his H6 dragon live - all of this, and it would not have been enough to win!

The game itself was just a very drawn-out slaughter, the (false) humility hidden in your own take on the victory could actually be interpreted as an insult to your opponent. Please do not be insecure when it comes to win or loss, or you will only end up being afraid of losing games entirely, and then you will end up being one of KGS' many underrated double-digit kyu players who intentionally try to stay a few stones weaker than they really are so that they may win more of the games they play. This is why a KGS 18 kyu will often be stronger than 18 kyu on other servers. And this sick indulgence will only make their ego frailer and their fear of losing greater as time go by: they can get no joy out of the game of go. I am not saying you are like this, but I implore you to not play ego-stroking games like this: you take away from your opponent's ego so much more than what you are able to add to your own.

Anyway, this is not the kind of game where you can learn from your weaknesses. You should send in a game where you actually lose, and I would be happy to review, or play this guy again with at least 4 stones and see if it is more balanced.]
