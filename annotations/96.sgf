C[buckyyowza: hello reviewer! my name is  Mark Fyffe (buckyyowza 7k* on IGS), and I  played white in this game.  it is obvious to  me that my opponent and I played two  distinctly different games of go... I am  hoping that you can help to understand the  game he played a little better.  thanks for  your time, and I hope you enjoy looking  over this game as much as I enjoyed  playing it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

O.k. here it goes....
The review will be made using Hibiscus  Go. I will comment for both sides so pls.  send the review to your opponent too.  Hope you enjoy it!

Black triangle group in the lower-left is in a  poor shape so this is not so bad. As for  your question - black played 5-3 exactly for  that reason. Giving your opponent  thickness is o.k. as long as you get enough  territory for compensation. If you can get  your opponent over-concentrated or having  his thickness facing the wrong way then  it's preferable to force him make  thickness...]

This is completely irresponsible to your  stones :)

1. Black has various sente moves against  the corner so (30) will not get any help from  there.
2. There's no space for white to extend on  the side.
3. (30) is too close to black thickness.
4. White still has a weak group on the left  side that needs taking care of.
5. Black group that (30) is trying to attack is  much stronger and can connect to his  lower-left group at any time.

All that considered - this should be a  loosing move.

This should be at (a)]

1. White should push toward his stronger  group which is the bottom-right one.
2. Do not make 3rd line shoulder hits unless it is vital to your eye-shape.

From the tewari viewpoint (Btw. tewari  means you rearrange the order of moves to  analyze the situation) white played (52)  which should be on the 4th line and black  played a shoulder hit against it (which is a  good move!) and white ignored it. That  sequence would be illogical jet that is what  happened here.

With white group weak as it is (and this is  his 3rd weak group!) making a mojo with 62  is unrealistic. Any black movement around  (a) will be a threat to white groups so white  will not be able to defend his mojo. (62) is  too far away to offer any assistance to  white groups on the left.]

Well black is about 60 pts ahead at this  point so resignation is in order.

Main points of interest.
Black played overly cautious in this game -  securing groups that he didn't need and  had handled white 30 very bad.  Afterwards he repeatedly missed the  chance  to harass white weak groups.
White on the other hand left weak groups  behind and eventually one died. Study L&D  problems as you had many chances along  the way. I tried to put in as many strategic  concepts as I could but both of you need to  work on your reading too (how fast was the  game?).
After the fight started by black 147 you both  had chances so I hope the variations help.

Hope this helps!

As always questions, comments and  hello's welcomed...
