C[Hi, I will try to do my best commenting this game but my first counsel is to keep on playing. That is the best way to improve at the beginning.]
;B[dd];W[pc];B[cp];W[pp];B[nq];W[lq]C[Everything is pretty standard until now.]

(;B[no]C[This is the first move a little unusual. It is played differentely often. Look at the variations.]

(;W[oq]C[white p3 it is not good.

As black has jumped into the center, white must do so at q6 getting territory WHILE attacking black. This is very important

never saw such joseki ...];B[op]C[attempted p4];W[or];B[nr]
;W[po]C[white is getting a good sized corner while black is still under attack but it is black turn.]
;B[kp]C[the black idea is good but i dont like this move. I would have played at j3 not letting white to stabilize his stone along the side.

pincer applied hoping to get m3];W[mp];B[np];W[mo];B[nn]C[so white counterattacks ...]

(;W[ip]C[Again the idea is good but the move not. The question is that you both are getting more groups under attack at every move. The best way to attack is from a secure position and now only white corner is more or less safe. Look at the variation.]
;B[lp]C[quite strong move for attacking.];W[mq];B[kn]C[the extension i
learnt];W[jq]C[This is good because connect both groups and the more connected you are, you are stronger. Usually]
;B[gq]C[this is a good move for attacking while making territory at the same time. The only problem is that black has two weak groups and that should take priority over anything else.]

(;W[jo]C[So white has to attack, but this move is not good because it leaves many weakness behind. Look at the variation.

The rule is: first split, then surround then kill.];B[ln]C[Black defends.

becomes bamboo joint when in danger, i like this]
(;W[eo]C[and white goes to another place ... Missing an opportunity. Look at variation.]
;B[ep]C[defending with touch];W[fp];B[eq];W[do];B[co]C[resonable result
for me in the start till here];W[cf]C[Again white goes to another big point but his bottom group is not safe yet, this is not good. Look at variation.]

(;B[pe]C[decided to bring all corners into fights];W[qg]C[This pincer is a joseki.]
;B[qc]C[This is one of the standard continuations

attempted joseki never
see this play before];W[pd]C[this is not one of the most usual moves, but it is not bad.]
;B[qd]
(;W[lc]C[this move follows the rule, from two stones extend three spaces, but i think that cutting at r15 is far better. Look at the variation.]
;B[pb]C[good move.];W[nd];B[oe];W[fc]C[The same problem again. While in a fight playing elsewhere. Pros do it many times, but they are pros so have counted which move is bigger. My humble counsel is that while in a fight play it until you win or give it up. Most games between kyus are decided by a killed group so dont take chances ยก

surprised me as not with the response of p16];B[ee];W[db]C[Black is now in a difficult position but he has room to run into the center.]
;B[ec];W[cd]
(;B[gd]C[I dont like this move,  it is weak and dont attack white.

try to take g17 but found out this is bad move];W[fd]C[white show black his mistake :)]
;B[dc]C[this shape, e17, d17 and d16 it is called "empty triangle". It is usually very bad. Look at the corner who has the better position. White isnt it?, but count the stones, either one has played the same number, 5. The empty triangle is very innefficient.]

(;W[de]C[I would have played differently. Look at the variation.]
;B[df];W[ce];B[cc]C[plays in deep for an exchange...];W[ed]
;B[eb];W[ef];B[fe];W[gc]
(;B[hc]C[this is very aggresive. but leave too many cutting points behind. Look at variation for another possibility.

another bad move here should haf h14 or h15or d13];W[ge]C[double atari....]
;B[ff];W[hd];B[bd];W[dg];B[eg];W[fg];B[df]C[idiot move here should make
the grp escape via g14];W[gf]C[Very good done by white ยก Brilliant tactic :)

whole grp dead...];B[id]C[tries to play to UR];W[ic];B[jc];W[ib]
;B[jd];W[eh]C[this move is not needed. There is no better place in the whole board for playing?

this move i think a bit slow...];B[jb]C[i managed to put the UR under
threat in return for the lost points in UL];W[hb];B[ld]C[the attack begins...]
;W[md];B[le];W[ne];B[nf];W[mf];B[od]C[knowing n15 is crucial i test his
response first by atari the grp];W[oc]
(;B[ob]C[this is a mistake, playing directly at o17 kills white stones.

atari again... force move];W[nc];B[me];W[nb];B[mb]C[ready to connect
or kill or even sacrifice... a good move i think];W[oa];B[qb]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[kb];B[ja]C[018 steals an eye from the UR gives me a lead
here];W[of];B[ng];W[pf];B[qe];W[lg];B[mc]C[white was trying to live where it was not possible.]
;W[pj]C[This is a very important point. It defends the white stones, enlarge the side territory and support the attack on the black bottom stones, the first fight. Do you remember it?

my worry is in the left right and center portion now, i saw r3 as an
important move here , the key to the right fighting];B[dn]C[so play down
left first];W[fm];B[fn]C[test move to see he wanted the grp or center...]
;W[en];B[gn]C[if he connects f5 i will cap the grp at e7...]
;W[gp];B[kq]C[threaten him back in response of g4];W[kr];B[hq]
C[m2 become another main point of the game here...];W[iq];B[dm]
;W[om];B[nm];W[mn];B[mm];W[lm];B[nk];W[nj];B[qq]C[i think this invasion is unreasonable again. Black group is not settled yet and it is not clear that the invasion could live neither.

started the fight in the right side];W[pq];B[qp];W[ro]C[interesting response....
at first tot of going s4 but afraid of early white r2];B[qo]
;W[qn];B[qr]C[lets see if black can live in the corner. Look at the variation.]

(;W[rp];B[pn]C[this cut is ok i think the ladder is useful for me]
;W[on];B[pm];W[qm];B[pl];W[ol];B[ql];W[oo]
(;B[oj]C[to disconnect the grp from above...];W[ok];B[oi];W[pi]
;B[pk];W[oh]C[this is the mistake that lose the game. And it is very easy to see now. Just play S8 instead of  p12 and black is dead. And the whole right side is white and black has two weak groups.]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[nl];W[nh];B[mi];W[li]C[dead end, his grp going to live,
but i must think of a way to save bottom right  2 large black grps]
;B[rm]C[Now white is beyond hope.

afraid of s8 white and into ladder
tat kills my whole grp];W[ck];B[rn]C[clearly might be a diversion move
c9... .so took 2 at s6 first];W[ll];B[os];W[mh];B[pr]C[both grp saved.]
;W[el]C[didn't see p10 the big loop hole !];B[dl];W[dk];B[cl]
;W[fq];B[fr];W[hr];B[jr]C[tot the next response is at j2 and i follow up
wif m2 to get the grp...];W[ks]C[at this point i could haf played m2 to
kill the grp.... didn't see again];B[js]C[bad bad move here]
;W[lr];B[em]C[decided to cut and fight];W[oj]C[just found out abt the atari

;W[hn];B[hm];W[gm];B[dp];W[rk]C[interesting pincer...];B[qj]

C[trying to connect wif the top and reduce white territory]
;W[jg]C[Another mistake, you must defend first for attacking later.]
;B[lk]C[this becomes vital for black to form two eyes here...]

(;W[kk]C[Lets see the other hane. Look at the variation.];B[mk]
;W[kj];B[kl]C[Now black is alive and white only hope to get back into the game is lost.

;W[dh];B[ad]C[Summary:

I think that both players have focused mainly on attacking at whatever the cost, forgeting that defending is, many times, the proper way to attack.

White has showed a little better understanding of fighting tactics, "tesuji" but while has played at big points several times he has did so in the middle of the fight which is no good.

Black is stronger at fighting and "life&dead" situations and because that he has won this game. I guess that he has played more games that white.

It is quite difficult for me to try to guess the players rating. I think that the best way is to play , and if possible play a lot, on any server or in a real go club if possible.

I am also a weak player so dont think my opinions are always true or the only way of playing.
