AB[dd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,
please have a look at my overall game. I have not been playing many handicap games, so if you could give me some advice for better handling it, I would appreciate it.
Thanks];W[fq];B[ip];W[dq]C[At high handicap games it is often better to put a stone in each corner before making a second play.  You need to play on a larger scale and more toward the center as a strategic matter.

Options here would be around n4, O17 or f17.

Another option is to double pincer which lead to hard choices for b - and the more you make black choose what to do, the more mistakes B will make- B is weaker than you, so you don't want B to be able to piggyback off your moves by playing too many forcing moves - especially not early on.]
;B[dn]C[since you have already played so much here, another move like c5 makes some sense - complex and sneaky.  It is not a good move, however, in an even game.]
;W[nc]C[Good.];B[qf]C[Since B did not pincer, approach at f17, and then look to invading corners, building a large side, etc. - though much later.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[jc]C[Much too slow for 7 stones.

This style of play is playable - if you are really good at invading and rescuing weak groups.]
;B[gc];W[cf]C[The bottom right is more open - and you have the target stone of j4 - so I would look to play in the lower right - at n4, actually - high and closer to the j4 target - yet close enough to mess with b's corner and right side.]
;B[ch]C[the only response here is a one-point jump to the center.  (go proverb - "one point jump is never wrong").  If you dive or slide into the courner, you lose too much in the center and settle things too much.]
;W[cc];B[dc]C[B did you a favor.  B should block the other way, take the left side, cap the k17 stone and game over.]
;W[cd];B[id];W[cp]C[Hmmm.  Tough call.  The steel post or stand at k16 makes w strong and the extension exactly right - and keeps the b group a little unsettled.  now b can push w into a low position on the top with k16 - and look to be huge in the center.

gotta think center];B[ep];W[eq]C[19 is too small in this game - what is your strategy?  You can't play a territorial game - you must play a power game.]
;B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[ap]C[23 is really senseless here.  -not many points and makes b really strong on the side.  There are many moves worth many more points.  Look at the lower right again.  Or womething like L15 or even f10 - which you may lose, but it would complicate b's play immensely.]
;B[ao];W[fp]C[A strong player once said in high handicap games that he makes the game so complex that he doesn't know what is going on - then for sure the weaker player doesn't.  This means that the weaker player will play less fundamentally sound play in general which must over time work out for the benefit of white.

25 is just too small.  In high-handicap go, once a group is settled - leave it.]
;B[el];W[qn]C[wrong direction - you want to attack j4 - now it will be hard.]
;B[nq];W[qp];B[qq];W[rp]C[not  joseki - 31 at S3 is proper here.

But the problem was 29 - too easy for b to defend without thinking.  Not enough ways to go wrong.

Also, this is not going to be sente for w - and w must keep sente]
;B[rq];W[po];B[op]C[b is playing very defensively so with w's for settled groups, and simple play, w should win - but w must start pushing b around more - not forcing b to take points and make rock-solid groups.]
;W[ne]C[this will induce b to strengthen the side - you need to reduce it.

a play around r12 is better - splitting b --playing off the top and right hand right groups.]
;B[og];W[ic]C[this must be at k16.];B[hd];W[jd];B[ql]C[39 was very small after 37.  Now look at w at r10 compared to b at r8.]
;W[om]C[too proper, - attach at q8, then b withdraws, then w gets 09 if w wants it.]
;B[nk];W[jf];B[gg];W[de];B[fd]C[B is now settled everywhere.  

W is settled in 3 of 4 places.

W has about 35 points in the bank; b about 65.  W should still win - if the handicap is correct.

So you need to look around for where to attack and where to keep b from getting points while you leave in sente.]
;W[ir]C[OK.  But better is L3 - attack that b stone - don't just reduce prospects.]
;B[kr];W[jq];B[kq];W[jp];B[io];W[ko]C[53 is too slow and two small.  

That is the essential problem in your game here - too small.

Consider f7, b e7,  w j7.];B[lp]C[same suggestion as last move - only stronger since you have a stone at L5.]
;W[lo];B[mo];W[lm]C[Meaningless - for now - this is currently no one's territory - just dame.  So play from the other side and attack the j4 group. 

Even if you don't kill it, you can chase it and by chasing it, you can worm your way into the b territorial frameworks - as the stakes get larger and larger of losing the b j4 group.]
