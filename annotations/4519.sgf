C[Please comment this sgf for both players as we play together a lot.


Spingle: Throughout this game there is a weak white group on the top side. I never managed to find a way take profit from it. A few suggestions would be good - I personally am not really interested in the endgame. Just made a few silly mistakes and missed a tesuji.

Thanks a lot for you time and help.];B[pc];W[dp];B[dd];W[pe]
;B[qg];W[qc];B[pd]LB[qd:A][qe:B]C[EmTom: How should white play in now?

PC: (1) Instead of Black's move, the usual idea is to play 'a', followed by White at Q16 and Black 'b'. After that things get complicated.
(2) For White, 'a' (as actually played) is the only move: it keeps the White stones connected and leaves Black short of liberties.]
;W[qd];B[oe];W[pb];B[ob];W[od];B[oc];W[of]
(;B[ne]LB[nd:B][qe:A]C[PC: Other options here are cutting at 'a' and capturing at 'b' - see the variations. In both cases Black gets a decent corner while White gets outside influence and thickness.]
;W[qf];B[nf];W[og];B[pp];W[nq];B[qn];W[jp];B[id]LB[cn:D][dj:C]
[nd:B][qb:A]C[PC: The Black upper-right group has the captures at 'a' and 'b', so it's pretty strong. That makes Black's move look too close - I'd think of playing something like 'c' or 'd' instead.]
;W[cf];B[ch]TR[id]LB[be:A]C[spingle is this good? - wanted to induce 3-3 invasion

PC: This isn't bad, though if White invades at the 3-3 point the triangled Black stone will be a little over-concentrated. One alternative is to play the "footsweep" move at 'a', preventing the 3-3 invasion and daring White to invade between the 4-4 stone and the triangled stone.]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[fc]TR[id]LB[cl:C][ef:A][fd:B]C[EmTom: I wasnt sure if it was good idea. What do you think?

PC: I believe it's a joseki but in this position, with the triangled Black stone closer than normal and having backup to its right, it looks too agressive to me.  Perhaps play something like White 'a' Black 'b' White 'c' instead, with the 3-3 invasion still available to play later.]
;B[ee]
(;W[bd]C[PC: I'm dubious about this, as it's difficult to find room for two eyes on the left and White loses the possibility of playing the 3-3 invasion. Playing the 3-3 point immediately looks better - see variation.]
;B[cc];W[hd];B[ic];W[ef];B[ge];W[he];B[ff];W[ie]
(;B[je]LB[gd:B][gf:C][hc:A]C[PC: This looks like a good time to get in the move at 'a', threatening to cut. If White answers at 'b' then Black can play the game move having improved his stones' liberties. It does give White the atari at 'c', which leads to some interesting fighting, but it looks OK for Black - see variations.]
;W[jf];B[ke];W[cd];B[bc];W[de];B[ed];W[ac];B[ab]LB[dc:A]C[PC: Risky. If White cuts at 'a' now, some of the Black stones are likely to end up captured - see variations.]

(;W[ad]
(;B[cb]LB[bb:B][eb:A]C[PC: 'a' is better shape and creates threats against the top White group. The cut at 'b' doesn't give White an eye, so it's not a major concern at the moment.]
;W[eg]
(;B[cn]LB[cl:B][hg:A]C[spingle: wanted to keep possibility of corner invasion open + force him to push me into center ... probably not a good idea?

PC: I'd concentrate on keeping the two White groups separated and the getting Black group into the centre, e.g. with a move like 'a'. The White group on the top is weak, and the one on the left still needs another move to make two eyes.

If you want to play a move to strengthen your left edge group, the move played leaves a large gap. I'd prefer a more conservative extension, such as 'b'.]
;W[cl];B[ck];W[dl];B[ej];W[co]
(;B[fh]C[spingle: c13 instead?

PC: Yes, it removes White's eyes and gives the Black group more eye space, so both Black groups end up stronger than both White groups in the top left. The fight looks good for Black - see variations for some possibilities.]
;W[cg];B[hq]TR[ch][ci][ck][ej][fc][hd][he][ie][jf]LB[mi:C][ng:A]
[oh:B]C[PC: I'm dubious about this because it seems unrelated to the rest of the board. At the moment there are two weak groups (trianged), one for each side, so I'd prefer a strategy that took them into account. E.g. Black could threaten to capture the White stones on a large scale starting with Black 'a', White 'b', Black 'c', looking to reinforce his own weak group in the course of the fight.]
;W[fq];B[ho]
(;W[dn]C[EmTom: I also considered f5 but i thought that its better to capture c6.

PC: I think F5 also captures the stone, though obviously more loosely (see variations). Your move solves all your problems on the left, but I wonder whether it's good enough to win. A quick count:

White
  bottom left: 23 points
  top left: 7 points
  top right: 15 points
  total 45 points

Black:
  top left: 5 points
  top edge: 26 points
  bottom right:about  10 points
  total: 41 points

Black has sente, which makes the score close, but both sides have weak groups to worry about, adding uncertainty. Not an easy decision, but I prefer F5.]
;B[jr];W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[pj]LB[kr:A]C[PC: Greedy. A White move at 'a' now damages the Black group's eye space and means it has to run, setting up a splitting attack on the left side group.]
;W[hm];B[kr];W[lr];B[lq]TR[fc][hd][he][ie][jf]LB[lp:A][mp:C]
[mq:B]C[EmTom: I wasnt really sure what to do about it... Maybe better idea was just to connect on the outide?

PC: The problem with connecting on the outside (White 'a', Black 'b', White 'c' etc) is that you White ends in gote with the Black stones settled, allowing Black to start a large scale attack on the triangled White stones.]
;W[lp];B[mq]
(;W[mr]LB[mp:A]C[PC: See the variation for the move at 'a'.]
;B[mp];W[lo];B[np];W[oq]
(;B[jq]TR[lr][mr][nq][oq][pr]LB[in:B][op:A]C[PC: Better to connect at 'a'. threatening to kill the triangled White group. White will have to live in gote, giving Black the opportunity to attack the other White stones with a move like 'b'.]

;W[jo]
(;B[gr]LB[fr:A]C[PC: 'a' is a better attempt at settling the group.]
;W[fr];B[in];W[im];B[pg];W[pf];B[oi]LB[gp:C][hp:D][jn:E][ph:A]
[rg:B]C[Spingle: This move seems poor ... any suggestions?

PC: P11 doesn't accomplish much, as White can still play 'a'. If you want to play on the right then 'b' is a critical point. However, the right side isn't the biggest area at the moment - the Black group at the bottom doesn't have two eyes, and can easily die after White 'c', Black 'd', White 'e' (see variation on next move).]

;W[ec];B[dc];W[fd];B[fe];W[ba]C[EmTom: This was silly and black didnt have to answer right?

PC: Yes, Black could ignore this, though answering does at least give one eye.]
;B[ca];W[hg];B[fg];W[di];B[dj];W[hi];B[gj];W[ir]LB[gp:A][hp:B]
[jm:C]C[PC: Better to shut the group in with White 'a', Black 'b', White 'c', forcing it to live in gote.]

PC: N17 allows the cut at 'a', but after White 'b', Black 'c', White 'd' White will either capture the Black cutting stones in a ladder or connect to the right. So N17 was better here.]
