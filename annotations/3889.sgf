C[--
cjmichael:  Hello!  Thanks in advance for reviewing my game.  This was a close game, one where I felt during the game like I had the upper hand.  What I'm mostly interested in is how to stop such narrow losses, as many of my games have been ending like this.  I played as black.  I'm very interested in how to improve my early game, and also how and when to invade or attack.  I've left a few comments within the game.

Hi, my pleasure. I'll prepend my comments with "j:". I'll also include here a few final comments after reviewing.

The final comments: 

It was an extrange game, he helped you *very much* to make points in the center. Then you both played a lot of yose (endgame) moves  in the m6 area, when there were still lots of really big points.

As actual suggestion, I'd say:

- do not be so afraid of cuts, try to read if the cut works, else avoid playing there. You played quite a few unneeded moves.

- avoid the urge to reply, double check if it's needed or not.

- as for reductions and invasion, use your ingenuity, look for weak spots (aiming at connecting, as seen in the vars, or at escaping...)

- before playing a non-vital move,  look at the whole board!

Best regards and good  luck!];B[dp]C[issiel [19k\]: hello

cjmichael: I saw this to be very good for me, but perhaps I should have tried to be more aggressive on the stones in this area than just expand my territory?

j: yes, he was surely helping you. Maybe you could have pressed a little bit more  (see var at 87), but the result was fine, as his wall is worthless]

cjmichael: I've been trying not to make open triangle shapes.  I think this move by me was unhelpful.

j: yes, bad shape and not needed, you should have played elsewhere. A B C seem good points to me, I'd play C]

cjmichael:  I wanted to reduce his territory on the left side of the board.  I'm not good at such invasions.  Instead of reducing his, I decided to let him strengthen it at the cost of strengthening mine as well.  The white stones on the left side of the board are very loose.  Please suggest a good way to approach this vulnerability.

j: good idea.  As said before, d11 seems ok to me, as it has easy escape into the center. Your move feels too timid. More fancy things, see var, but at your own risk! :)

I think there's enough space to live, aiming at connecting with b4. If not living surely you could escape. I just drop a few ideas]
