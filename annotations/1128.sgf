Review is based upon Black's request];B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[cd]
;B[qf];W[nc];B[qk]TR[ed]C[RR:  This move is not important now.  If White pincers, black can jump in the corner, or if white blocks the corner, black can play here (or at Q10)

Now (in the beginning) it is more important to play the bigger ponts. (like E16)]
;W[db]C[RR:  This is a strange move.  If white wants the corner, a play at D17 is more conventional.]
;B[gq]TR[jp][dj]C[RR:  A professional once told me that during the opening, play far away from your own stones.  As I understand this, I would play either at K4, or up on the left hand side.]
;W[kq];B[nq]C[RR:  This is a good move.  It forces white into the area where black is stronger, while black gets strong too.  (Makes black wish that the R9 stone was at Q10 too!)]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[iq];B[cl]TR[ci][dj]SQ[ip]C[RR:  This move doesn't go far enough for Black.  Black can jump as far as one of the two marked spaces.  Also, the 3,3 point is still available to be invaded.

Of course, white has the cut at J4, which could be nasty!];W[cj]
C[RR:  White makes a good jump here.];B[kc]TR[ic]C[RR:  I like the J17 point better for this invasion.  If White blocks on the left side, Black can play M17, and have two stones with 2 empty spaces between them, a very powerful shape.  If White plays on the right side, the same shape can
be made on the left side, but is a little weaker because of the D18 stone.  Or, Black can simply jump out into the middle.   By playing here, white can now extend from the wall on the  upper left corner, while attacking black, a perfect move!]
;W[ic]C[RR:  White makes a perfect move.  Attacking while making territory!]
;B[ib]TR[ke]C[RR:  By attaching, both groups will become stronger.  In this case, white will become VERY strong, while black is only a little bit better off.  As Black, instead of attaching, I would jump into the center.  White will jump also, creating another perfect move, but then there is some bad Aji in the upper right corner, especially if black attacks at the 3,3 point!]
;W[hb];B[jb];W[hc];B[je]C[RR:  Good to jump into the center.  Although this can be cut.]
;W[he];B[dj]TR[ch][di]C[RR:  When you are strong, and your opponent is weak, do not attach.  You will both become stronger.  This white stone could be attacked in a bigger fashon (i.e. C12 or D11)]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[di];B[ej];W[ei];B[ci];W[bj];B[ek];W[ch];B[ig]
;W[gi];B[gk];W[ii];B[ik]TR[me]C[RR:  Watch out for the upper black group.  It has 2 cutting points, no eyes, and is getting surrounded.  Perhaps a better move would be in the upper right area, putting a bit of pressure on the two white stones, and starting to make some shape.]
;W[qh];B[ph]C[RR:  By attaching to this stone, the R9 stone will become very weak.  (As it turns out, the 5 stones on the top become very weak, because the connection is broken.)]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[oh];B[rh];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[qj]C[RR:  Black sacrafices a stone to make a connection.]
;W[pk];B[pf];W[of];B[qd];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc];B[oe];W[pe];B[qe]
;W[od];B[ne];W[me];B[nf];W[og]C[RR:  Whites stones are becoming a large ugly blob!  Although blacks stones are not out of danger.  The hanging connection at S12 can be very dangerous.]
;B[mg];W[pn];B[qn];W[qm];B[rm];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp];W[rl]
;B[qp]TR[sf]C[Black chooses the corner over the safety of the black group on the side.  There are several moves that could kill the black group.  The first one I see is White T14.  If black blocks the connection at T16, White cuts at S13 and then S11.  Lets see what white does.]
;W[po]C[RR: !?!!  Emtpy triangle to make one eye?  This move is very questionable.]
;B[rk]C[RR:  Black protects the group.  There is still bad Aji, but better now.]
;W[sm]C[RR:  Again, a questionable move...];B[no];W[nm];B[mm]
C[RR:  Black doesn't need to attack white so strongly.  Black can push white up, and then attack the three stones on the bottom!  By attaching, black will make white very strong, which ever side white wants to become strong!]
;W[mn];B[nn];W[mo]C[RR:  White is helping the three stones on the bottom.]
;B[nl];W[om];B[mk];W[lm];B[ll]C[RR:  By connecting rather than making a pon-nuki, the white stones on the bottom middle still need to make life.  Now that they can be connected, life is easier for white.]
;W[ml];B[kl];W[mm];B[mi];W[ni];B[nj];W[oj];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[li];B[nh];W[ng];B[sb]C[RR: !?!!  Was time running out?]
;W[sc];B[oi];W[pj];B[pl]C[RR: Black caught white asleep.  Good capture.]
;W[pm]C[RR:  Unneeded move.  White is connected.];B[gg];W[fg]
C[RR:  When trying to block somebody invading territory, it is almost always bad to connect.  But, like a palm tree in the hurricane, back off and give a little bit.]
;B[ff];W[gf];B[fe];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr]
;B[fq];W[hf]C[RR:  Don't peep  where you can cut.  White should cut here.]
;B[hg];W[jg];B[if];W[fd];B[fh];W[eg];B[fi];W[eh];B[gh];W[ke]

;B[hl];W[jl];B[hn];W[gm];B[kk];W[gl];B[hk];W[gn]TR[go]C[RR:  The cutting point of G5 will rescue the black stones.]
;B[jk];W[kn];B[gp]C[RR:  No need to play this now... Wait for a ko threat.]
;W[jo];B[fn];W[go];B[fo];W[nr];B[or];W[kr];B[ns];W[ls];B[ir]

;W[bi];B[ak];W[al];B[ds]TR[bn]C[RR:  Is black being nice to white?]
;W[an];B[cs];W[bs];B[es];W[br];B[ms];W[ks];B[tt];W[aj];B[tt]
;W[lq];B[tt];W[id]C[RR:  Black Wins by 3.5 points.  (Black is either a very good counter, or got lucky by giving up 3 points in endgame passes!)]
