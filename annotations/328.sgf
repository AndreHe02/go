C[c: Review by ML (cricket) 4k AGA];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[fq]TR[de][ce][od][oc][po][qo]C[c: nothing wrong with this, but approaching/enclosing the open corner formations is more common.]
;W[eq]LB[dn:a][hq:b]C[c: white need not attach to this stone, this helps black. A jump sideways like [a\] works fine or a pincer around [b\] for the aggressive type.]
;B[fp];W[fr];B[cn]C[I think I make a mistake at the 9th move . should I play g2 rather than c6?

c: I like the flavor of this, to change things up while White keeps playing on your original approach.  But, g2 would start to make a nice wall down that bottom side. I've played d5 in such a position to play for influence, but that seems inconsistent with the two 3-4 plays at R16 and Q3.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[co];B[en];W[do];B[eo];W[cm];B[cl];W[bm];B[bl]
;W[bn];B[dl]C[c: This looks pretty good to me. White gets a giant corner, but black gets a nice wall, and now G2 looks really big.  Maybe not perfect, but you're okay.]
;W[gq]C[c: white took care of it, but now you can play a strongly-backed approach to the d17 stone.]
;B[ep]LB[de:a]C[c: bad shape, small, slow, strengthens white. This is the first really yukky move played by black.  I really like [a\] at D15.]
;W[er];B[ce]C[Should I play d15 rather than c15?

c: I like d15 because it is high, and it's backed by a nice high influence position. Walls are for fighting, not claiming territory. Still, c15 is better than letting white get the first move here.]
;W[cg]C[c: wow! Gutsy white, This fight should favor black.]
;B[ee];W[eg];B[cc]C[Should I play f17 rather than c17?

c: f17 would be better. Attaching to a stone strengthens it--you don't want to attach to white's weak stone, that helps him. Both of White's groups are weak still, so another jump to g15 would work too, which sets you up to engulf the corner bigger, or to turn and squash the two white stone against your wall.]
;W[dd];B[cd]C[c: hmm, this seems passive again, d15 would be playing to keep white split. This looks like you're going to try and merely survive,and let white connect.]
;W[de];B[df];W[ef];B[cf];W[fe]C[c: White really got away with this one. You are low, and he has a nice high position of his own now. He should be very happy.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[ch]LB[eh:a]C[c: my guts say to resist at [a\] (e12). If you're a good fighter, you should be fine. There are more defects in white's position than yours right now.  c12 seems like just another passive move, accepting your low position, and letting white walk over you.]
;W[ci];B[bg];W[ei]C[c: same as before, white has made black low, just lower now than before. I'd say territory is pretty close, and white has better influence, so white has a lead here, but nothing you can't get back. L17 or m17 look like good ways to reduce white's influence.]
;B[dj]C[c: small and accomplishes little. White is strengthened, you get no territory, there's no noticable change in your influence. This might be good sometime, but now, the top seems more important.]
;W[di];B[jc]C[c: definately the right idea. Might be a big close to white's wall for comfort. I was thinking L or M 17, but this looks playable for folks less timid than I.]
;W[ic]C[c: wow! white was so aggressive before, and now plays passively. I thought he'd take m17. This should help you.]
;B[jd]C[c: good];W[oc]C[c: This is inconsistent with white's attachment, but more what I expected before the attachment.]

(;B[mc]C[c: I didn't like this at first, but the longer I look at it, I like it more. Since you started with 45 to keep him off the top, this helps you get stable, and does pressure his stone.]
;W[oe];B[pf];W[qb];B[pc];W[pb];B[od];W[qc];B[pd];W[nc];B[nd]
;W[mb];B[lb];W[nb];B[lc]C[c: This worked out for you, no weak groups, and white's influence is checked.]
;W[po]C[c: yup, good move.];B[qm]LB[pl:a]C[c: I think I like a higher pincer at [a\] or maybe even q7. Still, this is the right idea, attacking and extending from above simultaneously.]
;W[oq]C[c: hmm, I don't think I've seen this before.  it looks like p4 would split white, but looks complicated.]

(;B[pp];W[op];B[qo];W[kp]
(;B[oo];W[pn];B[on]C[Should I play q5 rather than p6?

c: it would certainly fix some weak spots. p6 does feel like your making the light p5 very heavy. Being pressed like this at all makes me feel white's getting too much from you here.]
;W[pm];B[qn];W[om]
(;B[mn]C[c: these stones are very burdensome. Trying to save them by running, instead fo reaching from the outside, could be finishing you off.]
;W[nm];B[mo];W[mq];B[mp]C[c: slow, heavy moves, white is getting points here, and you're suffering.]
;W[lq];B[ko];W[jo];B[kn];W[jn];B[ll];W[mk];B[pk]TR[nm][mn][mo]
[mp][ko][kn][ll][mk][jo][jn][lq][mq]C[c: Here's where I went back to move 77 to show how heavy your stones have become. Look at the marked stones, all played since then. Who's really better off?  Just by their spacing alone, white's moves have affected more of the board than black's.]
;W[ok];B[pl]C[c: I don't like this, it seems to let white around you.q10 or p10 seem better, (I'd play the solid q10).  I'm betting this was played to attack the white group, but  solid play has offensive power.]
;W[oj];B[jl];W[il];B[jm];W[im];B[ho];W[hp];B[nl];W[ol];B[ml]
;W[mm];B[nk];W[nj];B[mj];W[pj];B[qj];W[qi];B[rj];W[ri];B[qk]
TR[pl]C[c: These white moves that wrap around black I think were possible because of the marked move commented upon earlier.]
;W[ph];B[rg]C[Should I play m9 rather than s13?

c: I like M10 a little better. When choosing whether to attack his weak group, or defend your own weak group, defend your own. if he keeps his group weak, then you can attack with much greater force, and if you both get safe, then.. you haven't lost much. I think the black stones are in much greater danger than white's.]
;W[lm];B[km]C[c: Those stones might have been better off sacrificed. This and the next white moves really make your stones heavy.]
;W[lk];B[kl];W[kj];B[jj];W[ki];B[ji];W[kh];B[ik]C[c: Now it's very clear that black is the one in trouble, and white is okay.]
;W[kk];B[jk];W[hk];B[hj];W[gk];B[gj];W[fk];B[fj];W[ej]
(;B[ek]C[c: I'm not sure this really helps much. Perhaps it's too late anyway, but saving the black stones now seems the only way to win, and I'm not sure this cut can help that goal.]
;W[hn];B[lp];W[ln];B[jp];W[kq];B[lo]C[c: another move that hangs on to those original burdensome stones. this move would be better played elswhere to save the larger group. If he wants these stones, it will cost him another precious move. If he responds to your other move, then maybe you can come back and save these later, when you're safe.]

(;W[ip];B[ig]C[c: good];W[id];B[ie];W[bj]TR[bl][cl][dl][ek]
[dj][dm][en][eo][ep][fp][fq][fk][gk][hk][il][im][hn][on][oo]
C[c: now this group's weakness is evident. The white stones were pushed toward this group by the running black group. I still think black's troubles go back to those 2 original stones.]
;B[fl]
(;W[fm]C[c: this seems greedy. White might be able to kill this group, and might not, but this move ensures black connects and saves his stones.]
;B[hl]C[c: good];W[gm];B[gl]C[c: white has a couple of weaknesses, but it's probably endgame from here. Big points left on the board.]
;W[em];B[hm];W[go];B[in];W[io];B[he]C[c: I think playing underneath at j18 makes more points.]
;W[gc];B[hd]LB[db:a][ib:b][or:c]C[c: this solidifies white without expanding territory. The lettered moves are simple point-gainers that beat this move.]
;W[hc];B[ng]C[c: I like this idea because it goes after the last weakness on the board. If black can get white to make a mistake here, and catch this group, he's back in the game.]

(;B[pk]TR[on][oo]C[c: you end up playing this move at 89 later, after the black stones are on the run, and white has a more solid position from attacking you. I don't necessarily like it here, but it serves the same purpose as it does when you play it later, and you have many more options. White can worry about those 2 black stones, and if he plays against them, you can make another move elswhere where it can do some good.  Cut your losses early with lonely stones like this, and let white worry about you rescuing them from outside, rather than running for your life, adding precious moves/stones to bad.]

(;B[pn]C[c:I didn't like this move at first, but it seems okay. You fix your shape, white fixes his, and it's your move.   no lost stones... Simple and solid might be best right here.]

;B[pn]C[c: not sure, maybe white gets too much on the bottom, but black's potential on the side and center looks good to me.

I'm not the strongest fighter, but I do think that outside attachment should be resisted by black.]
))
(;B[pc];W[od];B[pf];W[ld];B[jf]C[c: two running groups. As white comes out, you can make territory on the right, and the weak black group can play for the connection along the top edge, or run to the wall in the lower left corner. The weakness in that wall at e7 is starting to show.

Perhaps I like your moves better now that I look at this.]))
