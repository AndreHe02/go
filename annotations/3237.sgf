C[thanks for reviewing, when you notice something extraordinary or a mistake tell me :)
(i didn't notice any mistakes while i had a look at it again so it has to be something in the direction of play, i think)

Hello reviewee. I'm French and about 5k.
To make it simple, your main problem is that you don't attack enough your opponent's weak groups. Second, you played a lot of slow moves, i.e moves that are gote and/or take few points.
For the first point, I suggest you read "Attack & Defense" by James Davies 'Elementary Series". 
The second is a common mistake at your level. You'll improve if you ask yourself at any time : "Do I really need to answer this ?" How much will I lose if I don't answer, and is there a bigger sente move somewhere else ?". If you study high dans handicap games (no more than 4 stones handicap), you'll see that white often tenuki (play somewhere else) so as to play the biggest moves.  
Last but not least, you should try to control the flow of the game. Here white, although he played a lot of weird moves, took the initiative to play the big moves and won because of this. 

If you have any questions, please e-mail me at remi.vannier@numericable.fr. 
I often play on KGS, and my nickname is Babibo.

well I don't know this joseki, but attaching to a stone that is not especially strong is rarely a good idea. 
The main idea is to separate the opponent's stones while preventing being confined in the corner

It is not only 2 stones : for white, there is a cut at D13 remaining. However, it is gote for both sides, so the rescue of the stones can probably be postponed by playing one of the big moves remaining]
