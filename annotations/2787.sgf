C[Hi sir/madam ,
I am a new beginner and just learn to play Go for 7 weeks. All my knowledge came from reading books and playing with computer software . This is my second review game and I think is really benfit a lot of the advice from the past viewer .

This time I play Black against GNU Go software. Please help me to review and comment the game.

Thanks
Ken];B[pp]C[Ken : This is my first attempt to use the " Chinese" style opening . If you find any contradiction with the original concept , please let me know.]
;W[dq];B[pc];W[dc];B[qj]LB[pk:B][qk:A]C[In the Chinese opening the triangle stone is played at either A or B

"A" would be the low chinese opening and is used for gaining territory.

"B" is the high chinese opening and would be played to gain more influence.]
;W[hd]LB[ce:A][de:C][co:B][do:D]C[Ken : very strange move . I seldom see this movement before , any special meaning ?

The normal move here would be to enclose one of his corners at A, B, C, or D.]
;B[jc]LB[co:B][do:A]TR[dq]C[Since your opponent didn't enclose one of his corners it would be best to approach the triangle stone at either A or B]
;W[je];B[ld];W[hp]C[Ken : Strange move again !];B[jp];W[qe]
;B[qg];W[oe];B[od];W[do];B[ce]SQ[ch][dh][ci][di][cj][dj][ck]
[dk]C[This move is too deep into white territory and offers a target for attack.

The square points are better spots of invasion.

Invasion at the points shown will help to stop white from building a moyo.]
;W[cg];B[ee];W[pn];B[no];W[cj];B[cc]SQ[ce][ee]C[Ken : I want to take the corner first to secure the marked stones. Is this too "small" to be done at the opening stage ?

This is a good move at this time.  The two marked stones are under attack and need to secure a base.]
;W[iq];B[jq]TR[dc][hd][je][oe][qe][pn]SQ[hb][fc][lf][og][pl]
[nm]C[This move is too small. It would be better to attack whites weak groups .

The triangle white stones are weak and the square points are good points to attack them.]
;W[hn]SQ[ek][fk][gk][el][fl][gl]C[Ken : any good suggestion to attack B left hand side , as they going to form big territory . I think B is losing at this moment unless I can secure the lower right corner and get some territory at the centre .

B has fallen a little behind and allowed W to form a big territory.  The game is not over yet though.  There are still weak W groups on the board or you can try and reduce the W territory at the squared points.]
;B[jn];W[pd]C[The variation here is a little better for B.]

(;B[nd];W[qc];B[pb];W[qb];B[pf];W[pe];B[gd]SQ[dc]C[Ken : I want to capture the marked stone , is this move correct ?]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[he];B[hc]LB[gc:A]C[Ken : After this move , I immediately discover G17 is more secure since now there is a cutting point at A , and I did to suffer some bitter afterwards.

The H17 move is not bad the problem lies in how you dealt with the cut at G17 which will be explained later.]
;W[pl];B[oj];W[mm];B[eg]SQ[lf][ig]C[This move is bad.  It doesn't have much effect on the marked W stones whic need to be attacked now if B wants to win.

The marked points are better places for this move.];W[ql];B[mk]
;W[om];B[nl];W[nm];B[kl];W[fk];B[hk]C[Ken : Is this move OK to defend white extension ? My concept is very weak in this area , as there are always too many choice provided .

This move seems okay to defend against a W invasion from the F9 stone, but the matter of real importance is to attack the H15 group immediately.]
;W[ih];B[gi];W[lf];B[ne];W[of];B[nf];W[og];B[nh];W[rf];B[rg]
;W[gh]SQ[hd][he][je][lf][ih]C[Ken : Is there any efficient move to kill the centre marked stone , if they get big territory , I will sure lose this game.

At this point trying to attack the stones here will be hard but the variation I show might be able to do something.]

(;B[fh];W[gg];B[ro]SQ[pl][ql][mm][nm][om][pn]C[Ken : I don't think my skill can kill the centre stones , thus I change to make sure all these 6 marked stones must be dead .

This is a good move. If S5 is not played the W stones could live by playing at S5 or R5]
;W[gc]C[Ken : Oh! it find my weak point .];B[fc];W[gb]C[This next move is wrong it should be played out like in the variation.]

;B[ij];W[kh];B[id];W[pa]C[The next move P19 is incorrect and should be played out like the variation.]

(;B[oa];W[qa];B[ob];W[ir];B[jr];W[bf]C[W is making a lot of points in the endgame.  In your games you should always try to grab moves like B14 and K2 first.]

;W[ib];B[jb];W[ic];B[jd];W[ke];B[li];W[pj];B[pk]C[This move is wrong it should be at T10 to live.]
;W[ok];B[oi];W[qk];B[ph];W[pg]SQ[pk]C[Ken : I don't know why it move Q13 instead the marked Q9 , can you figure out any special purpose.

The purpose is that the W group has a very little chance of survival, so connecting would be giving away points.]

Thanks .

Besides a few mistakes in the game your play was okay.  I would also rate you at about a 20k.  The main things to be learned from this game is not to let your opponent build a big territory like the one W gets in this game, and to attack your opponent's weak groups when you have the chance.]
