C[I put a D in front of your comments, my comments are preceded by N:
I tried to limit myself to commenting the black side.
Also notice that i'm not much stronger then you (1d Belgium)
so don't take my comments for the truth. If you have additional questions, feel free to ask.

;B[jd]
(;W[jq]C[N: this seems to be the wrong direction making the middle of the right side a very big point.]
;B[pj];W[qe];B[pe];W[pf];B[oe];W[qd];B[qc];W[of]
(;B[qg]C[N: this seems to be wrong, by playing here you force white to connect and to take away one of his weaknesses. You want to play hane on the head of two stones. See variations.]
;W[qf];B[ne];W[oh];B[qi];W[mg]
(;B[pn]C[D: I thought this was good for Black
L:  I would prefer playing lower, this seems to leaves less attacking possibilitys for white but this is personally i think.
Besides that, your position seems ok, whites UR group is a bit weak.]

(;W[hc];B[oq]C[D: have a phobia about two stones on 3rd line, want to separate them!
N: appears to be logic.];W[op];B[np];W[pp]
(;B[mq]C[N: maybe the variation is better to connect your groups.]

(;W[ql]C[N: this seems to be premature, the white stone on the bottom needs reinforcing.]
;B[pl];W[qn];B[qm];W[rm];B[pm];W[rn];B[gq]C[N: to attack it is better to play one space closer i think, see furtheron.]
;W[lc]C[D: W gets revenge at the top];B[le]C[D: but I'm happy to keep pressure on his weak group]
;W[jb]
(;B[jj]C[D: least 2 possible moyos here
N: well i see only that one on the bottom ;-)
concerning your move: it looks like a splitting attack, but you are not attacking one of the two groups very severely therefore this feels a little suspicious, but this is not easy. see variations for possibilities for white at the bottom.]

(;W[nj];B[mn];W[qk];B[oj];W[lj]
(;B[nh]C[just a throw in to create aji
N: if you can do this, you are a strong player, however i'm not sure that you created aji. By throwing in, you force white to defend and reinforce himself. after the exchange there are less possibilities left for you, so you lost aji?
You can play a throw in if you want to see how your opponent will respond, and then alter your play elsewhere, but this is not the case here i think.]
;W[ng];B[nk];W[ni];B[df]C[D: feel I now have to play on the left]
;W[ck]
(;B[dm]C[N: this doesn't feel efficient, you play three moves in the corner but still don't have territory there;]
;W[ch]
(;B[ed]C[N: the variation looks to be better shape to connect your stones]
;W[ec];B[fc];W[fd]
(;B[ee];W[eb];B[gd]C[think this backfired a bit];W[fb];B[fe]
;W[cq]C[the obvious move for W];B[dq];W[cp]
(;B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[dr];B[er];W[cr]
(;B[ei]LB[bf:B][pr:A]C[D: is it bigger to defend against f2?
N: defending is worth more then 8 points in reverse sente (+risk of ko) so this is not that big at this stage. (see var)
For exampel 'A' is a much more important point in the endgame, worth 6 points in double sente, so this is bigger.
But now B is also very interesting, splitting makes that your opponent has to be carefull to live, also it makes your top left group more solid and less vulnerable. The continuation shows how much such a stone would have helped you.]

;W[ii];B[ji]C[D: misreading - did not see W 90, but it does help the bottom moyo
N: the moves you played extra, only gave white a stronger position and extra points and influence indirectly weakening your top left, this will prove to be very dangerous. you only improved your moyo a little, if this was so important, better to play m9 immediate.]
;W[jh];B[ki];W[kh];B[li];W[mi];B[lk];W[mj];B[il];W[hk];B[gl]
;W[hl];B[hm]C[N: the position seems more or less equal. Try to do an estimation and remark that the status of the bottom becomes very important now.]

(;W[eh]C[N: this treathens your top group so seems sente.]
(;B[mc]C[D: overplay I guess
N: not the biggest area on the board. You only have one major territory so white reducing moves are very much sente and so your moves will be bigger reverse sente moves as well i a kind of way.
Also you play a contact move, but i don't see what you are defending against?
And to make things worse, you even induce an attack.];W[md]
;B[mb]C[bad mistake! several better moves];W[ld];B[me];W[nd]

;W[bd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[fg];B[gg]C[N: following the exchange in the upper side, white seems ahead by some 10 points. So it becomes very urgent to ignore one of whites moves.]

(;B[dh]C[D: Should have played N2 instead

N: yes, i think you can even play p2
Here you have a lost position, no further comments.
Your two worst mistakes where imho giving white massive thickness in the center and free points, and your non-suji on the upper side, pracktically giving points to white]
