C[(IW) I played white in this game. My experience in even games is somewhat limited (I normally player stonger players and take a handicap), so I was unsure about a lot of my moves in the opening. Comments about direction of play and bad moves would be especially appreciated.



Overall B got a good position early on. W had two attempts to reduce a moyo  
and both went a bit wrong. B probbaly should have punished those attempts

more severely. Later a W group dropped off and B should have wrapped up  
the win comfortably. Instead B was careless and could even have lost had

W taken some big yose points earlier - of course then B might not have made the  
later mistake.



I think B should a) look to attack more severly b) watch those cutting points.



W needs to explore making light reductions and study the L group in life and death.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[kq];W[pj]C[So far so good, this sort of thing is in the books.          One can instead apprach the bottom left in the normal way or play closer to the corner.     But your move is fine.          You have effectively limited the moyo down here and B does not have a single move to close off the lower right.]
;B[jd]C[Some folks prefer to play this low as it is easier to make a solid base.          Also B could have apprached the top left from the other side and built     a mojo along the left.]
;W[mc]C[I feel that this is slow. My thinking is that B does not have to answer and the left side is bigger.          However recently I played B in such a game and stronger players crticised me for not establishing a base from 7, so maybe your move is OK.]
;B[gc];W[df]C[I think that W did need to play around here but I wonder whether this is the right place?     High is good if you are thinking of really pressing on 7 and 9, they look so strong I      don't think you can get much leverage.]
;B[dj]C[logical];W[kc]C[(IW) Black seems to have mapped out rather a large area at the bottom; however I thought that putting pressure on the isolated black stones would help my position at the top.    
    
It needs to be sente and preferably should also do something extra. 12 makes 8    
stronger but it was reasonably strong already, it adds very little territory or potential.    
    
If you were determined to follow your strategy possibly E17 would be better,    
it takes a large corner territory and makes 11 less forceful.]
;B[eb]C[Seems an odd shape, but does work];W[cc]C[     The fact that a move like this seems needed implies that 12 was bad]
;B[ch]C[Pressuring W from all directions               Somehow it's all gone wrong for W . I think 12 was the root cause]
;W[cf]C[This really is horrid. I'd prefer to get out to the centre.          If a move aroud G 14 is sente against the supper side then you should play there.          Problem is that 11 and 15 are strong so W can't get much pressure on that     side.]
;B[gf]C[Seems like a nice idea.];W[lf]C[(IW) I wanted to expand my moyo on the right, but after black's next move I was left feeling that my stones on the left had become stut-in.    
    
    
Yes, that's a problem. Also if you're getting into a mojo battle then your's has to    
grow as fast as your opponenet's; I don't see how that can ever be the case    
in this position.    
    
I would want to get into the lower left. F3 seems dull but is all I can thing of.    
I don't like the pincer at H3 that would follow but I'm even less keen on starting    
at H3.];B[eg]C[(IW) Black's move seems a bit slow to me.    
    
This is a thickness move. If it were sente against the corner    
it would be wonderful. Otherwise it's one of those build the    
thickness now and expect the profit later moves.    
    
I'm trying to learn when they are a good idea myself. My    
gut feel is that this is good. It nicely help the upper side group too.    
The downside is that 11 is nw a bit close to the other stones.    
    
Possibly Q8 might be better.];W[op]C[(IW) I felt I needed to break up black's position at the bottom; I was not familair with the joseki here.    
    
I feel that this is the wrong place. I prefer to go in towards the bottom left, that's where    
a larger territory is about to solidify. This is too peripheral to the main action.]
;B[oo]C[Very difficult to analyse possibilities here.          I think B should be aiming to drive W out toward the centre     and in so doing enhance his chances on the left.          Normally attaching to a weak stone is a bad idea.          However it does seem tough to answer this move.          The Kato book on the Chinese Fuseki seems to assume B would play     Q6 as the "obvious" move.]
;W[qq]C[     Ishida says that even pros avoid this because of undreamed of variations.          I tink that you should avoid going for an early life if it concedes lots of     thickness. But this move seems reasonable if you don't like the josekis     starting from playing O5]
;B[pp];W[pq];B[oq]
(;W[or]C[     I assume that this was not howyou thought things would turn out     when you played 22?          Looks like the sort of move I make when it has all gone horribly     wrong and I just want to salvage something.          One simply cannot afford to concede the capture of 20.          Absolutely must pull out 20 instead.]
;B[np]
(;W[rp];B[ro];W[sq]C[     I'm not sure that you live after this.          Get Life and Death an study the L group; you can then be pretty sure how to live in these situations.          Probably 28 is a mistake. See the variation.]
;B[nj]C[I would play S2 if I thought I coulod kill or O2 if I thought S2 didn't work.          O2 is huge and sente if W thinks they are alive.          31 is big though.]
;W[ph]C[(IW) At this point I assumed my group in the bottom right was alive.    
    
    
Well it's tough to analyse now, and even more so in a game. I think that 30 at S3    
would have been alive for sure.    
    
32 feels slow, can you afford to let B mojo grow like this?    
    
This is why a small life in the corner won't do.];B[cn]C[     still leaves the corner open. Wonder whether the slightly odd looking     C5 might be better. You could think of 33 as too close to the thickness     above.]
;W[qc]C[     If played on the basis of counting this could be very cool but one must have     a very accurate estimateof the score before playing a purely defensive move     like this.          My instict is that W simply has too many stones in the top left for the size     of territory he is making.]
;B[eq];W[jp]C[(IW) Black looked like getting a very large moyo, so again I felt the need to reduce this.    
    
    
Realy one needs to see the problem a few moves earlier but this seems a good    
reduction point. You are however very deep in the moyo, probably theoretically    
too deep. But could W win by playing reasonably? I doubt it, so this move    
is worth a try];B[jq]C[     Suppose B just played H4 and then chased W out? a huge territory would result?          This move is fine if you know you geyt enough territory this way.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[hp]C[     This seems suspect to me.          I don't think even one eye can be got down here, moving out to the     centre should be th priority]
;B[gq]C[          Very slow.          How about G5 and then chasing W out while building a the moyo on the left]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[gr]C[(IW) This seemed to be a reasonble sacrifice to make my wall thicker and retain sente.    
    
Why not just play G4? Don't sacrifice anything.    
    
But more to the point are you really building thickness, or is it just a clump    
of stones in deep trouble?];B[ir];W[gp];B[fq];W[em]C[(IW) I felt reasonably happy with making thickness, but was now unsure how to use it.    
    
You have no eyes and nowhere obvious to go. I think 48 may be a nice decoy,    
but B should probaby just play F6 and invite you to sacrifice it.    
    
If he's really aggressive he might try G7 and attack the whole lot.]
;B[dl]C[     Much too passive unless B knows their ahead.           19 was a nice thick move, 49 seems defensive.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[hm]C[(IW) I was afraid of a black play around here making my 'thickness' look like a weak group.    
    
I agree, but he should have done it a few moves back.];B[nh]
C[Ttreating both W groups as alive and playing large yose.          This does seem very big.]
;W[qf]C[          Too defensive. Moves around Q8 seem better.]
;B[lo]C[          I can't understand why B does not play O2 first.          But how about K7?]
;W[nq]C[(IW) I wanted to defend my stones around G4-K4, so I played this as a forcing move first.    
    
But you are no better off. B can still play O2];B[op];W[kn]
C[     Good answer, showing why 55 was off the spot];B[ol];W[ql]
C[Suddenly W is growing territory an B is not.          If the bottom right were alive I think the game is close.]
;B[jj];W[nf]C[(IW) I thought I was ahead, so I decided to secure more territory rather than play something aggressive.    
    
It's big reverse sente. Is it bigger than O2? O2 must be sente for B if you are alive.    
It's a huge endgame point for you.    
    
But B13, E8, K17 and E18 are all probably sente.Need to fnd those sente plays.    
    
B13 is proabably double sente so it should be played first and E8 next]
;B[jc];W[lm]C[     Might be amusing to play K7 first];B[ln]
C[Might be amusing to play K7 first];W[jm]C[After this W seems to be a lot more stable]
;B[mm];W[ll];B[kd];W[lc];B[el];W[fl];B[fk];W[gl]C[(IW) I considered a double-hane, but there seemed to be to many cutting points in my position.    
    
    
yes];B[fn]C[Possibly G9 is better (but B13 is still crying to be played)]
;W[fm];B[eo]C[THhis sequence is good only if it's sente];W[fo]
;B[en];W[gn];B[kp];W[bg];B[bh];W[ah];B[ai];W[ag];B[bj]C[     Yes, the chance was taken]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[mi]C[B seems to have missed the nasty possibilities here.          THis is a nice idea.]
;B[mj];W[lh];B[lj];W[mg];B[ni];W[gk];B[fj];W[gj];B[gi];W[nr]
C[          This seems to be the winning move. Except ...];B[rr]

(;W[rq];B[qr];W[rn]C[(IW) I was now not sure that my group would live, but I thought that I could link up.]
;B[so];W[ps]C[(IW) This seems a big mistake - I think that I could still have lived here with a move at Q2.    
    
It's tough now because B can play T4 directly. You can play a sacrifce at R5 in order to stop that, then I think the S1 move works again.   
   
Certainly 106 was a very bad move];B[pr]C[    I would have resigned after this. B should be able to play safe now.]
;W[qn]C[    However W does nealy pull it off. Difficult to see why at this stage.]
;B[on]C[Very bad move, seems to have no effect on the cutting point and otherwise    is worth only a point or two]
;W[hi]C[    Seeme like B has missed that W can cut?];B[gh];W[kj]
C[(IW) Around this point I realised I was a fair bit behind. I was looking to capture the five black stone around O10 somehow; a cut at P9 seemed to work, but I also felt I needed to stop black escaping towards the top left first.   
   
Good analysis. But what will you do in response to B connecting now?   
You may get 10 points or so by capturing 61.   
   
I would probably try a move around J15 with the same intent.]

;B[cg];W[bf];B[jb];W[kb];B[kf];W[ld];B[cb];W[bb];B[db];W[bd]
;B[ed];W[jg]C[(IW) Again, I'm trying to capture black by cutting off escape prior to cutting at P9.]
;B[jf];W[li];B[kg];W[ok]C[(IW) The game seemed to be back to a more even fight now.   
   
   
Yes this is huge, B must have been shocked?   
   
But although it compenates for the loss oin the lower right in the meantime B has taken two huge yose points at 125 and 129]
;B[le];W[me];B[lg];W[mh];B[nk];W[nl]C[    From now on it's just yose.]
;B[pk];W[oj];B[pl];W[qk];B[dc];W[ee];B[fd];W[dg];B[dh];W[ke]
C[(IW) I was afraid of the ko ! I did not want to risk losing my cutting stones around M12 etc.   
   
Yes, especially under time pressure sometimes it's right to be conservative.]
;B[fe];W[dn];B[do];W[qo];B[sr];W[sn];B[sp];W[pm];B[om];W[ja]
;B[ia];W[ka];B[hb];W[ef];B[ff];W[ko]C[(IW) With hindsight, a move at B19 seems bigger.   
   
   
Yes, but this sort of yose is something that is in some sense obvious. If we have the patience we can work out the value of the moves. Having the discipline to do so will win a few more games, however getting the opening and middle game strategy right is worth massively more.   
   
My predjudice is that agonising over improving yose is probably a waste of time unless     
you feel that this is a particularly weak area of your game.   
   
The key ideas are sente and reverse-sente, once you are thinking about that the rest   
 should fall into place.];B[fp];W[go];B[ba];W[ab];B[ca];W[je]
