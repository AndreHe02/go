C[forfun (ff) - Hi Cristiano!  Thanks for the opportunity to review this game.  It was interesting.  There were many twists and turns.  In the early going W had the advantage due to B's mistake in the upper left.  I am not sure that W realized this.  Later in the middle game W missed a couple of chances to take advantage of B's weak stones and the game became close again.  I don't think that W was behind when the game record ends so you must have lost some more points in the endgame.

Try to practice assessing your position throughout the game, it can help you keep a sense of balance.  Both W and B play away from the center of the action from time to time.  Sometimes this is good but other times it seems that the players are not understanding the potential of the position.

I have written various comments, usually illustrated with variations.  In other cases I have just added variations without comments.  The extra variations represent thoughts that I had as I went through the game.  I hope that you can understand what I was pointing out.]
;B[dp];W[cd];B[qp];W[qd];B[kq];W[cn];B[fp];W[dj];B[ed]C[ff - At this point we arrive at a fairly common position.  I think that W's next play is probably a mistake in thinking.  The issue for W is how best to make use of the W stones at D10 and C6.  I think that the most direct idea is the attachment at E15 (see variation).

Actually you will rarely find E15 played by the professionals however.  Instead they will usually play a pincer at H16 or G16.  This is because the stone at D10 is a little too close the resulting wall and the weak point at C8 means that B can reduce the left side.  However, I think that an amateur W should be willing to play this way.  If a pro intends to play E15 they will play the D10 stone at D9 instead.]

(;W[ec]
(;B[dd];W[dc]
(;B[gd]C[Is this joseki ?

ff - No this is not joseki, just a mistake.  Black should just continue into the usual nadare pattern with C15 to take advantage of W's choice of E17 earlier (see variation).]

(;W[cf]C[ff - But this is a poor answer.  W should take the opportunity to play into F16 (see variation).]
;B[ce]C[ff - B should just skip this and play F17.];W[be]
(;B[fc];W[de];B[pj];W[op]C[ff - Another approach would be to try to attack the stones that B has left on the upper side in order to build up W's position in the upper right.  On the other hand a shape like E16, F17, and G16 is tricky to attack cleanly.  So turning away from the upper side for now is not out of the question.

At this point, however, W needs to realize that the upper left has been a big success.  As a result, W is ahead on territory at the moment.  If W can erase B's moyo lightly and then trade territory in the upper right for what B makes on the lower right, W should win easily.]
;B[pp]
(;W[oq]C[ff - This looks heavy because of the B stone on L3.  What about P5 instead? See variation.]
;B[oo];W[no];B[on];W[lp];B[nn];W[kp];B[jq];W[eq]C[ff - Too extreme.  W does not need to try so hard.  This risks losing control of the game (basically what happens).]
;B[ep];W[cq]
(;B[dq];W[cp];B[np];W[mq];B[nq];W[nr];B[mo];W[pr];B[mc]C[ff - B plays first on the top and the right side is very solid.  In exchange W has taken the bottom left corner.]

(;W[jd]C[ff - In fact the B stones to the left will be hard to attack in a profitable way.  B wisely takes care of N17 first.]
;B[pc]
(;W[qg]C[ff - R17 is a vital point for the strength of the stones in this fight.  It is a pity to let B play there.]

(;B[cj]C[ff - Leaves the scene of the action.];W[ck]C[I think White 46 to be a bad move on the left side. Isn 't it ?

ff - This looks natural to me.  W wants to force the B stones to the upper side because the shape there is very strong.]
;B[dk]C[ff - This is a natural answer.  The question is - what next?]
;W[ci];B[bj]
(;W[bi]C[ff - This must be a mistake as it faces W's strong upper position.]

;B[bs];W[cs];B[dn];W[dl]C[ff - This is a meaningless stone.  Should play D5 instead to keep the B stones separated.]
