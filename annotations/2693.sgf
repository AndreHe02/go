AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I'd like some help!  I'm starting with a 4-stone handicap against gnu-go, and it seems to me I ought to be doing much better than I am.  In this game, I eke out a win, but I must be missing some pretty obvious stuff.

Thanks,
Doug Miller

JWS: Let's have a look. I am not too fond of reviewing games against computer programs, because of the sily moves of those programs, but I think there is still enough too comment upon. 

My name is Jan-Willem Swane and I am around 10k.];W[cn]
(;B[jp]C[I'm thinking, forget the usual 1-point jump, I'm so far ahead I'll just grab the big points and start making moyo.

JWS: There are a lot of ways to start, and I don't think this is a very bad one. Still, I do think there are better choices. See variations.]
;W[ck];B[qj]C[JWS: If you are aiming at a moyo, playing at the 4th line is more consistent.]
;W[df];B[fd];W[cd];B[cc];W[ce]
(;B[de]C[JWS: this seems to make you overconcentrated. See variation.]
;W[hc]
(;B[gc]C[JWS: this moves strengthens white, while it doesn't help you a lot. See variation.]
;W[hd]
(;B[jc]C[Is this awful?

JWS: First of all, I think it is too close. A move around M17 still makes it difficult for the white group to settle itself, while it works better with Q16. Still, I would play B17.]
;W[bc]C[JWS: White takes this important point, settling it's own group, and threathening the life of the black group.]
;B[db]C[JWS: A very bad move. Black can play C18 and black will have great difficulties to find eyespace. bC18 is a lot better. But Black's position is difficult, for example because of the weak point at E17.]
;W[qn]C[JWS: I will not comment too much on the computer moves, but here you see why you won't learn too much from playing it. Any human above 20k would punish you for your slack move at D18.]

(;B[nq]C[JWS: Here was your chance to repair your problems in the upper left. See variation.]
;W[rp];B[qq]C[JWS: You could consider to ignore this, because your position at the bottom is strong.]
;W[pg]
(;B[qf]C[JWS: I don't like this move. It strengthens the white stone, which weakens your stone at R10. See variation.]
;W[nc]
(;B[oc]C[JWS: Again: this strengthens white stone (assuming white will answer it, as a human player would).

You could have ta advantage of white's tenuki. See variation.]
;W[fq]
(;B[eq]TR[cn][jp]C[JWS: again, you are touching the stone you attack, making it stronger. Besides that, this move is not consistent. Remember that you answered the white marked stone with the black marked stone. With it, you wanted to get influence, not territory. But you also invited a move at F3. See variation.]
;W[er];B[qh]C[Was something like D2 much more urgent?

JWS: If you think the right side is important, you shouldn't have played E3 in the first place.

Locally, your move is bad too, because you leave a hole for white (R13). Playing at R13 yourself would have been a lot better.]
;W[nd]C[JWS: Now the white stones start walking, your position gets a lot weaker.]

(;B[nb]C[JWS: Keeping the white stones separated is most important at this moment. See variation.]
;W[mb];B[pb];W[ql];B[rk]C[JWS: again: strengthening the white group. Connecting at R13, although not sente, seems best.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[on]
(;B[oj]C[JWS: Not urgent. See variation.];W[ek]
(;B[hq]C[JWS: still, I would play K15. But localy, this move is bad, because you are playing from your strong group. You are almost forcing white to take the corner. See variation.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[rl];B[mj]TR[jc][dp][eq]C[JWS: again, extremely bad timing. The marked stones are collapsing, threathening to give white a lot of territory.]
;W[hf]C[JWS: ouch!];B[ff];W[eg]C[JWS: incomprehensible. Catching K17 is much bigger.]
;B[fg];W[fh];B[ef];W[dg];B[dr];W[ep];B[dq];W[fp];B[co];W[bn]
;B[bo];W[fm]C[At this point it seems I've let him build quite a territory on the left with almost no chance to invade or reduce it.  Where did I go wrong?

JWS: you wen't wrong by not playing the good defensive moves in the corners at the right time. because of that, you needed to struggle, whicht gave white the possibility to strengthen the borders of his potential territory.]
;B[jj]C[Now I'm thinking just get out to the center and prevent him from grabbing anymore territory there.

JWS: Remember: there is not mucht territory in the center. Look at the situation. You have a lone stone at K17. When you manage to get away with it, whites's O17-group will get difficulty to form eyes.]
;W[gh];B[je]C[JWS: finally!];W[ld];B[jg];W[ih];B[jh];W[mg];B[qg]
C[JWS: needing to come back here is expensive.];W[gd];B[gb]
;W[hb]
(;B[gj]C[JWS: why? You are only inviting white to seal of his territory. See variation.]
;W[mn];B[ej];W[fj];B[fk];W[fi];B[dk];W[el];B[dl];W[gk];B[dn]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dj];B[cl];W[bl];B[em];W[bm]TR[bb][of]C[Hurray, I think.  I've save my stones on the left and reduced his territory a bit.  But should I have been doing something bigger elsewhere??

JWS: You could win this much, because white played stupid. Besides, I think playing at the marked spots is bigger.]
;B[dm];W[ei];B[bk];W[cj];B[an]C[This is obviously doomed, shouldnt' have bothered.]
;W[bj];B[bb]C[JWS: finally.];W[gn];B[bd];W[be];B[ac];W[of]TR[jc]
[je][jg][jh][jj][mj][oj]C[JWS: a very important move. See how living by the white group means that the marked black stones make no territory at all.]
;B[pf];W[lq];B[lr];W[mp];B[mq];W[lp];B[kq]C[JWS: you leave too much cutting points. L2 seems better.]
;W[ds];B[cs];W[es];B[cq];W[og];B[ol];W[ae];B[ad]C[JWS: small.]

JWS: well, these kind of things happen when you start playing. You will get over it.]

JWS: I hope i have answered that already. You started to walk to late with K17. Because of that, you couldn't threathen the white groups anymore.]

   Black = 67 territory + 5 captures = 72
Black wins by 9.5.

JWS: my advice: try to see which are the weak groups. Attack those of the opponent, strengthen those of yourself, and try to the two at the same time.]

Funny how both players ignore the lower left. Makes you wonder about the exchange E3, E2.]

(;B[eo]C[JWS: What about this? It keeps the white stones seperated.]

(;B[nd]TR[hc][nc][hd][pg]SQ[jc][qj]C[JWS: maybe, this is even better. White has a lot of weak stones here, and when you can keep them seperated, you can win a lot. When white connects the stones, he gets a lot, especially because of your weak stones marked with a square.]
))
(;B[qg]C[JWS: What about this simple move? Connecting with R10 makes your groups strong, puts pressure on the white groups and takes territory. Often the most simple moves are the best.]
))
(;B[rl]TR[pg][qn][rp]SQ[qj]C[JWS: White has created two weak groups, while your stone between it is weak two. A good strategy is putting preasure on one of the white groups from your weak group. It will strengthen your weak stone. Afterwards, you get a strong attack on the other weak white stone.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[qr];B[pr];W[qp];B[qs];W[on];B[rg]C[JWS: I am sure a stronger player will not aprove of this variation, but the important part is the idea: black gets territory and strong groups, while white groups have to fight for life.]
))
(;B[bb]C[JWS: As soon as this groups settles itself, both white groups aside of it get weaker. Giving white two moves in the lower right is worth that.]
))
(;B[mc]C[JWS: What about this one? White can't make it's ideal extension to M17/16, while you are getting a strong corner. White stones remain weak for some time, which gives you ways to harass them.]
))

(;B[bc]C[JWS: You could consider this move. It leaves white's position insecure, while it secures your own position. Besides it gives you territory]

(;B[cj]LB[dd:B][dj:A]C[JWS: If you like to play at a big point, I like this one (or A) better, because it works as a pincer and an extension from B at the same time.]
