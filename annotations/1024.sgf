C[Have I really lost?  I was white.
The IGS server told me I've lost, but I don't understand.
I have learned the rules reading Janice Kims introduction to Go.
regards
Gunnar (White)];B[dp];W[pp]C[This is a more agressive start. As a beginner you usually want less fighting and q16 is safer for that as you then always get two corners close to each other.]
;B[gq];W[eo]C[Do not attack that group at this poiunt of time. It would be better to get into another corner by playing q16 or q17.

Also if you want to attack the black group c6 would serve better (see variation)]

(;B[fo];W[ep];B[fq];W[eq];B[dj];W[cg]C[This is somewhat undecided. The lower left corner is not at all settled, so either you continue playing there, trying to win the corner, or you decide to play somewhere  else, in which case you should play dirctly into one of the corners.]
;B[cj];W[cm]C[This seems to be somewhat too open, it might yet happen that black manages to live within the corner, which you should certainly prevent, so playing c6 might be better, preventing black from gaining time by pushing at d6]
;B[pj];W[pg]C[You need not directly attack black's move, as before, just play into a corner.]
;B[qj];W[pm]C[To defend your own corner you should rather play r6, as of now, black can easily invade playing r6]
;B[dd];W[gc]C[It seems somewhat pointless to attack black in that position with the only support coming from the weak stone on c13]
;B[dc];W[do]C[I wonder if it wouldn't have suited better to take the top right corner instead]
;B[pd];W[ne];B[pc];W[qd]C[that move was bad, as you can see from the following moves, black can fortify it's position and you lose the stone]
;B[qe];W[nd];B[rd];W[pe];B[qc];W[oe];B[li];W[pn];B[ph];W[pf]
;B[pi];W[qg];B[rj];W[rg]TR[ph][pi][pj][qj][rj]C[that wouldn't have been necessary, the marked group can certainly live without being connected to the corner and black cannot gain much territory down there]
;B[qi];W[sg]C[see move 38, you get nothing from this move];B[na]
;W[ob];B[oa];W[pb];B[nb];W[oc];B[qb];W[pa];B[nc];W[od];B[qa]
;W[cp]C[I doubt this one was necessary, black would have been unable to live in there anyways]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[dr];W[er];B[ds];W[es];B[cr];W[bq]C[b2 would have been the more obvious approach, but black has no chance anyways.]
;B[br];W[aq];B[ar];W[bs];B[cs];W[as]C[You need not do that, if black had taken your stone his group would still be dead, so just play somewhere else. Do not waste moves on removing dead groups from the board]
;B[gd];W[dn]C[That was far too small, most of what you get by this move you would have gotten anyways and black's move does deserve an answer (though black finished it badly)]
;B[hc];W[fc];B[db];W[ed];B[cd];W[ec];B[bd];W[de];B[ad];W[ee]
;B[da]C[This was somewhat stupid by black, he probably would have been able to capture the stone at g17, which would have been disastrous to you]
;W[dm]C[This too is useless, your group is safe anyways, whereas you still need a stone to capture the black group at o17]
;B[bl];W[bm];B[al]
(;W[am]C[This saves you one poins (see variation to move 83), yet you could have gotten far more if you had played somewhere else.]
;B[cl];W[dp]C[This was your territory anyways, do not play into it!]

(;W[jq]C[Why not play directly on j3? (see variation)];B[en]
;W[jr];B[js];W[kr];B[jo];W[lr];B[kp];W[mr]C[Do not run along on the second line, as you get too little territory, you can easily get back into the third or fourth line]
;B[kq]
(;W[mq];B[iq];W[mp]C[Do not just walk in single steps. if you leave a gap between two stones the still can be connected if they get attacked (see variation at move 107).]
;B[ir];W[np]C[T];B[ap];W[oo]C[Very good, ignore the black stone on a4, it won''t be able to make life.]
;B[dg];W[on]C[This is needless, black cannot attack you there, yet your stones in the top left corner are in danger]
;B[ch];W[no]C[Same as with move 116];B[cf];W[ce]C[You cannot save that stone nor can you really afford to try]
;B[bg];W[be]C[You cannot make life down there, so try to run into the center or try to live on the top, if that is possible]
;B[ae];W[bf];B[af];W[df]C[Due to black's mistake you get a Ko out of this situation, you cannot count on that]
;B[ef];W[cg];B[sd];W[rf]C[That doesn't do anything, black is alive there, rather try to get your stones out (play e13 for example]

;B[qh];W[oi];B[rh];W[oj];B[sh];W[ok];B[qd]
(;W[ol]TR[si][qk]C[Encircling that black group was somehow a bad idea, black can live in there, no matter what you do by playing at one of the marked places, whereas due to black's mistake in the last move you could have taken the top right corner, though one probably one cannot blame you for not having seen this]
;B[om];W[pl]C[No need to connect now, better play  n17];B[nm]
;W[nl];B[ri];W[mm]TR[ph][qh][rh][sh][rj][qj][qi][ri][pi][pj]
[so][sn][sm][sl][sk][rl][rm]MA[qk]C[You might now have taken the marked stones by playing r9, as black cannot form a second eye, yet if black plays r9 he lives]
;B[sj];W[nn]C[Black is dead there, so don't waste time removing the stones]
;B[lm];W[ml]C[You should try more agressively to prevent black from building a moyo, maybe m9 would have been better]

;C[When you finish a game you get the possibility to remove dead groups from the board, if you had done this you would have won (a4, c5, f3, k1, r2 and all stones attached to these were in fact dead). At the moment you should try not to waste moves to take dead stones from the board, as this can be done in the end (I call a group dead if you can always prevent it from forming two eyes, creating seki or joining a living group), also you should not waste moves on connecting solidly, if this is not necessary (I have often commented on that). Of course learning something about the opening or about certain shapes, in like the group in the top right corner would also do you very good.]
