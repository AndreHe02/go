C[krv: I'm playing black here.
Thank you for your time and attention

Hi my name is Floris Barthel and I am a shodan from the Netherlands. I have commented this game and I hope to answer your questions to their fullest extent. If you are for some reason not satisfied or still have questions please email me at floris.barthel@inter.nl.net]

C[krv: Is P9 better?

In fact, it is preferable for black to tenuki (play in another area). For example the point A is very big.]

(;B[em]C[krv: Is C6 good?

No, capture is best.
See variation.];W[cn];B[fn];W[cm];B[ip];W[eq];B[dh]C[krv: is D12 good point for invasion?

It's quite deep. White should be able to kill this stone.

Black is quite a bit behind as of right now, he will have to try something serious to win. But in my opinion, there aren't many serious things to do.]
