C[Thank you for reviewing my game.
I am playing white.  I lost by 0.5.
I can see a couple timing mistakes,
but not more more.  Lately I've been
focusing on the openning and timing.

--------------

Alex:

This was an interesting game to review.  There were some very complex fights where I think you had a chance to play more simply: I've made a few suggestions.

Your opening play tends to be "slow", that is, you make safe moves that don't put any pressure on your opponent.

I think timing, especially judging when to invade, is an important issue for you.  I hope that my comments there will be useful.]
;B[qd];W[dq];B[qq];W[cc];B[pi]TR[qd]LB[od:a][oc:b][nc:c]C[Alex: This is a very strange move!  It's the wrong direction from the marked stone: black should make a shimari at a, b, or c instead (or play in a different corner).]
;W[co]LB[od:a]C[Alex: This feels slow, because it gives black the opportunity to repair the strange shape on the right (R16-Q11).  You could take the initiative by playing at 'a' (or another point in that area).]
;B[oc]
(;W[fd]C[Alex: another slow move.  See how black and white have one side of the board each--but black is always going to be one move ahead in this sort of contest.  See variations for some other ideas.]

(;B[de]C[Alex: black missed an opportunity here.]
(;W[np]C[Alex: This is a good point for reducing black's moyo, but you should attack the marked stone first (see variation).  Play urgent points before big points!]
;B[pn]
(;W[kp];B[ed]
(;W[fc]C[Alex: it's better to try and keep your stones connected.]

(;B[di]C[Alex: again, a missed opportunity for black.];W[be]
;B[bf]
(;W[ce]C[Alex: this leaves a weakness at B16.];B[cf];W[jd];B[ld]
C[Alex: NOW is the time to think about invading or reducing black's moyo, or attacking.  It's hard to decide exactly which move is best, but see the variations to the next move for some ideas.]

(;W[cl]C[By now I already feel behind, but I'm not sure why.  Maybe I should not have exchanged the a19 corner for the tenukis, or maybe I should have made my openning more parallel to black's by playing d14 instead of f16.  I seem to have a habbit of inviting invasion, but I was trying to keep black from getting more unchallenged sides than he had alread as on the right.

------------

Alex: see comments after next move.];B[ef]TR[qd][oc][dq][co]
C[Alex: I think this is still a close game.  The only _secure_ territory are the two corners enclosed by the marked shimaris.  There is still a lot of potential for invasions in other areas.  Black's framework looks a bit larger, but white has sente (as well as komi!)]
;W[gf];B[bd]
(;W[cd];B[ae];W[bc]C[was this too small?  Would e17 been more appropriate, or would tenuki?

Alex: you can't tenuki, because of the weakness at E17.  Once you've played C16 you have little choice but to follow it up this way.]
;B[fp];W[hp]TR[kp][np]LB[hq:a][iq:b]C[Alex:  This is a good idea.  However, notice your three triangled stones all on the fourth line: this is a very thin position.  It would be better to play 'a' or 'b' instead.]
;B[ho]
(;W[go]C[Alex: this is an example of where you could play more simply.]
;B[gn];W[gp];B[fn]
(;W[io]C[Alex: but here you need to be more aggressive!];B[hn]
;W[nn]LB[ol:a]C[Alex: this sort of move only encourages the opponent to strengthen their position.  If black now replies at 'a', it becomes much harder for you to invade.  It would be better to invade right now.]
;B[fo];W[cj]C[Maybe these last two moves were at the heart of my bad timing.  It seems that you should push into the center as soon as possible, but first I probably should have invaded at r7?

Alex:  Yes!  Or r8 or r5.];B[ci];W[bj];B[bi]
(;W[ek];B[gk];W[lc]C[Alex: again, this helps to solidify black's framework.

Let's estimate the score before you play this move.

White: top 25 points, bottom left 22, bottom 18, komi 6.5,  total 71.5
Black: left side 8 points, right side approx 70, total 78

so if by invading you can make black's framework even 8 points smaller, then you should be able to win (unless black counterattacks and makes things complicated.  After all, go is never an easy game!)  On the other hand, if you settle the position as it is now, defend your territory and let black do the same, then it looks bad for you.

It's still not too late to invade!];B[md];W[mc];B[nm];W[om]
;B[on]
(;W[mm]C[Alex: see comment to move 56.];B[nl];W[mn];B[ml]
(;W[jm]TR[ml][nl][ld][md]C[Alex: Now that you have forced black to play the marked stones, it's almost impossible to successfully invade.

Your last few moves have enlarged your territory by about 5 points, so the game is very close, but now black is definitely a little bit ahead.]

On the other hand, I think there is an even better way to do this.  See variation.]
