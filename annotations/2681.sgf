DM[1];B[pp]C[Hi, this is Michaeljohn Clement, 1d.  I have reviewed for the white side.  If you are on KGS, I am "inimino" there if you have any questions, or email me at mj@mjclement.com.  Please have a look at the variations, there are quite a few.]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[oc];W[mc];B[md];W[ld];B[me]
(;W[pc]C[This move cannot be correct, see variation for a normal continuation.  Q17 strenthens b, weakens M16 stones, and does not solidly take the corner.  Whatever it is that you liked about this move, please reconsider it :)]
;B[od]
(;W[pf]C[i think would have been better at R14

Yes, this is quite bad shape.  W shape is very weak here.]
(;B[lc]C[Cut allows w to give up one stone and be strong outside.  This is thinking much too small, b should have attacked whole group.]
;W[kc];B[lb];W[kb];B[mb]C[Yes.  So you got a good result here on the left side of this shape.]
;W[ke];B[le];W[kd];B[qh]C[now your bad shape becomes obvious.  You *must* add a move here, unless you want b to tear your group into shreds.  But adding a move will not make you any more points, and helps b.  This is why Q14 is no good.  Actually this is why most overplays are bad, you have to add moves later.  Best is to play correctly the first time, but if not you still have to defend.  You cannot tenuki this.]
;W[cn]C[needed to protect

Yes. :)];B[qe];W[pe];B[pd];W[re];B[qc];W[rd]
(;B[pb]C[This is slack.]
(;W[rc]C[This is gote, b should tenuki.  W should play P13 or similar.]
;B[rb];W[qg];B[ph];W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[pg];W[fq];B[cl]
(;W[cq]C[try E6 -- the corner is nothing special.];B[cp];W[bp]
;B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[dq];B[fp];W[gq];B[gp];W[hp];B[ho]
(;W[ip]C[pretty sure double hane is better here for me

Yes, see variation.];B[io];W[jp];B[jo];W[lq];B[nq]C[At this point the game has developed a bit.  Now you should be able to see clearly why I say, P13 was better than S17.  B has a strong position in the lower right, and wall on the bottom right.  Furthermore, strong positions at Q12, N15 gives him good chances in the center.

However, b did tenuki at S11, so you have aji there.  You can also invade at around R6.  Best way to use the aji is by S10, you should play there immediately unless you prefer to invade.]

(;W[kg]C[I find this to be bad direction.  You can already come out at O14, so this area is not urgent.  And b will play around D14 anyway, so you will be reduced.  This does not greatly increase the territory you can make with your wall, and it is not a big reduction.  I prefer S10

Something around C14 maybe is a possibility, but see the variation.]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[lf];W[ig];B[cf]C[maybe d14 better          hard for me to read though and i dont know many variations on that move

Do you mean better for white instead of the next move, or better for black instead of this move?  For b, yes, I think D14 is probably better.  For w, no, D14 here is not so great, see variation.]

(;W[di]C[This was good move.];B[eg];W[dg]C[Remember: you are very weak here.  This is b's area of influence.  The wall at F4 is extremely strong on this whole part of the board.  You cannot attack at once, your stones are much too weak.  Better is to run out at F11.  This way you help compensate for b's wall, and you will not weaken your corner territory.  This move should be regarded as very bad.]
;B[df];W[ef];B[ee];W[ff];B[de]C[Now you have an impossible position.  You must defend D16 or it will die, and you must defend D13 or it becomes absurd.  This is why D13 is very bad.]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[fd]C[you chose to extend from D16, so you your F14 stones are almost dead.]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[he]C[now b has pushed into your possible territory, and you are trying to contain on both sides.  This is a hopeless battle for w.  You must avoid this kind of situation.  You cannot play a move like D13, for this reason.]

(;W[ie]C[This is a strange move.  See the variation for a more reasonable sequence.  However w still will get a bad result.]
