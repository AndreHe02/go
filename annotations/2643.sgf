AB[dd][dp][jj][pd][pp]C[Hello reviewer.
note: shoheiJ is dan


Firstly, I think you chose the wrong game to submit for review. You're playing against someone 21 stones stronger than you: Somone who could beat, in a 9 stone handicap game, a person who could beat you in a 9 stone handicap game.

I'm 4 kyu on IGS, and I could not win this game. And you were luck to get someone 14 stones stronger than yourself to do this review. 

I am not going to be able tell you how you could have won this game. If there was a good reason for submitting this game, and not an even game against someone of approximately the same strength as you, it would have been nice to know in advance, so that I didn't have to give you this lecture.

I should also point out that, since you did so well in this game, Black may not have been trying his hardest against you. He may have approached it as a teaching game.

So in my analysis, I'll try to point out your mistakes, both tactical and strategic, but I will not be pointing out any of Black's.]

;B[bb];W[cn];B[fp];W[dk];B[qn]C[k4 better?
r10?
K4 is too close to the lowere left strength, and being on the fourth line would make invasions too easy. R10 is not so valuable because the right side is open at the top. L3 would be my preference.]

Threaten to connect instead, then have eyes if he cuts you]

*shoheiJ*: Thank you for the game.
*shoheiJ*: nice game
*shoheiJ*: thank you very much
*shoheiJ*: No problem


k9 was probably needed.
Any comments would be appreciated, thank you

Throwing stones away is not good for either player: O3, O2, P16, C5.

Nor is giving away sente: B D18, W Q17-S17, B Q6 , B F8-F7, B R9-R7, B M7]
