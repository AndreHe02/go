AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, thanks for reviewing.  I'm white in this game.  It was the first game I had played in about a month, and I usually play worse in handicap games so I was expecting a tough match.

Hi,

My name is Peter.
I try to present my opinion of this game.
Please do not take it as the truth.
There are only some thought of me.
Perhaps they can clear your mind for the next game.

Yours,
Peter (go4fun on KGS)
PS: I prefix my comments with g4];W[pp]C[pub [14k\]: hi];B[dd]
;W[cf];B[gc];W[cn];B[gq];W[dj]C[g4: Good start];B[qn];W[ql]
C[g4: Good, since G3 is low the lower side is not so interesting.]
;B[on];W[np];B[pk];W[qk];B[pj];W[qj];B[pi];W[pm];B[pn];W[om]
C[g4: This is dangerous.];B[nn]C[This isn't the joseki , but I wanted to avoid the joseki that black wanted to keep him from getting comfortable.  Black should hane at r11 and force white to run, correct?

g4: R11 is big. But the black R6 group is weaker than the white R10 group. So white should be able to take some territory while attacking. And R11 is not so big as it might look as R17 is open.
Black might have tried O7 instead of the calm O6.];W[qh];B[ph]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[cq]C[g4: Greedy. You will end in gote. And black has really some bigger moves.]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[dq];W[bq]C[g4: Not joseki, but that does not matter really.]
;B[rp]C[g4: This too cowardice.
I would prefer N4 or];W[qq]C[bad exchange for black I thought.  gave up the 3-3 invasion and got almost nothing inreturn.]
;B[mq]C[wasn't sure what to do with this stone.  I decided to force it to run, while building influence so I could attack the p6 stones.

g4: This is very ambitious of black. I had preferred N4.];W[mo]
;B[mm]
(;W[jq]C[g4: Perhaps K4 or L4 look better.];B[lp];W[lo]C[g4: If you play this way, you should have played K3 higher. Now it has a hard time. Perhaps you could have tried L5 instead of M5.]
;B[kp];W[ko];B[jp]C[g4: Better to leave K3 unplayed.];W[ip]
;B[jo];W[km];B[iq]C[g4: I think moving out with N9 is more urgent for Black.]
;W[hq];B[ir]
(;W[hp]C[g4: Too cautious I think. This is locally the shape move, but I think you should try to split black into two. That seems possible.]
;B[hr];W[nk]C[g4: Good!];B[ll];W[kl];B[lk];W[kk];B[li]C[g4: This resiult is not very attractive for White. Blacks weak group is out into the center. Blacks lonely stone at the bottom secured some territory, and the black bottom group looks into the white influence.  At last, there is a moyo beginning to appear at the top.]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[nm];B[mn];W[nh]
(;B[pf]C[g4: R14 was possible.];W[gp];B[fq];W[rq]C[g4: Very small.]
;B[kn];W[ln];B[jn];W[lm];B[ml];W[jh]C[I totally missed the cut.  Things turned out okay though.

g4: These are cutting stones. Cutting stones are most valuable, if they help to keep a group weak. This is the case here.]
;B[nl];W[ol];B[ok];W[mi]C[g4: Adding stones to a dead group?]
;B[lh];W[nd]C[g4: Overambitious. The black groups are both secure. The cut at R11 is deadly.]

(;B[mf]C[g4: I would be tempted to play M16 instead. How will white live?]
;W[nf];B[mh];W[ng]C[Decided to give up the 3 stones and try and live at the top.]
;B[nj]C[g4: Very kind of black.];W[rd]C[g4: too far.];B[qi]
;W[ri];B[qf];W[rf];B[qm]C[g4: S15 or S13 would have been better.]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[jc]C[g4: Too far away. Can be cut.];B[me];W[ne]
;B[ld];W[mc];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[nb];B[kc]C[g4: Good by White. Difficult for Black now]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc]C[I was satisfied with the result.  I managed to live and black lost everything in the top right corner.]
;W[jd]C[g4: What do you do after P17 and then S18?]
(;B[jb]C[g4: White is lucky. Black should use his wall and cut through K14 or K10.]
;W[fc]C[I was thinking about doing 3-3 again, but went for something more severe.  Probably a mistake now that I think about it.

g4: Black is stronger here. So this will be a burdon.];B[fd]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[dc];B[hd]C[I'm not sure black needs to protect the cut.  Either way, I think he's a bit behind so he has no choice but to hane right?]
;W[cd];B[df];W[ce];B[eg];W[ch];B[gb]C[g4: The loosing move. With K10 Black will secure a large center.]
;W[fb]C[g4: Small! More urgent is L10.];B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[hm]
;B[hn];W[gn];B[ho];W[go];B[em]C[What's bigger, saving the stones or protecting the territory? Or is there a way to do both?

g4: In most cases it is bigger to protect the territory. But now you did add too much stones.]

I thought it was largest at the time.];B[ib];W[jf]C[g4: At last. This was the last big point. Black had several possibilities to kill some of your stones. But you managed to live everywhere. Good game.]
