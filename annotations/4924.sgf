C[Hi reviewer,



Naturally, my opponent and I would like to know where we went wrong, what else we could have done, etc. I was playing white. And at the end, if I forget...Thanks for reviewing this game!]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pp];B[ce];W[cg];B[ee];W[fc]LB[gc:B][fd:A]
C[EmTom: White should play A or jump further to B here. A idea is to jump to 4th line (notice that white is ahead of b here so if b push w will have nice 4th line teritory) B idea is to forget about this group as soon as possible. Standard extension creates base so white may do something with C13 if black allows it.]

(;B[bc]C[I was actually wondering whether it would've been better for black to attack W6 or jump out instead of playing at B17.]
;W[ic];B[cb];W[db]LB[cj:A]C[EmTom: I think this is too slow. W gets very little here so i think it would be better to tenuki... maybe play at A or just aproach black corner.]

(;B[eg]LB[ci:A]C[EmTom: Ok. Since blacks group is quite safe now, the proper way to attack single white stone is A or sth like that.  Any pincer will force white to jump to the center a and will allow black to build a wall facing hoshi stone at D4]
;W[di]C[Now I think a proper base would've been better.];B[qn]

(;B[qd];W[qi];B[bp]
(;W[bn]C[EmTom: I really dont like this move. Im not sure what was the idea behind it. Perhaps helping R11 a little bit would have been better]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[cj];W[dj];B[cl];W[bk];B[dl]
(;W[en]C[I thought connecting under would be a bit slow so I jumped out to keep black apart instead.]
;B[bi]C[EmTom:  I think this doesnt really work.];W[bh];B[bl]
C[EmTom: black cuts in sente. Its very good.];W[bj];B[fl]C[EmTom: Now it looks like white is under attack not black.]
;W[gn];B[hl];W[pl];B[ql];W[oj]C[These two moves were more or less to stop black's left group from running out to his position on line R. Maybe this was a bit too loose?

EmTom: So white still wants to attack? I would think about connecting my weak group first. Notice that you played this sequence in gote so you gave black another move to attack g6 group]

(;B[hq]C[EmTom: Too weak... Black should attack now i think...]
;W[ep];B[eq];W[in];B[ho];W[hn];B[jp];W[kp];B[jo]C[EmTom: Hmmm... It seems you should play from your weak group... This way you make white stronger so your H8 group is getting weaker.]
;W[il]
(;B[gj];W[fi];B[ko]C[EmTom: Dangerous. Leaving in the middle of fight.]
;W[lp];B[ik];W[km]C[I should have extended at K8. This move lost W56...I feel it was quite important.

EmTom: again its better to nobi here.];B[im];W[jn];B[jl]C[EmTom: good for black. Ponuki is a powerful shape]

EmTom: Yeah... making solid connection at A instead of n7.]

;B[lm];W[jk];B[il];W[ln];B[dm];W[dn];B[lm];W[do]LB[qm:A]C[EmTom: Not a good threat. Maybe A is better?]
;B[co];W[ln];B[kq];W[mo];B[lq];W[mp];B[cn]C[I hated losing those two stones. Did I have to lose them? >_<

EmTom: D5 forced C5 and black had sente after ko so... yes black could take them if he wanted to. (go back to the point where you could have connecter at B8 instead of jumping to E6 and think about it again ;))]
;W[ji]
(;B[mf];W[mh];B[lh];W[mg]
(;B[kf]C[EmTom: I dont get it... Black wants to give M12 group to W? This is not a good shape.]
;W[lg];B[jg];W[kg];B[jh];W[kh];B[bf];W[gi]C[At this point there were definitely better points on the board.

EmTom:  Hmm... White group has one eye if B plays C11. W needs to be careful]

White: 55 territories + 20 prisoners + 6.5 komi = 81.5 Black: 75 territories + 11 prisoners = 86 Result: B+4.5


Thx for reviewing the game. My opponent and I are both grateful!

EmTom: It was a nice game. Very close. Very hard also as there was a lot of fight. Hope you will find my review helpful If you have any questions Im available on KGS (EmTom). Good luck!]
