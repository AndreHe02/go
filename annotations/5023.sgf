C[[MAFU\]
Hello! I'm very happy that you like to review my game. I (5k) was playing black against a stronger player (1k). The game was rather even, but in the end i was able to attack and kill a huge group so i won. Still i feel like i did a lot of small and big mistakes in this game, so i'd be happy if you could point out them ;)

[kb\]: Hi, my name is Kyle Blocher, 1-dan from the United States.  I hope that I can help your game.

After reviewing, you played very well up to move 65, where you got jealous and helped White destroy your own moyo.  Before that, you played fairly solidly.  Two things to work on:

1) Play solidly and with good shape - it will pay off later.
2) Do not get jealous of your opponent's territory.

Your main weakness seems to be reading skill - work on that and you will be 1-2k soon.]
;B[qe];W[dp];B[oq]C[[MAFU\]
i like this opening for black, usually it will become fun

[kb\]: This is a good reason to play Go.

Concerning this opening, it might be good for White to approach your Black stone early in order to prevent Black R4 (and thus Black's advantage on Move 5).  sv]

(;W[dd];B[qp]C[[MAFU\]
i like this move because white has no good approach against r15

[kb\]: A fine opening for Black if you are comfortable with omoyo strategies - although it is dangerous to put all your eggs in one basket.  It does give good practice at killing or making your opponents live small in a framework, though - I liked to play this way to force myself to learn these techniques at your skill level as well.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[oc];B[nd];W[nc]C[[kb\]: This move is normally at N15 but it turns out to be good because of Black's weakness in shape.  You should most certainly extend in this position.]

(;B[pj]C[[MAFU\]
was this too early? in other words, is b n16 sente or gote? what happens if w does not answer n16?

[kb\]: White can live in gote, but Black becomes thick at top.  In my opinion it is still better to press - again, it is dangerous to make one huge potential territory and only have it wiped out later.

Because of White's next move and the variation shown here, N16 is revealed to be the vital point in this framework.  Pressing moves are good in these situations - you will get something one way or another.]
;W[md]C[[kb\]: Now Black's shape is compromised.  It is almost always bad to let your opponent hane at the head of two stones - especially when White has an extra stone at Q17.  Black's only reply here is O14, but then White has succeeded in flattening Black's moyo and his only source of points.  N16 is the vital point here.]
;B[me]C[[MAFU\]
is this a good move? i think o14 might be stronger for black

[kb\]: This leaves a big weakness in Black's shape as you find out later.]
;W[le];B[ld];W[mc];B[mf];W[pe]C[[MAFU\]
this was nice, i did not expect this move. black looks bad

[kb\]: Black can still cut - sv]
(;B[pf];W[pd]C[[kb\]: Black should fix up his shape now.

All of the variations I have worked through consistently show that N16 is the key point.  Learn to play solidly, and your shape will pay for itself later!]

(;B[ke]C[[MAFU\]
i thought that this move was big because the white area at the top is now neutral

... but i misread the ladder xD];W[of]C[[kb\]: Very big];B[pg]
;W[og]
(;B[oh];W[dj]C[[kb\]: Wrong, must be at M14.];B[lf]C[[MAFU\]
phew

[kb\]: The biggest point.  Black is lucky here]
(;W[jq]C[[MAFU\]
this move was looking big
i wanted to play there :(

[kb\]: K4, not K3, is better for both sides, as this game is being played on a large scale.]

(;B[cn]C[[MAFU\]
good spot for invasion?

[kb\]: I am not skilled enough to know the right move here, but maybe C14 is better, to try and use Black's new thickness on the top. sv]

(;W[fp]C[[kb\]: Black has it too easy];B[bp];W[cq];B[cl]C[[MAFU\]
here, b is overconcentrated but alive. is this result good for b?

[kb\]: Very good for Black];W[bk]C[[MAFU\]
how to answer this move?

[kb\]: In this position, your move is correct.];B[ck];W[cj]

(;B[fm]C[[kb\]: Block first, then play F7.];W[bl]C[[MAFU\]
but now i have no base :(];B[fk]C[[MAFU\]
so i made a new base :)

[kb\]: This is a flexible shape, but not as good as living in the previous variation.]
;W[gc]C[[kb\]: White40 tries to do too much - playing at E17 is much better.]
;B[cc]C[[MAFU\]
3-3 seemed the best way here
reducing is impossible from the outside i guess
because w is rather strong there

[kb\]: This is good timing.  Even with the mistakes in the top right, Black is still very much in this game.]
;W[dc]C[[kb\]: White should block in the direction where he can make territory.  It is unreasonable to kill here.]
;B[cd]
(;W[be]C[[MAFU\]
this looks like hamete. i dont know how to punish

(;W[bi]C[[MAFU\]
this is gote, so this result looks very nice for black

[kb\]: White 54 is unnecessary and only make a half-eye. At D11 is much better]

(;B[lq]LB[hq:A]C[[MAFU\]
this move prepared an invasion at A later
and it extended the b moyo
i guess w should to protect...

[kb\]: How about at L4 or M4? sv]
(;W[cm]C[[kb\]: Naturally at K5...];B[dm];W[bm];B[do];W[eo]
C[[kb\]: Must be at C4.];B[en]
(;W[fn]C[[MAFU\]
this move seems bad
it is gote
and b gets stronger

[kb\]: White must deal with the Black moyo or he will lose. sv]
;B[gn];W[fo]TR[fn]C[[kb\]: These moves only hurt White, not Black.]

(;B[hq]TR[fo][fp]SQ[if][hg][gi][in][jo][kp]C[[MAFU\]
i guess h3 is too deep, since these stones help white too much

[kb\]: H4 is much better.  Do not be jealous of your opponent's territory!  Sealing White in can seal the game...  Look at Black's potential in the middle!

This is probably the losing move... Black has been doing very well to gain roots on the side while minimizing damage to the moyo on the right, but this move ends up in a big loss for Black.]
;W[ho];B[ip];W[kp]C[[MAFU\]
L4 seems like a very good answer
b is in trouble now

[kb\]: sv]
(;B[lp]C[[MAFU\]
m4 is the wrong direction and a bad move, or?];W[ko]C[[MAFU\]

unusual spot

[kb\]: You are correct, White should start at S4, but his options are still limited.  There is some serious aji at the top right that White can aim to exploit]
;B[pm]C[[MAFU\]
is this answer good?

[kb\]: When attacking, stay as far away as possible, but close enough to prevent eyes and limit options.  The simple response  at R6 looks good, but this is playable.

You could also ignore White's move here and play a solid move like M7 or D12, causing White more trouble, although S4 looks good now for White if Black tenukis.]

f16 was bad i think, white could have punished me
do you see a good move for white here?

[kb\]: Yes, the game move is fine - White has one extra liberty on his F14 stones, allowing White just enough to protect everything.  How about G14?]
;W[fc]C[[kb\]: White is fine here, Black D18 hane is not as big as it was before.]
;B[gf];W[gl];B[fl];W[if]C[[kb\]: Overplay]
(;B[ge]C[[MAFU\]
this move prepared the cut

[kb\]: If J16 was your intention, then play your intention first.  White breaking in is bigger than the E14 stones, which are only points and do not help White at all. sv]

(;W[id];B[ee];W[ih]C[[kb\]: Okay, so now that your G15 stones are strong , how about cutting something?]

(;B[je];W[ie];B[jg];W[ig];B[ji];W[ng]TR[qf][ph]C[[MAFU\]
this was the natural move for w now
because of this weakness there was no good way to defend
so i tenukied

[kb\]: S14]
(;B[kb];W[nh]C[[kb\]: S14 still - now there is no territory in the middle.]

(;B[ni];W[ph]C[[MAFU\]
i misread this cut :(];B[oi];W[qh];B[rg]C[[MAFU\]
did black play the correct moves here? would there have been a way for life or for killing white?]
;W[rh]
(;B[re];W[sg];B[rf];W[qg];B[qf];W[rd];B[ri];W[se];B[qi];W[qd]
TB[le][em][dn][qo][ro]C[[kb\]: After W164, the game is close, and if White is four stones stronger then White will probably win by a couple of points.  However Black has played exceptionally well up to this point against a stronger player, so the game is probably still up for grabs.

Black still has an attack against White's stones at top but White can live small, then B2 is the biggest endgame move.

No more comments.];B[ne]C[[MAFU\]

i think my main mistakes in this game were:
- i left to many weaknesses for white to exploit, thats why i lost the q13 stones.
- ofc i should also have saved the L2 stones in sente.
- my h3 invasion was prolly just too deep.
- o15/p15 was plain stupid =)
