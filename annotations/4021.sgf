C[VincentV [12k\]: hello

VincentV [12k\]: Hi Reviewer-San ^^. Thank you very much for reviewing my game. If you notice anything i havent written a question about but it's still worth mentioning please write a comment to it :)
VincentV [12k\]: Please Review the black moves only

Hi Vincent. I hope this review is useful to you.];B[pd];W[pp]

(;B[fn]LB[dn:a]C[Here the standard joseki calls for E6, because it's relatively easy to cut by playing at "a". See one of the standard josekis in the variation.]
;W[fp];B[di];W[dm]C[On of the important fundamentals in go, is that you try to cut when it is possible, and try not to be cut when possible]

(;B[cp]C[VincentV [12k\]: i I wasn't quite sure with this move, it seemed a little shaky. Is the variation better? or is there anything tha would suit better?]
;W[dn]C[When you play the contact play at c4, it's usual to hane over the touched stone, in this case, playing d3. In the variations I show you some alternatives]

(;B[cq];W[dq];B[nq]C[VincentV [12k\]: To be honest i had no idea what joseki to play heere. Is there anything i can do to invade when w is strong on the left?

One proverb says "Play away from the force", so it's ok to play this far from the white wall.]
;W[kq]
(;B[qq]C[It's important to bear in mind, that when you enter into the corner, white will surely get an outer wall. When he already have a wall facing the posible new wall, it's important that you know that the game will surely turn to how you diminish the moyo. 
So an alternative is not to enter the corner, which is shown in the variation]

TR[cd][pd]C[A good point. It builds the famous low chinese fuseki (marked stones), and the D11 stone is working very well. But do not forget that when white plays P7, black generally answers it with R7...it is left as exercise to see why :-)]

It's better to preserve the corner, otherwise, you'll be left with a rootless group, that you'll have to look after in hostile territory]
;B[cr];W[co];B[eq];W[fq];B[es];W[fr];B[bo];W[bn];B[ap];W[qi]

(;B[ph]C[VincentV [12k\]: shoulder attack correct?

Depends on your strategy...because R11 is not threating any of your groups, maybe you could just invade the moyo]
;W[ql];B[kh]CR[qe]C[VincentV [12k\]: i was afraid that W might get too much influence in the center so that an invasion would become impossible, so i thought L12 would be alright to fix that although it leaves a weak point in the corner, wrong decision?

No, it's a good decision. And not also it diminishes white moyo, but makes yours bigger :-)]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[hg]C[Be careful in not finishing the josekis, because white can get profit from it]

It's difficult to say which spot is better, but the idea is ok]

You are not really threatening any white group, so maybe it's not a very good idea at this point...you could save it for the last moves in yose (endgame).

Yes. As a yose exercise, count how many points did you win/lose in this exchange. In Senseis Library, there is literature about yose and counting techniques]

VincentV [12k\]: the result of the game was W+6.5. I think the biggest mistakes were E5, E8 and Yose. Any suggestions or Advices on my way of playing?

You played well. I agree with you that you have to study more yose theory. Also, studying more joseki (not just memorizing), will help you make proper moves and enlarge your ideas in fuseki.
Goodbye,
