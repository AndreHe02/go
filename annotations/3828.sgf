C[Hello friendly helper.  I've been playing Go at my local club the last couple months, and this is my first game online.  Figured I might as well take advantage of the GTL.  I'm curious about my fuseki, which I never feel great about.

Also, as I havn't really played anything with rigid ranking (first AGA tournement this sunday!), I'm not really sure how to rank myself.  What would you say?

Thanks,
Nick.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[mq]C[I never feel great against this opening.  If I go inside at like Q5 I feel like I give too much up top.

[ndkrempel\] Q5 would be premature at this stage, N3 is the right direction (O17 equally possible, but not R14). Since you have equally good prospects, build your area first, then destroy your opponent's after if necessary.]
;B[po]C[[ndkrempel\] So far, the moves could have been played by a professional.]
;W[nc]C[[ndkrempel\] This is the first unusual move - seen on its own, the N3-Q5 exchange is good for black as it completes black's corner while only giving white a potentially weak group.
That's why this move is usually on the bottom edge around K3 to help the lone white stone and build some white territory there in compensation.]
;B[pf]C[But this is money for black.  Do I give up too much on the right?

[ndkrempel\] Don't be too jealous of your opponent's formations :) You have equally good prospects to build up, so you should concentrate on building before destroying.

In addition, this isn't 'cash in the bank' for black by any means - consider the invasions at R17, R12, R7 for example - black can't fix all of these in 1 move.]
;W[jd];B[cf]
(;W[fc]C[[ndkrempel\] F17 seems a little slow - because of the M17 invasion there isn't a lot of territory here. A pincer like C12 would be more active (see variation), or even B15.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[dj]C[[ndkrempel\] This extension is unusual - after black has strengthened white with B16 and removed the possibility of a 3-3 invasion, white's invasion at C12 becomes more serious and could be done immediately.]

(;W[cm]
(;B[fq]C[[ndkrempel\] This move should be closer to N3 to prevent it from forming a base.]
;W[eq]C[[ndkrempel\] Safer to play this at K3, otherwise black might ignore E3 and play K3 himself, fixing his mistake.]

(;B[fp]C[[ndkrempel\] This is bad for black, white gets to settle his weak stone while attacking.]
;W[jq]C[I *think* I liked that last sequence of moves, but I wish I could have extended another line, I feel like I'm inefficient with those two stones.  I also think I used it poorly.

[ndkrempel\] Extending one further would be risky, this result is already good.]
;B[iq]
(;W[jo]C[[ndkrempel\] Almost always, you should respond to a contact move like J3 with a hane or extension. K5 is a light move - useful when under attack, but here it is black that is weaker.]
;B[jr]C[[ndkrempel\] Black is able to settle easily now.];W[kq]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[ef];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb]C[[ndkrempel\] After this sequence, you should defend against M17 with O15 for example, as you have made the O17 stone 'heavy'.]
;W[or]C[[ndkrempel\] This move is a little aji keshi and should be saved for the endgame - your group isn't in danger.]
;B[pr];W[op]C[[ndkrempel\] Similarly for this one.];B[oq];W[np]
;B[pm];W[pi]C[is this a legit reduction?

[ndkrempel\] Yes, I think this is ok, but see following comments. R12 is also possible, or you can try starting with a probe at R15.]
;B[qi]C[[ndkrempel\] Here you must hane at R12 since Q12 leaves you behind in territory.]

(;W[ph];B[qh]C[[ndkrempel\] Q10 is a key point at the 'head of two stones', so you should play there first.]

C[I think I should have played B9 a *long* time ago];W[bm];B[bl]
;W[of]C[[ndkrempel\] Better not to play this at all if you're going to leave it to play E2.]
;B[oe];W[er];B[nf];W[me];B[og];W[oi]C[[ndkrempel\] This move is too small, black's group is already alive and very solid, so this is just a 6 point gote. Since you are behind in territory, consider attacking black's J3 group, for example with H3; or invading at D12.]
;B[fr];W[ge];B[bc];W[bb];B[cd];W[dc];B[ab];W[ba];B[gg]
(;W[if]C[[ndkrempel\] This seems a little too small - there's aji at Q4 you can exploit first (see variation).]
;B[ho]C[how do I go about reducing the f10 area?  what I did was Bad, Bad, Bad.

[ndkrempel\] Since you are behind, you can try playing directly at E11 as shown, but you must be careful not to let your N11 group become separated in the fight that might ensue. At the very least you can play F11 or G11.]

(;W[jm];B[lg];W[ih];B[gi];W[al]C[[ndkrempel\] Playing this now leaves the C7 stones short of liberties, unless you jump to E7 afterwards.]
;B[ak];W[am];B[bk]

(;W[kd]C[I was very tempted to cut with M14.  What I did was, again, Bad, Bad, Bad.

[ndkrempel\] M14 is definitely bad, the other cut is L14, leading to complicated variations - you probably can kill black's stone, but there is very bad aji!]
;B[md]C[[ndkrempel\] This is a good move by black - I don't think you can keep all of your top territory and save the two stones, so your response is ok.]
