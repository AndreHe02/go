AB[pd][dp]C[In general, you seem to have a good flair for many of the little nitty gritty moves in the midgame, however, the big moves towards the beginning and the fine details of the endgame strategy could be improved.  In this game, it was mainly the beginning that ruined the rest of the game.

If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.];W[pp]
C[racerx [17k?\]: hey
rmhenne [15k\]: hi];B[dc];W[ce];B[cj];W[ch];B[cm];W[cc];B[dd]
;W[cd];B[hc];W[qf];B[qc]C[You're right, this move could have been improved on.  In these situations either extend in the other direction (for example, O17) or play a more active move like R15 or R12.]
;W[qi];B[mc];W[fq];B[cq];W[iq];B[qn];W[qp];B[qk];W[mq]C[Even with those two corner mistakes, you are still winning at this point.]
;B[rj];W[ri];B[qj]C[This move is a bit too lax.  It doesn't threaten anything, and nothing was threatened if you hadn't done it.  Now white has the opportunity to attack.]
;W[on]C[White takes the opportunity.];B[pm]TR[lo][mo][no][oo]
[lp][mp][np][op]C[Here white is looking to make territory in the general area of the marked squares.  Your response is just letting white get that territory.]
;W[fo]C[White continues to make a huuuge lower side.];B[dn]
TR[mo][gp][ip][jp][lp]C[Instead of here, it would have been better to attack the large white moyo at the bottom, the marked squares are not bad places to start invasions.]
;W[om];B[ol];W[fm]C[White's territory at the bottom is now even more humongous.  Now the invasion schemes I illustrated earlier are too deep, and I would attack no deeper than line 6 unless I saw a clever trick to pull to make life or to connect out from deeper in.]
;B[ej];W[eh];B[ef];W[me];B[nd];W[ne];B[ke];W[ld];B[kd];W[lh]
;B[jg];W[ee];B[ed]C[was this overly defensive?

It probably was overly defensive.];W[de];B[fe];W[fd];B[fc];W[gd]
;B[gc];W[ge];B[ff]C[I wanted them to retain aji.

Better than that, you could have saved them, see next comment.]
;W[gf]
(;B[fi]C[You actually could have saved the 3 stones around F14 (and possibly killed the 4 white stones around G16) if you had played F13 instead here. See variations.]
;W[fg];B[nl];W[mn];B[hp]C[it was at this point I looked at the whole board and realized... I've lost! So I hoped to make something out of this.

As I said earlier, by this point the 4th line is too deep of an invasion unless you can see a trick you can pull.]

;W[jn];B[mi]C[this actually worked out for me. Could he have done better than he did in the following moves? What do you think of my approach?]
;W[mh];B[pi];W[ph];B[oi];W[oh];B[ni];W[li];B[nh];W[ng];B[lj]
;W[jk];B[km];W[jm];B[kj];W[jj];B[kk];W[gj];B[eq];W[db]C[I didn't see this coming... oops.]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[lc];B[kc];W[lb];B[mb];W[ia]C[killer! was this something I could have prevented or was it destined from much earlier?

If you had played M17 first, you could have prevented it.  However, it was being threatened for a long time now.]
;B[kb];W[ka];B[jb];W[ja];B[le];W[md];B[ib];W[ha];B[ga];W[cb]
;B[hb];W[la];B[ma]C[was this a stupid move? I felt that corner was being threatened.

Right, the simple move at O17 would have been much better.]
;W[nc]C[and it was!];B[nb];W[od];B[oc];W[pe];B[nd];W[oe];B[qd]
;W[nc];B[ob];W[re];B[rd];W[pb]C[this was really confusing.

This was really silly of white to even try to kill that.];B[qb]
;W[pa];B[qa];W[ie];B[id];W[hh];B[je]C[I felt I needed to be secure so I put this one down.]
;W[if];B[jf];W[jh];B[ig];W[hg];B[ih];W[ii];B[kh];W[kg];B[ki]
;W[mg];B[ji];W[ij];B[em]C[I didn't know what to do...

There isn't much you can do about the game at this point.  In general in endgames however, keep sente.  You have a bunch of lovely sente opportunities at B11 and S5, for example, which I am glad to see you took advantage of.  However, after playing those two moves, it is unecessary to play in either C11 or R5.  Instead, you are free to keep going and playing A12 or T4 immediately.]
