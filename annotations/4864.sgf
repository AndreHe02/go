;W[qq];B[rl];W[cf];B[dh]C[D12 seems to be too high. I'd rather play bC11. This makes a good extension for black and gives more pressure on the white stone. But D12 is certainly playable]
;W[ef];B[fd];W[bd];B[cc];W[bh]C[Black should answer with D11. Otherwise white could play B10 or even C11 and this consts a lot. And black doesn't look like that he is already living unconditionally.]

Some crucial points for black:
- the wrong joseki on the upper right caused almost the death of the right side
- black should have cut the groups in 2 pieces on the bottom side. Not only threaten to do this. Right corner would have be quite weak and to attack the right corner would have made black stronger and this would have caused to weaken the left too.
- Some bad shapes caused troubles. On the left side defending would have been easier with playing good shapes like a bamboo joint.
- On the right lower corner saving S2 caused troubles. Actually it couldn't have been saved anyway if white would have player correctly.

I hope I could help you with my review :-)
