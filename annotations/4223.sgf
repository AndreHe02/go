 iyaiya7716 5k : Hi!
ben: I felt compelled to submit this game because I had a hard time in the fuseki.  He played unusually and it threw me off.  I was unable to establish a smooth rythm and as a result I think  I ended up making a lot of artificial plays.  Once the middle game started I felt he was comfortably ahead.]

 onesickpup 5k : Hi
ben: I dont know why I played this.  It feels too artificial.

This is one of the favourite move of Master Go Seigen, so please don't call it "artificial", it is a little disrespectful to the Master :)

Look at it this way, C9 stone extends the influence of D16 stones, reduces the potential of the shimari, so it is a good move.

Another thing, A and B is miai, so C9 is in good position also.]
;B[jd]LB[qo:A]C[I would play A.

If opponent gives (a corner in this case), you must have the guts to take, this is my playing principle :)]
;W[pn]LB[qo:A]C[Again, this is Master Go Seigen's 21th Century Go :)

Here again, I would play A for black.];B[pi]C[ben: Im confused by blacks play.

Remember the komi is 6.5 points, you have to be more proactive.

Gentle play like this (K16 and Q11), I would not recommend...]

[pi]SQ[jd][lc]LB[nb:A][gc:B]C[Ben: Seems small to me.

Yes, small and gote as well.

Here, K16 is stronger as A and B are miai.

So you probably should aim to attack the Q11 group.]

White C15 look crude to me.];B[ef];W[de]C[ben: I wasn't sure if this peep was okay or not.  I don't know if there was a way for him to make aji in the e-17 area.

This peep is good move, it removes eye-shape for black.];B[cg]
;W[dh];B[eg];W[cn]LB[qf:A]C[ben: I wanted to just leave the group on c-14 alone now and get him to settle areas around the board so that I could attack later in more favorable circumstances.  He didn't seem to want to cooperate with that plan though.

C6 is huge as compared to black C7 here or you can also consider to play A.]

(;W[hf]C[ben: Maybe this is slack?

Yes, little pressure on both groups...];B[hc]C[Ben: He seems to be alive on the bottom for now.

This is correct, settle the weaker group first, E13 group can fend for itself later.]

S7 is slow, if black play A (or somewhere around), your center will be greatly reduced.

I shall end my review here, hope you enjoy my nagging :)];W[ik]
