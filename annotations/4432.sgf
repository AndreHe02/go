(;W[jc]C[This invasion failed. I was concious of a potential strong B wall forming H17-R16, wirth support from G15 and R12. Hence I wanted to break it up. L16 may have been better. However I now see that if i had kept my nerve then perhaps it was good after all..see variation after move 34

Invasions into three space extensions are very difficult to read out, and much depends on the surrounding position. With your stones at F17 and O17 you are fairly strong in the area, but note that you would have liked O17 to be at O18 right now. A stone at L16 however would have ended up lost outside a black wall. So I think you did the right thing.]

(;B[le]C[The variation is good for White..and would have decided the game..rest of play being the same

Given that black has his advantage back now, you must look for a way to stir up trouble and attack. Those three stones at the top aren't dead yet.]

N6 looks good. You could aim at N3 for instance. But your bottom group needs strengthening as well.]

It was a tight game from the beginning, very safe play from both sides, with little opportunity for attack, so it was a pity your invasion didn't work out. After that, you did a good job creating territory in the middle, but you handed B back the attack with 51. B let you off the hook however and handed you the bottom right corner. A tighter endgame might still have won you the game.]
