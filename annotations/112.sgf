C[Hello Rogerio,
     My name is Yimeng Huang and I am about 7k AGA (9k* on IGS).  So bear in mind that my comments and suggestions below are what I see at my level and may not be the "correct" answer.

    My comments will be more on your moves as White since you requested the review.

    Before you start reviewing the game, please turn on the "Show Next Move" option in your game viewer.  If you have already done so, you should see a letter A on Q4 as the first move.  I will refer to A as the next move below.

   My general impression of the game is that at the begining and several times during the game you have some real good situations going on but somehow you didn't fully take advantage of them and end up losing a lot of benifits.       My main advice for the game is "DO NOT PLAY TOO CLOSE."  Think carefully the direction to play.  Don't weaken your own group by chasing an enemy group.

[qk:C]TR[pd]C[When b has a stone at Q16, to prevent b to have a good potential on the right side, I often play a pincer at B or C.  w A is fine too.]
;W[nq];B[ph];W[cf];B[cd];W[ef];B[fd];W[dj]C[Both b and w get fairly good shape by the last couple of moves.  Fine.]
;B[dm]
(;TR[dm]SQ[dj][dp]C[Whenever I see a single enemy stone];W[pk]
C[b A is a normal move, putting pressure on w single stone.]
;B[on];W[oi];B[oh];W[nl];B[mn]TR[pd][ph][oh]MA[pl]C[w has invaded b's right side, but I think b is happy with the strong shape with the marked stones.
w good thinking to cut b stones, but normally  it's when w has a stone at X, it's more often a sure cut by w.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[po];B[ql];W[om];B[qk];W[pl];B[qj]C[b is out.  A is very good and urgent move for w to ensure connection.]
;W[nn]TR[mc][fq][cq][iq]C[b move at A is small.  should play bigger moves on the board.  I would consider the marked spots for possible the next b move.]
;B[no];W[oo]C[b A not bad, with relation to the two b stones.  But it gives w the convenient pincer.]
;B[kq];W[hq];B[mq];W[mo];B[mp];W[np];B[lo];W[ln]C[Looks like w is ready to play a ko.]
;B[mm];W[ko];B[lp];W[lm]
(;B[ml]TR[lm][ln][ko]SQ[dm]C[From here on, the next 20 some moves, w plays WAY TOO CLOSE.  I understand that; I  was playing like that not too long ago and was corrected by my "tutor" again and again.  w's play a A might be immature.  w wants to kill, but w marked stones are not strong.  It's impossible to kill the b group in the bottom.    Knowing what happened later, take a look at the board at this point.  If I were w, I would think about how to chase b and force b to live and get out in a narrow shape in the middle while i strengthen my marked stones to attack the single b stones at D7.  w could have great potential there.

Remember Go is not just about killing stones, it's more about gaining more territory on the board to win the game.]

C[w moves too close, pushing your own stones into a bad situation.]

;W[hp];B[mh];W[md];B[hr];W[gr];B[ir]LB[fp:B]C[w you see b is out, just let him, think of where you can play to protect your own points, such as C  maybe to protect the corner.  It's still pretty big.]

[hc][kc]C[good for b to protect the cut, but w didn't have to respond at A at all.  It's too small at this time.  The top and the right top corner are not decided yet.  Much bigger moves there.  w could consider the X positions to play.]

;W[de];B[cg];W[mi]TR[dj][dk][ck][dl][ek]LB[gj:B]C[w moves not good.  b will not let you cut him.  N11 doesn't gain anything for w.  the marked w stones have may have some weakness.  shoud make sure you kill the b group at E7. Play a stone at B for example.]
;B[nj];W[lh];B[gk]LB[lj:B][ei:C]C[good move for b.  with cutting point at B and maybe pushing out at C, b could use w's weakpoints to kill something or get out  (up)]

LB[ik:B]C[I'd be tempted to cut at B instead.  could be complecated here.]
;W[ii];B[ik]LB[ji:B]C[i would try to play w at B to avoid atari pushing moves.]

;B[tt]C[Again, w shold learn to attack at a distance.  w should always be on the look out for your group.  Be careful not to weaken your own group while chasing your opponent.  In other word, pay attention to the direction you want to push the situation toward.

Think big moves on the board early on in the game.  Delay the fighting a little bit more.

Hope this helps.  Enjoy the game!
