(;W[hc]C[Was this the right answer?

I think that something like k9 is better];B[gd];W[ld];B[le]
;W[gf]C[A bit to ambiigues? I tought, double chages connect to top corner and making connection to left hand side possible

j9 is an important point for the life of white corner and for keep separated black stones]

h10  is  more strong here];B[hd];W[id];B[jd];W[ic];B[kc];W[kd]
;B[je]LB[kb:a]
(;W[lc]C[Was L12 better?
yes];B[kb];W[gb];B[fb];W[jb];B[lb];W[ga]C[A double triangle. What does that mean

with g13 you die in gote...not good];B[ec];W[ee]C[d10 is better, e9 is weak here]
;B[db];W[fd]C[I exspected F11.]
(;B[ed]C[this is the right answer to white f10 because black keep out his stones]
;W[fe];B[fc];W[dd];B[cb];W[cd]C[Both C10 and C11 would create a empty triangle. And thats bad I learned. What was the correct answer? 

I think that an empty triangle here is not bad because you have to protect the cut in d9. you cannot play move like b11 or b10 in reason of this cut]
;B[bc];W[bd];B[jk];W[ei]C[Maybe this one was to simple. Not claiming enough territory. But I thought: I have to have some territory. The top corner I lost already.

the game is lost but try to give the best  you can: e5 is a good direction]
;B[gj];W[ge]C[Playing now, I think: stupid, you loose inittiative

yes this is little, better g6 , d3 , j7];B[fa]C[Is white already dead or can i do something about it?
useless move for black];W[hb];B[ia];W[cc]C[not usefull i think? Endgame pattern.
no, is sente]
(;B[bb];W[dk]C[Was this the best I could do?
maybe j7 is bigger];B[ej];W[dj]C[d5 better];B[fi];W[eh]C[f6! don't give up]

C[I played this one to try to get some more territory. Was another move better? And how should I continue?
nothing to do here...is too late, stone like k2 or j3 are usefull to make some aji or to gain the corner in some more wide situation]
;B[kl];W[kj];B[ll];W[jj];B[ik];W[ki];B[jh];W[kh];B[mi]C[Do I need to answer this one?

white is dead anyway];W[ij];B[hj];W[hk];B[hl];W[jl];B[il];W[lk]

(;W[ef]C[mistake c8 is your weak point...play it!];B[cf];W[bf]
;B[ae];W[bg]C[Correct ?
yes but you lose 8 stones];B[be];W[dg];B[cg];W[ch];B[ag];W[ah]
