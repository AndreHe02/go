C[I am particularly interested in the way i play the opening, but any comments are welcome. Also, I have several variations in the game file. The actual game was var 1.

And also, thanks in advance for doing the review.

Its rather hard to review a game for a person when the game was won, because the weaker aspects of the player's game were not brought out.  I will try to point out a few things that may help.  If you have any questions or have other game records you wish me to review, please feel to email me at my return address.

Post review comment- you played a nice solid game and won by a large margin.  Black failed to take advantage of some of the openings you provided.  Remember to solidify your corner stones more efficiently and don't leave them open to attack.  Also try not to crawl along during play and extend out a little more.  And lastly,  keep shape in mind when trying to pick a point to move.

Overall a good game for you. -Barry];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[ce];W[nq];B[qn];W[gq];B[cj]C[Black's move was pretty slack because it was not urgent and did nothing to make you respond.  Therefor black lost sente, giving you a nice opening.]
;W[cl];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd];W[nc]C[Not necessarily a bad move, just at the wrong time.  You should probably finish up with another mover in the top left to make you stones more secure.  If black attacks strongly, you could be left with two weak groups.]

;B[mc];W[dd]C[While it is good to fix the top left, you have left the top right open for black to take the coner and threaten  your stone at r14.]

(;B[de];W[cd];B[be];W[ql]TR[qi]CR[rb]C[I believe that this extension is too wide.  Black could have complicated your situation by playing as shown in the previous variation and then splitting your stones by moving at r11.

You situtation does't look especially promising right now because of the weak groups you have.]

(;B[pr]C[Not a good move by black because she allows herself to be sealed in the corner.  o4 would have been stronger, (see var.)]

;W[ip]C[Don't peep where you can cut.  This moves just allowed you opponent to connect.  Further, it wasn't a valid threat.  Black should have ignored the threatened cut and played at n2, thereby creating a base.  see var.]

;B[qe];W[mf]C[Black should probably attack at r13.  Take a look at the top right.  All three of your groups are subject to attack.  If black takes the initiative, you could have some problems.]

;B[sa];W[ra];B[sc];W[qp]C[Good job of picking up a big endgame play.  This was worth almost 30 points.    I don't have any more comments.  You played a good solid game and won easily.  During the beginning of the game though you had several weak spots that a stronger player would probably attacked.

In order to improve the quickest, I recommend that you study some life and death problems and take a look at some of the openings of games of stronger players or some pro games.  That will give you a better feel of how they solidify their stones very efficiently and quickly..... and then attack.   Keep on playing and have fun.
