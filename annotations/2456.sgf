(;B[cj];W[nc];B[kc]C[DW: b[L17\] is not recommended. It's rarely seen in pros' games.

( The comments below are quoted from Kogo's Joseki Dictionary )

The two-space low pincer, at best indicates a special strategy. 

The two-space low pincer is not as forceful as the one-space pincer, nor as relaxed as the three-space pincer, which is most often used as a dual purpose move to pincer and extend at the same time. Neither fish nor fowl, the two-space low pincer is less able to secure territory compared to the one-space pincer, if the selected variation comes to that, and perhaps more likely to later come under attack if White establishes a base for White [o17\].]
;W[pf];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qb];W[pe];B[nd]C[Seems like a bad result for me (black)

DW: It should be a joseki, but it just destroys your Chinese fuseki. That's why it turns bad to you.]

------------
DW: Not likely. The result is not bad for b.];W[gp]C[Is this a good move?  It seemed like it.

I didn't know how to deal with this moyo.  I thought black m3 would be loose, but now I think it would have been good.  What about n3?  q5 looks like good shape, but it seems to be begging for w moves at n3 and r7.  An invasion under all those fourth-line stones might make sense too, but  I wouldn't know where to begin.

-------------
DW: You know it's just a moyo, haven't turned to territory yet. there are many ways to invade in. See below. 

B[m3\] is a choice, too. It's better than [n3\], because it emphasizes w's weaknesses.]

;W[ec];B[db];W[cg];B[eb];W[fb]C[ I played 7 stones, I got 9 points, and I'm surrounded.  Not a good result, I think.

DW: hehe, I should say that you have stolen 9 points from w, in other words, you've gained 18 points. And don't forget w has responded to your moves, and the influence w built here is almost useless....]
;B[qn]LB[qg:A][qh:B]C[It seemed natural to split the difference since I didn't want r9 to get cut off, but I don't think I've ever seen a good player do this move.  q9, m3, n3, r5, s18, and b3 all seem possible.

--------------
DW: 
q9 -- guess you mean p9. yes, after b[p9\] b can even invade at 'a' or 'b'. But it's better to take s18 first.
m3 -- better than n3 imo. Very big, too.
r5 -- (compared with r6) less aji in the corner, an invasion point left on the side. 
s18 - Very big. As I've explained.
b3 - not as big as other choices I think. Not a sente either.

I will choose s18 or m3.];W[mq];B[bq];W[bp];B[ap];W[cr];B[ke]
