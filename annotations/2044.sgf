C[s: Hello.  I played this game on KGS against dennjirou (9k).  I'm interested in any moves you saw that were particularly good or bad.  I've noted where I think my main mistakes were.  I look forward to reading your comments.

Comments by Andre Bergholz (marked AB).];B[pd]C[samtregar [9k\]: have a good game
dennjirou [9k\]: hi];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ec];W[qf]
(;B[qi]C[AB: Somehow I feel that this move is questionable. If White goes to 3-3, you will need sente to get an extension from your wall. The variation shows a simple development, which is not bad for you.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe]
(;W[qe]C[s: I expected q14 here.  I felt lucky to be able to build a wall.

AB: Even with Q14 you will be able to build a wall (see variation). White's move is good.]
;B[pf];W[qh]
(;B[jd]LB[cn:A][jq:B]C[s: looking back, this looks bad.  Like trying to use influence to build territory.  Perhaps A or B were more urgent.

AB: Gigantic mistake :-)! I thought you wanted to build a wall. Well, you need to finish it! All the upcoming problems are related to you not finishing the wall at this point. K16, 'A', and 'B' are all important points but at this stage Q12 is the only move (see variation).]
;W[pg]C[AB: Only move. Game over :-). If you want to learn one thing from this game it is to never allow your opponent to play a point like Q13. Excellent shape, backed up by R14 amd R12, double hane easily possible. Easy way to increase White's influence on the right while reducing Black's at the top (your four stones turn from a wall into a problem). You must, must, must finish that wall!]
;B[nf]C[AB: Hane should be possible.];W[ng];B[og];W[oh];B[of]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[lg]C[AB: Take a second and look at the board now. The ten White stones in the upper right just look perfect. They make some points, are 100% alive and create enormous influence on the right. The eight Black stones make also some points but they have no potential for more and their shape is not good.]
;B[qn]C[AB: Good! Play away from White's strength.];W[lf]C[AB: As I said, the shape of the Black stones is not so great. It is painful that White can largely reduce the top in sente.]
;B[le];W[ke];B[kd];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]
(;W[je]C[AB: Tiny.];B[qp]C[s: maybe playing calmly at S4 would have been smarter.

AB: Maybe. It is true that strengthening a lonely White stone by touching it is generally not so good. However, due to the overwhelming White influence you need to strengthen your own stones, too, so maybe your move is not so bad,]
;W[ld]C[AB: White should not ignore your move.];B[me];W[id]
;B[lc];W[jc];B[kc]C[AB: Painful for Black. There are 16 Black stones up there, and how many points do they make? Less than 16 I suspect... And they are completely surrounded, so they do not participate in the game anymore.]
;W[ie]C[s: at this point I wan't very happy.  White has managed to totally enclose my wall!  Where did I go wrong?

AB: As I said, you needed to finish that wall. Most important lesson from this game. White's move here is big, but the lower right is bigger.]

(;B[ic]C[AB: You should leave the situation up there as it is. Capturing the stone here is endgame. The points you gain here you may very well lose afterwards in the upper left corner. You cannot save the whole edge for your self anyway. This was the perfect opportunity to finish off the lower right corner with Q3, which is MUCH bigger.]
;W[hc];B[jb];W[qq]C[AB: Too late now for Black :-(.];B[po];W[rp]

(;B[qo]TR[qn]C[AB: This move looks like the only move, but it is bad in fact. You create a very bad shape, the stone R6 now serves no purpose. You needed to create a ko with S5 or switch sides with P4.]
;W[op];B[ro];W[pi];B[qj]C[AB: Somehow I don't like this one. It is just one stone and way to close to White's thickness. Sure, you can save it but you give White easy and useful moves in sente. Maybe stabilizing the group by capturing S4 would have been better. In any case White will probably not spend another move to actually capture the R11 stone.]
;W[pj];B[pk];W[ok];B[pl];W[ol];B[oo]C[s: I realized what was planning to build a big center, so I thought I should head out there.  Looking back, this looks much too slow for so early in the game.

AB: Mmh, pushing from behind is generally a bad idea, since you give White easy fourth line territory. But in this case you needed to get out. Maybe P6 instead is a little better (doesn't force White to respond with a move O4 that he wants to play anyway).]
;W[np]
(;B[no]C[AB: No, not another push. Keima instead!];W[mo];B[mn]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[ko]C[AB: So Black got out, but at what price? You gave White now even fifth line territory, that can't be good. At this point the game is hopeless for Black, but I see that you won on the board at the end. How did that happen? We'll see...]
;B[dj]C[AB: Very good!];W[kn];B[cn]C[AB: Good!];W[dn]C[AB: Normally I'm not so fond of the attach joseki (here it eliminates the Black weakness around C8). But from the viewpoint of direction it works quite well here.]
;B[cm];W[co];B[hq]C[s: maybe should have been at j3?  this left me a little too close to the left corner.

AB: No, quite the opposite. You want to be far away from White's strength on the right. You chose a good point, if anything, one more to the left would also be possible.]
;W[jq];B[eq]C[AB: Ahh, not so good. It provokes White D3. Look at just this exchange in isolation: the addition of Black E3 and White D3. It is good for which side? Clearly for White. So you need to look for some other means (D2 or F3 or G6 come to my mind).]
;W[dq];B[ep]C[AB: Ah, no. Again bad technique. Obviously White will now hane on top of two stones and then your group is cramped again and White has some excellent shape. Hane at D2 instead.]
;W[eo]C[AB: Of course.];B[fo];W[fn]C[AB: Again White gets an excellent double hane.]
;B[go];W[dg]C[AB: Good move by White, because he makes intelligent use of his influence. D12 would be even more severe.]

(;B[ch]C[s: I don't think this was the right response.  I must have forgotten that I played D10 for influence against the center.  Instead, this move is looking for territory and it helps white build his center moyo.

AB: C11 would be better as it would make the Black group virtually alive. The bottom group is also still in danger (White G2, connecting to either D3 or K3, comes to my mind as a straightforward attack on the base).]
;W[fj]
(;B[ej]C[s: terrible move.  asking white to get stronger...

AB: Not so terrible. Connecting the whole side with C13 would be a bit better, though.]
;W[fh]C[AB: This is now clearly a mistake by White. This move is too loose. Black's hane at F9 will reduce White's center moyo significantly. F11 would have been much better.]
;B[fk]C[AB: Only move!];W[gj];B[gk];W[hj];B[hk];W[ik];B[gn]
C[AB: Very good sequence for Black.];W[ll]C[AB: Also an excellent point. Right on!]

(;B[hd]C[AB: Too direct. Try F14 instead for example. Breaks the ladder there and aims at the weakness between D13 and F12 (see variation).]
;W[gd];B[he];W[hf];B[hb];W[gc];B[gb];W[cg]C[AB: Very big. The game still seems unlosable for White to me.]
;B[dh];W[eg];B[fc];W[ge];B[fm];W[en];B[dm];W[em];B[el];W[do]
C[s: at this point I tried to read out a way to kill the corner, but it didn't work.  I think I missed the vital point.

AB: Not easy. If in doubt, start from the outside. That way you at least don't lose anything. The fundamentals: First reduce the space, then hit the vital point.]
;B[bp]C[s: maybe this should be at B3?

AB: I doubt that would work better. May be impossible to kill White.]
;W[bo];B[cr];W[dr];B[bq];W[ar];B[bn];W[ao];B[er];W[es];B[fs]
;W[ds];B[fr];W[br];B[cq];W[cs];B[an];W[aq];B[rq]C[AB: Big!]
;W[rr];B[sp];W[qr];B[bg]C[AB: Again you risk to lose in the corner what you gain here. Think about just descending to B12. It seems often you force your opponent to make good moves.]

;W[jl];B[im];W[om];B[nm];W[pm];B[qm];W[ri];B[rk];W[rj];B[qk]

;W[kq];B[kr];W[lr];B[ls];W[mr];B[ir];W[ms];B[ks]C[AB: Small. Try N8 instead.]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[hm];B[hn];W[jm];B[in];W[jn]C[AB: Small again.]
;B[ml]C[AB: Good.];W[mk];B[lm];W[km];B[nl];W[on];B[nn];W[nk]
;B[sj];W[rh];B[be]C[AB: Excellent.];W[af]C[AB: Not possible.]
;B[de];W[ee];B[cf];W[df];B[ce]C[AB: That was big.];W[eh];B[ei]
;W[fi];B[sr]C[AB: Big again. Your endgame is better than that of your opponent, which helped you to catch up. K2, B15, N8, and T2 were all big.]

[is][js]C[s: I lost by 5.5 points.  Thank you for reviewing my game!

AB: For a conclusion, I think your biggest problem is that your groups get forced into becoming unefficient clumps of stones. This happened on the upper side, the lower side, and a little on the right-hand side as well. On the upper side you needed to prevent this by finishing the wall. This game was the perfect example of why finishing the wall is more important than getting the extension. You also missed the opportunity to get complete control of the lower right corner, that was very big. In general, I suggest to work on technique (more flexible style, good shape). The saving of the one single stone near your opponents wall on the right was an example of unflexible, "hard" play. The book "Tesuji and Anti-suji" by Sakata comes to my mind. Sometimes you also force your opponent to make good moves (hane on the head of two stones, pushing from behind to give him big territory). Don't make the game too easy for your opponent! In the endgame, you did very well and found bigger points than your opponent. If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to contect me (Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com). Best wishes!]
