C[Game reviewed by Neil Mitchison
(2k; Varese, Italy), a.k.a.
Niall (6k* igs), on request
of Slawek Piela, who played black.
Slawek's questions are preceded
by "SP", Niall's comments by "NM".];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[cf];W[jd];B[mc]C[NM: I would prefer to support the
C14 stone by a play somewhere round
D10, but this is certainly possible.];W[cj];B[cc]C[NM: I would prefer C16, but again
this is playable.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec];W[fd];B[dn]C[NM: It makes me uneasy to leave
quite as much unresolved agi in the
TL - I would have played the B16
hane-and-connection before  playing tenuki.];W[fp];B[di]C[NM: Very agressive, but I suppose
if you're going to leave lots of
corner agi, this is the way to  exploit it! Still it looks a bit
of an overplay to me - but quite fun!];W[dj];B[ej]C[NM: Too many weaknesses - nobi at
E11 is better.];W[ei];B[eh];W[fi];B[ci];W[ek];B[mq]C[SP: Would 4th line be better here?

NM: No, looks just as good to me.
The 4th line improves your R side
moyo, but it's still pretty loose;
and the 3rd line comes nearer to
taking corner territory.
This is a good way to use the agi
of the ladder, but you're still
going to left with three weak
groups on the L, and it'll be
difficult to save them all.];W[fk];B[bj];W[bk];B[ck]C[NM: I think B11, which makes you
nearly alive on the side, and is
nearly sente, would have been
more solid.];W[dk];B[bl];W[cl];B[ak];W[bm];B[ck];W[cm];B[fh]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[bf];B[cg];W[bg];B[be];W[bd];B[ce]C[NM: We've now got into one of these
bitty hane-and-connection fights;
it's important to keep your
eye on the ball. It looks difficult
for B to make both his groups live.];W[bb];B[bc];W[ac];B[ae]
;W[ad]
(;B[gc]C[SP: would f17 have been better?
NM: I don't think so, it looks very
similar. See the variation.];W[fc];B[fb];W[gb];B[hb];W[eb];B[ga]
;W[db];B[gi];W[fj];B[he]C[NM: B does well to sacrifice the
corner, and ends up with a very  respectable result, despite W's
14 points in the corner.];W[pj];B[oi]C[NM: I don't like that - the shoulder
play is a limiting move not an
attacking one. I would play either
Q13 or Q7.];W[pm];B[qn]C[NM: R5 would be better, as giving you
and almost certain corner.];W[nl];B[ok]C[NM: Seems a bit pointless - what
are you trying to achieve with that
move? It doesn't look likely that  you can kill the group, and this
stone may end up as a present to W.
I would have played something solider
like Q11.];W[pk];B[pi]C[NM: Good!];W[ol];B[ql];W[pl];B[mj];W[qm]
;B[rn];W[rm];B[po]C[NM: ... which shows the original
difficulty with R6
(although still I would have
played R16 or N15).];W[no];B[np]C[NM: Comfoting, but it doesn't seem
strictly necessary; and now that
the W group is almost certainly
alive, you should be thinking about
territory (e.g. K4 or J3), or a
large-scale attack (e.g. M4). Or
switch to the top.];W[oo];B[jq]C[NM: Good, but I'd have gone
one further J3.];W[hq];B[cq]C[NM: Good!];W[cp];B[eq]C[NM: No, at this point you should
play the joseki to live (D2, which
after the excznge W B3, B B2, leaves
you B4 and F2 as miai to live).];W[ep];B[gq];W[fq];B[gp];W[gr]
;B[hp];W[fn]C[NM: Insufficient profit from your
corner invasion];B[qd]C[NM: Good, but you'll have to cope
with W activating the K16 stone.];W[ic];B[hc];W[kc];B[le];W[ie]

;B[kr];W[is];B[kp];W[ks];B[lr];W[nr];B[nq];W[nb]C[SP: at this point I felt I had this game won and needed only to defend. My game probably became too submissive ...

NM: Well, let's see:

B has 7 points in TR corner   (that jump is big!)
      30 points in TR
      27 points in BR
      14 points on L
and maybe potential for 10 more

W has 15 in TL
      40 in BL
      11 on R
and maybe potential for 6 more.
(This is all on the assumption
that B can do nothing in the
BL, which to be honest I'm not
sure of given perfect play ...)
Yes, I think B is ahead, by 12-16
points.];B[lc];W[kb];B[mb];W[ma];B[oc];W[pb];B[la];W[na];B[kd]
;W[jc];B[ka]C[SP: that was an oversight on my part];W[ib];B[ob]

;W[nd];B[ne];W[qa];B[ra];W[la];B[pa];W[ri];B[qi]C[SP: beginning of an and .... :)  what was the proper way to  handle this?

NM: nothing wrong so far.
Your play at the top was poor, but
didn't lose you a huge amount.
You're still ahead.];W[rj];B[rh];W[rg];B[qh]C[SP: t11 was safe , right?
I chickened out I think.

NM: Yes, when you're strong behind
you should answer S13 with T12.
The difference is considerable!];W[sh];B[qj];W[qk];B[qf];W[re]

;B[ef];W[df];B[dg];W[ki];B[li];W[nj];B[oj];W[nk];B[bn];W[bp]
C[SP: looks like I wasted potential  of this move later...

NM: This is the sort of place where
you have to count. The W incursion
in the TR has been very big, and
I reckon:
B has 22 in TL
      19 on R
      33 in BL
and little potential
W has 15 in TR
       9 on L
       2 at top
       3 in balance of prisoners
and if you let him away with
everything, he'll have        42 in BL
It looks to me as if you're still
narrowly ahead, so I think B6 is
fine.];B[am];W[cn];B[ap];W[aq];B[ao]C[NM: No, should be A6]

of points through damezumari on the
R side there - enough to lose you
the game.];B[sd];W[si];B[ck];W[hd];B[gd];W[bk];B[hs];W[gs];B[ck]

recovered very well from a difficult
position on the L. On the R you  attacked W's invasion gaining lots
of territory as a result. You went
into the endgame well ahead, but  made mistakes partly of failing to
block and partly of shortage of
liberties, which were enough in the
end to lose you the game narrowly.])
