C[Hello
I was playing white here (I dont know what my rank is).

I want to know:
 1. What mistakes I've made
 2. What good moves I've missed
 3. How good or bad was my development during the game
 4. What should I do to improve ;)

Thanks in advance.

JPL: Hi.  I'm about an 8kyu player.  I'll do my best to answer your questions.

I'll tell you up front, I can't really guess your rank from this game.  I would say you were evenly matched with your opponent.  You will also gain 5 or even 10 stones if you can apply the advice I have at the end of the game.  So just keep playing games and don't worry about your rank until it's at least 15kyu.  (And I would say from this game, that you're not 15 yet, but you might be 20 or thereabouts.)  You'll be 15 soon enough.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[de]C[JPL: Black's D15, by the way, is an over-aggressive move.  I doubt you'll find very many higher level games where someone opens on the 5-4 point.

But then, I could be wrong :-)];W[qp]C[JPL: Common opening moves are the ones you did -- the 4-4 and 4-3 points.]
;B[nd]C[JPL: Heavy move on Black's part.  Joseki suggests one of the remaining handicap points.  Something around K16 (or 17), Q/R 10 (or so), D10 (or so).  Or to invade to one of your corners.]
;W[op]C[JPL: Same comments for your response.];B[fq]C[JPL: There we go.  From here, you should study common joseki.]
;W[eq];B[fo]C[JPL: I think you should respond, probably with C6.]
;W[ic];B[dj];W[fp]C[JPL: The various moves in the lower left after F4 don't help you terribly well.]
;B[gp];W[ep]C[JPL: In the exchange of F4-G4-E4, black came out ahead.

Rather than F4, a move around C6 would have been better.  It strengthens your corner.  Instead, you forced black to make a stronger wall.]
;B[fr]C[JPL: Black still has pressure on your corner (it's still not yours) and has a nice wall for the lower side.]
;W[ec];B[dn];W[pj]C[JPL: I think your moves E17 and Q10 were good choices.]
;B[ql]C[I was thinking about O10, but decided that I must prevent black from development with K3]
;W[jq];B[ir];W[iq]C[JPL: Your stone at K3 is pretty far from P4.  J3 is a small move and doesn't gain you eye space.  It puts pressure on black, but that pressure is only useful if you either intend to kill black or can use it to limit black's territory.]
;B[hq];W[cd]C[JPL: C16 is a good move, but I'm not sure about the timing.  Protecting this very large gap in the lower right corner is important.  You have a lonely stone at Q10 that is easily cut off, and the stones at JK3 are also easily cut off.]
;B[mq]C[JPL: This is one of the places where you ask yourself if you like the trade.  You got C16 and he got N3.  Do you think that's a good trade?

C16 is a big move, but N3 is huge.  You didn't necessarily come out behind on this trade of moves, but I think the game is a lot messier for you now.]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[jr];W[kq]C[JPL: L3 is a heavy move.  Think about how much happier you would be if you had give up the stones at K3 and have won big along the right side.]
;B[kr];W[hp]C[JPL: H4 is a clear mistake.  You didn't read this.]
;B[ip];W[ko]C[xyn: and you?];B[jp];W[kp]C[*theONEz*: about 3 months ago]
;B[ho]C[JPL: In the end, you came out of this sorta okay.  Now the pressure is on R8, but black still has a lot of room to invade along the bottom.]
;W[jn]C[JPL: I think this is a very small move.  You have lots of choices that are far more powerful.

Instead of K6, this is a good chance to decide what your immediate goals are.  Here are some choices for goals you can pick:

1. Secure the lower left corner.
2. Secure the right side (there's a LOT of room for big territory here)
3. Limit black on the upper right side.  However, if you do this, you'll be giving up more opportunity on the right side, so decide carefully.
4. Limit black on the left side.
5. Protect the center.

K6 is a very very small move.  The only pressure it applies is very light pressure on R8.]
;B[oq]C[JPL: Blacks P3 was much bigger than your J6.];W[io]
C[JPL: Another small move.];B[in]C[JPL: Black's response is also small.  He doesn't really need to protect his stones and could have made significantly larger plays elsewhere.]
;W[jo];B[hp];W[lc]C[JPL: Okay, you decided to limit black on the upper side and extend yourself.  Not bad.]
;B[qi]C[JPL: But as I said earlier, doing so becomes a tradeoff on the right side.]
;W[qj];B[rj];W[oi];B[ol];W[pl]C[JPL: You were good through P11, but I think Q8 is just making a mess.

Imagine N10 instead.  It puts pressure on the black stones and really opens up the middle.]
;B[pk];W[pm];B[qk];W[ok];B[nk];W[oj];B[pg]C[JPL: Okay, now ask -- did you come out ahead?  You gained absolutely no territory.  Black gained a huge upper right corner.

The reason -- you played all your stones very very close together.  Black is far lighter.  His stone at Q13 is a huge move.]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[ce]C[JPL: Your stones on the right side aren't safe yet.  Black can very very easily take huge area on the right side by threatening your stones on the top.  C15 is premature.]
;B[dd];W[dc];B[cf];W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[ee];W[bf];B[bg];W[cg]
;B[ch];W[eh]C[JPL: I think you came out way ahead on that exchange.  Black got some power towards both sides, but you clearnly own the corner and have influence towards the center.  But this is a point where you need to decide what you want to do.

I really like moves in the area of n13 and H13 now.];B[ah];W[di]
C[JPL: Small move.  Forces black to make himself stronger while not really doing much for you.]
;B[ci];W[eg];B[gd];W[fd]C[JPL: G17!

Then use your stones at F13 to prevents a large black center.]
;B[fe];W[gc];B[hd];W[ff];B[ge];W[gg];B[hc];W[gb]C[JPL: Hmm.  Black has trouble here.  I'd have to play with it, but I think J18 is better than G18.]
;B[hb];W[ha]C[JPL: Definitely not.  Black didn't have anywhere to go, and you need to hem him in.  Definitely either J16 or J18 now.]
;B[ia];W[ga];B[ed];W[fc];B[ib];W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[hf];W[ig]
C[From now on I've tried to capture large black group (unsuccessfully)]
;B[if];W[jf];B[hg];W[hh];B[kb];W[kc];B[jb]
(;W[je]LB[ie:B][je:A]C[I think it was a mistake - what if I play at J15?

JPL: No, J15 isnt any better.  H15 is a false eye if black doesn't also take G14.

However, protecting your weaknesses in the cuts at G12 and J12 might be good.]
;B[gf];W[fg];B[ie];W[ka]C[JPL: You lost the fight.];B[lb];W[mb]
;B[la];W[le];B[nb];W[mc];B[nc];W[co];B[bn];W[cn];B[cm]
(;W[bp]LB[mf:B][bp:A]C[Maybe n14 would be better?

JPL: I don't like C6.  It doesn't make you any stronger, but gives black a reason to take C7, and you still need to make an extra play.  You got a moderate corner in the lower left, but you gave black a huge corner in the upper right.

So n14 would have been good rather than C6.];B[mf];W[im];B[cj]
;W[hn]C[JPL: Small moves.  How about G8 instead?];B[gn];W[gm]
;B[fm];W[en];B[em];W[eo];B[gl];W[do]C[JPL: Very small move.  However, F6 would have split black's groups.  Not that he needs to connect, but it's still nice when you can split someone.]
;B[dm];W[hm];B[hl];W[mi];B[jj];W[ik];B[ij];W[hk];B[ih];W[fk]
C[is my plan to cut at f8 is good enough, or there was better moves?

JPL: F9 isn't horrible.

Other choices....

M12 or L12
M8
R7
Q3, although that's probably not very big];B[gh];W[fl];B[hi]
C[I think that Black at k13 would be more destructive

JPL: Maybe.  But all his center stones were cut off.];W[jg]
C[K13 or M9?

JPL: I think your stones at the top were in danger.  Protecting them wasn't a bad plan.  M9 isn't bad though.]
;B[lk];W[lg];B[ei]C[JPL: Only bother saving the stone at D11 if you think you can apply pressure on black with it.  Otherwise there are bigger moves.]
;W[dh];B[fh];W[cf];B[fj];W[gj];B[ek];W[gi];B[fi];W[hj];B[el]
;W[gk]C[JPL: You made all those moves to save those stones.  In the meantime, black made all those moves to build walls.  Bad trade.]
;B[jk];W[il];B[jl];W[ng]C[I feel that there was a better move. But where?

JPL: I'll comment in a few moves.];B[nf];W[me];B[ne];W[lf];B[md]
C[JPL: Okay.  What have you gotten out of this exchange?  Black is stronger.  You've sort of connected your top center and right side stones.

Connecting those stones was good, but you gained no territory doing it.  You just formed life.

I think black came out of this exhange ahead. But in the next set of exchanges, you came out ahead.]
;W[ld];B[li];W[ll];B[kl];W[mk];B[ml];W[mj];B[lm];W[oh];B[og]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[rk];B[si];W[rl]C[JPL: That was a good exchange for you.  You sacrificed 2 stones but captured 3 and built strength you needed.]
;B[om];W[qm];B[nn];W[qh];B[qg];W[ph]C[JPL: I didn't like R12 and Q12.  Weak.  I think there's still more in the general area of P6 (although probably not P6 itself.  Maybe R5.]
;B[rg];W[lj];B[ki]C[JPL: You lose on the next set of exchanges.]
;W[kj];B[jh];W[kh]C[JPL: Tempting move, but you can connect with M12 instead.]
;B[lh];W[kg];B[mg];W[ke]C[JPL: Good that you read that.];B[nh]
;W[mh];B[ji];W[ni]C[How should I handle the in bottom right corner?

JPL: You took a different approach than I would have.   This is another chance to ask yourself if you played the biggest move on the board at O11.  I think R2 is MUCH larger.]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[pr];W[nq];B[pp];W[nr];B[oo]C[why not Black at o4?

JPL: Before P5, O4 is self-atari, and you get a free move to capture at O5.]

;B[no];W[ks];B[es]C[Black have too much space at top left corner. Is it possible to reduce it? I've tried to, but failed. Is it possible?

JPL: Certainly not now. When you built your right side (or tried to), you made the decision to let black have a big top corner.]

What should I learn, how could I improve?
I'm waiting for review ;)

JPL: I have some basic ideas.

First, learn some of the most common opening joseki.  Everyone always improves from that.  However, that's WORK.  Ug.

Next, learn to ask yourself at key points throughout the game, "what are my goals from this point?"  Stop and look around the board and decide --

-where can I gain territory?
-where do I need to push back at black to prevent large black territory?
-am I in danger somewhere?
-is black in danger somewhere?

Finally, when you're making a movie, also ask yourself, "Is this the biggest move on the board available to me?"

Some of these decisions require more confidence.  Lower level players need to make stronger moves (building stronger structure), but that also results in heavy, small moves.  If you try to play too light, always going for big, big moves, you'll leave all your structure open to attack.  So it's a balance.]
