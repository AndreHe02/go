C[Hello,

I'm not familiar with this fuseki, but I'll try to provide useful comments if I can.

I would strongly advise to use the 'reviews review' feature that is proposed by GTL, just to make sure I'm not inducing wrong concepts while I'm not totally mastering the taka-mokuhazushi fusekis.

However, the problem in this game was not the fuseki in itself, but how White managed into its consequences ...

There is not much to say about black's strategy.
Black mainly took fair advantage of White misjudgements, according to the very basic principles of Go ...]
;B[pd];W[de];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj]SQ[dc]C[Black might consider using the usual joseki and take corner points.
Q10 is consistent anyway.];W[hc]TR[gc]MA[be][cc][dc][ec]C[I checked in Gobase, and there is no joseki at H17, which is considered too far. G17 is the joseki move here.

Other josekis are indicated, but don't follow the same idea.]
;B[cj]
(;W[gq]C[This poses a problem :

Black is playing at C10 to prevent a white moyo.

Since there is no way that White can prevent Black from settling at either C13 or C7, there will be no moyo ...


Therefore, playing G3 as if you'd want to build a moyo is not efficient.

All the more, there is no pressure on the C10 stone.
You should at least pressure from one of the sides (The variations are from pro games)]
;B[fd]C[Considering that C10 can be left on its own, F16 is certainly a sound move.
Other possibility is K16];W[dc]C[ok];B[ff];W[fb]TR[dg]C[While this is rationale to connect, it is somewhat slow at this stage.

If Black separates, you can stabilise H17 with a play at L17.

If B threats from the other side, you can play F18

However, this move is not uncorrect, but just slow.
I'd play D13 and keep the pressure on both F14 and C10];B[dg]
C[good];W[cf]TR[nc][nq]C[this looks small and defensive in retrospect.

Yes.
There is no real threat on your group life, so I think you can aim for bigger plays.

One of the problem I see now is that black has started to build influence right where White had originally planned to do so ...

All the more, the left black stones work well with the sanrensei on the right ...

As a compensation, White has more secured territory];B[dn]
(;W[cp]C[I'd prefer C5 because of the later yose, or tenuki and play on the top, because a play at J15 / J15 is big for both]
;B[cn]MA[he][ie]C[No real need.];W[ej]TR[nc][nq]C[this might be too early.

The point is : what does this move achieve ?

- no territory claim
- no influence (within Black infuence ...)
- no real threat to black stone

I would not advise to try to break black influence without closer support, because the risk is that black chases this stone and gains too big strenght.
This is a typical 'jealous' move.

Before playing this kind of move, better ask yourself :
'can I play a move that construct more for me than I would destroy for my opponent with this E10 move ?'

I' play the biggest extensions];B[cg];W[bf]TR[dl][eh]C[Hmmm, falling into blacks plan ...
The corner is less valuable than an attack on your stone. I'd reinforce it as shown.]
;B[gj]C[natural.];W[dl];B[ek];W[dk];B[fk];W[dj];B[fm];W[ci]
;B[di];W[bi];B[id]C[black is being very consistent in its strategy]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[nc];B[ne]C[of course];W[pb]TR[qf]C[R14 is also possible, because O17 has H17 support to settle]
;B[ld]TR[qc]C[joseki is at the corner, but black follows his idea, which is correct]
;W[lb]SQ[hc]TR[qc]C[The corner is much bigger
M18 is of no use because it makes H17 superfluous];B[qc];W[qb]
C[no time for this !];B[qe]SQ[hp]CR[lb][nc][pb][qb]C[White is lucky that B answers
imagine a play at H4 and the follow ups

The result of the four stones invested is meager to say the least.
On the other hand, blacks compensation is excellent ...]
(;W[mh]C[it seemed that black's strategy of taking the middle was working out too well. but this looks like a random move.

Yes

The point is the same as with E10 : 

Does this stone achieve more in imparing black's strategy than you would gain by playing elsewhere ?

(see variation)];B[mj]C[Of course, Black is pushing you towards its strength.]
;W[kh];B[kj];W[ph];B[ih];W[ji];B[ik];W[qi];B[ni]
(;W[qj]C[The price is high.
around 25 to 30 points given to black in the middle.

See variation to see if living in the place is a strategy, but it would be big risk if B kills the whole group

However, there is still a game because the only sure territory for black is the center]
;B[pk]
(;W[qk]C[too slow.
R8];B[nh];W[fi];B[gh];W[ng];B[og];W[pg];B[rg];W[qf]
(;B[of]C[I have completed your variation];W[rf];B[re];W[sf]
;B[jq]
(;W[mp]C[Hmm, again, you are playing an isolated stone within a black framework.

You will end up small and reinforcing black (like your right group did)

Try to play from your groups. 
The most severe would be Q7. I don't think black can cut

You can even play R7

An other strategy is to devaluate the bottom for black (push black toward R9), but for this you must play low (O3) to stabilise quick.]
;B[nq]C[same idea : B is grabbing territory while pushing to the strenght]
;W[mq];B[jo];W[np];B[oq];W[mn];B[qn];W[on];B[ql]
(;W[ol]C[threateneing to cut 2 living groups ?
(but the shape is OK)];B[nk];W[nl];B[mm];W[nm]SQ[bg][ic][rl]
C[White :
30 points top
10 points right
15 points bottom left
+ komi

Black :
20 points right bottom
35 middle
Given the fact that black has sente, and white has one weak group (-10 points), odds are in favor of black.

Also, in the yose, black has absolute sente threats that will cost a couple of more points to white.
Plus some remaining points around K7

I'd be much surprised if W won this game.
Black made no big mistakes that White could take advantage of, but he played very consistently and very basically his strategy according to basics principles.

The basic problem of White is 'jealousy' :
throwing unsupported stones in the middle of black formation (E10, N12, N4) is not usually a rewarding strategy.

Hope this helped.
