C[Dear reviewer:
I played white in this game and I win 10.5 points with komi 5.5. I don't know my rank but my opponent is 16k.

I think my play have a lot of mistakes and I will like take your comments for improve. Normally I play with black and my feel with white is not very good.
Thank's for your time.                                                          Overall this is a good game for white. You get ahead early in the game and you hold your advantage nicely. However I suspect that at some stages you answer blacks moves to much. It is important to evaluate the status of your groups and attempt to determine what blacks strategy is likely to be. It bacame obvious early on that black must make a big bit of territory in the middle to stand any chance in the game. What has various opportunites to frustrate this but does not take all of these moves.   At move 56 perhaps white would be best to play at b or c. This would limit blacks development. A move at d would be very territorial and big (easier to make territory in the corner!)]

C[Interesting. Shows some nice thinking.];B[dc];W[dd];B[cd]
;W[ec];B[qf];W[nc]C[This extention feels a little tight to me. Particularly in light of the white group in the top left hand corner. It might be better to play on the forth line.]
;B[rd];W[qi];B[qc];W[qd];B[rc];W[pc]C[I don't think this exchange in the corner helps white very much. Might be better to extend up the top side. While looks over concentrated.]
;B[oi];W[ql]C[Good.];B[cc];W[jd]C[Nice but a play here directly after black plays at R17 would have been more timely.]
;B[ol];W[qp]C[This is a little risky but shows fighting spirit. Black should seperate white into two groups but instead allows his stones to be captured leaving white in a good position.]

[go:b][gp:c][dq:a]C[I think this is a good time for white to stop and think. He seems to be ahead with territory and all his groups seem quite solid. Moves at H13, G5 or G4 would seem wiser than the move next played.

G4 (c) is particularly interesting (see variation)]

Yes but not enough to affect the result. Important to note that white can play at E14 in sente earlier.  Threatens to take two stones.]
