AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, I'm Hannes and I will mark my comments with "H". The review is for black (Tarol) but I will  comment on white moves as well, if necessary.

I will summarize my hints for black at the end of the game.

Let's go on, then...

(P.S.: I think, it is good style, to let the opponent take back moves that were obviously mistakes.  This makes the game simply more interesting. Well done, here :-)]
;W[qn]
(;B[pn]LB[qg:B][qj:D][qk:C][pn:A][nq:E]C[H: The first "rule" to mention here is that contact-moves usually make the opponent's stones stronger.
So they should not be used for attack.

A second remark is, that it is very uncommon to start direct attacking after the first few moves. But if this is black's favourite way to play, so be it.

Usually, black would play at B instead (to make white extend to C or D (see the variation), or at extending his lower right corner at E]
;W[ql];B[pl];W[qp]LB[pl:D][ql:A][pn:E][qn:B][pp:F][qp:C]C[H: this result is excellent for black. White get's very little territory and black has a huge wall facing the center.

Remember, that there are two concepts that drive the game of Go: Territory and Power.

Comparing A,B,C to D, E, F in these terms shows, that white's stones have some small territorial value (10 points), but no power, as they face the near edge of the board. The black stones D,E,F have no territory, but immense power in direction to the center. Which should result in much more territory later in the game.

But: one should *not* expect white to play like this, as it is generally bad to run on the third line.]
;B[qo]LB[po:B][ro:A]TR[fc][jc][nc][cf][qf][cj][cn][fq]C[H: This is not a good move, as black looses sente (which means that up to now, white had to answer black's moves. But after the sequence of white A, black B, it is white who takes the lead and black who has to answer whites moves).

If black is afraid of white interrupting his loose line of stones, B would have served the same purpose and would have been a much better connection.

But black does not have to play in this region at all. He would usually play an extension on one of the corners, or right between the corners.]
;W[ro];B[po];W[qq];B[qm];W[rn]LB[qm:A][pq:B]C[H: A should be on B. Watch the sequence of the next 4 moves. My comments follow on move #15.]
;B[rm];W[sm];B[rl];W[sp]LB[qm:A][pq:B]C[H: This sequence (in which black plays all the right moves) shows, that white can not prevent being cut off at the top. Knowing that, he could have answered A by bending around at B, which would have given him more points in the corner.]
;B[sl];W[sn];B[qk];W[pq]LB[qk:A][pq:B]TR[fc][jc][nc][cf][pf]
[cj][cn][fq]C[H: By playing A, black makes one point (capture of the white stone) but this stone was useless for white, so black looses one move here. 
He should have played B himself, or one of the possibilities I mentioned before]
;B[oq];W[pr];B[or];W[os];B[ns];W[ps];B[nr];W[ij]C[H: Making territory is most easy in the corner, more difficult is the edge, and starting in the center might well never result in territory at all. Bad move.]
;B[qg]LB[qg:A]TR[qa][ra][sa][qb][rb][sb][qc][rc][sc][qd][rd]
[sd][qe][re][se][qf][rf][sf][rg][sg][rh][sh][ri][si][rj][sj]
[rk][sk]C[H: Black's idea is good, and A makes the marked territory quite secure.

The only objection might be, that other moves, which extend the corner stones, might be more valuable.

Note that white will rarely invade at A himself, as he would have no means to settle himself there.

But A is alright.];W[op]C[H: this is not a good cut, as the variation shows]

(;B[oo]LB[nr:A]TR[np]C[H: This is the wrong side to attack the white stone, as it pushes white against the weak black A-group.]
;W[np];B[mr]LB[lr:B][mr:A]C[H: The general idea is good: to make liberties. But it is slower than B, which would have been better.]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[kq];W[mq];B[lr]LB[lr:A]C[H: It is not necessary to play A. White can not cut successfully.]
;W[ko];B[jp];W[km];B[jo];W[kn];B[jn];W[jm]C[H: Let's have a look at the whole board. White has few points in the lower right corner, black quite a lot on the upper right corner and a massive wall on the lower side.

If white does not get some larg territory now, he will loose.  If black secures his corners, there's neary nothing, white can do.

The white stones in the center have no territory at all but some power to the right (which is not very useful as black is strong there, too) and towards the upper edge.]
;B[qi]C[H: This move is not necessary, as white will not invade here.]
;W[hl];B[hn];W[in]LB[hl:B][hn:A][in:C]C[H: Black A was exactly the right answer to white B. It stays away from direct contact and makes black's moyo (potential territory) on the lower side really huge.

White C is a mistake.];B[im];W[il];B[io]LB[hm:A][gn:B]C[H: Again, it is not necessary, to capture the white stone, as it was all alone within black's territory. Playing A or B would have been better]
;W[hm]
(;B[gn];W[ml])
(;B[in];W[ml]LB[mn:A]TR[fc][nc][cf][jk][kk][lk][jl][kl][ll]
[lm][mm][dn][ln][lo][mo]TW[so][rp][rq][sq][qr][rr][sr][qs][rs]
[ss]C[H: Up to now, the white group in the center had no territory at all, so white tries to get some either right from his group, or above it.

If black wants to respond, he could play A to destroy white's approach, but as white gets just around 10 points, all the old corner extensions would be much better choices.]
;B[nl]C[H: The following sequence is a good example for making your opponent stronger by playing contact-moves]
;W[nn];B[om];W[nm];B[nk];W[no];B[mk];W[on];B[pm];W[ll]TR[qa]

[iq][jq][er][fr][gr][hr][ir][jr][kr][es][fs][gs][hs][is][js]
[ks][ls][ms]C[H: White's groups is alive and might be a base for attacking.

Nevertheless, Black leads by far, if you have a look at his moyos.]
;B[mh]C[H: Very good move, extending the moyo.];W[kj];B[lj]
C[H: unnecessary contact again];W[lk];B[li];W[ki];B[kh];W[jh]
;B[lg]LB[kg:A]C[H: Mistake. should have been A];W[kg];B[lh]
;W[jg];B[lf];W[en];B[eo]LB[eo:B][fo:A]C[H: A would have been better (and no direct contact). But B is good enough to prevent a white invasion.]
;W[gn];B[go];W[fo];B[fp];W[fn];B[gp];W[do];B[ep];W[co];B[cp]
;W[fg]TR[jg][jh][ij][hl][hm][en][fn][gn][co][do]C[H: Looking on Power vs. Territory again, black leads wihtout question in terms of territory, but white has established a very large wall, that gives him overwhelming power on the left side of the board. 

Black should try to reduce this power, see the variation.1]

(;B[ef]LB[fc:D][fd:E][cf:C][dg:B][ci:A]C[H: I'm not sure, what black had in mind playing this move. If it aimed at stopping white building his moyo, A or B would have been better. 

If black aimed at extending his corner-territory, C, D and E would have been good choices (C being a moyo-reducing move as well).]
;W[dj]LB[dh:A]C[H: Quite good move, could even have been on A, which would have made the moyo bigger.]
;B[ff];W[hf]
(;B[eg]C[H:  The following moves serve their purpose of not letting white invade the corner from below, but black's moves are unnecessarily slow.

See the variation for a series of light non-contact moves that serve the same purpose (and result in slightly more territory for black)]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[ei];B[dh];W[di];B[ch]LB[ci:A]C[H: Minor mistake. A would have been better.]
;W[ci];B[bi];W[bj];B[ai];W[aj];B[bh];W[id];B[ld]LB[kd:A]C[H: Good response, black could even play A (a few  more points)]
;W[kd];B[kf]LB[gd:A]C[H: A would have been more valuable.];W[jf]
;B[ke];W[jd];B[je];W[ie];B[lc];W[kc];B[kb]LB[kb:A][gc:C][gd:B]
C[H: The move at A is an endgame move, which makes black loose sente (the lead). Playing B or C is more important.]

[is][js][ks][ls][ms]C[H: As a short summary, I would say, that black made fair use of his handicap stones. It is just the white group in the middle, which could have been much smaller, if black would have been more eager to attack it.

Here is, what black should keep in mind in the future:

1) The weaker you are, the more you should stick to "Corner first, then the edges, then the center", avoiding early fights.

2) Be careful about whether you have to respond to an opponent's move. This is sometimes really difficult, if you are right within a fight, but you might find that you are fighting for five or ten points, while a move at some different part of the board would be much more valuable.
A good example are the two black capturing moves, that were not necessary and made black simply loose two possibilities to extend or attack.

3) Contact moves make the defender stronger. Dont't attack with them.
4)  Make your weak groups stronger, not the ones that are already strong.
5) The reason to avoid weak groups is, that even if they cannot be killed, your opponent can build territory while attacking you.

6) A much more advanced hint: It is very difficult, to deal with the concept of power, as territory is much more easy to evaluate, and as powerful formations (like walls) result in points not near, but somewhere else on the board.

But if you find yourself being confronted with a powerful shape like a wall, try to reduce it's influence.



Keep playing!

(;B[cj]LB[cg:A][cm:B]C[H: How about playing here, followed by an extension to A or B, depending on whites attack?

This would (with probably some fighting involved) settle black on the left, reducing whites power (and his moyo) a lot.]
)))
(;B[np];W[oo];B[no];W[on];B[pm];W[nn];B[mn];W[nl]C[H: This situation is great for black, as he can build up his territory on the upper right and on the lower center while white tries to run for life.]
;B[ok];W[nk];B[nj];W[lk];B[km]C[H: So white will most probably live, but without any points, while black's position looks overwhelming. White might as well resign.]
))
(;B[qg]LB[qj:A]C[H. this move threatens the extension to A, which would leave white without a solid base. So white will have to prevent that]
