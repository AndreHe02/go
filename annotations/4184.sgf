C[hello dear reviewer,

thanks for your effort,
i have played white, 0,5 komi, I have lost with 0,5
I am 11/12k at KGS

 I often dont know how to play (see game comments).  I have  tried to hold the opponent under pressure. Thereby however too little area made by me.  What do I have to mainly to become around 6k ?  I hang on 11k.
More comments in game.
Sorry for the terrible english.
All comments are in german also.

Greetings Bernhard (Philosoph auf KGS)

Hello Bernhard,

My German is much worse than your English so I will reply in English :-)]

;B[nq];W[dq]C[This move could be called aji keshi.  It is best to leave this, perhaps you might play this a ko threat later.  This move is sente, but just because something is sente does not mean you should play it.  Certainly black would not play here any time soon, so there is no need to play here as white.  Next time, just skip this move and play whatever you would play after it instead.]
;B[dr];W[bp]C[is this too lokal? better around d10?

--

Yes, this is a bit small, around D10 would be better.];B[bq]
;W[bo]C[B5 is gote, so you should leave it and play a bigger move.]
;B[di];W[aq];B[ec];W[br];B[cr]
(;W[gq]C[I have thougth that the black group is dead
did i better play c9?

--

I do not see a way to kill the black group.  However, you can press instead and get some benefit from it.  However, you played B5 and A3 already here and black ignored both.  So you added two extra stones locally.  The benefit of E17 and D11 to black is better than the benefit of this attack for w, so it is best not to play those previous moves.  But since you have played them, see the variation for another way to put pressure on black bottom group.]

;B[ip];W[dg]C[wrong side? c9?

--

I think this is OK.  If you attack from the other side, you will be weakening C16.  This move seems to be a better idea, and puts the strong shape around D5 to good use.]
;B[dl];W[ek]C[i feel, that this stone is total wrong here. better d9? or where?

--

D9 is interesting, although perhaps attacking this group right at this moment is not so urgent.  Something along the top around G17 would seem better to me.]
;B[dk];W[el];B[ej];W[ch]C[is it better to play e7?

--

I do not like E7, it feels slow.  However, something around G9 might be not bad.  I do not think this move is bad though.  If anything, this group is more important than the two stones at E8.]
;B[em];W[fm]C[I would also prefer G9 here.];B[en];W[dm]C[This cut I think is not so good.  If the two black stones cannot be captured, this is premature and creates difficulties for white.]
;B[fn]
(;W[gl]C[This move feels wrong and I think w got too little out of this fight.  G9 feels better, however, the group around D5 still does not have eyes so the position is uncomfortable for white.]

Unfortunately the group on the bottom does seem to need a move.  C7 works, I think B8 is slightly better in terms of points.]

either on the left - pressing the b stones (k17/h16) on the wall or get a part of the edge arund q17? but how?

get the corner on the right bottom? q2?
or help the group in the middle (L11) to go to the side
or make an attack with k3 and m4 on the edge around o3?

--

I think this move pushes the black group against the white weak group, so it is not a good idea.  Black is very thick on the bottom, so it is not good to push in this direction.  K3 I think is not so good also for this reason.  Q2 is not a bad idea but I think the center group is the more important thing.  I think I would try to threaten the black group instead, while strengthening your center group, and then play in the lower right corner when possible.  Also, although it is very unpleasant to play, the lower left group still needs a move.]

;B[lp]C[when have i lost the change to go to this nice point?

--

Well b got this which is big, but you got a lot on the right side.  If you secure your points there now with a move around R9, it is not a bad result for white.]

(;W[lo]C[now i was again not sure what is the best move?
r2?
r9?
or r18? can i get a pice of the corner on the to right?
or better close the gap at c8/9?

--

I would play H5 at this time.  This way the left corner group is finally alive, and black may answer this move because he has just made territory there.  After that, I think R9 is biggest, bigger than R2 or R18]

ones more, many thanks to the reviewer
Greeting Bernhard/Philosoph (KGS)

**************************************

im endspiel könnte ich doch sicher mehr punkte herausholen, oder?

dem Reviewer nochmals danke.
Gruß Bernhard/Philosoph (KGS)

You did lose a few points in the endgame, such as missing P7 which would win the game for white, and of course the mistakes at the top side and top left.  However, I think the biggest problems in your game were in the fighting in the center and the early part of the game.  The moves at B5, A3, B2 were too small and cost you a lot for the entire first 100 moves of the game.
