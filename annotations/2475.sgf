C[Hi. I'mHervé Menge aka Hyoga, and I will note my comments liek this :



H : This was a very close game since between two 22k on IGS. There weren't many fights but it was interestiong to play. I played with black.


Kyo: Hello ! I am Sébastien aka Kyoshinai, 11k on KGS.

Kyo: I will do my best commenting your game. I added a few variations, and sometimes added some comments regarding White's play.

Kyo: Since I am a mere 11k, do not take my comments blindly, but try to analyse them, and see what lies behind. Therefore you may find mystakes from me or better moves.

Kyo: Please feel free to add any comments or question that is left.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[pd];W[dd]
(;B[dj]C[Kyo: This move is a bit timid, since it does not threaten any White position, nor makes territory. Black has sente, so he should try a kakari (attack of the corner) around  C14 for exemple. A common sequence is C14 F17 D10]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[kc];B[pj];W[fq];B[dn];W[iq];B[qn];W[pn];B[pm]
;W[on];B[qo];W[qp];B[po]C[H : this sure isn't standard. I should play tenuki here

Kyo: Right. Q5 is a  "thank-you move", since after White P5 - which gives him a strong influence towards the left.]
;W[oo]C[H : white is very strong now.

Kyo: Moreover, Black can't hope to cut as long as he has not covered his weakness at R7 (see var.)]

(;B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[ef]
(;B[bd]C[Kyo: You could have gone on with the standard joseki (C15 C16), then invade around H16]
;W[cd];B[ce];W[de]C[Kyo: It is still not too late to invade, H16 seems ok for that.]

(;B[cc]C[Kyo: Hane moves are very powerful moves, but in that case it is not the best option to me. Compare it to a nobi at B17. The territory difference is very small, and it does not leave as many weaknesses as C17.

Kyo: Moreover, it is a quite offensive move. If White does not respond, you'll have the opportunity to take the corner later in the game.]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[db]C[H : maybe this exchange is not really good? I took the corner, but white is very thick now and has the whole upper board.

Kyo: Yes, it will be difficult for black to invade now.];B[kq]
;W[mq];B[ko]
(;W[mo]C[Kyo: Here White loses the benefit he could have expected from his wall. N3 should have been at J5.]
;B[hn]C[H : trying to enclose white];W[io]
(;B[in]C[Kyo: If you wanted to try to save your L3 stones, then K6 is better (see vars.)]
;W[jo];B[jn]C[H : at that moment I knew that L5 and L3 would be cut from the rest. The whole lower board is lost. But I playd this however to build thickness and influence. As it is, the exchange is too good for white, I should have escape at L7 sooner.

Kyo: Black gets a very strong influence towards the center, so maybe this is ok. But White gains a lot of territory at the bottom]
;W[kn];B[km]C[H : I knew I wouldn't save L5. This was just to build more thickness to goto the center.]
;W[ln];B[ho];W[hp];B[fp]C[Kyo: Bad. It strengthen White, while does not give Black anything.]
;W[eq];B[gp];W[gq];B[ih]C[H : this gives me (or so I hope) a lot of territory.

Kyo: White still has the possibility to invade with a move around F12, which would greatly reduce your moyo.]
;W[ne]C[Kyo: Wrong direction, since White has an opening at N8]

(;B[eg]C[H : not sure this is good. Too slow, too small?

Kyo: It gives White the opportunity to remove some of his weaknesses by letting him play around G14. Moreover, if White plays G14, you'll have to add another move to protect your moyo. However because of the weaknesses in your wall on the left, I don't see any better move if you want to protect your moyo in the center (F11 may work though)]
;W[gf];B[gh];W[ng];B[if]C[Kyo: Good];W[id];B[he];W[gd];B[ge]
;W[fe]
(;B[fg]C[Kyo: Don't fear White F13 (see var.)];W[ff]C[Kyo: Here you should have gone on whith cutting White (see var.)]

(;B[hg];W[hd];B[kj];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]
(;B[ep]C[H : This is small. I believe M14 or around that would be a good blow at white. Should I completely secure the left side at that point (with C8) ?

Kyo: E4 is small, you don't have to fear an ivasion here. A move at C8 will protect you more, but Black is very strong here so he should be able to deal with an invasion. I think it is best to go on with D3, protecting the corner, then S18.

Kyo: M14 is not urgent, because of J14. White can't make a lot of territory there at the moment.]
;W[cr]
(;B[dq]C[Kyo: Here you know you won'y be able to cut White. With the exchange D3-D2, you keep the initiative, but you remove one of White weaknesses. So better directly play at B3]
;W[dr];B[bq];W[br];B[cq]
(;W[om]C[Kyo: Bad White move. It removes Black's weakness at R7]
;B[pl];W[je]
(;B[ph]C[Kyo: Safe play. Good.];W[jf]
(;B[hf]C[Kyo: Better sacrifice these two stones to invade with M13]
;W[kh]C[H : now that I failed to play M14 or so, white has made the winning territory there.]
;B[ji];W[jh];B[lm];W[mm];B[ml];W[nl];B[mk];W[nk]C[Kyo: S18 is still worth more]
;B[od];W[nd];B[ni]C[Kyo: Trying to cut White here is not worth anything, since the two groups are alive and strong. Better play sente yose move like S18]
;W[of];B[pf];W[mh];B[mi];W[li];B[lj];W[rc]C[Kyo: Good point]
;B[rd];W[pc];B[qd];W[sc];B[sd];W[rb];B[oc];W[ob];B[oh]C[Kyo: Black should try to keep sente, with moves like S4 or D19, then A2]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[so];B[sn];W[rp];B[ok];W[nj]C[Kyo: White does not need to respond here. B3 is bigger]
;B[oj];W[ca];B[bb];W[cg];B[ch];W[bg];B[be];W[bh];B[ci];W[bj]
C[H : I think I handled quite well this invasion, as it didn't work out. However, if you have any comments...

Kyo: Basically, in that case, White doesn't have enough space to live. His only chance is too kill your weaker group - here the B15 one.]
;B[bi];W[bk];B[ai]C[Kyo: Good. White is finished here];W[bn]
;B[bo];W[cm];B[cn];W[bm];B[dm];W[dl];B[ck];W[dk];B[cj];W[cl]
;B[al]C[Kyo: Well done];W[fk];B[fl]C[Kyo: Nothing wrong here. However, keep in mind that playing in contact usually strengthen the weaker group.]
;W[ej];B[el];W[ek];B[gk];W[gj];B[fi];W[ei];B[dh];W[fj];B[hj]
C[H : H9 better?

Kyo: Yes, because is does not leave the weakness at G8. However, Black is strong enough in this area to deal with cuts.]
;W[ki];B[ij];W[jg];B[nh]C[H : well this gives nothing, while next white move is worth oe point.

Kyo: Correct. A2 is still worth more (3 points)];W[og];B[pg]

Kyo: This was an interesting game, and you both played some good moves. I do not have any particular advise, since you did not make huge mistakes. Just keep in mind that during yose, sente moves _have_ to be played.

Kyo: I hope my comments will be useful, and do your best :)]
