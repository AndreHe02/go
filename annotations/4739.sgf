C[Q: I think there was not big mistake in opening, but in middle game i often feel lost....

Hello Marcin.
Several main comments about this game:
1. Pay attention to what happened on the top left. Remember the proverb "attack from afar". 
2. In some points you played aggressively when you had better options. Your post-game analysis also shows that you found better options(like C3), and that is good.

The main reason you lost was the bottom right area and the failed invasion which put white into a lead for the rest of the game. Black managed to regain alot of points, which is very good, but white had too much of an advantage.
I recommend that you:
1. Solve tesuji problems(http://goproblems.com/). Your strength will rise significantly by improving your reading.
2. Try stopping more before you play, and think about the overall position.]

(;W[od]C[Q: wrong direction?

DC: In chinese opening, the purpose of L17 is to be an extension from D16 while immediately attacking any stone approaching R16.
P16 is a move where it's hard for white to make life.];B[pf]

;W[oq]C[DC: Now black has three main choices:
1. Playing on the right is big because white has a shimari(corner enclosure) facing it. White's enclosure will have an easier time making territory on the right.
Locally, a move on the right gains more for white than on the bottom.
However, the right said also has black stones which makes it less profitable for white to play there.
2. The bottom. If black plays there he will be surrounded from both sides. I'm also not sure that white can make something big out of it in just one move.
3. The left side. Black has the stones D16 and G16 which make moves like D10 worth playing.
Right now the left is the biggest and most open area.];B[jq]
;W[ql]C[DC: This is a nice move for white, because Q11 is high which means white can slide at S11 to put the black group into some danger.]
;B[cj];W[gq];B[mq];W[cm];B[ej];W[di];B[dj];W[df]
(;B[ef]C[Q: bad direction?

DC: There is a useful proverb in times like this: "Attack from afar."
When you have a weak stone like D14, don't play a contact move like E14.
Contact fights lead to both sides getting stronger in the area, and since black is already strong it is not really favourable.
The way to attack weak stones is by limiting the area they can use to make life.
For example, black C15 as you suggested doesn't provoke white to strengthen himself and it defends the corner territory.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[cd];B[dc];W[cc]C[DC: The result of the contact move: white does not seem that weak right now.]
;B[ei];W[eg];B[dh];W[dg]C[DC: Here, black can't be really happy with any move, because letting white escape will harm both of black's groups, and if black closes white, white will have nice territory and black's wall will have many cuts.]

(;B[fg];W[eh]
(;B[fh];W[ch]C[DC: C3 is a very common move in this position: white's corner has two large knight moves on the sides, and K3 and C10 which are stable are threatening it.
C3 can easily make life, and afterwards white will have cuts for black to use, and any white influence will be cancelled by the black stones.]

(;B[qn]C[DC: Risky play. White has move like S11 which threaten black while helping white stones, and if white chases black the correct way he might be able to attack N3 too.]
;W[om]
(;B[on]C[Q: wrong?

DC: Probably black's best choice here.
But this position is hard for black.];W[pm];B[pn];W[pj];B[oi]
;W[oj];B[ni];W[nn]C[DC: Black would have liked to play O6 before white, but the moves at P11 were also important.
Here you can see that the black invasion put black in a very difficult situation.]

(;B[rh];W[qk];B[op]C[DC: Good move.];W[np];B[nq];W[oo];B[pp]
C[DC: White can also play Q3...]
(;W[po];B[pq];W[qq];B[pr];W[qo];B[lo];W[qr];B[or];W[og];B[ph]
;W[cq]C[DC: Let's look at the overall position:

White has a big right and big bottom left, a nice territory on the right and barely anything around O15.
Black's S13 territory together with the L3 territory is more or less equal to white's B15 territory combined with the O15 territory.

Now black's H17 area must compete with both S7 and the bottom left corner. It's easy to see black is behind.
However, black also has more influence, from his two walls.]
;B[fq]C[DC: More peaceful options for black include H4 and K14, but an attack such as this is appropriate for this position, but black must verify that it works.

Here I think it is not very easy for black to get much out of this attack provided that white responds correctly.
To start with, white G4 makes it nearly impossible for black to live with F3.]

(;W[fp];B[gp]C[DC: White can play at H3.
There is a useful proverb: "Extend after a crosscut."
The shape created by G3, G4, F3 and F4 is called crosscut, and often playing atari as white did is the wrong option; extending, like at H3 is correct.]

There are various ways to reply to it. A good one here is and L2(see variation).

Because white can't cut at S7(see variation), this limits white's eye space and enlarges black's. However white still lives.]
