C[I think I played relatively well and only made a couple of what
I now know were obvious mistakes which cost me a few stones and
a small amount of territory.  I think we both played all right
in the opening and the first fight began in the bottom right
corner where I would say we both followed a standard Joseki sequence.
My opponent ended up with a small amount of territory and although
his stones lived I had them surrounded and it looked as though
I would be able to take control of the area to the upper right
of white’s territory. As it happened this was not the case, as
I went wrong later on and allowed my opponent to successfully
invade.

The next fight took place on the upper right where my opponent
secured a fair bit of territory along the right hand edge of
the board.  Could I have killed my opponents stones if I’d played
differently?  But again even though his stones lived I had them
surrounded ready to make territory closer to the centre of the
board.

We then played a few stones in the middle of the board before
a similar fight took place along the upper edge of the board.
I managed to separate the stones along the upper edge from those
along the right edge but again the outcome was the same: his
stones lived and he secured territory along the upper edge but
again I had the stones surrounded ready to claim territory in
the middle of the board.

On the bottom edge the outcome was reversed: I secured territory
in the lower region of the board with my stones surrounded by
my opponents.  In the event I managed to kill those stones and
am curious to know whether my 97th move was correct and whether
playing where I did was the right move to kill white’s stones.

A fight then followed in the middle.  The only mistakes I am
aware of are move 133 where I think I should have played one
point lower so that my stones would have lived and move 171 where
I should have rescued the two stones that were in Atari at the
top of the board.

What I am far less clear about is how I could have played different
so that my opponent would not have secured as much territory,
particularly in the lower left region of the board and so that
I would have retained my territory in the lower right region
where my opponent invaded.  The game ended after 241 moves (120
each) then we both passed and my opponent won by 46.5 (including
a 6.5 komi).

I hope that one of your reviewers can provide an analysis and
commentary on this game, particularly given that it is far from
obvious to me how I could have made the balance of territory
more in my favour.  I look forward to the review.

In this game black showed good fighting and reading skills ...
however black must not attach to weak stones .. this helps your
opponent out ... so develop ability to recognise weak groups
and then play around them rather than against them.
Also black needs to play bigger moves in the opening  .. to calculate
which is bigger .. to respond to white or play elsewhere ...
as you develop this skill you will quickly build larger framewors
than your opponent that you can convert into territory.

Hope these comments help
