C[Here
you have a large amount of teritory on the top edge, which is no doubt what
you were playing for, but when you look at the bottom side of the board black
is in a good position to defend and take a large amount of teritory.

At this point you should be looking to invade the lower edge before black has a chance to strengthen here.]

only place left is the lower left corner.  Now is the time to move here as
the score currently stands with black winning by about 60 points.]

bad!  see variation]

serve much purpose as black is dead at the top - really this move just takes

best to make sure.];B[lm];W[gq]C[This looks ambitious]

[as][bs][ls][ms][ns][os][ps]C[A good game played by both.

My final advice to sumarise is to keep an eye on the whole board and before playing a move ask yourself:

Is this move urgent?  (if so then play it)
As this move is not urgent is it the move which is gaining me the most? (if so play it)

URGENT moves, then BIG moves

If its not urgent then make sure your stone is doing as much for you as it can.

The best way to get better is practice and game reviewing.
After a game have a look through it with the benefit of hindsight and see what move may have been better.

Hope this review is of use to you.])

this would have changed the game in your favour tremendously as the way it
plays from here to move 59 just gives black tremendous influence over more
than half the board.

This move would pretty much secure the top edge for you while keeping the rest of the board open to invasion.]
