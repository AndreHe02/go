A is a good move, but invading is also good.
Why didn't you play the more usual invasion
one point to the left?];B[dc];W[de]LB[ff:A]C[I'd play A with a good feeling, knowing
"a one point jump is never bad".];B[ce];W[df]C[This is a heavy move. In this kind of situation  you want to make light, felxible moves like  jumping ahead one more space.]

B will ruin the moyo.]

yes, of course D2 is better.];W[dr];B[hn]C[B got his result, making W heavy and  destroying his moyo.]
;W[ko];B[hl]C[This is a bad move. Why? Attachments are  meant to be used to develop your own weak  group, not attack your opponents weak group.]

The group on the upper side is quite safe. Also,
A is a better move to settle the upper side as it
gives W more territory.];B[on];W[no]C[Must play hane. This move is very submissive.]

It's actually the wedging move earlier that is
really bad.];B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[ok];B[jn];W[kn];B[im]C[It hurts to let black have this move.]

;B[ig];W[ih];B[jh];W[ji];B[he];W[ge];B[je];W[jc];B[fh]C[My quick calculation shows B is about 20pt  ahead, so resigning was appropriate. Black  played solidly and took secure territory, while  W didn't manage to make the moyo he was  trying for in the beginning. In the endgame both  players made huge mistakes, but W playing the  wedge in and loosing the two stones on the  right was the worst one. After that, there was  nothing left to play for.

I think you play a little too agressivly, making  unneccesary invasions and playing moves that  looks like tesuji, when in reality they don't work.
When you make a new group by invading or  cutting, try to envision how it will live at the end  of the game by considering if there is enough  space for two eyes in the area or if it can easily  connect to a friendly group. You must realize  that making a new group that cannot be  sacrificed easily is a heavy burden.  Studying examples of light shape from pro  games would also probably pay off.

Good luck in improving your skill!!])
