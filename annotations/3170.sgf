To the reviewer

Hi my name is Nikos and i am black.
I won this game and was comfartable all the way through it. however 
I felt a bit rusty in some areas and I thought some off my logic 
could do with a bit of help from the likes of your self.

Reviewer : 

Hi, I'm Menfin in KGS. I used to be 12k but the rating system 
has been changed and I don't play a lot so I'm not sure to be 
at this level today. I hope however my advices will help you 
to perform your play. If you have any question or remark, feel 
free to send me an e-mail : menfin2@laposte.net];W[pp]C[Nikos [19k\]: enjoyu]

This is the end of my review and I hope it'll help you to improve. I could resume my advices with this points :
- connect your groups and cut your opponents position
- drop some stones to gain much globally
- don't play too much contact move which strengthen your opponent
- always look at your weak groups and, if needed, try to save them. The opposite is true : look at your opponent's weak groups and attack them.

Good luck and feel free to drop me an e-mail.
