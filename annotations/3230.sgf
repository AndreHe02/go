C[Ninjinka [3k\]: hi

Hi Ninjinka, I'll try to make an as good review as possible, first time for me reviewing for the GTL, but i'll do my best :)]
;B[qd]C[theolddan [2k\]: hi];W[dp];B[pq];W[od];B[mc]C[Possible, but I'd prefer playing in the empty corner, see variation]

(;W[ob]C[Strange for white to start this fight, Black has a stone bottom right to help him, white has no "allys" nearby.]
;B[pf];W[ne];B[jc]C[if white had a stone in the top left corner, he would have been able to pincer now, since he hasn't, it's hard for him to get a good result.]

(;W[qe]C[this and the next white move are bad, they only make black stronger, and don't really help white, see variation]
;B[pe];W[pd];B[rd]C[a good way to stop white from making a base in the corner, but it's hard to make good shape with these stones...]
;W[ng];B[ph]TR[qj]C[there still is some aji left in the white stones, when white gets a stone at delta for example, see variation]

(;W[po];B[np]TR[qk]SQ[qg][rh]C[I don't think this is the right choice of joseki here, you know that white will get a stone at delta, after wich he gets a nice follow up at one of the 2 squares...

I can't think of a good joseki to make this not happen though, so I think playing in the top right corner would also be a good choice...]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[or];W[qk];B[fq]CR[jc][mc]C[The top left corner is bigger, since playing there also helps your encircled stones]
;W[hq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]
;W[dc]C[Now white got to play there first.];B[de];W[ce]
(;B[cf]C[Wrong direction I think, because the lower right corner is low and solid, the top is weak so it needs help, see variation]
;W[cd];B[dg];W[fc];B[ck]CR[kq]TR[hc]SQ[rh][qi]C[Ninjinka: maybe d9 better? i thought i was ahead so i try to be more solid as possible

I'm not sure, pretty much anything you play here gives you a funny shape. D9 is not good for sure, leaves too much aji, i dont think you can do much better than this here.

You think you are ahead here, lets see. 
Black has 15 points solid on the left + what he makes around C11, say 8 points top right, 6 points bottom right, and a unsettled group at the top, so 30 points total. 

White has 12 points top left, 5 bottom left, we'll count the bottom right for 5 as well, and a weak group at the top. That makes a total of 28 including komi.

That makes it quite a close game, but black has good potential on the left side. Delta is a nice point for both, since it would settle the black group, also a play around the circle would be very large, since both can still gain there, the same goes for the squared area. I'd say black is a bit ahead, but white has sente, so it definitly is still a game.]
;W[em]C[strange, this helps black take away the aji on the left]

(;B[dm]C[Ninjinka: this i think was a mistake

I agree, it strengthens white]
(;W[dl]
(;B[dn]C[strange, see variation];W[en];B[bm];W[cl]TR[ch]C[aji keshi, there is still a lot of aji around delta, white is going to remove this now...]
;B[bl];W[dk];B[cj];W[dj];B[jq]C[big, but the top is more urgent right now]
;W[ci]C[good];B[di];W[bi];B[bj];W[dh];B[ei];W[eh];B[fi]C[painful, now you're cut into 2 weak groups :-(]
;W[bg];B[bf];W[aj];B[bk]
(;W[fk]TR[bg][dh][eh][bi][ci][aj]C[this is bad, now black can capture the delta stones, see variation]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[ff]C[Nice move, white is captured.];W[fh]C[this only makes matters worse...]

;B[hh];W[ii];B[hg];W[hk];B[ag]C[So black got the left side as well as the move at the bottom, black is ahead.]
;W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[rf];W[lq]C[a tough move to answer, since white is so strong in the centre.]
