C[sprout: I currently frequently lose liberty races and fail to read mounting danger until it is too late.  I think I'm doing an OK job in the beginning although I somtimes let my opponent wall off too much of the middle while I'm making live groups on the side.

bignose: White concentrates too much on whether a group can be captured, which is probably where the idea about "losing liberty races" comes from.  It is important to count liberties and read through whether a group can be captured -- but far more important to make positions strong so that it is easier to avoid getting embroiled in capture reaces anyway.

The larger problems White experiences are a failure to look for weak points, and a tendency to play forcing moves without considering if they are beneficial.

The only time an attack is profitable is if it is made from a stronger position than the group being attacked.  A study of professional games can make this clear; before attacking, the professional player ensures his own groups are strong first.  "Make a fist before striking", says my sensei.

When a group is attacked, it will wriggle for a way out or a way to make life.  If you make contact plays, the wriggling group will find plenty of ways to break through the cutting points or capture the contacting stones.  In this light, *contact plays are not attacking plays* at all, since they make the group stronger as a result and it is the player who contacted that becomes weaker.

An attacking play is one that *does not touch* the group, but plays near it to reduce its options and cut off escape routes.

White also plays moves that force the opponent to respond, without considering whether the response is something the opponent wanted to do anyway -- known as "playing the opponent's game for him".  Look for moves that make you stronger, rather than moves that simply force a response.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[ch]LB[cg:A][dg:B][dh:C]C[sprout: I think a more standard response would have been to extend, but I felt that c12 prevented a black base and began to work with d4 (with an additional future play)

bignose: This is a standard response to Black's corner approach (kakari), it is called a pincer.  Other standard pincer positions are 'a', 'b', 'c' -- each one leads to different results which you can study in joseki dictionaries.

The point of the pincer is, as you say, to prevent a black base and act as a large extension from your corner stone.]
;B[ee]C[bignose: Black is denied a base, so must prevent being encircled by running out to the centre.]
;W[fd]LB[fc:a][gc:b]C[sprout: Intending to attack and extend at the same time

bignose: This is an overplay, a better response would be 'a' or 'b'.  Playing so close to Black at this point is only going to force him to become stronger, leaving your two groups weaker as a result.

When you want to attack, you must do so from a position of strength; make your own stones strong before attacking.]
;B[ff];W[id]MA[ch]C[sprout: Would staying closer to black have been better?  This isn't really attacking anymore.

bignose: As you've seen, in response to Black's play you ended up defending yourself.  Note that the stone you used to pincer (marked) is also weaker as a result of Black's "defensive" move.]
;B[ed];W[ec]LB[bc:a][eh:b]C[bignose: White is now forced onto the back foot as a result of the overplay.  Note that 'a' and 'b' are big plays for both Black and White; Black eventually lives in the corner because White does not take 'a' later on.]
;B[cj]C[bignose: Black can now attack the stone to become stronger himself.]
;W[di]LB[eh:a]C[sprout: Attack and jump toward center

bignose: This is not an attack; it is another overplay.  White's stones are weak, he cannot hope to kill Black; therefore there is no threat to Black and any close play will only make Black stronger.

In this case it is necessary in order to make White stronger too; but do not mistake these kinds of moves for attacking moves, they are purely defensive.

The one-point jump at 'a' would be faster and lighter, and would put pressure on both Black's groups.]
;B[dj];W[fi];B[cn]C[bignose: Black has basically been "forced into" making a base.  This is called "playing the opponent's game for him".]
;W[fp]LB[fq:a]C[sprout: Extend.  Is a two point jump better?

bignose: This, or 'a', are the best two responses to a corner approach.

Unfortunately, White has lost sente and is simply answering Black at this point.]
;B[bc]C[bignose: Black has now claimed the upper right corner. White's left group is now eyeless, between two settled Black groups -- very weak.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[kq]C[sprout: Low because f4 is high.  I don't really know what this means but I've read about it.

bignose: This two-space extension on the third line is the ideal distance to settle the group.  It also works well with your stones in the lower right too, leading to a nice moyo.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[hq]LB[ho:a]C[bignose: Black has invaded a little too deep here; a capping play at 'a' would be severe.]
;W[gq]C[bignose: This is alright too, but only because it forces Black to make his stones heavy (close and inefficient) -- it should immediately be followed by an encircling play to make the most of your two strong groups on either side.]
;B[hp];W[co]LB[fn:a][fm:b]C[sprout: Too small?

bignose: Wrong direction; this will only make Black stronger and White weaker, since Black already has enough space to live on the side.  As can be seen later, this one move creates such a weakness that Black gains the whole corner.

A play at 'a' or 'b' would keep you connected out, and follow through on your tsuke (touching) play by giving black a heavy, weak group to worry about on the lower side.]
;B[bo];W[md]LB[qj:a][fm:b]C[sprout: I think this should have been m16 instead

bignose: This move is poorly timed; it only helps Black do what he wants to do anyway, which is create a large moyo on the right side.  This is "playing the opponent's game for him".

An invasion at 'a' is preferable, although 'b' is still an urgent point.]
;B[pf];W[pr];B[qq];W[oc]C[bignose: Again, this move only forces Black to settle his corner nicely and creates more weak points for White.]
;B[pc];W[ob];B[pb];W[qj]LB[nn:a]C[sprout: I felt I need to get into the right side before it was too late.  But would r11 have allowed me to either make a base toward the bottom or a large knights move toward the top, depending on black's response?  With r10 I could only jump toward the center after black r12.

bignose: This is the correct point for invading the moyo Black has created, but again could be timed better; Black has a natural response at 'a', which would put pressure on White's lower side and make the invasion much less effective.]
;B[qh];W[oj];B[ql];W[qe]C[sprout: I felt black's outside wall was already strong & there was a way to reduce the corner.

bignose: This invasion is doomed.  Black's wall is very strong, and White does not have enough strength outside it to make this invasion effective.  This will only result in Black becoming much stronger when he swallows the invading stone.]
;B[pe];W[rg];B[qf];W[qg];B[rf]MA[oc]C[bignose: Black's corner has become impregnable now, and quite large.  This can be traced back to the inappropriate move by White (marked) causing Black to become strong in this area, as well as White's failed invasion.]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[rh];B[pi]
(;W[qi]C[bignose: White had a chance here to gain some compensation from the failed invasion by capturing the stones on a larger scale; see the variation.]
;B[oh];W[pj];B[oi];W[kc]LB[fm:a][nm:b][hf:c][mg:d][ni:e]C[sprout: I would previously played l16 to get as much territory as possible but I now think it is better to mix high and low.  Is this correct?

bignose: This is the correct move to consolidate territory, but it is much too slow.  White has many weak points to worry about before relaxing with a move like this.

Any of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' are preferable to this move.  White is relinquishing sente to Black for no reason.]
;B[ng]C[bignose: Black protects a weak point, making his wall much stronger.]
;W[bf]C[sprout: Trying to make at least one eye while reducing black

bignose: This move again forces Black to become stronger in the corner while making White's right side group weaker.]
;B[be];W[cg];B[hf]C[bignose: Another opportunity to harrass Black's groups disappears.]
;W[ol]LB[no:a][nm:b]C[sprout: I only have one eye (I think) so I still need to escape.  I felt pressing on black's corner was a better than just going toward the center.

bignose: This move is in the right direction, but is a little slow; Black has an easy response at 'a', putting pressure on White's lower side while leaving White's right side no closer to escaping.

White at 'b' would be lighter and faster, and make Black 'a' useless.]
;B[bq]MA[co]C[bignose: The marked White stone is having no effect now.]
;W[ir]LB[fm:a][kn:b]C[bignose: Connecting your groups together is the correct idea, but this move is ineffective in this instance.

You would do better to connect your groups out and encircle Black's lower group on a large scale with 'a' or 'b'.]
;B[hr]C[bignose: Black has definitely succeeded in splitting White's lower area into two weaker groups.]
;W[gr];B[hs];W[fm]C[sprout: Still need to connect upper left group

bignose: Also valuable because it puts pressure on Black's lower group, which has no eye space.]
;B[cl];W[fk]LB[hm:a][kn:b]C[bignose Unnecessary, and too slow; capping Black at 'a' or jumping out with 'b' would be better, and would help your other weak groups.]
;B[dn]MA[co]C[bignose: The marked White stone has now become a liability, allowing Black to become very strong in the corner.]
;W[jn]LB[hn:a][ko:b]C[sprout: I thought  at this point that I could kill black's group in the bottom middle.  I didn't end up succeeding.

bignose: This is too half-hearted to be any good; it drifts without a definite connection to any White group, so is used  against White later when Black wants to get eye space in this area.

Either White 'a' or 'b' would be better; they would put pressure on the lower Black group without creating White weak points.]
;B[nj]C[bignose: Though Black doesn't seem to have seen the danger to his lower group, this is a big move that gains power in the centre.]
;W[fo]LB[nk:a][fn:b][hn:c]C[sprout: Was this required?  I felt that a two point jump was too weak and the connection too important to lose.

bignose: Black's previous move gained a lot of power in the centre, extending Black's wall and pressuring White's right side.  A response at 'a' would help White's side and partly neutralise Black's influence.

This move played by White is too slow; the connection, while valuable, would be too costly for Black to try to cut.  If Black did play here or at 'b', White only needs to play 'c' to keep the pressure on; in the resulting fighting, White should be left with both a strong lower right corner, and strong outside thickness.

White at 'c' instead would be a better way of staying connected.]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[jo];W[kn]MA[jn]C[bignose: If the marked White stone were played here in the first place, Black's struggles would be of much less concern to White.]
;B[ko]MA[jn][kn]C[sprout: I felt that my bottom group was alive so I would use blacks moves to build a wall facing the moyo.

bignose: White's lower group is alive, but Black can use its weak points to gain eye space.  The two marked stones are also being cut off (and in this game are eventually captured) giving Black even more chance at eye space.]
;W[lo]LB[mn:a][no:b]C[bignose: Playing contact moves is not the best way to harrass and encircle a group; as can be seen later, it just gives Black more opportunities to break through.

White at 'a' or 'b' would give Black far fewer options, as well as connecting White's groups together.]
;B[ln];W[mo]MA[lo]C[sprout: Protecting the crosscut

bignose: Note that the crosscut was only possible because White played the contact move (marked).]
;B[in]C[bignose: Black now has one eye, and enough White weak points to exploit to try for a second.]
;W[lm]LB[jl:a]C[sprout: Looking at this afterward I think I should have played on the other side to keep the pressure on.

bignose: Contact plays are still less effective in this situation than trying to encircle the group and steal its eye space.

White at 'a' would be the standard way to draw out the two weak stones, and would threaten Black's potential eye space.]
;B[im];W[ik];B[jl];W[kk];B[jk];W[jj]LB[ij:a][kj:b]C[bignose: Again, these contact plays by White will only create weak points for Black to exploit.  This play means that White must now protect the cuts at both 'a' and 'b'.  If White played at 'a' or 'b' instead, then at least only one side remains weak.]
;B[kj];W[ki];B[lj];W[ii];B[kl];W[lk];B[ll]C[sprout: I saw that I could save these two stones and keep black separated.

bignose: Keeping Black's groups separated at this stage is much less effective than if White had simply separated them earlier, when the lower group was not alive.]
;W[mk];B[mm];W[mn];B[ml];W[nk];B[gn]C[bignose: Black ensures he has eye space.]
;W[fn]C[sprout: Maybe g5 instead?

bignose: No, this is the correct response; White's lower right group is still vulnerable, so maintaining the connection to a strong group is essential if White wants any chance of regaining sente.]
;B[gm]C[bignose: No question, Black now has two eyes.];W[go]
;B[ho];W[hl];B[hm]C[sprout: Too late to prevent two eyes now, but I didn't see it quite yet.]
;W[ip]C[sprout: Wishful thinking];B[iq];W[jq];B[io];W[on];B[mj]
;W[li];B[qr]C[sprout: Oversight by black.

bignose: Yes, a study of tesuji is useful for both offence and defence.]
;W[ni];B[mi];W[mh];B[or];W[nr];B[pq];W[oq];B[ps]C[bignose: Note that this result almost compensates for missing the tesuji that captured five Black stones in the centre, so White should not be too proud of letting the lower right corner go.]
;W[po]LB[cb:a][cr:b][rk:c][jf:d][mf:e]C[bignose: This move has almost no effect, except to create another White weak point when White is still in need of damage control from the loss on the lower side.

Any of 'a', 'b', 'c' to protect weak points, or 'd', 'e' to encircle Black and connect White, would be preferable.]
;B[qo]LB[op:a]C[bignose: Black is simply forced to complete his wall, while White has left a weak point at 'a'.]
;W[op];B[cr]C[bignose: Black has sente and is using it to exploit White's weak points.]
;W[dr];B[br];W[rk];B[cb];W[db]MA[db][dc][ec]LB[eb:a]C[bignose: Black has forced White to form an "empty triangle" (the three marked stones with the empty point 'a').  This is the most inefficient formation of three stones, and proves the undoing of the group later.

Empty triangles are a bad idea so often that there is a Go proverb that says "Don't form empty triangles".]
;B[bi];W[gd]LB[sn:a]MA[rk]C[bignose: This has no effect on Black whatsoever, and is not necessary.

Black has ignored White's marked stone.  This can be punished severely with the tesuji known as a "monkey jump" at 'a'.  It is a useful exercise to prove to yourself that, surprisingly, Black cannot capture a White stone at 'a' and loses roughly eight points of territory -- a big play at this stage of the game.]
;B[gh];W[cd]MA[ff][gh][hf]C[bignose: This is no real threat to Black -- he has just created an eye with the three marked stones, and can still make a second in the corner.]
;B[bd];W[jr]LB[sn:a][jf:b][mf:c][gi:d]C[bignose: Another consolidating move that is uncalled for here.  The monkey jump at 'a', or the connecting moves at 'b' and 'c', are still bigger.

White also has gained a weak point at 'd' that should be protected.]
;B[er];W[ds];B[gs];W[fr];B[fs];W[es]C[bignose: The continued costs of trying and failing to capture the Black group on the lower side are still being felt by White.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[do]C[bignose: Black gained a huge amount of benefit from exploiting the misplayed White stone he has just captured.]

bignose: Not sure what you mean by this.  The groups are connected, albeit without much territory.

If you mean it took you a while to read out this fact, that's good -- at least you're not just assuming it's so.]
;W[ei];B[fj];W[gi];B[gj];W[hj];B[gk];W[fl];B[ns];W[ms];B[os]
LB[mr:a]C[sprout: I thought it was safe to leave this alone because of the group on the left.  I didn't take the aji at the top of the left group into account as we see later.

bignose: Black still has a damaging play at 'a' that White must protect against.]
;W[ci];B[cc]C[sprout: I totally missed the threat here];W[dd]
;B[fc]C[sprout: I realized it now and tried to cut my losses

bignose: The empty triangle now shows its full ugly inefficiency.]
;W[gc];B[eb];W[fb];B[ec];W[gb]C[sprout: I think g19 would have been better

bignose: Only because a ko could be formed; at this stage though, White has few ko threats while Black has many.]
;B[sm];W[sf]C[sprout: This black group already has one eye...is there anything else I could have done to reduce?

bignose: The Black group has been quite secure ever since it formed a wall around the corner; even without the eye on the outside, there is so much room in the corner, along with the captured white stone, that it would be difficult for Black to *fail* to make two eyes.

You should get into the habit of seeing a captured stone as a potential eye, and a large amount of surrounded space as "eye space".]
