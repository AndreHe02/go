;B[pd]C[Move 28: Was thinking about R8. didn't nkow what to do after he played S10 any idea?

Move 172: Please ignore this move. i wasn't using my head.

As well as 189. I thought i was winning so i wasn't exactly thinking

and 268....

It ended up move 189 and 172 were my losing moves....

. . . i don't understand -- how can 189 and 172 be your losing moves? 189 is b, 172 is w!]

C[My friends and I call this sequence "our favorite joseki."  It's simple and easy to understand, so we play it alot.

That means we play it in the wrong situations! I think this might be a case of that.  White is very happy with his left side after d10.

It's not necessarily bad for you since you have sente and q16 -- but still, a move like f16 might be better than c15.  Still develops towards q16, and doesn't force white to make a nice framework.]
;W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[fc];W[dj];B[op];W[qq];B[qr];W[oo]C[This is not so good for white.  He's eyeless, with an approach from the top, black can attack and build a framework with q16.]
;B[jq]C[This is not so good for black.

I'm not sure which is better here for black -- o5 or something around r8.

o5 fixes b's weaknesses and is a strong attack on the four white stones.  once white fixes, b can then extend all the way to f3.

r8 force w to run into the center, and in the chase you build a big right side framwork.]
;W[qf]C[I think w might be too aggresive here.

b can still go for an attack around r8.  if w extends from his r14 stone, b can jump towards the center.  
if w plays around p8, then b's r12 seems like a good move.]
;B[qh]C[this is not so good for b -- it lets w to fix his problems below and attack black at same time.]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[pk]C[i think w probably wants to  jump to p10 to put more pressure on r12, or play at q8 to connect.

as it is, i think b can cut of the lower right black stones wtih q8, provided he's willing to sacrafice q8 and r8 later.]
;B[pg];W[qc]C[not sure what you meant in your question . . . .]
;B[qd]C[wrong direction? a wall at q17 might be better -- the w messes up so it goes okay for black.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[qe]C[mistake for w! needs to connect at s17.  that makes cuts at r15/p16 miai.]
;B[rc];W[od];B[pe];W[rb];B[sd];W[oe];B[of];W[nc]C[w];B[ob];W[pf]
;B[rd];W[nf];B[og];W[nb];B[qb];W[jc]C[black came out very well in this exchange! the w group on the top side has lots of weaknesses.]
;B[fq]C[this is not such a good followup though.

i'd look at q8 for b.  either capture the q9 white stones above or the r3 group below.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[go];W[ri]C[im not convinced this immobilizes the r8 stone . . . and it's definitely not sente against the top.

if b tenuki, w s13, b s12, w t12, b s14 captures.

no matter what, be can still caputre three white stones above.]
;B[rh]C[this is very bad move for b! the three white stones are captured without it!]
;W[dr];B[fn];W[dn];B[en]C[this is a very small move for black.  should be looking at pulling out r8 stone, or attacking top side w group.

if b wants move here, something like f8 seems better.  still threatens to jump into w side, but also helps out r8 stone, builds moyo, and helps some with eventual attacke on topside w stones.]
;W[ep]C[v];B[gq];W[dm]C[i'd want to get cut at g6 first.  just play as throw in for now, might come in handy later!]
;B[gm];W[oa]C[why waste ko threat now?];B[pb];W[jf];B[mg];W[mf]
;B[lg];W[rr]C[big for white];B[pr]C[t];W[lf];B[kf];W[ke];B[kg]
C[b should be very unhappy with how this turned out -- all w weakness are gone, and all be has to show for it is defect at o13!]
;W[lm]C[good move for white!];B[nl];W[mn];B[no]C[not so big now.  i think q8 is better for b.  you can still seperate the groups (i think) if you're willing to sacrifice q8/r8.]
;W[om]C[another good move for white!

again, b is getting nothing for his efforts but a stronger w.  waited far too long to look at this area.]
;B[qi];W[ol];B[nk];W[oj];B[mj];W[ni];B[mi];W[ng]C[another good move for w.

now w has no weak groups, roughly equal territory, and gets to chase some weak black stones.

b is behind for sure now, i think.];B[rj];W[rk];B[si];W[qk]
;B[nh];W[oh];B[mh];W[ok]C[bad move for w.  seems like he's connected anyway.

worst case, he gives up three stones above.  g1, h18, l5 and j11 are just a few moves that seem much bigger.]
;B[ii]C[not as good for b as for w, since w has m7.

might look at playing h17 sente against the k15 cut first];W[lk]
;B[je]C[not so good for b here.  ladder works for white.   w j15, b k16, w l16 sets up a ladder that ends with w playing g18 instead of h19 for the kill.

w will happily let b catch six stones in gote if b tries m15.]
;W[kd];B[if];W[ko];B[kp];W[lo];B[jo];W[lp];B[lq];W[kj]C[this is a pretty weak move for white -- not clear how it gains or takes poitns away . . .]
;B[dh]C[good! b needs to try stuff like this to win!];W[eh]
C[if i was black, i'd try d11, w e11, b c10, w d9, b d12 threatens to connect, then b c9 seems like can make two eyes.

this takes lots of points from w, and while w does get b14 to reduce the corner, his wall in the center is worthless.]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[ei];W[ch];B[di];W[ci];B[fh];W[bf];B[dk];W[ej]
;B[fj];W[ek];B[fk]C[b can't be too happy with this sequence.   he didn't get much on the outside (8pts?) and in return w soldified his side and got b14, a big point.]
;W[el];B[jl]C[interesting play.  sets up double peep for b after b's o6.]
;W[ac]C[good for w! if w can play his sente endgames well, the game is his.]
;B[bc];W[ad];B[ib];W[ic];B[hc];W[hd]C[i think this is silly for white, since he can already f15 to reduce b's top side.

better for w to k18 or something, protect his territory and threaten atari, then move somewhere else.]
;B[hb];W[jd];B[ie]C[seems small for b.  won't win making these moves.]
;W[fs]C[why not g1?];B[fr]C[i think b should g1 here.  then either b f2 or b e1 depending on whites move.]
;W[gs];B[hr];W[ij];B[ji];W[ik];B[kl]C[wrong direction for b.    instead, b o6, w o7, b n8 sets up double peep to cut off w stones.

b probably should have played o6 long time ago -- maybe instead of j15?]
;W[ll];B[jj];W[jn];B[il];W[io];B[ip];W[fl];B[gl];W[bb]C[no comments from here.  seems w just has to play normal endgame to win.]
