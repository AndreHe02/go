C[I played this game as white. Though I lost only by 4.5 points (which means I would have won if we had played with komi) I really though I was clearly leading and wan't see any big fighting mistakes, so I guess It's more a question of using the wrong strategy. I can't seem to figure out by myself what I could have done to win this game, the big spots I let pass. Thanks for the help. --iPiou

Hi! My name is Jan, and I'm a 13 kyu on KGS. I'll try my best to answer your questions and offer you some variations for different situations. I tried to focus on the most important ones at that.

(I removed the chat text.)];B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[qp];B[op];W[oo]
;B[no];W[po];B[mo]TR[nq]C[J: For black, a play at the triangle would be the joseki. Like this, white will be able to threaten to cut duing a later invasion, e.g. at N3.]
;W[pj];B[ho]C[J: This move seems to be rather ineffective as it neither seems to secure a lot of territory nor is able to develop fast (if at all..).]

(;W[fc]TR[cj][dj]C[J: The next move seems important. I tried to come up with different variations. In this situation, one of the marked points would probably be best as they don't allow black to form a big moyo on the left.]
;B[hc]
(;W[dc]TR[cc][fe][cf]C[J: Common responses to the pincer are marked. As I wouldn't want to start a 3/3 invasion this early in a game, and don't like the results of a double pincer at C14 (which would instantly become rather complicated), I'd suggest continuing peacefully with F15.]
;B[cc];W[cd]TR[hc]C[J: Probably better at E16. The idea would be to strengthen your three stones and attack the marked stone in the end.]
;B[ec];W[db];B[cb];W[eb];B[ed];W[bd];B[da];W[fb];B[bc];W[cf]
;B[fd];W[hb];B[gc];W[gb];B[ib];W[ba];B[ca];W[ac];B[aa]C[J: Let's analyze the status of the black group!]

(;W[cn]TR[cl]C[J: I don't like this move because black's tighter pincer will seperate the stone from his allies above and black can use his bottom stones below for assistance. Probably better at C10.]
;B[ce];W[be];B[de];W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[dh];W[di];B[ci];W[cj]
;B[bi];W[bj];B[bh];W[bg];B[df];W[ai];B[af];W[bf];B[ei];W[dj]
;B[ej];W[cq]CR[ho][mq]TR[kc][lc][ld][jq]C[J: This doesn't seem like a good move to me. First and foremost, it's important to limit blacks influence in the top and center, probably with one of the points marked above. If, at some point, you want to play below, make use of black's weaknesses: N3, which threatens the cut, and the misplaced stone at H5 that still doesn't do anything. K3 would probably be an adequate idea for that.]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[em];W[do];B[en];W[dl]TR[eo]C[J: The stones above are alive, and the stone at C3 can easily make life in the corner. Better to press inwards with E5 instead of trying to link up!]
;B[co]
(;W[bn]C[J: I'd prefer to strenghten the C4 stone. See variation.]

(;B[ep];W[cp];B[bo];W[bp];B[ao];W[dq];B[an];W[am];B[eo];W[ap]
;B[do];W[bm];B[ek];W[dk]C[J: Wasted move!];B[eq];W[br];B[dr]
;W[cr];B[er];W[kq]C[J: Big, but a) rather late and b) I'd prefer to play at the top since you should be able to make territory there, not just reduce your opponent's, and to reduce his influence!]
;B[aq];W[ar]C[J: Well done!];B[lq]TR[ko]C[J: I'd probably prefer to jump out with L5 now, so that I don't get sealed in.]
;W[lr];B[mq];W[mr];B[nr];W[kp];B[ko];W[hp]TR[iq]C[J: It's hard to stay what to do here. Might be better to play K5 and threaten to walk out, or to play J3, which seems a little bit tighter and more secure.]
;B[jp];W[jq];B[ip];W[iq];B[hq];W[hr];B[gp];W[gr];B[gq];W[fr]
C[J: This seems unnecessary.];B[lp];W[ks];B[fq];W[pq]C[J: The top! The top!! The top!!!]
;B[ms];W[jr];B[ns];W[ls];B[nd]C[J: Big!];W[pf]TR[of]C[J: Better at P14.]
;B[nf]C[I guess this sequences was too nice from me. Yet I imagined building territory on the 4th line being thus give the whole 4 lines of the right side plus the link side and the two small territories on the upper and lower side were more than enough to win, so I just let black do as he wished without engaging a fight.

----

J: Your calculation is correct: You are far ahead on territory. However, black has constantly build up influence, so it is not surprising that this should allow him to make quite some territory now. 

Also, I would recommend not to be too submissive. As a beginner, you learn more from fighting than playing passively. Better a fighting game lost than a submissive game one, in this respect!

(Not to mention that this was the reason that you lost..)];W[oh]
;B[nh];W[nj]C[J: Better to attach at O11.];B[mj];W[nl]TR[mk]
C[J: Again far too submissive! Better at N9.];B[ml];W[nn];B[mn]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[oc];B[nm];W[om];B[on];W[pm];B[nk];W[ol]TR[mb]
[mc]C[J: Probably better to forget about that single stone and walk into blacks territory with one of the points marked above.]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[ni];W[ok]C[J: Whew! One point secured!];B[nj]
;W[pn]C[J: And another!];B[og];W[pg];B[ph];W[pi];B[qh];W[qi]
;B[qg];W[qf];B[rf];W[re];B[ri];W[rj];B[pk];W[qj];B[qk];W[rh]

;W[rp];B[rq];W[qq]TR[qr]C[J: Better at R2.];B[qr]C[This seems to be THE move that cost me 10 points and gave victory to black.

---

J: Yes, both sides were about equal before.];W[pr];B[ps];W[rr]
;B[qs];W[rs];B[os]
(;W[ic]C[I really thought there was a weakness I could exploit here but I didn't manage to make something useful out of it.

J: You were right! See variation.];B[jb];W[jc];B[kb];W[kc];B[lc]
;W[id];B[hd];W[ld];B[ie];W[je];B[kd];W[ia];B[ja];W[ma];B[la]
;W[na];B[jd];W[ea];B[ha];W[bb]TR[el][nn][pp][ds]C[J: That was premature. There are still some endgame moves worth points left!]
;B[ga];W[fa];B[ia];W[pp];B[np];W[ds];B[nn];W[es];B[el];W[tt]

[in][jn][kn][ln][fo][go][io][jo][lo][fp][hp][mp]C[J: So then: why did you loose? The reason is mainly that you constantly ignored opportunities to take away some of black's influence, and that you even allowed him to do as he pleases when he transformed that influence into territory. 

In this game, you played a bit too territory-oriented and overlooked the chances to reduce your opponents moyo. I'm sure that if you try to keep a balance between influence and territory, you will become much stronger!

On a final note, you did well whenever capturing races and life and death situations came up. You should be proud of that!

Feel free to contact me either via mail or on KGS (I go by the name of Pallando there) for any other questions.]

In all the other variations, in which white didn't play A16, it seems that white dies. Of course, ko threads are rare in the opening, therefore white probably doesn't loose much. Still, it is important to keep this in mind.]
