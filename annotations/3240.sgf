Hi, I played white in this game. Although I think I had a relatively easy win, my opponent made some invasions that I didn't really know how to handle.


pajaro: Hi. I'll try to review your game. I hope you can get something from it.]
;B[pp];W[dq];B[pd];W[cd];B[ec];W[de];B[gc]TR[hc][gd]C[pajaro: This is too short. Normal are G16 (a bit higher) or H17 (a bit longer)]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[jp];B[co];W[cl]C[pajaro: Good, this is also an extension from the top.]
;B[eo]C[pajaro: This move seems not to be joseki, with the 2-space pincer.]
;W[fp];B[cq];W[cr]C[Is this the correct way to answer?

pajaro: I guess it's good, yes.]
(;B[bq]LB[dp:B][bq:A]C[pajaro: B for black might lead to an exchange.]
;W[dp];B[do];W[el];B[bm]C[pajaro: Black might try to jump to the center before seeking life.]
;W[bl];B[hp]C[OK, invasion #1.
Black's other group was still pretty weak so I believe this invasion is alittle unreasonable.

pajaro: Yes, this looks too early.White might try to make a double attack, but he has to be careful too, to avoid a black counter-attack.]
;W[fo]C[pajaro: This looks very good, splitting black and making white safer in the corner.]
;B[hn]
(;W[bn]LB[bn:A][br:B]C[pajaro: I don't think this is good. White will end in gote and black might take sente to escape. Surround first, kill later.]
;B[bo];W[cm];B[br];W[pr]C[here i tried to settle my two stones, planning to follow Q2 with Q5.
was I being paranoid again?

pajaro: Q5? O5, you mean. This looks like the wrong direction. Attack the 2 black stones and you will get stronger at the same time. Don't give black a chance to attack you. K6, for example.]
;B[lq]C[this is the other invasion. again this seems to me unreasonable.
maybe i should have played K3 and then connect or play R3?
K3 looks good also because it keeps black seperated...

pajaro: This time the invasion might be good for black. White isn't that strong. If k4 is splitted or killed, black will have no problem. White must try to stay connected.]
;W[lp]C[pajaro: good, only move.];B[mp];W[mq];B[kp];W[lo];B[kq]
;W[ko];B[jq];W[jo];B[ip]C[I didn't like this outcome of the fight.
to me it seems black gained way too much considering his starting position.
and i still have to take care of N4 and of F5.

pajaro: Did black make any bad mistake? No, he didn't. And yes, the result id ok for black. So this means that the starting position wasn't so good for white and so bad for black.]
;W[qq]C[pajaro: You had to capture N4.];B[np]C[guess i should have played O5...

pajaro: Yes. Now white is in danger.];W[qp];B[oq];W[or];B[qo]
;W[gr]C[well, my idea with this is to limit black's area, increase my own, and in sente.

pajaro: Limit white's area? You can't think this at this stage of the game. Forget about points, just see strength and weakness. First, black won't make so many points at the bottom, so you can't limit it very much. Second, you don't make many points either, because b can play D2 and take most of them. If black answers H2, you will be forcing him to make eyes. Not all sente moves are automatically good.]
;B[lr];W[mr];B[ms];W[nr]C[pajaro. These forcing moves don't give too much to black either.]
;B[ro]C[pajaro: black ignored G2...];W[iq]C[pajaro: ... and white punished. Black is bad now.]
;B[hq];W[ir];B[hr];W[jr];B[hs]C[pajaro: Black has dead in gote. Painful.]
;W[fn]C[this is more like i expected it to turn out, b weak.

but not because of a mistake on black's side.
(end of questions)

pajaro: Well, it is black who lost the game. Actually, it was white who had a worst game.]
;B[er];W[fr];B[eq];W[fq];B[ep];W[jl];B[hl];W[jj];B[hj];W[fi]
;B[fm];W[em];B[en]C[pajaro: Black is unreasonable. No more comments.]
;W[gm];B[fl];W[gl];B[fk];W[gk];B[ek];W[dk];B[ej];W[fj];B[ei]
;W[eh];B[cj];W[ci]C[sakamotsu [8k\]: thx^^
SirJohn [8k\]: thanks for the game
sakamotsu [8k\]: bye
SirJohn [8k\]: bye])
(;W[br]LB[bn:A][br:B]C[I think here is better, also makes w much stronger..]
))
(;B[dp]LB[dp:B][bq:A]
(;W[eq];B[bq]C[I mean, is this much better for black?

pajaro: Yes, this is much better for black than the game, as it gives better eye shape and white can't attack it.]
)
(;W[bq];B[eq];W[cp];B[dr];W[cq]C[pajaro: White won't play like this, making black a lot stronger.]
)))
