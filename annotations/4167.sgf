C[gokiti3: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
kevco: hello and good luck



Hello,

I'm Black (kevco), I won the game because there was no komi, had it been an even game, I would have lost by a half point. Please review it as an even game.

I'm most interested in the early middle game, and perhaps some final end game plays as I lost it by only 0.5.

Thanks for your help in advance.

Kevin

Hi Kevin.
