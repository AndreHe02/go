C[This
is my first time using the GTL. I play as <kyuless> on IGS, and I have
rated myself 27k. When I am stronger I would like to review games as a thanks
for this free service.

In this game I am white. My biggest concerns are:
(1) How should I have handled Black's successful invasion
on the right?
(2) Was there a way to invade Black's territory and take
advantage of weak-points in his wall of stones?

Thank you for taking this request!! :-) -Dennis

hi dennis.
this is my first review, so I apoligize if I get too in depth or anything. I'll help as much as I can

as
far as the invading question goes, if you're looking to do it on a 13x13,
you need to act a little sooner in the game. your opponent can secure his
position quickly. I'll demonstrate in the game.];B[dd];W[jj]
;B[dj];W[id];B[fc];W[ig]C[I
haven't played on a 13x13 in a long time, so I may be mistaken on this, but
I think that if black had known when and where to invade, J10 and J7 would
have proved fairly useless for you. moves this far out on 19x19 may help
build influence for you (becuase they're not going to make much territory
as they are), but influence is not as helpful on a 13. you should stick to
playing a little closer in to the corner.];B[dg]C[f3 for your next move
might prove a little more helpful than g3. it would also help set up an invasion
later. (variation)]
(;W[gk]C[a black move anywhere from K11 to L11
to L10 would probably cost you the game at this point. you would lose a lot
of your territory because of those two high opening moves.
see variation]
(;B[fj]C[g4 is a little too passive. a move at e2 would prove delightful for you.]

;W[ic];B[ge];W[fi];B[ei];W[fh];B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[hh];B[eg]
;W[eh];B[dh];W[fg];B[ff];W[hf]C[small
comment, but this move at h8 is pointless. you lose sente. it could be much
better spent at L11 to prevent an invasion, or c11, to make one. you still
have a pretty good chance of surviving at c11. you may not technically gain
a lot of points, but you would certainly make black lose a lot.]
;B[gf];W[if];B[kc];W[ke]C[L9
is the right idea here. keep him from making a base. I think this is where
you ran into problems with the next invasion.];B[kd];W[ld];B[lc]
;W[le];B[md];W[me];B[mc];W[jb];B[jc];W[kb];B[lb];W[ib]C[top invasion was handled nicely.]
;B[ki]C[this should be pretty easy to kill if you keep black from making a base]

(;W[jh]C[k6
is too passive. you don't need to worry about the cut at this point. playing
here lets black make a base. you have to take away his space, and definately
keep him out of the corner. (see variation)];B[kj];W[kk];B[ji]
;W[ij];B[lk]
(;W[jk]C[again-
with moves like k3, you're letting him survive. when you have such thickness
as you do here, you are allowed to fight much more aggressively.]

;B[mf]C[again,
h8 is another pointless move. if black ataris there, you can simply block
a L7. this is your chance to play elsewhere];W[lf];B[fm];W[gm]

was a nicely done invasion.];W[cf]C[this sequence may be pressing you luck
a little, though. simple yose moves like B4 and G12 should get you the points
you need to win.

however, don't get me wrong-experimentation is important. it almost worked, too : )]

C[the
following moves show a lot of creativity. very nice (even though you died).
just like in Christmas presents, it's the thought that counts]

*Chevalier*:  you remember the central group?
*Chevalier*:  I think if you do not attack it it would be a seki ... more favorable for you...
*Chevalier*:  close game
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
actually,
it wasn't seki anyway. all he had to do was play b12 and b13 to kill your
upper left group. if that group had been alive, it would have been seki

so,
keep this in mind when trying to kill- don't give them any more space than
you have to. this is the reason the group on the right lived, which cost
you a lot of points.
well, dennis, I hope this has been helpful.
(btw, sorry it took so long-there was some confusion between gtl and myself.)

the L3 invasion, that is), and now black is almost forced to play into your
strength to prevent f3 from making huge points];B[hj]C[you can
choose here to fight with f5, or just grab a lot of points with h3. either
way you choose, you have gained a lot.])

is a good place to start. the rest is up to your imagination. (you still
have the possibility of a c3 invasion.)])))
