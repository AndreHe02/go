C[hello kind reviewer

i'm black in this game

the middlegame was a desaster, a continuous misreading

but from the very beginning the game went wrong for black and i can't find out when and where and how happened

please, can you point out what happened in fuseki?


thanks!

;W[dc];B[oc];W[ci];B[de]LB[jd:A][pk:B]C[AB: Not a bad move per se, but puts you into defense right away. In general, it is rarely good to invade early. 'A' and 'B' are simple and good alternatives.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[cg];W[bg];B[bf];W[bh];B[dg]
LB[eg:A]C[AB: This move cannot be good. At least jump to 'A'. You need to get to the centre as eye space on the side is a bit narrow.]
;W[bb]
(;B[bc]LB[gf:A]C[AB; Best to ignore White. Jump 'A' instead. Then if White protects the upper side, you can attack the three stones on the right (see variations).]
;W[be];B[af];W[ce];B[cf];W[dd];B[ae];W[ee];B[df]C[AB: Take the two stones right away.]
;W[ac];B[bd];W[ei]C[AB: What a horrible result! Now White gets to strengthen his stones on the side and the Black group is still not alive yet.]
;B[fg];W[he];B[gh];W[jq];B[kc]C[AB: Good move. A move on the right may be even bigger.]
;W[qj];B[qh]C[AB: Somehow I think the direction is wrong, playing from the other side would be better. You are already very solid on the upper side, so there is no need to add more stones there.]
;W[po]
(;B[np]LB[nq:A][pm:B]C[AB: I think it is better to either play on the third line at 'A'  or to invade directly at 'B' (my preference). 'A' is better than your move as now you are open and the k3 stone is well-placed to undermine your group. But I prefer the invasion. You (a) are behind, (b) have strength on the right side, (c) can easily split White to start a double-attack. You don't need to kill, just finish sente to invade White's lower left afterwards.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[mq];B[nq];W[oj];B[oh]LB[hq:A]C[AB: Too small. Now is the time to take the initiative as you are behind. 'A' seems to be a good point as it puts pressure on the K3 stone. You absolutely must reduce White's lower-left.]
;W[jc];B[kd];W[dl]C[AB: It's getting more and more difficult....]
;B[cq]C[AB: Ok.];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep]LB[eq:A]C[AB: 'A' is possible for White.]
;B[eq];W[bp]LB[fq:A]C[AB: Mistake, should be 'A'.]
(;B[bq]LB[fp:A]C[AB: Mistake. You should make use of White's error and hane at 'A'. That is very big (see variation).]
;W[fq]C[AB: The difference is enormous....];B[fr];W[gq];B[gr]
;W[hr];B[hq];W[ir];B[hp];W[fo];B[io];W[ko];B[im];W[ij];B[gj]
;W[gl];B[ih]LB[hk:A]C[AB: I thiink connecting your stones at 'A' is good.]
;W[hk]TR[im][io][hp][hq]C[AB: Now the bottom group is under pressure. This is a recurring theme: It's not that the group will die, but during the whole game you are under pressure and White is not. You cannot win.]
;B[kn];W[lo];B[go];W[fp];B[gn];W[hm];B[hn];W[jo];B[jn];W[kl]
;B[jl];W[ln];B[km];W[il]LB[lm:A]C[AB: Clearly an overplay. White wants to kill, when enclosing at 'A' would be good enough to win.]
;B[lm];W[jk];B[jm];W[lk];B[mm];W[nn];B[mn];W[no];B[mo];W[mp]
;B[mr];W[lq];B[lr];W[kr];B[nm];W[op];B[pn];W[qn];B[on];W[oo]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[qm];W[rm];B[rn];W[qo];B[rl]LB[ql:A]C[AB: Big mistake! 'A' is much better.]
;W[pm];B[sm];W[pl]LB[om:A]C[AB: Capturing at 'A' is better.]
;B[om];W[ql];B[rm];W[rk];B[rq];W[ro];B[rp];W[so];B[sp]C[AB: Terrible mistake!]
;W[sn]LB[rr:A]C[AB: Just capture at 'A'!];B[ol];W[qk];B[mk]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[nj];B[gp]C[AB: Necessary? I think you always have G4 or J4 to make the eye.]
;W[rr];B[oq];W[sq];B[fn];W[dn];B[fj];W[qs];B[ns];W[ls];B[ps]
;W[pr];B[kq];W[kp];B[qr];W[rs]C[AB: White should continue the ko. He has much more to win than to lose.]
;B[pr];W[ok];B[ll];W[jh];B[ig];W[jf];B[fl];W[jb];B[kb];W[pf]
;B[qg];W[rd];B[rc];W[qc];B[re];W[qe]
(;B[sd]LB[pd:A]C[AB: Big mistake again! Just extend to 'A', there is no problem (see variation).]
;W[pd];B[rd];W[pc];B[od];W[oe];B[ne];W[nf];B[me];W[ob];B[mf]
;W[ng];B[nh]C[AB: It is usually bad to play one side first (N14), then the other side afterwards (O12). Just decide which side is better and play only there.]
;W[mg];B[jg];W[mh]C[AB: Now the game is lost for sure. Black has not enough points.]

;W[cj];B[di];W[hh];B[hi];W[ii];B[hg];W[li];B[kj];W[ki]C[AB: There are two things I think you should work on: First, you need to take the initiative, dont' get too many weak groups that keep you busy all game. You have been too much under pressure, no time to make points :-). Also, don't automatically answer your opponent's moves. You don't want to answer them, answer only if absolutely necessary. Second, there were some serious reading mistakes, so you should improve on that. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me (Andre.Bergholz@xrce.xerox.com).]
