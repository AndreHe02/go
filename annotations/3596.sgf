C[[Hi, I'm white, and I lost this game because of a simple end-game mistake.  However, I would like some comments on my play during the match.  Thank you very much.\]


djna: Yes, it's a shame about the snapback. So let's look at the rest of the game.

Overall, I think that in this game W did better than B at the phase of the game where the jose is just starting. In this game it's where W's thickness became really important.
So that's where W "won".];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ce]C[
djna: Personal opinion: I would not play this as white, B has the initiative and can negate W's plans.]
;B[cc]C[
djna: Seems premature, invading at 3-3 would not be good under 4-4, why is it good here?]
;W[ed]C[
djna: according to the books this is the only move];B[ec]
(;W[fd]C[
djna: this is one joseki line, but I really don't understand why this is thought to be acceptable for W, see variation in a couple of moves time

I don't like the W result in this joseki line, so how about the variation for this move?]
;B[fc];W[gd];B[gc];W[hc]C[[I'm not sure if this is an overplay on  my part.\]

djna: the books show the line in the variation, I think it is an overplay as you are left with a defect in your shape]
;B[cj]LB[cj:A]TR[hc]C[
djna: fundamentally the joseki result with the marked stone being not quite right.

My problem here is that I just don't see how to use W's thickness, A seems to negate that thickness so effectively.

Hence my doubts about the initial 5-3 move.

However perhaps the other joseki line is better];W[cm]LB[hd:A]
C[[I often have trouble at this point (I do the 4-4 / 5-3 opening a lot, and get mixed results).  I played this move to attack that stone into my wall.  However, my wall is floating, so sometimes (in other games), it gets into danger.  Am I attacking from the correct side?  I'm following both 1) Attack into thickness, and 2) Attack from the weak stone.\]

djna: the whole W position depends upon the W wall truly being "thick". So you cannot be concerned about the W wall being vulnerable. Without the defect at A you are pretty strong.

So, yes attacking from the right side];B[cg]
(;W[ef]C[[I'm not sure if this response is necessary.  It would seem my group would be floating if I don't make this move.  How about B15?\]

djna: I think this must be too slow, if you need to reinforce then you were not thick enough and your whole opening is wrong. See variations for some more comments]
;B[cf];W[be];B[hb]C[
djna: W likes B grovelling on the second line, I'm not really sure that B must do this, but it does preempt W sealing him in]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[jc];B[bc]LB[pj:A][jp:B]C[
djna: surely B doesn't need this? Unless W can kill, he doesn't need to play here.

A or B must be bigger.];W[qj]LB[dk:B][nq:A]TR[cm][dp]C[
djna: alternative approach is to build on the lower side by approaching at A this could work well with the two marked stones.

There's potential for constructing a moyo at the bottom, moves near B are likely to be sente against the black side group]
;B[jp];W[hq]CR[jp]LB[eq:A]TR[cm]C[
djna: the defect  of this move is that it encourages the 3-3 invasion and you don't get enough territory. I saw a pro describe this as a boxer with two fists spread aggresively (the marked stones) and getting punched on the jaw (the 3-3).

Thing is that the marked B stone erodes the W influence that gets built when B invades.]
;B[eh]SQ[pd]C[
djna: I guess B's plan is to make his group a little stronger before doing the 3-3 invasion.

If W can shut B in in sente then this move may be OK

I think that the marked stone is becoming isolated and needs attention, so I would be more concerned about dealing with that.]
;W[fh]LB[qf:A]C[
djna: does W Actually need to answer? I think that W is too cautious about this group

I would play A];B[fi];W[gh];B[eg];W[ff];B[cq];W[dq]C[

djna: just a little premature, but large. Whatever happens W must get sente]
;B[cp]
(;W[co];B[bo];W[cn]C[

djna: may conceed sente];B[bn];W[cr]LB[dr:A]C[
djna: Black should have played A];B[br];W[dr];B[bs];W[pn]C[[Looking at the board, my opponent has cash, and I have influence on one side of the board.  I wasn't sure which stone to attack, the upper right or the lower left.  I felt that O17 would have been bad b/c I would then have a leaky boat up there.\]


djna: my feeling is that W should play in the upper right because W should expect to press the B stone - also the high approach seems kind of odd, I suppose you are aiming for balance of high and low, but I'm not sure this works.]
;B[nq];W[qg];B[nc];W[re]C[
djna: let's evaluate the position now, see the variation]
(;B[bm]LB[qc:B][qo:A]C[
djna: I think that the right corners are bigger. A is very big for Black and white B will destabilise the two stones.]
;W[gi]LB[ei:B][ej:A][dk:C][ho:D]TR[fi]C[
djna: This is the kind of move that if it's sente it's good but otherwise is off the point (corners are more important)

Do you have a good follow up?

The two black groups are joined so W can probably get the marked stone or seal off the left with A, B C but Black has D to erase that potential.

I think the move is not sente and therefore bad];B[fj]C[
djna: Oh so it was sente ;-)];W[qq]TR[pn]C[[I'm not sure if this 3-3 is a good idea.\]

My first reaction is that the marked stone is damaged by the invasion and so it's as though you don't have a consistent strategy. But let's evaluate the board after the invasion.]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[or];B[oq];W[nr];B[mr];W[pq]
;B[mp]LB[pk:D][rk:C][jn:E][qp:A][ir:B]TR[qo][mq]SQ[re][qg][qj]
[jp]C[[But it ended in sente.  Perhaps I was lucky.\]


I can't see a way for B to take sente without leaving the marked stone in danger of being cut off.

So, usng my previous estimate as a benchmark we've moved from a situation where in this corner where if W plays A instead of invading, then black has about 8 points more than W but W has potential to this where White has about 7 points (Black has sente yose against the corner) and B has probably on 2 pretty certain points but lots of potential

The marked W group is very strong so a lot of the potential is reduced.

And W has sente. So overall I'd say this was a success];W[qc]
C[
djna: excellent move];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[hn]LB[qb:C][pl:B]
[qm:A]C[[I'm not sure if this was the right move.  I was considering saving the Q6 stone, but I then decided to leave it as is (perhaps use its aji later).\]


djna: setting Q6 in motion just gives B a target. It's not a cutting stone so you want to sacrifice it. Playing moves nearby such as A or B might be good.

The move you played is pretty big though.

I would prefer to play C. This leaves the B group open to attack and is worth quite a few points.]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[jr];W[ip];B[jq];W[hr];B[pm];W[mm]LB[qb:A]C[[There are no more weak black groups to attack, so tried to make territory in the center.  Normally, I don't like doing this, but I can't really start a fight and use my influence effectively.\]


djna: I think that A goes give a Black group to pressure a bit]
;B[nn]CR[mm]LB[oj:A]C[

djna: this is a very bad move, hangs onto a few points.

Instead B should be more active.

Either play elsewhere or find a way to attack the marked stone perhaps playing  A first]
;W[mn]LB[md:A]C[
djna: we're now arguaing over a very few points.

How about playing A instead?
Suddenly W has a  moyo.];B[mo]C[
djna: B is just too attached to these few points.];W[nm]C[
djna: good because it builds thickness but it really should not be sente]
;B[on]C[
djna: this sequence has seen B secure 4 points and W huge thickness]
;W[ok]LB[md:A]SQ[mm][nm][mn]C[
djna: A is bigger, press that nearly weak group.

W can give up all three marked stones  - no need to hang on to them so no need to protect them]
;B[rk];W[rj];B[qk];W[pk];B[rc];W[of]TR[rk]C[[Too weak?  I was considering the large knight's extension at O14, but I was wary of his thickness at Q16.\]


djna: O14 is better, but this is the right area

djna: in the last few moves B seems to have lost sight of the whole board poisition, suddenly W has a huge centre territory

By my estimate the game is now in W's favour. The marked move was just too small]

In other words W needs to find 10 more points and he has sente.

It seems that W has more growth potential, A, B and C all are growing moves. I don't see major moves like this for B.

So (and I'll admit I'm surprised by this estimate - I thought W had a lost game) the game may actually be pretty close.]
