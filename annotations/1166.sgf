LB[dn:a]C[Answering at 'a' would be the right way. It would be much more solid. With this weakness you have in your shape, it will be harder to invade _if it becomes necessary_ the black territory on the right.]
;B[jp];W[qn];B[qo]
(;W[ql]LB[qi:a][nq:b]C[This extension is small. The extenstion could be at R9.    Black can extend at 'a' or 'b' . I have chosen 'b' on the 3rd line thinking of the 4th line stone at K4.]
;B[qk]C[Black's response is wrong: 1. He should not make a contact move. it makes your opponent stronger.  2. It is too far from his black formation at the top.]
;W[qi]C[I believe it was a good response from W although it could one more point farther (at R12). That would not be as direct, but would remove a possible extension point at R13 (which now exists)

I expected this to turn into a running fight as I am showing in the variation.]

(;B[qm]C[Well, couldn't understand this black move. :)]
(;W[pk]LB[pl:A]C[My conclusion from this is, it is a complicated shape to analyze. And this move is not helping at all :)

The one you suggested ("A") could be an option. I tried to analyze it for a few moves.]
;B[rl]C[With this move Black take the advantage because he is putting your stones in atari.]
;W[qj];B[pl]C[Now  you really have to settle your stones.]
(;W[ok]C[And I probably would play at Q13.];B[pn];W[cj]C[Your shape is not safe yet.   You always have worry about your weak groups first.]
;B[rj]LB[ld:a][qg:b][of:c]C[Black is not attacking strong. He could have played at the marked locations. Some are loose but still much bigger.]
;W[ri];B[gc];W[jc]C[Black made a mistake but coming too close.

And you punished him... That is good.];B[kd];W[jd]C[Seperate them.
Good.];B[je];W[ie];B[pj];W[oi];B[ol];W[nk]C[Good moves until here.

Black is controlling the flow of the game here with forcing moves but your answers were good.

Black made couple of big mistakes. Now your group on the right is very stable.
And you can invade around N-O 17. You have gained territory at the top left, along with influence towards the left.

Black added little bit more influence towards his bottom territory.]
;B[ge]MA[id]C[The marked point is getting weak now.];W[ee]C[I would use the other direction.

Your corner is very strong. But not your 3 stones.];B[kc];W[hd]

(;W[kb];B[lb]C[Big mistake from both sides here!

Black should have cut.];W[ke];B[jf];W[lc];B[ld];W[mc];B[md]
;W[mb];B[lf];W[eh];B[id]C[Well, since I did not understand the reasoning behind the last 10 moves, I wont be able to comment.   Now Black has cut and White has given away a nice chance.

At least in compensation White has a living group at the top and territory on the left. Another relief is that Black and White groups are facing each other and therefore, Black could not create big influence towards center.]

(;W[hb]C[Extension here is not necessary. P18 is there to be used when necessary.

And this move should be at J18 not H18.];B[ib];W[ja];B[gb];W[la]
C[Not needed.];B[hf]
(;W[nq]TR[eq][eo]C[The two marked Black stones are not very strong.

With this in mind, I see two approaches. Directly attacking at H4. Or playing at N3 to see how Black will play. If black closes the corner as he does in this game, I may have better prospects.]
;B[oq]C[If O3 were at N3, you could have moves more lightly.]
;W[kq];B[mq]C[I see this O3 stone as a sacrifice now.

You can develop around L3 towards the left (knowing Black is weaker there)]

Sometimes it is very important to connect.

I have observed a couple of places where you play diagonal...  But as you see here, solid connections can make you much stronger.]

It was all yours, and is probably worth 25-30 points.

And a couple more mistakes at the end game sealed the victory for Black. (the stones lost at R17, letting in Black around J12)

Your big territory on the left gave you a big lead although in tactical (local) fights, Black played better than you.   Overall, try to play a bit, just a bit more solid.   When you are weak, don't forget to strengthen yourself before attacking.

I hope the variations and comments I added are useful..

Enjoy :)])
