Review by John Rae

In my comments I try to suggest some ideas and concepts which will be of help  rather than evaluate every individual move made. Therefore  no comment does not mean the move could not have been better

Caveat - Do not assume my comments are 100% correct. There are many players stronger than I who can suggest alternatives and things I have missed.]

Since both B bottom corners are open I don't think an approach is necessarily the best thing to do first. I would have considered  putting pressure on the 2 B stones on top.]

 I'd prefer to play along the bottom so that the extension had some threat which white might feel compelled to respond to.

A or B seem to give White a little more to think about. I'd play on the 4th line since White has an outside position in the bottom right so black does not want to be pushed against the bottom with white building further on an outside wall]

Fair enough but now may be the time to ignore the middle and try to do some serious damage to White's territory.
