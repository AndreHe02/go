C[Hello, I played W here.
I think I didn't play too bad in this game, but B won with a small margin in the end.
I
just want to know, where in the end game that I can turn the table and
win the game instead? Or do I have to do it during mid-game?

KKMD: Both, sir ! :-)


Also, I would appreciate if you point out my weaknesses. Thank you beforehand.


KKMD:
First, I must admit it is my first review (for the GTL or whatever
else), and I enjoyed it very much, though it took much more of my time
than I thought. Of course, at many places I couldn't make up my mind
about the value of some continuations, and when I did, I probably
misread or misevaluated. What I say should be taken for what it is :
speculations of a 2-digits kyu. Speficically, I think it should be
interesting to verify all tactic lines I gave. At last, I apologize for
the certainly numerous mistakes I did in trying to write in english.]
;B[od];W[dp];B[po];W[dd];B[dj];W[cm]LB[cn:A][qd:b][pi:c]C[Should I play at A instead?

KKMD:
I think these moves are rather equivalent here. But maybe this is not
such a good idea to play here, since you will have hard time if you
want to attack the D10 stone, which is on the 4th line. So a move
around C7 seems less urgent to be than a move around, say, b or c,
because of the variation.]
(;B[dn]
(;W[co]LB[cn:A]C[Again, is A better?

KKMD: Yes, A is the natural move here, it simply preserves connection between your stones.]
;B[cn];W[bn];B[dm];W[do]MA[co][do][dp]LB[bm:a]C[KKMD:
This move is awful ! The marked stones form  the well-known empty
triangle, which is an ugly form you should try to avoid. Here, as
often, playing it is completely useless, it is better to connect at a,
for instance.];B[bm];W[bo];B[cl]C[KKMD: Now compare the position
with the one you would have gotten if you had played A at move 9. Now
your corner is smaller and, more important, the black group becomes
strong.];W[jp]LB[qd:a][pi:b]MA[od][po]C[KKMD: Good point (although
I feel I would have played around A) . Now I think you can aim at B to
separate the marked stones.];B[gp];W[mp];B[kp]
(;W[oq]MA[kp]C[KKMD: Now that's an interesting move. I would have been mesmerized by the fear of being cut by the L4 stone.]

[io:b][ho:c]MA[jo][jp]C[KKMD:
Unnecessary again, you're wasting a move. It is better to add liberties
to the marked stones, by playing a and b. Then you can pursue with c,
go toward the center, or tenuki.];B[jn];W[no]C[I don't think this is a very good move. In fact, I think this was bad.

KKMD: I do not fully agree, let's see why...];B[oo]C[KKMD: Black cannot allow white to play here before him.]

you pushed the marked group.];B[mk];W[qk];B[ql];W[qe];B[qd]

(;W[hq]MA[hq][iq][ir]LB[eq:a]C[KKMD:
This is again the archetype of bad shape. A would have been more
consistent (see variation).];B[gq];W[en]LB[eq:a]MA[co][do][dp]
[bo][bn]C[KKMD: Overplay, A is safer. Now the marked group is endangered.]

You're a lucky, lucky bastard. Thank God for black didn't play toward
the corner first.];B[dr];W[cr];B[ds];W[fs]C[KKMD: Bad. Since black can't be killed, you should save this move for a ko threat.]
;B[fr];W[cs];B[gs];W[es]C[KKMD:
Same remark.];B[er];W[is]C[KKMD: The only purpose of this move is to
induce a ko thread at F1. So this is a *very* bad move ; you could
almost as well pass.];B[oh];W[pg];B[og];W[of];B[nf];W[oi];B[oe]
;W[pf];B[ni];W[oj];B[ok];W[ho]C[KKMD: Completely useless, black could not cut.]
;B[nj]
(;W[pj]LB[fc:A][cf:B][qi:a]C[This is not necessary, is it?
I think, either A or B is better, am I wrong?

KKMD:
I think this is necessary, to prevent a black move at A (see
variation). For a reason of shape, and to obey the proverb "the
ennemy's key point is yours", I would, as white, play at A myself.]
;B[fc];W[cg]LB[cf:a]C[KKMD:
A bit loose, considering you're playing toward a black stronghold.
Following that idea, A is more usual, so probably safer, especially in
this situation.];B[jd];W[cj];B[ck];W[bj];B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[be]

A better?];B[ae];W[af]LB[ab:a]C[KKMD: It was not too late to play at A.
Now black can live without condition by playing here himself.]

bad move. I think if I had moved somewhere else, I could've won the

because it spoils a virtual ko threat, but that's all. Since it doesn't
lost point and is sente, that's not *so* bad. You can always play at S2
later.];B[na];W[pb]C[Duhh!

[ss]C[A close game indeed.
So, I think I wasted two moves during the end game that cost me the game.

(KKMD: True enough, but black did the same.)


I would also appreciate if you can comment on my general style of play, what can be improved, etc.

(KKMD:
I have three things to say. First, take some time, even the slightest,
before each move you play, to ask yourself what is its purpose. If you
don't have a answer, then don't play it, cause it probably has none.
Try to avoid playing useless moves that just seem to say to the
opponent "ok, I pass, show me more". In this game your moves 103, 115,
141, 205 and 239 are in this category. Now, I don't want to bring you a
false joy, but just think that a wasted move in the opening or in the
middle game is like a handicap stone given to the opponent (well, that
may be false, but just think about it), and you can see how much you
could improve :-).  Second, when you have gone through my first point,
try to get a feeling for shape, in particular forbid yourself to play
empty triangles, unless there is an excellent reason to do so. Third
and last, try to keep an eye on large scale. In this game, with his
first two moves, black showed he 
was going to build great things
on the right side. But you did invade there only on move 69, after
having greatly helped black to build his moyo. Well, as they say,
always look on the right side of life.)


Thank you again for the review.

(KKMD: You're welcome. I'm close to think that I enjoyed reviewing this game pretty more than you playing it.)]
