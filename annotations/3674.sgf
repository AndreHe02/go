The comments are mainly focused on black's moves.

The top five issues are:
1. Have the stones work together
2. Lean against strong groups to strengthen your group in preparation to attack another weaker group
3. Careful not to push your opponent in the wrong direction forcing him to get stronger
4. Be willing to sacrifice one area to gain another, choose which is larger, or more strategically important and support it.
5. Be willing to sacrifice stones, make him use a few moves to capture the stone or two, while you get a bigger profit.

The top five moves to change were:
15. Connect the stones or take the corner.
27. Look for bigger moves, don't push his group into your weak group
30. Keep his group out of the center, don't let him cut you up.
39. Connect your groups, keep him out of your center.
45. Continue with your excellent attack, complete the lower left play.

My Go teacher suggested the change of move 45.];B[qd];W[dc]

(;B[qj]C[Q: Would R9 be better? would it work as a pincer?

S> R10 appears to work well with P17 and R16.  I think you made the best move.

S> if there were a stone at K4 the pincer would be ok.  the variation of this move shows that scenario]
;W[jc];B[oo]C[S> This is setting up a shape that black used twice, having two stones on a knight move, then extending far.   This does give a large potential area, however it also invites the group getting divided.  Consider playing more close and stable to avoid creating a target for attack.]
;W[qm];B[jq];W[gd];B[do];W[ce]
(;B[bp]CR[fp]C[S> I consider this a mistake.  Usually when pressure is applied to one side of a group it will respond by growing in the opposite direction.

S> B4 causes damage to K3 because B4 induces move F3 or G3, which starts to separate D5 and K3.  Black has no stones around D10 to give support, so D5 wants to work with K3

S> K3 was far from P5 and Q3, that style of play needs more support on the ends, it is as if you have created two weak groups, although they give the illusion of being strong.]
;W[fq]
(;B[cj]C[S> This is creating a weak group.  It is inviting white to grow F3 and attack both D5 and K3 at the same time.

Consider these items:
1.  How close D3 and F3 are together 
2.  How low B4 is, it does help protect territory, but it does not prevent the cut between C10 and D5.
3.  How strong C15 is.  If C15 were weaker you could play around C13, attacking C15 and build up that side.  

D5 is not strong enough to defend the C8 area];W[pl];B[oj];W[nl]
;B[mj];W[mp]
(;B[mq]TR[mn][om]C[Q: Bad play? I wasnt sure exactly where to block this

S> The exchange went well for black
1. Black has a large area around R13 almost secure.
2. White is investing alot of stones in a place that comes "pre reduced".

S> Need to decide where you want the game to go, there are several ways to block / connect / cut.  Each is good depending on your style.  I like moyos, so I would go for M8 L6 plays, sacrificing P5 and keeping O8 from connecting to the center.

S> Making the contact play at N3 will tend to make both sides stronger.  However N3 is pushing N4 towards his friends at O8.  A move to separate O8 from N4 would help.  Again you can see how the F3 move is damaging K3, because if you move around N6 to attack O8 then N4 can work with F3 to attack K3]
;W[dm]C[S> White is working to divide your groups D5 is being devided from K3.  D5 is being devided from C10.  D7 has this power to try and divide in two different directions.  Now you can see how B4 induced F3 which starts to damage K3]

(;B[cm]TR[fo]C[Q: again the same

S> C7 as a contact play works to make both sides stronger.  contact plays are defensive, slightly distant moves to attack.  I would push to separate D7 from F3, see alternate move.]
;W[mn]
(;B[rl]LB[lc:B][cg:A][kk:D][jo:C]C[S> This is small compared to other possible moves.  It also causes damage to Q3.

The potential meaning it has are these:  
1. It starts to take the base from R7.  The R7 group has the L7 area and the S3 area to run to, so taking away the base does help, but it can escape easily.
2. It takes territory / profit from white.  The points gained here are much less than several other places, such as M17, C13
3. It makes R10 stronger, giving it a base.

The damage it may cause is this:
1. The S8 move induces R7 to become stronger, it squeezes R7 downwards or outwards.  At the moment Q3 and P5 are a bit weaker than the Q8 group.  
2. The S8 move induces R7 to extend out to somwhere like K5, L9 or]
;W[qq]C[S> induced by S8, causing Q3 and R5 to become stronger]
;B[qr]TR[lc][ll]C[S> I consider this smaller than the marked moves.]
;W[mk]C[S> Is this surprising for white to let R3 die?  White is happy to sacrifice the R3 stone to:
1. keep sente, you responded with R2, it did it's job.
2. defend the S5 area.
3. white is ok with Q3 living, so making it stronger with R3 R2 exchange was worth it.

I think you game would improve alot if you were willing to make sacrificing moves like R3 and let them die.

N9 This is a strong move for white.  It works well with all the stones on the board.  It does these things:

1. Threatens to cut off N10 from the K8 area.
2. The N15 area is open, white M10 will have space to run to.
3. The K17 group is strong to run to.  A fight around L12 after a cut will have the advantage for white.
4. How strong O8 is to push from.  White can attack without worry for Q8 being short on liberties, or getting cut off.]

(;B[cg]TR[fo][lc][lj]C[S> A big move to get territory and strengthen C10, however it allows N10 to be cut off.  Also a move at M17 would work better with your stones at N10.]
;W[lj]C[S> this is where white won the game.];B[mi];W[cl];B[cn]
;W[qp];B[ek]TR[dl]C[S> D8 seems ok.];W[rr]C[S> moves like this are how you can win a computer.  let's think about what it does:
1. get sure life for R5 group
2. threaten to take R2 stone
3. get some more territory in S3 area
4. gives a stronger base to attack from, with R5 alive he can attack from R5 without worry, N9 is connected to that base, so he can have fun in the M7 area without worries of making two eyes.

I think this move ( S2 ) is small, there are several larger moves.  I say it is small to suggest ignoring it, let him have R2.  What happens if he gets R2?
1. N3 becomes weaker
2. territory is lost
3. P5 becomes weaker

my style at this point is to:
1. play G4 or G5, 
2. connect K3 with D5, 
3. threaten F3 group
4. reduce what territory N6 will get by attacking F3.

F3 will live, but as he is defending, you are expanding to fill the H9 H5 area.]

(;B[qs]TR[dl][gp][lc]C[S> White has invested many stones to this area, how about letting this place go and look for something bigger.]

(;B[lg]C[S> here is a comment from my 3dan teacher:
M13 is the turning point, it is horrible, his style of play is to push you around but then all of that took a 180 at m13 but if he would have e5 then white n12 he could just p13 no problem. 

He attacks well and pushes well, he just doesn't defend a lot. 

Some of his moves may look big but there weak because he was greedy. If he would just learn to defend more with each game he would be able to attack better and he would become a better player by getting past his obstacle. 

He lacks experience, he attacks and pushes well because most likely he studies games and problems, but now he needs to play more games. For him it will not matter if he plays slow games or fast games at this time. This is what I say about his game.]
;W[dj]C[S> One of these is going to happen... E6 connecting with F3 or D8 extending to G16.  Each has its side effects.  Which do you want to live with?]

(;B[dk]TR[eo]C[S> This move does a few things:

1. Attacks D8 but cutting it off from D10, how can the D8 group live?  By connecting with F3, what result will that have? it separates F7 from D5.

2. threatens to put D10 into a ladder, K17 is a ladder breaker so it doesn't work.]

(;W[fp];B[ao]C[Q: Is this move necessary for life?

S> I agree, a move in this area is needed to live.];W[ej];B[fj]
;W[hp]C[S> This starts a long chain of moves where white is leaning against a strong group ( K3 ) and preparing to attack F7.  With each move H4 / F4 gets stronger, and K3 becomes stronger, but F7 does not get stronger.]

(;B[jo]TR[ei][gf]C[S> this induces H6 which pushes towards your F7 weak group.]
;W[hn];B[hl];W[iq];B[ir];W[jn];B[er]C[S> This is a fun move, threatening to cut D3 from F3, however E11 would have done much more.]

;W[fl];B[gl]LB[jj:C][gk:A][hk:1][jk:2][il:3][gm:B]C[Q: Any way to save it from this point on?

S> no, I see no way to save the center group.

S> Let's look at escaping or building eyes.
potential eye places that are false eyes:
A: False eye, white will move G10, then black will move G9
B: Black cannot move G6 to make an eye at G7, R6 does not have another way to connect with G8
C: For K10 to be an eye black needs many stones, K11, L11, L10 and L9  this is too much to ask.
