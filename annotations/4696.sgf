C[this was a game with a stronger player. im not sure if handi's count as fair game, but i found some good points about this game and some bad points. anyways, thanks for looking at it. it means a lot to me.

Hi there. Some introductory comments: 

* I will prefix my comments with G: if there are other comments on the same move. 

* In general I dont like reviewing won games. I think all the games I ever reviewed for GTL was won by the person requesting the review. I think I might be guilty as well though - I seem to remember that the first game I have reviewed was also won :) 
However, a won game is often boring because the player just rolled over the opponent and had the feeling he played well because he never had any resistant... 

* In this case you played a stronger opponent, although I wouldn't count the difference between 21k and 22k for much. However, he should have won if it wasn't for the terrible terrible blunder at 267, so I suppose the game is kinda lost after all :) 

So have fun, and I hope you learn something useful!];B[pp];W[dd]

G: I'm no joseki expert, but it looks a bit funny to me. I think white can now get both bottom and lhs, you should take one. A, B or C are more common responses.]

(;W[rc];B[pc]LB[od:B][qf:A]C[this is good shape in the center if i remember correctly, but where does it leave openings?

G: I think here you should be very happy with this - white has spent 3 stones, is not alive and has practically no territory. The shape leaves peeping points at A and B (i.e. if white plays there you pretty much have to respond.]

;W[ec];B[fd];W[cf];B[eq]LB[pj:B][jq:A]C[would playing somewhere else effect the rest of the game?

G: Yes :) Every move makes the game into a different one! 

This is ok - but i dont like the timing. Since you played on 4x4 in the bottom right, there are no nice follow up moves in the corner, otherwise this would be a nice time for a corner enclosure. With Q4 I would go for A or B.]

C[in the end the game was registered as 111.5 to 115, but i forgot to count d3, so it should have ended as 111.5 to 118 in favor of black. anyways, overall this was one of my better games, and i appreciate your comments.

G: The game looked fun to play, and it was very dynamic, with the player ahead changing often. To improve quickly I would recommend playing lots - both of the players here lose big because they make very basic mistakes in connecting/cutting/etc. Play many quick games and you will quickly learn what moves are possible are what are not. Dont be afraid to lose! (And if you succeed, tell me how!)
