C[Basically what I want to know is, I came close to killing the big black group in the upper right. Could I have killed it?

Also any tips in the opening or especially the endgame would be much appreciated. Thank you very much.

crux: Hi, my name is Bernd, I'm about 1d at my club.  Please use an sgf viewer that clearly shows which nodes have variations, as I don't explicitly mention all of them.  I recommend qgo, ggo, cgoban1 or jago.  There are some problems with cgoban2, the KGS client.]

;B[pn];W[qm];B[mq]LB[iq:B][jq:A]C[crux: Extremely narrow. More usual is to either keep pushing or to extend around A or B]

C[Should I have played here or is there somewhere better? This seems kind of small.

crux: I'd say it is quite big.  If you are disconnected, your group is weak, and this is a nice thick way of ensuring safety.  Capturing cutting stones is rarely small (unless they are cutting live groups).]

LB[bc:C][bo:D][hl:A][os:B]C[Should I have played A instead of here?

crux: Well, certainly not here.  The marked black stone is not a cutting stone, so capturing it is not very valuable.  Black does get some nice forcing moves if White omits A.  There are other big endgame moves (B, C, D).]
