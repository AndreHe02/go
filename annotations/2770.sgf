RE[W+15.5]

AB[dp][pd]C[Hello, I am Jeffery from Hong Kong, SAR, China. Thanks for your time and reviewing my game.

This is a 2 stones handicap game. I think this game, I am very weak in mid-game battle, and I lost a lot points. I would like the reviewer give more advises in the mid-game battle. Thank you very much.

R: Sure, no prob.  I'll preface my comments with a R:];W[pq]
;B[po]C[C: This is my usual way to play, don't let my opponent get the corner easily.]
;W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pm]C[C: This is aimming at R11.

Q: Am I right? Or just connect them at Q6, then play at Q10/R10?

R: It's a matter of style and preference.  Q7 allows a larger extension to R11, but leaves white possible moves like P5 or R8, which are weaknesses avoided by playing Q6.  Both are joseki.  I'd say that because you have Q16, Q7 is maybe a little better than Q6...]

(;W[cd]
(;B[qi]C[C: I just think R11 was much more important than the left upper corner.

Q: Am I right? Or just as my usual play, attack that corner?

R: White ommitted the joseki move of O3, I'd be apt to attach at P3 and start a fight.  But disregarding that...R11 is also okay, because it helps to strengthen and settle your 3 black stones at R6, as well as preparing to take territory.  No need to worry about white enclosing the top left corner.]
;W[qf]C[C: I just not so sure how to respond to this.

R: because you have R11, the attachment is a good response.  I'll see what other options I can think of..]

(;B[qe];W[pg]
(;B[oi]C[C: I played this was to ensure the lower area.

Q: Am I right? And how to attack those two white stones?

R: this doesn't do as much for you as O16 does.  the right side stones are still in good shape, the top black stones in the corner need help more..]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[rg]C[C: At this moment, I realised that white wanted to make a living in this area.

Q: Can I prevent this, or just let it gets as less points as possible?

R: you can prevent white from getting 2 eyes on the side, but he will be able to slide to the center...so you should continue to attack it and get compensation, but trying to kill this group outright at this stage of the game is a little premature.]

(;B[rh]C[C: I think this was a wrong move. It should play at S15.

Q: Am I correct?

R: correct ^.^  S15 is better for taking eyespace, and it secures the black corner..]
;W[qh];B[ri];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd];W[oe]C[C: Now white lived and pointing to the centre. Too bad.]
;B[nc];W[od];B[oc];W[fq];B[hq];W[mq];B[kq];W[dr]
(;B[cq]C[R: I'm not sure I like this move...  It's joseki, but black ends up with a cramped position on the bottom side, and white is settled]
;W[fo]
(;B[cn];W[hp]C[C: Again! White made an easy living.

Q: How to prevent this happen?];B[ip]C[Q: Should I play at G4?]
;W[ho];B[jo];W[lr]
(;B[kr];W[ec]C[C: Now white gets his corner, too bad.

Q: When should I attack that corner in the previous moves?

R: you can omit L2 if you want, black will get small territory there, and those black stones are not in danger of being killed.]

(;B[jd]C[Q: Should I play more closer to white at J17?

R: Well..  K16 doesn't really accomplish a whole lot.  you can't make a moyo with it, it doesn't really take terriotry, and it's not threatening to attack any white stones, since the white group on the right is solid.  I think any of the other moves here are a bit better...  J17 is still too far away from the white corner.]
;W[hc];B[ic];W[ld]
(;B[lc];W[md];B[mc];W[kd];B[kc];W[cg]
(;B[dj]C[C: I think this was another wrong move, it should play at C10.

Q: Am I correct?

R: C10 isn't a big move, but it's better than D10 I suppose.]
;W[cj];B[ck];W[ci];B[dk]TR[ck][cn][cq][dj][dp]C[R: Black is quite overconcentrated here...]
;W[di]C[C: Now I know that the upper left area was white.

Q: How to reduce his land ?

R: E15 is the reduction move, and the B16 probe can also be useful at the right time]

(;B[gk];W[mo];B[lp];W[mp];B[lo];W[ln];B[kn];W[lm];B[jl]C[C: I just don't feel comfortable, therefore I jump to the centre.

Q: Am I right?

R: sounds good to me...  it also cuts off the white stones on the bottom left for sure, so if white lets you push him around there, you can make it difficult for him to life.]
;W[em]
(;B[dm]C[R: hrmm...what are you afraid of?  E7 doesn't threaten anything.  use the opportunity to attack white.]
;W[el];B[ek];W[fi]
(;B[gn]C[C: I think this should play at H11, and heading to the centre.

Q: Am I correct? Or having other great moves?

R: G3 is the move I see to take away easy white eyespace.  Yyou don't need to run to H11...your stones are safe.]
;W[fn];B[gm];W[gq];B[hr];W[gr];B[ng];W[hs];B[ir];W[is];B[js]
;W[gs];B[nl];W[kf]
(;B[je]C[R: this move is not necessary...if you play on that side, play H16, then you can still reduce.  Why not cut at N6?  White can't do anything about it.]
;W[nn];B[op];W[on];B[pn];W[oq];B[np];W[rn];B[rm];W[ro];B[hd]
;W[gc]
(;B[fe]SQ[ci][cj][di][fi]C[C: I think this is too far, it should be G15.

R: right, becuase of the marked stones, you can't reduce at E15 or F15 like you really want to..]
;W[gd]
(;B[he]C[Q: Should I play at G15?

R: look at variation.  H15 is a kinda painful move to have to make, and it does look like G15 is possible..]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[ff]
(;B[hf];W[fg];B[ke];W[le];B[lf]C[C: I think this cutting was quite success. But I missed the change to kill all the white stones.]
;W[mf];B[lg];W[jg]C[R: white can't make this move, he needs to protect against black O16]

(;B[ig];W[jh];B[mg];W[ii]
(;B[nd];W[of]
(;B[nf];W[sm];B[sl];W[sn];B[rl];W[lk]
(;B[kj]C[C: I played this wanted to kill those four stones, but fail.

Q: Can I kill those stones?

R: Looks like it to me.  He can play H12 right now, and they will be safe, but he protects his bottom left stones (which do need protection).]
;W[go]

Thank you very much.

R: lets see...

White got away with having some weak shapes and killable stones which black didn't attack and kill.  this often happens in handicap games.  White was able to settle himself too easily, and black did not take enough in compensation.  It seemed that you generally had the right kinds of ideas, but not always the best way of going about it.  You had the chance to make more severe moves than you did sometimes, and I think that made the difference.  Good game, and good luck. (^.^)]
;B[tt];W[tt])
(;B[ep];W[sd];B[fp];W[gp];B[cr]C[R: white must protect here, so you have at least 1 ko threat...but you need more than that to win this fight..]
