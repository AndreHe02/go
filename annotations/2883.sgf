C[Hello - I'm playing black, and lost in a very close game. I've been playing for a couple of months and am looking for some general areas in my game which I can focus on in order to improve

I think I could have been more aggressive at times - could you suggest some points?

Thanks for reviewing this game

Tim Jay

;B[jp]C[RB>>> White is foolishh to let blacck build this type of formation. This is very powerful for black and gives him a significant advantage.]
;W[qn];B[mq];W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[RB>>> Wrong direction. A play at R4 would split white. While white could probably live in teh corner, the black wall that would face up would more than compensate black and would give him thickness to attack from. (See variation)]
;W[qp];B[qi];W[qk]C[RB>>> Comparred to the last variation white is strong now and black's stone at R11 is feeling weak rather than in control.]

RB>>> There is another joseki that you may want to look at in this situation. (See variation)]
;W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[RB>>> Do not be afraid to slpit and fight. Black is in the driver's seat here. This is even better for black than the other corner. Again because of the D10 stone. (See variation)]
;W[cp];B[cl];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq]C[I was happy at this point with three pretty safe groups and a bit more influence towards the centre than white. I quite often lose the corners like this - how big a problem is that?

RB>>> It depends on what you get for losing the crners. But as the variations show, there are better and worse ways of "losing" corners. In this case black did not fare as well. White got the corner but still has access to the center, a loss for black.]

[la][ka][ja][ia][ha][ga][fa][ea][da][ca][ba][aa]C[RB>>> It was close, but it didn't have to be. Black was way ahead in teh opening and then slowly but surely gave just enough back to white to let him eek out a win. I suspect white knew he was fortunate to have won this one. I'm sure he felt he was behind for a lot of the game.

I honestly think the difference was the two lower corners. Please take a little time to study the 4-4 joseki that white used here twice. When white jumped in on teh 3-3 after approaching. Typically this is a move that sacrifices the original approach stone as I showed you. But white played it too early. With 3-3 point invasions, timing is everything. Because white played a poor opening, he was desperrate to establish himself in your area of influence and took great risks to do so. Learning how to respond to this type of mistake will help you immensely. 

Good luck, and please let me know if you have any follow on questions.

Sincerely,

Tom Obenchain
