C[Dear reviewer.
This is a game played on KGS between bommel (1d, white) and lordofpi (2k).
Please review for both colors.

We both entered our question and thoughts at the appropriate moves in this sgf.

thanks
in advance

arend: Hi both of you.
Nice game and thanks a lot for your questions. As I am only 2-3 stones stonger than the two of you, you shouldn't take this as a complete review. I might have overlooked things that are worth commenting, and I might even have made wrong comments...

As usual, here is the place for some general remarks:
As for black, I think you had a little luck winning this game, but you showed good fighting skills. If you learn to also play the more solid, slow looking move at the time, and improve your judgment for shape (don't squeeze out your opponent as you did on the left side!), you should be one-dan soon.
And white: I think your positional judgement isn't much worse than mine. But I think you should be more ambitious in reading out fights. Don't play such a keima at D6 without reading out what happens if the opponent cuts! Don't start a costly ko without reading out the consequences! Also, you missed a couple of occasions to punish black more severely for his shape defects. (And you missed to kill black's invasion at the top.)
So read out the fights precisely, and then rely on your reading (if it turns out wrong, you will have learned s.th. to improve it).

Enjoy!
Arend];B[qd];W[dc];B[co];W[oc]C[Bommel (W): Now I think P17 is a
bad move, because White ends very low. Which move is better here?
arend: P17 is fine. You can find this pattern (the upper side) in many pro games.
(Try it out on gobase.org or with kombilo.)];B[qq]C[lordofpi (B): this seems strange now, i wanted to spend only 1 move on that corner. maybe Q4 is a little better?
arend: I'd prefer Q4 but I couldn't argue which one is better. However...]
;W[pf];B[od];W[pd];B[pe];W[pc];B[oe]C[arend: ...I think this joseki choice does not quite fit with the 3-3 stone in the lower right.
After this joseki, you definitely want to move the R3 stone to Q4!]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[re];B[pg]
(;W[mc]C[arend: The joseki gave white a low position at the upper side. So why don't you just play this move one line higher, at M16?
You are strong enough to modify josekis to fit into the global position, so...do it!]
;B[of];W[rd]C[lordofpi (B): i think this joseki gave black a good result.
arend: See my earlier comments.];B[de];W[cg]
(;B[ef]C[lordofpi (B): I didn't play C17 because i felt a wall facing N17 is worthless.
arend: But playing C17 doesn't immediately lead to a wall facing N17!
On the other hand, I think white can get a good result now:]

(;W[fd]C[Bommel (W): Is this continuation ok, or is it better to strengthen C13?
arend: I think the joseki in the variation looks more interesting.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[dh];W[pp]C[Bommel
(W): I felt this is the only move here. C11 doesn't seem to be a real
option for W. Is this true?
arend: I agree.];B[pq];W[op];B[ro];W[oq]C[Bommel (W):
P3 is not joseki, but I felt that the bottom is more important than the
rigth side (Q8), because S14 is open. Is P3 playable here?
arend: Yes, S14 is open, but black is very thick at the top, and you could devalue that thickness by playing at Q7. I think it is wrong to believe that the right side is small.]
;B[pn]C[lordofpi (B): is this the correct response to P3?
arend: I'd think so.];W[kp]
(;B[ci]C[lordofpi
(B): i went for secure profit here but it feels a bit slow. do you
think a move on the bottom would work better?
arend: I don't know. I'd like to play at H4 here. This aims at invading at N3/N2.
However, if you play at the top you should definitely play solidly at C12.
 Because of the aji of the white stone at C13, you had to add two defense moves later.]

(;W[ep];B[dq]C[lordofpi
(B): E4 looks good for white. again i went for profit with D3 but i'm
not sure if black should have been more aggressive.
arend: The corner is big!];W[eq];B[dr];W[dn]C[arend: Overplay.]

(;B[cn]C[arend: Now this is too submissive. White asks being cut, so you should do him the favor!]
;W[dm];B[fr]C[Bommel
(W): This black response seems small first, but after the cut at E6 it
was in a pretty good place. How should W react to F2?

lordofpi (B): of course C7 or C8 is the proper move but i felt i cannot play on submissively like that.
arend: No, C7 or C8 is just slow here. (The 6D in our club would lable them "endgame". Because your corner is fully alife already.)
And F2 is bad shape. If you want to play there, the move is E2. See var. for white's answer.
Actually, F2 is _very_ bad shape. Don't ever do that again, ok? :-)]

(;W[cm]C[arend: I think this is small.];B[do];W[eo];B[en]C[Bommel
(W): This cut was very effective. [arend: Well, not as effective as if it had been done immediately...\] Can white get out of trouble easy, or
is a hard fight the only chance to survive?

lordofpi (B): I'm not sure if that cut was ok, the D4 aji feels bad

arend: oh oh, very difficult for both. I think white can still exploit black's bad shape and get an advantage.]

(;W[go]C[arend: Also very plausible.];B[em];W[el];B[gm];W[dk]
;B[fl];W[fk];B[gk];W[fj]
(;B[gj];W[fi];B[fh]C[lordofpi
(B): here i tought i have to protect against the D13 push & cut but
it seems to be less dangerous than expected. of course forcing white to
play G11 hurts black's G10 group
arend: Playing such a move, forcing white out at G11, is horrible. If you think you have to play here, then you should defintely leave out the G10 push.
It is extremely important to unlearn such moves! See the variation for the picture you should have in mind.]

(;W[gi];B[io]C[lordofpi (B): is
this attack ok? i expected to induce my defense if white plays H6 and
at the same time leave aji with the J5 stone.
arend: The problem is that your group at G7 is a bit short of liberties. I don't find a definite variation to punish J5, but it seems more natural to to strengthen your own group and then continue attacking either G5 or G11.]
;W[hn];B[il]
(;W[in]C[arend: One idea is in the variation. But this move is probably good enough.]
;B[hi]C[arend: Better make shape at J10.]
(;W[hh]C[arend: The direct cut looks like a good fight for white.]
;B[ii];W[gh];B[jo];W[jm];B[ko];W[lp];B[ln]C[lordofpi (B): pulling out the J5 stone like this looks bad for black now.]
;W[jl];B[jk];W[kk];B[jj];W[ll];B[nn]C[lordofpi
(B): i don't like that move now. i think i should have played at K3
instead, probably forcing white to jump out
arend: I agree.];W[li]C[Bommel (W): Here I think J3 would be the best move, instead of M11. Are there better options for W?
arend: I think this is ok. It's sente, and makes it harder for black to make territory on the right.]
;B[jg];W[cj];B[bi];W[jd]C[arend: "Urgent moves before big moves" suggests that you play J3 now. After that you can play E2 or O8. Whatever, do s.th. for your big weak group!]
;B[jq];W[kr];B[kq];W[lr]C[arend: Better M3.];B[mq]C[arend: Better K2 directly, I think.]
;W[lq];B[jr];W[jp];B[hq];W[mo];B[mn];W[pr];B[qr];W[or];B[no]
;W[np];B[lo];W[mp];B[lg]C[lordofpi
(B): i tried to defend my group with this and at the same time make it
impossible for white to connect to the top. white suggested a move
around P10 in the discussion after the game. is it an option?
arend: The idea of P10 is that you _force_ white to connect to the top. This is good because all connecting moves will be neutral moves, while you make territory on the right. However, I don't think this works well here, because your center group has only one eye.
I agree with M13.
(Assuming you have a plan to deal with white L12--namely to anwer at J14!)]
;W[nk]C[Bommel (W): I must find life here as quick as possible. Is there a better move to get eyespace AND reduce blacks side?
arend: I think this is the right point for making shape. I'd like to play L12 first, to test black's answer.]
;B[ps];W[mr];B[pk];W[oi];B[oj];W[nj];B[pi];W[ok];B[pj];W[om]
;B[pm];W[nm]C[Bommel (W): This is gote, so W must be alive to justify this move. Is he?
arend: tough question.
I think white is alive because of the aji at D4. In the center it is only one eye if black moves first.]

(;B[rf]C[lordofpi
(B): i tought it's ok to close that territory. i saw no chance to
continue the attack on the center group. is there a way?
arend: I don't think so. You should take the chance to fix your weakness at E2 in sente however.]
;W[sf]C[arend: This is problematic, because it creates the aji at O18.]
;B[sg];W[se];B[rg];W[on];B[ip]C[lordofpi (B): seems to be a bad move, maybe black should at least play Q5 first]
;W[qo]C[arend: Aji keshi. (After you get a stone at Q5, which might happen naturally in the fight, S4 becomes interesting.)]
;B[qn];W[qp];B[rp];W[er]C[Bommel
(W): I can save my center group in gote simple by connecting P5. But I
was trying to find a way to do it in sente (which failed). is there a
way?
arend: E2 is good. (Finally it gets played!!! :-)];B[es];W[dp]
;B[bq];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[fq];W[bp];B[oo]C[lordofpi
(B): it was sente at last because black made a stupid move, i guess B2
would be a lot better.
arend: B2 is bigger yes. But it is still sente for white.];W[he]
C[Bommel (W): Is this move too greedy? H16 better?
Arend: Yes.];B[kc]C[lordofpi (B): after the failure in the bottom left i had to play an invasion there, i expected to use O18 aji
Arend: Good fighting spirit. As a small improvement, I sugest starting with R17. After your invasion, white could decide to kill your group and give up the S16 stones (by answering R17 at R18). If you play R17 first, you have taken that option away from white.
If white plays correctly, your invasion dies, however (I believe).]
;W[kd];B[lc]
(;W[md]C[Arend: This looks bad.];B[nb];W[nc]C[Arend: Now it is obvious that N16 is badly placed.]
;B[mb];W[jb];B[kb]C[Bommel (W): Is there a way to kill B?
lordofpi (B): i guess he could kill me but it is dangerous to let black run out.
Arend: No kill possible anymore.]

;B[bk];W[an];B[aj];W[bm];B[ir];W[br]C[lordofpi (B): well this hurts]
;B[bs];W[aq];B[po];W[os]C[Bommel (W): P1 was a mistake, way too small. Now I would play it on P19.]
;B[oa];W[qb];B[qs];W[dd];B[ce];W[ds];B[cs];W[as]C[arend: Count ko threats before starting such a ko. 
It's a ko where
a) you loose quite some points when you loose it, and
b) you have to invest one more move than black (because you needed an extra move to start it)]
;B[ar];W[fs]C[Bommel (W): Terrible ko threat. Did W really gain something from that exchange?
arennd: No, black gained. Of course you have much better threats than that.]
;B[bq];W[ds];B[ap];W[es]C[lordofpi (B): i was happy with that exchange
this is the last question, late endgame is not that interesting anyway.
