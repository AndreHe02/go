C[  Dear reviewer,

I played black in this game.  I put some comments and questions through the game record.

(marked as R:) I'm particularly interested in yose stage of the game, but i'd appreciate any other comments from you. I'm looking forward for your guidelines which may help me to improve. Thank you in advance.]
;B[qf];W[dp];B[fc];W[pp];B[ck]C[R: For some time already I've been starting my games with double 6-3 and 6-4 points.]
;W[pd]TR[pc][qc]C[I would prefer another kakari for white.
The 4-4 stone seems to invite the severe pincer in the game
so i would suggest one of the marked points
Âµ];B[nd];W[pf]
(;B[pc]LB[pg:A]C[R: I wanted to make some thickness to the centre. But i don't know any particular joseki.

usually black play hane at A (4-4 point joseki)

;W[lb];B[le];W[id];B[ic];W[hd];B[gc];W[if]C[R: I think, things here are settled for the moment.

Well, black could attack making a moyo ?]
(;B[qn]C[R: Is it better to play on the left side?

you could attack the white cebter stones but this is a good move too]

(;W[ni];B[ml];W[jp]TR[rp][jq][kq]C[black is strong, so this shape looks a bit thin
i would probably take one of the marked points];B[qj];W[mh]
LB[ni:A][nj:B]C[move immediately to the target (connecting with the other weak group) is usually too easy for the opponent (he can cut).

See variation with A at B: there white "leans" first on the strong group which makes it easier to connect afterwards.]
;B[oi];W[oh];B[qi];W[pi];B[lg];W[nm];B[mn];W[mk];B[nn];W[nj]

(;B[qk]C[R: Please, look at the variation. Which way is better?

Both are possible i think
I slightly prefer the variation as this keeps more pressure on white]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[mm]

Attacking from the other side seems better as it makes huge territory for black

also locally, this move is thin];W[kg];B[kh];W[ge];B[ee];W[lf]
