C[H: Hi, I'm playing white here and lost by resign.  Please focus your analysis on how I lost influence to the center, which (apart from the mistake that made me finally resign) I obviously underestimated.

Any other hint is welcomed, too, of course.

Thanks go to the reviewer in advance!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]

(;B[cg];W[ef]TR[fc][hc][gd][id][he]C[H: up to my last stone, I was quite content with my moves. but here I could not think of anything preventing him making territory in the marked area.

What could I have done?

Instead of your last move at C13 perhaps you could have approached his corner at F16(see the variation) or invaded at C17]

;B[df];W[eh];B[bd];W[bc];B[ad]C[Moves on the first line are very small especially in the opening a better place for this move would have been N3]
;W[hd];B[fc]TR[cc][ee]C[H: I hoped to make some profit of the two cuts

The B stone at F17 is extremely heavy when it's played.  An invasion here is not recommended, because of all the W stones in this area it will be hard for this B stone to do anything of profit.  A better choice for this move would have been at Q10 or N3 to grab up the last opening points.]
;W[gc];B[fd];W[gf];B[cc]C[H: here I misread the situation. this stone was doomed from the start]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[dc];B[ac];W[np];B[lq]LB[np:A]C[H: what would be other/better answers to white A? i happily succeeded in cutting this stone off, but that was due to whites mistakes, i suppose.

And it was the following sequence, that I was cut of the center in the end. So there should be something more suitable.

Black doesn't have to answer white A if he doesn't want to.  He could still grab the other side at Q9 or Q10.  Black can always steal the territory from under A later at O2.

This move isn't a bad move right now though.];W[mq];B[lp];W[jo]

;B[mr];W[nq];B[ns];W[of];B[pi]C[H: this is probably another bad decision, regarding the center, but it looked liek makign big territory on the right

This is good.  You should try to stay out in front of the white stone at P14.  Jumping out to Q11 is a bit far and black could have some problems because of it though.  See the variation]

(;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb]C[H: This looks like a mistake to me, but I lost the corner in the end.]

;B[sf];W[na];B[si]LB[ri:A]C[H: this should have been on A, I think now]
;W[pn];B[om];W[qn];B[ri];W[ro]C[H: I absolutely forgot about the fragility of my stones here, so I lost.

End of comments.

One white group would have lived either way so black seems too far behind at this point to catch up.  In future games I would recommend that instead of rushing to invade a big enemy territory when its too late, you time your invasions or reductions earlier and keep your stones secure.  
If you're ever on KGS my screename is Mothman and I will probably give you a teaching game if you want one.  Just make sure you tell me its you before you ask.
