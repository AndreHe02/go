;B[pd]C[I am black.

There are some fights in this game that are beyond my reading level, but there are places where I think I could have played more simply and had a better game.  In a couple of places I play moves that are pretty greedy and get into trouble.

I have made some comments about what I *think* is going on, but please feel free to correct them.

Thanks in advance for your comments,

-Calvin

**Hi, you seemed to have had the game until some moves near the end. Let's see if my review can help.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[qn];B[qp]C[White di];W[qk];B[cn]
MA[kp][kq]C[Interesting. You could also expand your corner down the side.

This is nice though.];W[hq]LB[eo:A][dn:B][fp:C]C[This counter-pincer is unusual.   Typically, I'd expect A, B, or C.

**True, white needs to get out into the center. He lives very small (and in gote usually) in the corner.]
;B[cq]MA[eo]C[**You opponents good move is your good move. This forces white to make a wall that helps white. Lock him inside to live small.]
;W[cp]MA[dq]C[**Bad for white, wall is going the wrong way. Marked spot is good way.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[fr];W[fo]LB[go:A]C[Should be at A, I think.

**Yes, It's not about white staying connected (it's easy to split) but relegating black to the corner. Usually the trade offs in joseki is one lives in the corner while other gets outside thickness. If corner gets access, he has a very strong base to attack from.]
;B[ck]C[**You can afford to go further along side. This is still great as a 2 space base.]
;W[ci];B[gp]C[It is hard to resist the urge to split here.

**Again, it's not a split, it's getting to the out side. Also notice how whites big wall does nothing now. It's completely neutralized.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[jd];B[fc]LB[go:A]C[This is becoming a big are, but It is probably better to continue splitting at A.]
;W[hc]SQ[jd]LB[ec:A]C[Because of white's market stone, I think W24 is redudant and better played at A.

**He's scared you'll block off his k-16.];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]
;W[ce]LB[de:A]C[This hane is an overplay.  Should nobi at A.]

(;B[be]SQ[hc][jd][ci]LB[cb:A][de:B]MA[db]C[Normally the punishment is for black to descend at A rather than playing B29.  This aims at the cut at B.  However, because white's three marked stones, I decided not to be so aggressive.  Perhaps this is a mistake.

**First, play D-18. After all that. You can play];W[cf];B[bf]
;W[bg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[ek]C[**C-13 a nice weakness to exploit later.]
;W[da]C[White is trying to kill black, but this is not possible.]
;B[ca];W[bc];B[ad];W[af];B[bb]C[Black is still alive.];W[ag]
C[This move is total gote.];B[gn]LB[go:A]C[I'm not sure sure about this move, but A is pushing from behind.

**You have to look at the results though. 'A' is solid and builds a wall facing your other corner. You own all four corners by the way. White gets no potential with that push, you will.]
;W[ab];B[ac];W[go];B[ho];W[fn];B[gm];W[fm];B[gl];W[fl];B[fk]
;W[dl];B[cl]LB[dk:A]C[I now think it might be sufficient for black to connect at A and let white live small.    The game would be good for black.  Since white lives anyway, the result in the game is worse.

**Only kill if you know how to kill. Other wise you're playing a ladder blindly (See how many weak spots you left in your chain?). White not only would live small, it could still die.]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[cj];B[dn];W[dm];B[bo];W[ej];B[bp];W[di]C[This result is not as good for black as it could be.]
;B[jp]LB[gk:A]C[This is not so big right now.  I think black needs to protect the cut at A.

**The cut accomplishes little as those two stones do not have a job anymore.]
;W[gk]MA[mp][rd][qe][kc][qh]C[A good move, I think, substantially reducing the value of black's thickness.

**No, you still build a higher wall. White's being cute thinking he's getting points. In all this, there are still corner moves to be played.

From here, you seem to let your one loss dictate the flow and end up losing the game.]
;B[hk];W[gj];B[il]LB[hj:A]C[Probably better shape at A.  Or even tenuki.]
;W[lc];B[rd];W[kq];B[jq]MA[mq]C[**Pincer is nice too.];W[kp]
;B[kr]MA[ko]C[**White wants to take away any potential area. This move is in wrong direction]
;W[lr];B[jr];W[lp]LB[mq:A]C[Bad shape.  A is correct.];B[mq]
;W[lq];B[no]C[I'm not sure about this shape.];W[hp];B[io];W[bq]
C[I am not sure black has to answer this.];B[br];W[aq];B[ii]
;W[eq];B[fp]SQ[fq][fr][gp]LB[er:A]C[Maybe black should sacrifice the marked stones and take sente.  The sequence which follows loses points.  Blocking at 'A' may be better.

**A is mandatory. F-4 does nothing as those two shone were already connected.]
;W[er]MA[cr]C[**The marked space must be protected now or black loses entire corner.]
;B[gs]C[The following few moves were played in byoyomi.];W[fs]
;B[es];W[hs]
(;B[ar]MA[dr]C[**Bad, see variations];W[gr];B[dr];W[fs];B[ds]
;W[gq];B[kn]LB[mr:A]MA[mn][mm]C[It may be better for black to start the attack with the descent at A.

**White cannot make a base, So block his escape point. You pushed him to live.]
;W[ln];B[lm];W[mn];B[nn];W[mm];B[pl];W[ko];B[ll];W[nm];B[om]
;W[jo];B[ip];W[jn];B[km];W[im];B[hm];W[jl];B[jm];W[in];B[hn]
C[See how your cutting yourself off?

Attack from a distance. Here, you're trying to kill without looking ahead. In the process, you're losing eyes and getting disconnected.]
;W[jk];B[jj]LB[hj:A]C[Dangerous for black.   Should be at A, I think.]
;W[kk]LB[ik:A]C[White may be able to cause some trouble by starting with the atari at A instead.]
;B[lk];W[kj];B[ki];W[lj];B[mj]LB[nk:A]C[Too greedy!   I think black most connect at A.]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[li];B[hj];W[ik];B[gi];W[fj];B[hl]LB[nk:A][nl:B]
C[Black may have to capture at A or play at B and fight the ko instead of connecting to stay in the game.]
;W[ok];B[nk]SQ[lk][mj][ml][ll][lm][km][kn][jm]LB[nl:A]C[Ouch.  'A' is correct.  Now black will lose the marked stones.]
;W[nl];B[hf]LB[mi:A]SQ[mj][nk][ml][lk][ll][lm][jm][km][kn]MA[oj]
C[The reading is hard, but maybe black could get somewhere with A.  To give up completely on the marked stones may be too much.

**Not much to do, I guess the marked spot allows some liberties to kill off white.]
;W[nj]LB[ni:A]C[White should just net at A.  This move allows black to create a ko by playing at A.  (Although I didn't do that.)]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[ql]LB[ni:A]C[Taking profit, but this my be not enough.   If black plays A to start a ko, white captures first.   Does black have a ko threat large enough?

**White wins  by now, so I don't see him risking game with anything played.  White Has lotsa threats though.

This will be my last comment. You seem to lose the flow from here. White has momemtum that's hard to stop now. Sometimes it's best to resign and get your bearings for the next game. 

Hope the review helped.];W[rk];B[rl];W[nq];B[qh];W[of];B[nh]
