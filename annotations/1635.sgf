C[fhayashi - in this game, I play white, with 0.5 komi.  I felt I played well in tactical terms, but lost the game by 17.5 points...

Not sure where things went wrong...

rika:
Hi. I'm Chun-Kit (5k IGS, 8k DE). Let's see what I can do to improve your game.]
;B[pq];W[dp]SQ[po][qo]LB[pd:A]C[rika: 
Just a matter of taste, if you play hoshi anyway I like wQ16(A). 
Then you can approach with wQ5 or wR5 with some balance to wQ16.
But your move is playable.];B[qd];W[dd];B[nc];W[jp]SQ[pj][qi]
[qj]C[rika:
Somewhere around R10 is playable, if you want to prevent black from extending (splitting move)]
;B[qj];W[jd]C[fhayashi - at this point, i thought black was overconcentrated on the right...

rika:
I don't think overconcentrated is the right term. OK, 4 black stones on the right side, while white took stratetical points.
In my view "overconcentrated" means: too many stones in a part of the board, where some stones already works efficient.
Black wants a pieceful start, no complications in fuseki.];B[cj]
;W[oj]SQ[cg][cm]C[fhayashi - not sure if I should have responded to C10 immediately...

rika:
I agree, since you haven't responded to bC10, black can always extend to the marked spots. You can always come back after the exchange on the left side]
;B[fq]C[rika:
of course wrong side];W[eq];B[er];W[dr];B[cq]
(;W[fr]C[rika:
better split with wD3 (see var), thus black cannot take care both of the weak groups.]
;B[dq];W[es]C[rika:
better wE4 to avoid a ko in the early stage of the game];B[ep]
;W[cr]C[rika:
once black will play G2/G3 your wK4 stone looks very lonely.]
;B[er];W[cp];B[gr];W[eq];B[gp];W[bq]C[fhayashi - i thought black got a very bad result here.

rika:
you just managed to save the corner. But the prize: You cannot connect to K4, so the K4 stone has to live on its own.
If white's turn now peep at H3 and F5 is a must, therefore black will have a clump of stones which cannot be ignored. But it's black turn now, he will fix his shape and simultan attack your lonely stone K4.]
;B[jq];W[eo]C[rika:
attach -> hane. Sure wE5 is a big move, but wJ3 is more urgent (proverb: urgent move before big)]
;B[fp];W[cg]C[fhayashi - thought this would force black to play to white's thickness

rika:
yes, wC12 also works (to put more pressure to bC10), since black will not play bC14 himself]
;B[cm];W[dn]C[rika:
too slow, don't play from the thickness. I like the attacking move somewhere around E11.]
;B[bh];W[bg]C[rika:
well, personally I wouldn't answer to this move. I admit it's not easy for double-digit-kyu player to see, why such a move doesn't require an answer. A territory-style reviewer will say: "It's a must because keeping black is not aready alive", while I say: "black can escape to the center, so why blocking".]
;B[kp]C[rika:
this is of course terrible for white (even bL3 is more safe)]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[ch];B[ci];W[ah];B[bn];W[dm];B[bo];W[cl];B[bl]
;W[cn];B[ck];W[bm];B[dl];W[cm];B[ek];W[am];B[em]
(;W[en]C[rika:
not sure why you played that. doesn't put pressure to the black group.]
;B[fm];W[ei];B[di];W[eh];B[fc];W[ec];B[eb];W[db];B[fd];W[fb]
;B[gb];W[ea]C[fhayashi - thought black made the same sort of mistake as he did on the bottom...

rika:
yes, corner looks save, and black has still no eye.];B[jc]
(;W[ee]C[rika:
why didn't you answer to bK17? 
black's next play is obvious.];B[id];W[fe];B[kd];W[gd]C[rika:
A ponnuki for black (bK15) is very painful at this stage of the game]
;B[gc];W[he];B[hd]C[rika:
ponnuki (bK15) is stronger];W[ie];B[je]C[rika:
remember that wK16 was a stratetically important stone. Now it's captured]
;W[ge]C[rika:
saving the stone isn't important. You will still need some developement at the right side and the bottom.]
;B[ip];W[jo];B[fn];W[iq];B[hq];W[kq];B[lq];W[jr]C[fhayashi - black didn't 'capture the cutting stone' which surprised me.

rika:
not sure if black was afraid of the ladderbreaker at wP10];B[lo]
;W[lr];B[mq];W[mr];B[nr];W[is]C[rika:
what's the meaning of wJ1? The center is still open, so dive into the center is enough for now. 
The right side is undeveloped, so an invasion is possible];B[io]
;W[ko];B[lp];W[jm];B[im];W[lm];B[qn]C[fhayashi - at this point, I thought I had the game won...

rika:
white has 2 unbeatable corners about 30 pts upper left and 18 lower left, 5 lower. 8 captures. total 61pts.
black: upper about 20 sure points, left about 10, lower right about 20. 
I haven't counted the possible points of blacks "moyo" in the right.

At that stage invasion at the upper left corner or a sabaki (light) play can decide the game (see next var)]

(;W[pk]C[rika:
this is definately too slow. 
As I promise let's see the invasion/reduction plays at the upper right corner]
;B[qg]C[rika:
with one move black can make big territory at the upper right]
;W[qk];B[jl];W[kl]C[rika:
I don't like that move, your group is already alive, so black will play simply the boarder of his territory on the left]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[jj];W[kj];B[mi];W[ji]C[rika:
you need a great reduction move here (eg wP12)];B[kh]C[rika:
now black makes more and more territory]
(;W[ki]C[rika:
a cut isn't dangerous in my view];B[lh];W[in];B[hn];W[jn];B[hl]
;W[mj]C[rika:
you can't expect to make points in the center because black can reduce from the bottom with bO7]
;B[oi];W[pi];B[ni]
(;W[nj];B[qi];W[pj];B[ph]C[rika:
now an invasion is nearly impossible without an escape route to the center. Of course you were thinking white is in the lead, but look at whole board situation and decide which side you prefer.]
;W[jh];B[kg];W[ij];B[ii];W[hi]C[rika:
wH10 is enough];B[hj];W[ih];B[ik];W[gj];B[ii]

fine, you made lots of false eyes];B[dj];W[fo];B[go];W[gm];B[gn]
C[rika:
mistake by black!!! vital point is H2]
(;W[gk]C[rika:
see var how to win the game.];B[hr]C[fhayashi - not sure if I could have done something to prevent two eyes here...

[ls][mk][ml][nk][nl][nm][ok][ol][om]C[fhayashi - for all the mistakes black seems to have made in tactical situations, I seemed to have made a bigger strategic mistake...  Not sure at what point I should have made an invasion or more robust reduction move...

rika:
ok, that's the game.
you see making territory yourself isn't profitable than reduction move. At some stages you made some unnecessary small moves where your opponent is happy to play tenuki.
Attached stones should be answered immediately (see wK16 and wK4). You can obmit if there are more urgent move.
Your main weakness of this game: many small moves.

I hope this game will guide you to play games with fewer errors.
