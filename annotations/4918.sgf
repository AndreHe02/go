AB[pd][dp]C[Hi Oliver,

Sorry for this review taking so long.  I guess there was an email mess-up, and I didn't get the file until today.

I play as "snip" on kgs, and am about 1 kyu.  I'll do my best to answer your questions.

As to your question about fuseki with low handicaps, I think it's best to just play normally.  Your opponent's errors will catch you up.]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[pj]LB[nd:A]C[normally black should play around A now, and he skipped this move.....]

(;W[nc]TR[pf][qf]C[...so you try to punish.  But this is the wrong way to do it.  Black will push out between your two groups, leaving them both weak.]

[iq][kq][lq][mq][nq][oq]SQ[ce]C[OK, let's look at the board...

There are, perhaps, 3 big areas.  Which is biggest?

Without a doubt, #2 is biggest in terms of width.  Notice that there are 11 open intersections within #2 and 10 in #1.  Area #3 is ony 5 spaces wide and is not worth consideration right now.

Also notice that in area #1, white has the strong settled stone at C15.  This means that this side of the board has lost some of its value to extend into.  A stone on the third line like this basically completes an enclosed territory.  

In conclusion, the largest remaining area of the board is clearly area #2.]

(;W[cn]LB[fq:C][jq:A][nq:B]C[...so, this move is wrong.  If black gets to move first on the bottom, it will be a hard game for white.

If I were white, I would move at A, B or C.  Of the three, I prefer A.]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[en]LB[co:A][cp:B][cq:C]C[This is known as the "Attack and extend" joseki, because black first attaches to white's lone stone with D6, and then extends from his own stone with E6.]

(;W[em]C[Here you make the same mistake as on the top right.  This is not joseki and is a bad move.  Your main joseki choices right now are marked and slightly explained in the variations.]
