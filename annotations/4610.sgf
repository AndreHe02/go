AB[dp][pd][pp]C[Bonjour,
I'm Damien (dmg on KGS) and I'm around 12kyu FR. I'll be commenting your game.
See global comments at the end of the sgf];W[dd];B[dj];W[nd]
SQ[jc][jd][lc][ld][pf]C[Will be this battle good for black? What I made wrong?

dmg: We don't know yet. Standard answers to white 3 are marked spots.]
;B[ne]C[dmg: Strange answer.];W[me];B[mf];W[nf];B[oe];W[od]
;B[of];W[lf]
(;B[ng]C[dmg: Extending at n13 instead of capturing would have gave you better shape here. I think an even better play could have been cutting at n16 (See var).]
;W[ke];B[oc]C[This one giving away the cut at n16.];W[nc];B[lg]
;W[kg];B[nb];W[ob];B[pc];W[mb]SQ[md]C[dmg: That was a mistake by white (see double-atari at n16)]
;B[pb];W[na];B[kh]C[dmg: this is an over play. Extending at m12 seems more natural.]
;W[lh];B[mh]C[dmg: firm connection at n13 instead of n12];W[mg]
;B[li];W[lg]C[dmg: white should have took at n14 instead.];B[ni]
;W[nf]
(;B[og]C[dmg: I don't think it was needed to protect here (See var).]
;W[jh];B[ki];W[ih]C[dmg: To answer your question. Black is pretty happy here. Because he get as much territory as white (and more thickness). He's the more happier that he have 3 handicap stones).]
;B[ji]C[dmg: this is slow.];W[fh];B[gi];W[gh];B[hi];W[ii]C[dmg: White letting you build a nice wall. He's a very nice guy.]
;B[ij];W[hh];B[fi];W[ei];B[ej];W[di];B[ci];W[dg];B[ch]SQ[dq]
[jq][qp]C[That's like ooyose moves when there are bigger spots on the board (marked spots worth more than 30pt)]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[cf];B[bf];W[be]C[dmg: That was a failure by white. See variation on how you should have exploited it.]

(;B[bg];W[de];B[af]C[dmg: It's like a 2pt move (playing a15 locally was a 4pt move) when there's still >30pts moves on the board.]
;W[ae];B[cj];W[qq]C[What about this one? I know, I gave him too much teritory...]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or]
(;B[nr]C[up to here it was correct. See variation on previous move and on move 68 for correct play. I think due to the overall position that here playing at o3 would have been better.]
;W[nq]
(;B[np]C[dmg: that was a mistake. see variation.];W[op];B[oo]
;W[oq];B[mq]C[dmg: That's a mistake but white did not took advantage (see variation). Playing at n4 was better.]

(;W[mr];B[lr];W[ns];B[mo]C[dmg: protection at n4 here would have been correct. (it protect nearly all the cuts at once).]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[kr];B[kq];W[ls]C[white should have pushed at m4 here.]
;B[lp];W[lr];B[rq];W[rr];B[jq];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[so]
(;W[sp]C[White could have cutted at r5 instead of playing t4.]
;B[qo];W[jr];B[ir];W[iq];B[hr];W[kp];B[jp];W[hq];B[gq];W[is]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[ko]C[dmg: NOOOOO Ladders. Take h5 point instead.]
;W[gr];B[gp];W[hs];B[ho];W[fr];B[eq];W[fq];B[fp];W[er];B[dr]
;W[ds];B[cs];W[es];B[cr];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa];B[qb];W[pk]C[dmg: Ok I think even with the mistakes on the bottom of the board. Black should feel quite happy in this stage. Let's go straight to the facts : white q9 seems dead like this.]
;B[ok]SQ[qi][ql][rj]C[And what about this?
dmg: This stones is like pushing white in the direction he want to be pushed. You should push white towards you're strength and remove its eyespaces.  Marked spots are options. I personnally feel s10 like the one since it removes all eyespaces to white and can connect on both sides.]
;W[pl]SQ[qi][rj]C[dmg: still the same, attack on the bottom]
;B[ol];W[om];B[nm];W[on];B[nn];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi]SQ[ri][rj];B[pn]
;W[pm];B[oh];W[qn];B[po];W[rm];B[pi];W[pj];B[rn];W[qm];B[no]
SQ[qi]C[dmg: Nooooooooooo you don't need to protect now (you still have a liberty at t6). Playing r11 here would have killed.]
;W[ph];B[qi];W[qj];B[qh];W[ri]SQ[rh];B[pg];W[rh];B[rg];W[sg]
;B[rf];W[sf];B[se];W[sh]SQ[rj]C[dmg: oops you losed an opportunity (killing every stones).]
;B[sm];W[sl];B[sn];W[rk];B[re];W[nk]C[What I should do to avoid that?
dmg: What you did was correct.];B[nl];W[mk];B[lk];W[mj];B[mi]
;W[lj];B[kj];W[ml];B[ll];W[kk];B[mm];W[dm]C[More than the move 123, this stone should be dead.]
;B[em]SQ[cl][cn]C[And what was here?
dmg: Same has for move 124.  But here why stones doesn't seems alive.]
;W[dn];B[en];W[do];B[dl];W[cp];B[dq]C[dmg: no need.];W[cl];B[ck]
;W[el];B[ek]C[dmg: firm connect instead of ko.];W[dk];B[fl]
;W[dl];B[eo];W[bl];B[bk];W[ak];B[aj];W[al];B[fk];W[cq];B[bq]
;W[br];B[bp];W[co];B[ar];W[bo];B[bs];W[ap];B[aq];W[ao];B[hd]
C[And what about this one? I think I could do it better...

dmg: I think it should have died.];W[hc];B[ic];W[id];B[hb];W[gc]
;B[gd];W[ib];B[jc];W[ha];B[gb];W[fc];B[jb];W[ga];B[ia];W[fb]
;B[fa];W[ea];B[ga];W[jd];B[kc]SQ[eb]C[dmg: Here, the cut at E18 is more valuable.]
;W[lc];B[lb];W[la];B[ka];W[kb];B[ja];W[lb];B[fd]C[dmg: Arg, this is aji-killer. White can protect the cut at e18 now.]
;W[ec];B[kd];W[je];B[ld];W[md];B[mf];W[ai];B[bj];W[nf];B[ah]
C[dmg: This stone is giving 1pt and an half to the opponent.
1/ You're giving away ko
2/ You're putting one stone inside your territory and thus giving away 1 point.]
;W[mf];B[tt];W[tt]C[dmg: Ok, basically, you've lost this game on l&d problems. You should try to do a lot of them (www.goproblems.com). And think in terms of eyespace when trying to kill or in term of territory when trying to make him live small (which are the two cases in an invasion).
Also always looks at cutting points. Not only yours and try to see what can happens if you try to exploit them.
You can join me on kgs (well I'm not that often on it) or by email if you have any question.
