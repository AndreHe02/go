C[In this game, W did quite well in a difficult opening. W's problem, however, was to make use of B's weaknesses in the middle game fighting. In the endgame, he should have tried to resist B's moves more often, as not to leave all big points for B. I hope, my comments will help.]
;B[oc];W[pp]LB[pe:a]C[Would have been my choice too. This move has a good follow-up in the UR corner with a (Q15).]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[pe]LB[qd:a][qg:b]C[B should rather make a proper shimari at a (R 16). This move leaves a weakness at b (R 13).]
;W[jc]C[Good, taking B's extension.];B[nq]C[Wrong direction. B doesn't want W to extend towards B weakness in the UR corner.]
;W[qm]C[Seems to be the best response.];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq]
(;W[cj]LB[qg:a]C[Although this is a fine move in itself, an approach at a (R13) seems better (see variation)]
;B[cm];W[cg]LB[df:a]C[I would rather play at a (D14), making a corner invasion more difficult and giving W the possibility to build a framework (see variation). It is often better to form one large gap than two medium sized ones, leaving less weaknesses for the opponent to exploit.]

(;B[fc]
(;W[ec]LB[qg:a]C[A move like this is often good to make the marked stone heavy. Here, however, a play at a (R13) seems better (see variation).]
;B[fd];W[mc];B[qi]TR[mc][jc][fd][fc]C[This sequence was not good for W, since B could cover his weakness in the UR corner, taking a huge amount of territory (an invasion at 3-3 would have a hard time). Furthermore, B's marked stones are not to be easily attacked, since the marked W tones have become weaker.]
;W[ie]LB[ee:a]C[This move seems rather worthless. It doesn't attack B's stones strongly, nor does it improve W's shape. Indeed it is difficult to find a good move for W, maybe he should play a (E15) immediatly.]
;B[ff];W[ee];B[gf]C[This is an odd shape, although B is probably right in resisting W's kikashi.]
;W[fq]TR[fc][fd][ff][gf]C[OK, W doesn't seem to have a profitable attack on the marked B stones so he should wait until a better possibility arises.]
;B[eq]
(;W[iq]LB[fp:a]C[Big mistake. In a position like this, W MUST play at a (F4) as in the variation, exceptions are rare.]
;B[fp]C[Now W has to struggle for life without need and all aji in B's corner is gone. W seems to have lost here.]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[hp];B[oi];W[me]LB[in:a][qr:b]C[Hm, W needs to play more aggressively if he still wants to win, just answering B's moves will not be enough. An idea might be W a (J6), aiming at attacking the marked B group, starting with b (R2).]
;B[ho];W[io];B[hn];W[in];B[hm];W[lp]LB[qr:a]C[W a (R2) takes territory and attacks B group.]
;B[qr];W[rr]LB[lq:a]C[No, if W just answers every move B makes, he has no chance to win. He should play a (M3) since B has no good follow up move in the corner.]
;B[pq];W[rq]LB[qp:a][op:b]C[Better connect at a (R4), then b  (P4) is not sente.]
;B[op];W[po];B[kp]C[W has lost on both sides of B's group and is still weak.]

;W[hq]LB[er:a]C[W can resist at a (E2), then B has more problems to put pressure on W group.]

(;AW[fp]LB[iq:a][fn:b][cq:c][co:d]C[a (J3) and b (F6) are miai for W, so he need not fear a B attack. Furthermore, W might later be able to invade at c (C3), exploiting B's weaknesses at c (C3) and d (C5).]
