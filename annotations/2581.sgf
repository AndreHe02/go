C[Hello. My username is Meso and I'm about 4kyu (KGS). My fuseki isn't very strong so there might be some disagreements in the first 20 moves or so. I use some basic Japanese terms of go. I also might often say something like "I'd prefer" or "I think that". That's because I try to give my opinion if there might be a better hand. This will be my first review so I try to keep it simple and clear. Yorosiku Onegaishimasu!

There are many hands during the game I'd like to comment, I will concentrate on W's hands but there will be  comments for B's too.]
;B[dp]C[Hoshi (star-point play) is the most common way to start the game...]
;W[qd]C[... but this komoku (3-4 play) gives me an odd feeling. I like komoku myself, very much. It's a flexible moves but the komoku here isn't the best possible answer to B's lower-left hoshi. I'll explain it after the next move.]
;B[dd]LB[dj:A]TR[dp]C[This pattern is called niren-sei and it gives an opportunity for a promising moyo (a big territory). The usual follow up to niren-sei is sanren-sei (A). It would give B a very strong position to the left side. B's D16 gives W's komoku an uncomfortable position because unlike hoshi, komoku leaves the corner quite open. I'm not claiming that the W's answer was a mistake.]

(;W[pp]LB[nc:C][oc:A][od:B]C[W plays to the last empty corner with hoshi but leaves his corner wide open. I'd prefer A, B or even okeima (big knight's move) of C to the hoshi in this situation (see the variation)]
;B[oc];W[od]C[This is not the best possible answer but let's see what it is good for:]
;B[nd]C[This is the right answer for B.];W[oe]LB[pc:A][ne:B]
C[W gives B the right follow up. I think now B should've played at A, not B (variations)]

(;B[ne]C[I think this is a weak move but...]
(;W[nf]LB[of:A]C[this hane (a diagonal move in contact with an enemy stone) is no good either. It leaves the cutting point (A) (see var.)]
;B[mf];W[ng];B[mg];W[nh];B[mh]
(;W[mi]CR[oj][ol][pn]LB[nc:D][me:A][of:C][ni:B]C[You asked what I think of the sequence this far. I think that B has the advantage. His wall is pointed towards the center but W's wall is towards the side. There are also cutting points in both players' wall and I wonder why neither one used them during the game. W's territory on the right side is still quite open and one might expect Black to invade there right away 

After the W's 2nd hane (triangle stone) B should cut at B or at least invade (for example the circle points)

W's move should be at A, I think. B cannot do anything about it (see var.)

It seems to be that you have some thought of yourself. Let's see how they work. There are three variations. Please examine them.]
N[A];B[qn]C[This is common sense: to invade when the opponent is open.]

(;W[ql]C[White's pincer is very close. It could be better if it was a little further form B's invading stone because...]
;B[on]LB[qj:2][np:1]C[...B's answer to the pincer creates weak holes to both sides (something like 1 or 2, see variation to the pincer)]
;W[ol]LB[np:A][nq:B]SQ[ni][nj][nk]C["Yes I am eager to have territory immediately." I know what you mean. I usually think the same way. It's painful to let the opponent invade your territory.

The situation here, however, isn't favorable for the triangle stone. W's corner is now in trouble. I think W should've taken territory from the corner (by defending with A or B).

There is still possibilities for B to create an successful invading to the W's territory on the side (squares). It would be very slow for White to put an extra stone there and now B can make a serious attack to the corner stone. It can live there but it might be hard to get 2 eyes and by doing so B will benefit by getting an superior thickness to the lower side of the board (he already has the thickness on the upper side so W absolutely cannot let that happen)

At this point of the game I think that B has got an extremely profitable settings to win the game.]
;B[np]C[Again, the move that comes first to one's mind.];W[iq]
TR[fq][gq][kq][lq]C[It will be hard time for W down there. Most likely B will make it hard by increasing his thickness (triangle=possible pincers) and W will be barely alive. There is very little space for W to live. He should play lightly to avoid heavy groups.]
;B[kq]C[Now W begins to be more and more squeezed.];W[fq];B[dn]
LB[dq:A]C[This isn't the best move here. Playing a thick closing move at A would give W more trouble. The move played in the game leaves the corner still open for W the settle his stones.]

(;W[cq]C[This move isn't good at this moment. It would've been better to keep one group than letting B divide W into two weak groups (see var.)]
;B[dq]TR[fq][iq]SQ[cq]C[At this point B must've been very satisfied in his game so far.W is in an awkward situation.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[dr];B[er];W[cr]C[W decides to take the corner thus leaving his stones floating between Black's influence.

They still have some possibilities for living but W might also leave them dead.]
;B[eq];W[bo];B[bn];W[ap]LB[df:C][bo:A][bp:B]C[W is left with a sente of A or B. This is a big minus to the invading. B should close his moyo (C)]
;B[ei];W[cm]LB[cf:A]C[It's a good idea to peep but , in this situation, if the opponent won't defend (like he didn't). It won't matter because B could still live.]
;B[ck]C[With this squeeze it seems to be that the peep W made has become meaningless.]
;W[cn]C[White decides to attack the B's group by cutting and destroying his eye shape but B can live by escaping to the roght if he'd want.]
;B[dm]C[This move is odd. Letting W stones to connect isn't very profitable.]
;W[do];B[eo];W[co]LB[fd:A]C[Closing the ko is slow Now is the last moment for W to make a successful invading to B moyo (somewhere near A). Black should now defend his weaknesses of the upper-right wall.]
;B[en]LB[fn:A]C[this move is quite slow and doens't give B a very good shape. No eyes. Something like A would've been more effective]
;W[fp];B[ep];W[gn];B[hi]C[It would've been better for B to defend his corner and the upper side. There is still a possibility for W to invade.]
;W[dl];B[el];W[dk];B[ek];W[dj];B[di];W[cj];B[ci];W[bj]C[This is small and rather useless. W is already alive even without doing this crawling. By doing this B has gained a Great wall to defend his moyo. W's top priority would've been to invade.]
;B[bi];W[fm];B[em];W[io]C[This move indeed settles W's group but making Black's wall useless isn't very important right now.]
;B[ki]LB[fd:A]C[Still I think B should close his moyo with A. Maybe he was a little bit greedy. However, it won't be easy for W to invade successfully anymore.]
;W[fc]LB[hc:A]C[It begins to be a little too late for W to invade. Black has thickness to all directions and if he plays right there won't be any chance for White to live.

I'll review this W's invade closely:

First of all, the invading move is low. It might give hard time if B makes a close pincer.]
;B[ec]LB[cc:B][dc:A]C[This is an aggressive answer. Playing A might be a little better (otherwise, there will be the weak point of B left).]
;W[fd]LB[gd:B][fe:A]C[This is a mistake. In this kind of situation this is way too thick and heavy.

W should play more lightly (A or B, for example)];B[hc]C[When B squeezes wih the right move, W is dead.]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf]C[This is a usual joseki seen in dan matches as well in kyu matches. Black plays strongly.]

(;W[cf]TR[ce]C[This W's answer is wrong (see var.)];B[de]
(;W[bg]LB[bd:A]C[This is futile because B robs W's base and eating that one Black stone in atari won't bie him two eyes.

Instead of atari White should just connect with A. Black must defend his stone (or else W will easily live).

See variations.];B[bd];W[af];B[bc]C[At this instant I am thinking it is terrible for me. How can I go on in this situation.]
;W[eg]LB[ga:F][ha:E][ia:G][fb:H][hb:D][ib:C][jc:A][mc:B][ld:I]
[le:K][me:J]TR[id][he]SQ[nc]C[Any chance for W to live is to attack the weak cutting point to the right

White should attack Black's lone stone with A. Most likely Black will answer with a diagonal move or a one-space jump (the triangle points).

Then W peeps at B. Black should connect (it would be Very nice for W to get all the territory in the corner by cutting)

After B defends the peep, White C, Black D, White E, Black F, White G, Black H, White I (threating to cut), Black K (or J)

After that sequence there might be a possibility for W to live

Of course this is rather unlikely. The order of the stones might be played differently and B might answer with other moves as well. But like I sayed, W invaded quite late and thus it's Very hard for him to do it properly.]
;B[ef]C[Black keeps harrassing White which is just the right way.]

(;W[ff]LB[fg:A]C[ You asked if A would've been better.

The next move is A and by cutting White into seperated groups again, the left one is dead.

But A wouldn't help it (see var.)];B[fg];W[ee];B[df];W[dg];B[fh]
TR[bc][dc][ec][bd][dd][ce][de][df][ef]C[The result is a failure for W.

There is only one good point. He created some ko threats (The black group has bad aji, but that's not very satisfying, is it?).]

(;B[fk]C[Black's answer for the cut is wrong. It's slow and won't give B a chance to escape (see variation for the correct answer)]
;W[fj];B[fi]C[A mistake. Black's huge group is in a B I G trouble.]
;W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[hl];W[gl];B[hm]C[Black is dead. A good compensation for White. The game becomes close suddenly.]
;W[gm];B[hn];W[go];B[ho];W[hp]C[I am happy at this moment to have played stones to stabilize my group earlier. My attack is ok thanks to them]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[hj];W[ik];B[il];W[jk];B[jl];W[kk]

;W[lk]LB[nc:C][lh:B][lk:A]C[A is useless in this situation. B is a good attacking point. It uses Black's wall's weaknesses very effectively. C is also a possibility, increasing White's corner territory and at the same time greatly reducing Black's moyo.]

There are some main issues in this game:

 *After the fuseki (the opening) Black gained   a strong lead.

 *Blacks strong walls throughout the fuseki   and the middle game.
 
 *White's invading to the upper-left side of    the board.
 
 *Black's failure in securing his weak groups     in the center.

The game was very interesting because it had so many turning points. I hope you are satisfied with this review. Like I mentioned at the beginning, this was my first review ever. I hope this was the kind of review you wanted.
