C[My comments are preceded by "[Malweth\]." I played Black in this game on KGS. Your comments are appreciated.

Thank you.

Hi Melweth.
This was an interesting game.
In fact you made errors similar to my own.
If you are going to kill your opponents group you have to have secure own groups. You should try to read that out before attacking.

I t was a fighting game. White played a lot of overplays. I think you could easiliy win, if you do not try to kill him everywhere. Just let him live on a small scale.

I precede my comment with g4.

thanks for the chance to review this game
go4fun];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[jp];B[cf]C[[Malweth\] I'm not a big fan of the 3 space high joseki -- I haven't really studied them yet. This is why I tenuki.

g4: K4 is too far away. So it seems safe to tenuki.];W[gc];B[cm]
C[g4: I don't like this move very much. It requires two moves to make your left side group secure. But if you have a plan, this might be not a problem.]
;W[fp]C[[Malweth\] I allow W to make the first move here, so I can respond correctly instead.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[dq];W[cq]LB[eq:A]C[g4: Should be at A (E3) for giving a strong position.]
;B[eq];W[cp];B[go];W[gn];B[fn]C[[Malweth\] The cut MUST be good.

g4: I am not sure. White has sente and he has more or less the corner an seems safer, but if you are confident in fighting, this is ok.]
;W[ep];B[mq]LB[hn:A][io:B]C[g4: Your 5 stones could get weak after white A at H6 . This seems not to be a good result. I would prefer black B at J5.]
;W[hn];B[io]C[[Malweth\] I should have read this out better... As painful as it is, an extension around J3 is probably best.

g4: Yes. Now the cut is painfull. But if you played J3, white would have surrounded black giving him a good result.]

(;W[gq]C[g4: A little too ambitious I think. I would have played as in the variation.]

(;B[gr]C[g4: Why not H3? Look at the variation.];W[hq];B[ip]
;W[hr];B[er]C[[Malweth\] Now I'm just making this a sacrifice.]
;W[cr];B[iq];W[fs];B[ir];W[gs];B[fm]C[g4: This seems nearly as good as in the variation some move ago. Perhaps it is slightly better, because you got sente for the F7 move.]
;W[in];B[jn]C[g4: K5 seems good enough.];W[jo];B[jm]C[[Malweth\] The split is good...

g4: Yes should be.];W[hl];B[hm]C[[Malweth\] But this is a misread. I fail to see what W can do to the F6 stones.

Probably best to just L3 now.

g4: Since H7 does not work, you should leave this for later. I don't think that L3 is necessary.]
;W[gm];B[il]C[g4: This is your strong side. Better to strengthen your weak stones on the left.]
;W[fl];B[el];W[ek];B[fk];W[gl];B[dk];W[ej]
(;B[em]LB[dj:A]C[g4: Better to give up the two stones, and play  at D10 (A).]
;W[dj];B[ck];W[cj]C[g4: black has a cramped position now, even if he manages to live.]
;B[hk];W[gk];B[bj];W[bi];B[bk];W[dh]C[g4: This is much better for white. Now he has potential on the left.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[ec]C[g4: E18 at A is the only move.]

(;W[ed]C[g4: Why not cut? see var];B[fc];W[gd];B[gb];W[hb];B[fb]
;W[he]
(;B[kq]C[g4: Unnecessary. If you fear the cut, bear in mind that the group has 5 liberties, and you can sacrifize the two stones if it is necessary.]
;W[lo]C[[Malweth\] This has GOT to be an overplay. I almost killed it...

g4: Yes this is an overplay.];B[ln]C[g4: Don't touch what you are attacking.]

;W[qr];B[rr]C[g4: That looks difficult now. What if white had played A at S1 ?]

(;W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[qs];W[on];B[ql]C[[Malweth\] Perhaps this was a mistake... It's the only killing move, though.

g4: Looks good to me. A little more safe is R9.];W[ol];B[ok]
;W[mn]
(;B[lm]C[Perhaps this is the mistake... I need a more solid defense.

g4: May be you can play at M8 or N9. If white kills that stone,, you can destroy his second eye with S7. see var.]
;W[mm];B[ml];W[pk];B[pj];W[nk];B[oj];W[ll];B[mk];W[lk];B[mj]
;W[lj];B[li]C[[Malweth\] This is definitely an error. The correct idea would be to run with the K7 group... perhaps by living with L6, M4, L8?

g4: Yes, Always strengthen your weaker group. That should give you a good continuation.]

;W[jl];B[ko];W[im];B[ji];W[kj];B[kh];W[kn]
(;B[ih]C[[Malweth\] I don't get enough, and it's in gote.

g4: That seems really uninteresting. You should take the big point at L17. Or perhaps at P17]
;W[jg];B[jh];W[ng]C[[Malweth\] Another overplay by white... I expected O16.]

.];W[pb];B[qb];W[qc];B[ob];W[rb]C[[Malweth\] O18 first was necessary I think. The final mistake.

g4: O18 will not help either.];B[qd];W[oc];B[pc];W[qa];B[nb]
;W[rd];B[qg];W[qh];B[rg]C[[Malweth\] It's impossible for B to live inside here...]
;W[rh];B[ri]C[[Malweth\] Now the game is over - I'm playing overplays for my opponent's mistake (which doesn't come).]
