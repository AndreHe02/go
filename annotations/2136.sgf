C[Hello !

Nice to meet you ^^

I am Kyoshinai, 18k, and this a game I played on kgs against zloy, 18k. It is my first game reviewed, so the comments I tried to add my not fit the exercise.

I do not really know what my biggest weaknesses are - except that I'm terrible at yose -, so it could be nice if you'd point them out. And please feel free to comment on white's moves.

I thank you for your review.];B[pd]C[Hi Kyoshinai.  I have a kitten whose name is Kyoshi  :)

This is your first game for review and my first game as reviewer.  I hope I can be of some help.

First move comment - personally I like it when people honour tradition and play in the top right corner :)

Comments on the game overall:  

- Overall I thought you both played well.  

- You won by 12.5 which is a comfortable win.  Therefore, by definition, you did everything right.  I suggest you send in a game to be reviewed which you lost by about this amount.

- Much of the opening and beginning of the middle game is a *very*  'peaceful'.  Is zloy a friend of yours whom you do not wish to offend? Peaceful is fine, but these moves border on being too polite or amicable or even a little fearful.  

So I think both sides could benefit from engaging in some more fighting and strengthening that part of your game. I used to play 13x13 games to learn this a bit quicker.  It shouldn't be a problem for you looking at the way you dealt with the 3-3 invasion in the top right. 

- I think White could have punished you a little bit more for your Bad Shape at times.  Find some info on Good Shape then try to make this and force your opponent into Bad Shape.

Thaat's all I can think of.  If you have any further specific questions please email me or find me at KGS ('rog').  If I have said anything which you find out is wrong then please let me know  ; )

Oh, please don't take all the variations too seriously.  In some of them I am just experimenting with ideas and left them in for you to think about.  Where I think a variation is 'better' I have stated as much.

Wishing you fun and Fighting Spirit in the New Year.

rog: i disagree.  Look again - Black looks good in this fight.  The only thing White has is the N9 stone (and possibly an attack against the dreaded Empty Triangle! at N8)]

rog: Well, after looking at a couple of variations G12 does look pretty good.... (not sure if I'm missing something that White could do)]
