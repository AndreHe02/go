  This my first game for review, i started to play Go a week ago against the computer and on IGS network I ranked myself with lowest rank 30K.

Thanks!

Guilherme

Welcome to the game of Go then.  I would suggest you present games from live players as the computer can be apt to make stupid moves which lulls you into the habit of playing hoping for an opponents mistake.  Still, the computer is good when starting out to firm out the rules of play but nothing beats a human player who can instruct you throughout the game.]
;W[dc]
(;B[gj]C[Ok, you are playing handicap go.  The trick to that is that the extra stones are there from the get go to harass your opponents, playing D-9 or D-8 was the move here (see variation)]
;W[ic];B[jg];W[dh];B[ej]C[As you can see, you went easy on white, now it has a presence on large part of the board.]
;W[je];B[kf];W[jd];B[kd];W[ce];B[jb]C[Very conservative play throughout this game.  F-7, B-6 and others make for bigger play (territory outline if you will).]
;W[fd];B[gg]C[After my fuseki i didn´t know what to do, so i started to get the center territory

Outlining territory in the center is part of fuseki.];W[ib]
;B[hh]C[Play in your territory for defense, but white is not attacking you.  Perhaps H-9?]
;W[bi];B[ke];W[bj];B[eg]C[Unless you want to lose lower left, you should have played B-3]
;W[bk];B[ch];W[cj];B[dk];W[bl];B[dg];W[cl];B[ek]C[D-2 would block and defend.]
;W[dl];B[bc]C[This is a foolish invasion (anything besides the 3-3 point when backup is not available).  The computer gave you this corner but I would suggest you not add it to your armory as a lone invader.]
;W[cd];B[cb];W[db];B[bd];W[bh];B[cg];W[el];B[fl]C[This time i didnt know where to defend F2 or B7

F-2 as the B-11 group is dead (I know, it lives later and dies again).]
;W[bg];B[bf];W[be];B[ae];W[ca];B[ad];W[cf];B[ba];W[da];B[ab]
C[In reality, white would have played A-12 instead of D-13 and killed your group.  Your corner is now alive.]
;W[if];B[he]C[At this point i didn´t know if i should attack white or defend the upper right group

Your upper right is a fortress.  However, this stone H-9 is easily cut off with white H-8.  G-9(reduce your opponent) or D-5(keep white out of your territory) would be better.]
;W[gd];B[id];W[jc];B[jf];W[hd];B[ie];W[hf];B[ge]C[Another good reason not to play against a computer, it plays asinine moves like this.]
;W[fe];B[gf];W[df];B[gb]C[A hopeless invasion, defend at D-5.  Normally this is endgame, as the territory is set and only the boundaries are in question.]
;W[af];B[fa];W[fc];B[ha];W[hc];B[di]C[I didn´t know how to escape here. Please comment this part

Let em die, they are lost points,];W[ia];B[ec];W[cc];B[ed];W[bb]
C[In your attempt to save dead stones you lost the corner that the computer so graciously gave you (see how you lost the two eyes with that capture?)]
;B[ee];W[cb];B[ef];W[eb]C[OK, look at the variation to see a possible way out of this.]

(;B[ff];W[fb];B[eh]C[Wasted move, L-12 or F-1 better.  Don't bother killing the dead.]
;W[gc];B[ka];W[ja];B[kb];W[fm];B[gm];W[em];B[gl];W[dj];B[ei]
C[No need, just pass.];W[de];B[ig]C[Ditto for most of these last moves.]
;W[dd];B[hg];W[ci];B[dh]C[Ok, here you just poked out one of your eyes.]
;W[hb];B[ga];W[ac];B[ma];W[ea];B[lb];W[aa];B[mc];W[ii]C[Now white invade my territory and start to defend. Did I payed right? What could i have done to defend my territory more effectivy way.]
;B[hi];W[ik];B[hj];W[jl];B[ij];W[kl];B[jk];W[ll];B[lk];W[ki]
;B[ml];W[il];B[jj];W[hm]C[Kill white with K-1];B[gk];W[km];B[ih]
;W[ji];B[li];W[kh];B[lh];W[hl];B[kj];W[hk];B[fj];W[lm];B[mk]
;W[tt];B[mm];W[tt];B[jm];W[im];B[kg];W[tt];B[jm];W[tt];B[jh]
;C[  Well in the end of the game I think i did it well, but i know that I have a lack of technique and knowledge about the game procedures. Thx!]

(;B[fb];W[ea];B[ff];W[hb];B[ja];W[ga]C[Now you have a Ko,  of course you have no Ko threats to force white to answer.  Also, the K-12 group is in trouble soon so you will have to defend if you lose the ko.]
))
(;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc]C[Or something similar, and you have sente (initiative).]
