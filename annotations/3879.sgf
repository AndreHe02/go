C[W: Hello! Firstable, thanks for reviewing this game. I am very grateful for any comments, but especially interested in local tactics, and the best variation of a pincer i've made later at D12. The outcome was very bad for me and decided the game. I'm doing very hard trying to count during my games to realise how behind or ahead i am, but sometimes i make some unreasonable moves, trying to kill a group when i can win the game just by playing defensive. And then the outcome becomes very bad for my weaKER groups..

hello sekimoto,
this is my first comment in the teaching ladder. So don't expect too much. I am an experienced go-teacher and I'm used to give comments, so it will not be too bad.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[qo];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp];W[op]C[Here i played P4 instead of Q3 to prevent black to get a bigger moyo and a good outside influence. Is it ok?
p4 seems to be ok. q3 would be ok too. I would like to play at o17 first, expecting b to answer at r14 or q14]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[pr]SQ[lp]C[I was going to play at L3, but he had K4, so i was thinking to play at M4, but it seems too close to my stones. Is there any other good choice for me here, or P7 is just ok?]

(;W[om]C[m4 or m3 are good choices, m4 a bit better, because Q2 makes the second line worthless. Otherwise, m3 is stronger against k4.
p7 seems to be to far away, looking at the strong black stones q2-r5. When playing in this direction, I would prefer q6]

(;B[pn]C[a bit harmless];W[on]C[easy and good for white];B[mq]

(;W[hq]C[Is H3 correct? Or should attack in other place? Or just run out with my stick?

I think, H3 is possible and a good move.
You should not run with p3-p7, I would prefer to keep the black stones splitted in two groups.
But P2 would be very slow, allowing Black to strengthen his three stones.]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[gq];W[ip];B[ho];W[iq];B[fo];W[io];B[hn]
(;W[lp]C[You can not avoid P2, so this could be ok];B[or];W[lq]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[lr];W[kr]
(;B[mr]C[a bit lucky, black plays calm
i can not analyse it, it is too complicated]
(;W[mn]C[good position for you, I think, M6 is a better connection]
;B[in];W[ep]C[I would not play here. White gains neerly nothing, but he loses a ko-threat and perhaps the move e3 (which now is bad shape)]
;B[fp];W[jn]C[ok];B[jm];W[qf]C[Wrong side?

I think so, P7 is a good help to invade any territory b is building up.
So this side is not urgent.
BTW, I would have played at L6, but your choice to tenuki may be ok.]
;B[qh];W[of];B[nd]
(;W[pi]C[I don't like this move. The upcoming fight is very hard. I would prefer P12]
;B[qi];W[pj]C[You are risking a lot!];B[ph];W[oh];B[qj];W[pk]
;B[pg];W[pf];B[og];W[ng];B[nh];W[oi];B[nf];W[mg]C[the land of 1000 cuts]

(;B[ql]C[b should fight with P15];W[ne]C[lucky white];B[mf]
C[I think i made a mistake here. Should i force him with  N15 an then attack his group(Q16)?]

(;W[rd]C[I think you are right. Fighting against O,Q16  would be better]
;B[me];W[qc];B[oe]
(;W[lg]C[looking good, but leaving aji];B[mi]C[I didn't know how to attack his stones here... It seems M10 is ok, but i've made a mistake in the semeai that reduced my center group.]

(;W[lj]C[I would prefer M11, but you really like to fight!]
;B[pl]
(;W[ol]C[Maybe this is a mistake, you should capture N11 at once]
;B[li]
(;W[ki]C[hard fight again, did you shink about L10?];B[mj];W[lk]
;B[kh];W[kg];B[mk]
(;W[kj]C[I don't like this move, empty triangle, too good options for black]
;B[ll];W[kl];B[lh];W[jh]C[stubborn? B has got a group eith 5 liberties, you have got several groups with 4, 3, 3 liberties.
Maybe M7 is better];B[nl];W[nk];B[jg]
(;W[ni]C[I would prefer to save L10-stones. perhaps you can attack H6-group
To save this group means to get (keep) influence, not only points.]
;B[ji];W[ih];B[jj];W[mh];B[kk]
(;W[jf]C[a bit too slow,
k12 stones mean nothing, a possible attack against O16 means everything]
;B[de];W[dh]C[And here is the pincer.. The result was very bad for me

I would pincer too, but at D13];B[fd];W[ee]C[fight again, but joseki]
;B[ed];W[dd];B[ce]C[I am not a joseki-expert, but up to now ManyFacesOfGo says ok, C15 called a bad move.
Now the tutor shows E14 and the lexicon ends ;)]
(;W[fe];B[eb]C[After the game, i took a look at kogo and the follow-up move for black is at G16. Is E18 ok for him or how should i punish him?

sorry, I cannot answer this question. I would have chosen D18 too]
;W[db];B[gb];W[cd];B[cg];W[ch];B[bd];W[bc];B[bf];W[ad];B[bh]
;W[bi];B[dg];W[eg]C[too many cutting-points again. First play against the upper group with G15]
;B[eh];W[ah]C[Maybe you can kill, but e13 and e15 seem to be too week.]
;B[ef];W[fg];B[ff]C[very bitter];W[ge];B[gf];W[he];B[ei]
(;W[gh]C[i think i should've played at H13 and let him get my stones. The loss would be small than the continuation.

You can not save all the stones, but I think you should use the shortage of liberties in the G14 group]
;B[bg];W[cj]C[If there is a chance to kill, this is the only move, otherwise I would prefer D10]
;B[dj];W[ci];B[ae];W[be];B[hf]
(;W[ie]C[I think, this move is too slow];B[hh];W[gi]
(;B[bd]C[J13 would be easy for w];W[ac];B[hi];W[gj];B[ig];W[hc]
;B[ck];W[bk]C[no chance anymore to capture E11-group];B[cl]
;W[ek];B[dk];W[bl];B[el];W[ej];B[di];W[hb];B[pb];W[lc];B[mc]
;W[pc];B[oc]
(;W[qb]C[Las question: Should i had play at M18? Or the reducion at R18 is bigger?

    No, I am afraid, the white group in the corner would die

Thanks again!

   So, my comment ends here, too.
   I spent about 3 hours, maybe, our difference in threnght is too small.
   I hope I could help a bit.
  My general hint is:
  Start your fights, when you really want to fight! Be prepared first.
