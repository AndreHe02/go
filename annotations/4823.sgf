C[Hi. This is a game I played on DGS. I'm a beginner and rightfully and deservedly lost this game.

I think I made some stupid mistakes. More interesting than those obvious mistakes that I see myself would be comments on other mistakes I haven't seen.

Also some comments on how I could have cut my losses better would be appreciated.

Okay, here we go. I am white.

[dwheeler\] I hope my comments and review are helpful.

some areas you need to work on:

1) practice life and death -- there were lots of missed opportunities because neither of you recogonized them.

be more aware of when a group is alive (2 or more eyes), and when it still might be killable. Don't try to kill a live group.

2) try to keep your groups connected. when black separates your groups, you will have twice as many to protect in half the number of moves.

3) opening - look for bigger moves, and moves with duel purposes (e.g., both attack and defense at the same time)

4) you are already mindful of protecting your cutting points. keep that up!  but now try to do so in sente (i.e., defend while attacking)]
;B[jk];W[cd]C[I open on C10 with the intention to follow up later on E11.

[dw\] while your intentions are good, often we don't get the chance to follow up like that because the opponent will play there first. Besides, this board is almost too small to make standard opening plans like that. Could be too safe and small. But good thinking nonetheless]
;B[dk];W[jd];B[jg]LB[hd:B][di:A]C[We have divided the corners so far and I get a bit nervous when he is approaching me. How should I react here?

[dw\] he's not really threatening you yet, at least not enough to worry about. Playing at A (d5) looks interesting to me. But I suppose B (h10) would be the correct move here. You don't want black to invade here.]

(;W[cg]LB[hd:C][ci:A][di:B]C[I decide to ignore it for now (he isn't too close) and claim some territory on the left.

[dw\] feels too small to me. you can attack a little stronger at A or B, otherwise you give black too much. Try to make your moves have more than one purpose -- i.e. make territory and attack at the same time. you can defend your territory while he's on the run from your attacks.]
;B[ch];W[dh];B[ci]
(;W[df]LB[hd:D][bg:B][dg:A][eh:C]TR[gk]C[He attacks closely. I hane and protect the cutting point.

[dw\] this move is too passive, you shouldn't have to worry about this cut just yet. because I think the ladder works for you.

you still have the weakness at D. A is a more solid and prefered connection anyway. C aims at invading black's bottom. B is also a strong move threatening to undercut black's side.]
;B[gj];W[kf]LB[hd:A]C[I try to get at least the corner, if not anything on the right side.

[dw\] right now your top side is bigger and more important to protect and secure.]
;B[kc]C[He invades and I have no idea what to do.

[dw\] this is a very common joseki: 3-3 invasion to 4-4 stone. you should learn a few of the most common responses to this one. Basicly, you allow him to live small in the corner, while you take larger influence on the outside.

a starting point: http://senseis.xmp.net/?44Point33InvasionJoseki]

(;W[jb]LB[jc:X]C[[dw\] not good. leaves a big hole for your opponent to push through later.

If I were to find one move that could be considered your losing move for this game, then this one (and the next few moves) might be it.]
;B[kb];W[ka]LB[jc:A];B[la];W[ja]LB[jc:A];B[mb];W[ld]LB[jc:A]
TR[ja][ka][jb]C[[dw\] noooooo! big weakness here.

even if you manage to save your stones now, he will have distroyed everything else]

(;B[lc]LB[ma:2][lb:1]TR[jc][kd]C[Containment, nothing more. He doesn't have much territory. So far so good.

[dw\] he has two eyes and lots of escape routes to gain more territory]

(;W[lh]LB[jc:A][kd:B]TR[ja][ka][jb]C[But now I need some more on the right side to get my group to life,

[dw\] noooo..., first you must save your group from certian death. A (k11) is urgent!]
;B[jc];W[ic];B[ib]
(;W[ie]LB[hb:B][id:A]C[[dw\] solid connection (A) is better

but you also don't want black moving across the top leaving you with nothing, so (see variation for B)]

(;B[kd];W[ke];B[le]LB[ja:3][ma:1][lb:2][ld:4]C[M10 is lost and I can't do anything about it. Pity, that's his second eye.

[dw\] actually, that would be his fourth eye for that group.]
;W[lf]LB[hb:A]TR[lh]C[So again, containment and trying to get at least something on the right side.

[dw\] containment on the top is more urgent and bigger!!

you already have a supporting stone on the side (triangled, m6), so he can't get far. but you don't want to let black escape into the open on the top.]
;B[md]
(;W[mf]LB[hb:A]C[[dw\] not necessary. doesn't force black to defend (even though he does). A is much more important.]
;B[me];W[ih]LB[hb:A]C[K7 is a nuisance. I decide to attack.

[dw\] J12 is the real nuisance (as you soon see). Must not let black out into the open.]
;B[hc];W[id];B[gc];W[ec];B[eb]
(;W[fb]LB[db:A]C[[dw\] I feel this is on the wrong side. but stronger players than me say this is ok]
;B[db];W[fc]TR[ja][ka][jb]C[Maybe I can capture the H11 group somehow?

[dw\] no, H11 is alive already, because K13 group is dead. well, actually it depends on black's next move, because the K13 group still has some aji due to the H12 weakness]

(;B[cc]
(;W[ac]LB[bc:A]C[A11: reduce him. Does he necessarily live in the upper left or can I still kill him?

[dw\] this move doesn't help you at all. You allow black to take B11, when you should have taken it first yourself. White at b11 would reduce black more.

I don't think you can kill black in the corner now];B[bc];W[bd]
;B[ab];W[ad];B[ba]C[Okay, that answers it for now.

[dw\] yes, black is alive now.

and white has no territory (maybe 5-10 points altogether), while black has maybe 30-40 points of territory so far.

time to pull a rabbit out of your hat -- or resign.

there's no way to get that much territory in the center, and invading and living in the lower side is unlikely.

and of course, now's the time to go after the H11 group that you had your eye on earlier.]

(;W[dd]LB[hb:A];B[gb];W[ea]LB[jh:A]C[[dw\] too small. end game move. still bigger moves on the board.]

;B[ei];W[gh]LB[gd:A]C[[dw\] not necessary. closing the door at A is more urgent now.]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[ah];W[af]LB[aa:1][cb:2]TR[ca][bb]C[By now, it looks like he has all of the bottom and I can only try to get the middle. G10/H10 looks frightening, he can reduce me quite a bit there. Honestly, I don't know whether I relized that at this stage or only later in the game.

Also, I wasn't really sure whether his upper left really lived. After playing some scenarios through, I decided that my idea of C12 wouldn't work.

[dw\] the upper left is alive - it has two eyes.];B[ag];W[gd]
C[Fixing that dangerous leak.

[dw\] whew! its about time :)];B[hd];W[he]LB[ha:A]C[[dw\] black must not forget to protect here now]
;B[mj];W[mi];B[mk]
(;W[gf]LB[ha:B][fe:A]TR[fd][ge]C[Covering the cutting point.

[dw\] but there are two cutting points to protect. playing at A would have covered them both. And a solid connection at F10 would have been even better.

however B is even better now. black cannot connect because he is short of liberties. then there'll be no cutting point to worry about at all.]

(;B[ck]C[Why does he do that? Did I have a realistic chance to invade down there?

[dw\] maybe, maybe not. he does have a small weakness at A5. but the point is that he is far enough ahead in the game that he can afford to be lazy and not fully read out the situation, so he can afford to be extra defensive here.

I can't find a way for white to live on the left, so black was just being extra cautious there, but the right side looks more interesting (see variations).]

(;W[fd]LB[dc:A]TR[gf]C[Making the cut impossible.

[dw\] it cost you a point.

Playing the triangled stone (G8) there in the first place would have saved you that point.

But playing at A instead is worth 2 points (its only worth one point, but it saves you the point you lost here plus it also forces black to protect).]
;B[tt]C[He passes.]N[B PASS];W[dc]C[I reduce his upper left by one point.

[dw\] yes.];B[cb];W[tt]LB[ha:A][hj:B]N[W PASS];B[tt]N[B PASS]
