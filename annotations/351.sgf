C[Small games as this one tend to become terribly complicated. Computing the variations accurately may really be beyond me. You will have to ask a Dan for this.]
;B[jc];W[dj]C[I definitely play more territory oriented on small boards like this.]
;B[jk];W[ed]C[Don't know if this is a good strategy on small boards. Black can easily invade both corners, and a wall might not be so easy to use for attack against the two black stones.]

(;B[dc]C[The correct invasion point is C10. However, Black could also secure one of the corners first. White has to corners, which are oen for invasion.]
;W[dd];B[cc];W[cd];B[fb]
(;W[ki]C[I'd prefer an extension from the left lower stone. White can then play against one of the Black corners.]

(;B[fk]C[I'd prefer G3, or a pincer. H3 is now the weak spot. But there will be no time to cover it.]
;W[dk]C[This looks strange in combination to the wall. But I know no other strategy at this point.]

(;B[dg]C[Black is spreading himself very thinly.
The two stones below are not really connected, since White can play on H3 later.]

(;W[fj]C[This is a leaning attack, strengthening White below, while at the same time strengthening black. It is aimed at D7.
However, this is a difficult strategy. White could have topped the lonely stone instead, gaining influence and then trying H3.]
;B[fg]C[Black cannot play anything else. The white wall must now be used for attack. but this is not so easy here. Rather, the wall is looking lonely.]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[gj];B[kj]
(;W[hj]C[Not effective. Must be on K5];B[ik]C[Consequently this should go to K5.]

(;W[ch]C[This is habitual territory play. Black will cut and the three white stones become fruitless, and only a target for attack.]
;B[cg];W[bh];B[bg]
(;W[bd]C[Black cannot connect here. So this move is meaningless. White needs to try to escape (if this is still possible at all).]

(;B[ge]C[This move makes a lot of trouble to White.
However, H7 is safer.];W[ec];B[eb];W[gd];B[he];W[hd]

Should be on J9.];W[ef];B[eg];W[ff]

I would try H6.];W[gf];B[hf];W[hg];B[hh];W[ig]
(;B[ih];W[jg]
(;B[ji]C[This is out ouf question. But if Black connects, nothing is clear either.]
;W[fe]LB[ie:A]C[I should have played at A.

Of course.

That move is terrible shape. You were probably thinking of making eyes this way. However, You have two weak groups to care for. So A should have appeared to you.]
;B[ie];W[jh]C[Looks very direct. But I cannot see another way to save the white stones.]

(;B[ij]C[Aji and bad shape. Must be on J5];W[gh]C[Does not work at this time. White must secure the group at the left first of all.]

(;W[kd]MA[bg][cg][dg][eg][fg][gg][hg][ig][jg][kg][lg][jh]C[White cannot live that way. M11 makes it more difficult. Notice, that this is a fight between the white and black row of stones.]
