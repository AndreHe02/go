C[This is an incomplete friendly over 
the board  game (fuseki only)
where I played black and we discussed our moves while playing.
Often, it was difficult for us to choose the correct area to
play in.
If you could indicate the correct direction of play at each stage
and  which are the good and bad moves and who stands better,
that would help us improve. I have questions 
throughout.];B[qd];W[dd];B[cp];W[qq];B[oc];W[eq];B[cm]C[I played C7 instead 
of d7 to end with sente to take R10];W[cq];B[bq];W[dp];B[co]
;W[cr];B[qj];W[jc];B[lq]C[I chose M3  to break up white's side. 
Is that a good idea. Is
K3 or L3 equally good/bad? Instead, how about M17 or C14 or R5
or other?



The possible points you mentioned are all good choices, I cannot tell which 
one better.];W[nq];B[iq];W[cf];B[lc]C[Not sure how important B2 is or when 
either white or black should
play it. What I'm thinking was if white plays it, black tenukis,
and if black plays it, then it induces white g3 putting pressure
on black group? So I figure too early.

I played M7 first before corner invasion. Instead, would invasion
first be better? or how about around R5?


B2 is still too early for both side, this move M17 or around R5 are 
good.];W[je];B[dc]C[other invasion points??


D18, E18, H17 etc.];W[ec];B[eb];W[cc];B[db];W[fc];B[bc]
(;W[cd];B[cb];W[bd];B[fb];W[gc];B[bb];W[ck]C[what about the last few moves? 
black lives in gote, white gets
big moyo. Who stands better?

What should black do now? Is it too soon for B8? I thought F6
was more dynamic than B2


Since 34 is really a good point, I think white stands better.
B8 is good now, F6 is fine too.];B[fn];W[ek]C[Now I don't know what to do 
for black.

1. B8 looks like sente and strengthens both of us

B8 is ok.

2. a reducing move in the center? but where? g9? k10 k11???

G9 maybe ok.
If you want to reduce white moyo, draw a line between 20/36 and choose a 
point.

3.a competing moyo move  m15? r13
l14?

I do not know, but R13 is not good.
4.g3 or b2 (I considered these approx meaie?)

5. the last open area around r5 r6
and I actually chose.....];B[pn]C[only because not many high black 
stones.];W[dn]C[This looks like an interesting fight is going to occur where
I don't know what will happen. Fortunately, we decided to finish
our game here.

Who stands better and why? What should happen now?


Hard to say who is better, I think close.]
