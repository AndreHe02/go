C[R: Hi there! I will mark my comments with "R:". You can reach me at KGS (my nick is egymonk). I'm 5k EGF.

R: Well, it is said without some healthy confidence, one is destined to failure. :-)  Why do you think your opponent is much stronger?  (s)he has accepted your challenge in an even game, hasnt (s)he? Certainly you are strong enough then. You said you were playing deffensively. In an handicap game it may make a sense. In case of even game it does not. In case of even game you definitely *must* play the move you feel (or know) to be best. Of course, if your opponent is better, you might lose. But if you play moves even you know to be wrong, you will lose to the better player 110% sure. A rule of thumb to remember: If somebody find you worthy to play a real even game with, she is NOT better than you! Even if she happens to be 6d ! :-)   Crush her ! :-))

In this game I played white. In the opening I soon realized that I am playing agains a much stronger player, so naturally I started playing defensively to ensure the survival of my own groups. Thus I failed to stake out much potential territory in the opening, or rather my opponent stole all my territory. During the middle game I managed to destroy black's big moyo in the center but there was nothing I could do about his territory on the upper and lower sides.]
;B[jc]C[Black is confortable with this move because he thinks he is much stronger. He is right.

R: I think there is nothing wrong with that move. You dont need to be much stronger to play it. Btw, if you are surprised by some strange opening move, you can always answer with some mirror go.  Surprise to surprise. :-)]

(;W[pn]C[R: what is wrong with R5? You should  hold the corner group under pressure to keep sente. If you think B can cut because of the ladder, see var.]
;B[pj];W[np];B[ep];W[dn];B[cq]
(;W[bp]C[R: It seems to be a bit deffensive to me. It was W corner. Fight for it. Get the corner for free is too good for B.]
;B[dq];W[cj]C[R: You should push into the corner. Black will answer or lose the corner (and  strength) completely. If black play B3, he get 6 points never wil have to worry about his corner and weakens W's group.]
;B[dl]C[Another harsh move typical of stronger players.];W[cl]
;B[ck]C[R: B obviously wants you to crosscut so that he can atari at c7 and separate the corner group. If W want to ruin this plan (always good idea :) simply pull back (c7). (var)]

;W[cn]TR[bh][ch]C[My group on the left is alive but has no territory, black has lower side and thickness. This is obviously not a good exchange for me but mere surviving was the first priority. I fear if I tried to compete for center influence, my group would've been eyeless and under attack.

R: The real problem is that W has let B to build that great outer influence. Plus the bad aji at triangles.
R: However I feel weakness in that black wall, so I would add one more move even in expense of sente.]
;B[cf]C[Normally this would be a bad move for black it is close to my thickness and is pincered already. However this knowledge does not help me because I don't know how to press on the stone. Perhaps D14 would be good but if he manages to survive I'd be in trouble.

R: It really seems to be on the wrong side. Ok, let see what can be done? General rule is : press that stone to your thickness, chase it and make territory. see var.
R: Keep in mind, normally you cannot kill that stone. But you dont have to. Just carefully separate from the others, create influence and see what happens.]

(;W[bd]LB[fc:B][gc:A]TR[jc]C[Thus yet again I delayed attacking until I establish a base for my stones.
R: ok, but this way you dont really gain solid base. Triangle might undermine your plan if B plays somewhere at A or B.]
;B[fc]C[Another harsh move from black. I seem to be in a tight spot. Also if black plays a stone in the upper right corner, it would be difficult for me to do anything there.]

;B[dg];W[ef];B[eg];W[ff]TR[jc][cf][dg][eg][ch]C[OK, I seem to be alive again but no territory.

C[Black pushed me around. Now I have a chance to take the initiative.]
;W[pe]C[At this point, perhaps invading the lower or upper sides was necessary but I decide to give good shape to my stones in the upper right before doing anything else.
R: your stones were already in good shape. 3 stones vs 2. Its a good oportunity to attack and invade indeed.]
;B[nd]
(;W[oe]LB[lc:B][ld:A]TR[qi]C[I realize this is slow but if I attack I might do more harm then good.
R: Its better to take out the base  of black group at the right side and make some points. If you really want to fight you can invade at A or even  B]

[fp][gp][hp][fq][gq][hq][er][fr][gr][hr]C[I should have played on R11 but I wanted to make sure I had a clear way out in order to reduce his central moyo.

R: W should worry about the lower side moyo, and the center instead.  Upper side is far less important. B cannot make a moyo there (var).]

(;W[rg]C[My group could probably make life even without this defensive move but I didn't want to take any chances with him. This submissive play loses the game for me but what could I do.

R: You feel right. w has nothing to worry about. I think attack the right side or invade at lower side the right thing to do.]
;B[rh];W[pb]C[R: this would be a big end game move, but its gote and there would be a lot of things to do...]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[lo]C[R: Its big point. Now invading is hard.]
;W[gq]C[I want to know what you think about this move? Is there a way to survive there?
R: sure. Black wall is weak. Even if this stone eventually die, W surely get something for it.]

;B[me];W[od]LB[ij:A][em:B]C[R: Its small. 7 points only. B might tenuki. 
R: You can countinue your march into the center at A (and completely ruin it)  or cut at B and run the wall or even attack the right side.]

(;B[oc];W[md];B[nc]
(;W[mc]C[R: Pull out is better. You make some extra life and you attack the group in the same way. (var)]

My attacks on lower and upper sides failed, I am behind in territory. Do you think I could turn the game around if I played the endgame differently?

R: If you make a little pressure on the rigth side, tha game could have been easily turned. From now a nice endgame and a little luck would win the game.]

R: General comments? : play what you feel correct in even games, not that you feel safe. You should pay more attention to sente in yose. It can be large difference in the outcome! I think you played well, and i dont feel your opponent is "much stronger" just more agressive player. Maybe you should try this style some day :-)
