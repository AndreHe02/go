C[Hi,

Thank you for reviewing my game. I played white this game.

I was surprised at the end to have lost by a few points... I feel like I
played one of my better games here.

I don't see many places in the game where I should have played differently.
Please help me see where I could have made a big difference.

Thanks again!

adum:
i've tried to point out all the little places where you (and your opponent) have made the biggest mistakes, and to show you what you could have done instead, and why it would be better.

in terms of the big picture, the number one problem i see when looking at your game is wasted moves. you make about five completely wasted moves during this game -- moves that serve no purpose. if you consider that one move is worth about fifteen points, that equals seventy-five wasted points. clearing up this aspect of your game will help enormously. before each move, ask yourself: will this move actually do anything, or am i just putting a stone on the board?

of course, it's not always so easy to know if a move does anything, but looking through your game i can see you have enough skill to avoid most of them.

on a related subject, practice your reading. _know_ if a sequence works.

relearn some fundamentals: don't make empty triangles, play away from strength.

when attacking groups, attack from the outside unless you're sure you can kill them with placement. always a good idea to surround a group and squeeze it. even if it lives, you make lots of profit.

i'd say your single biggest mistake was move 56. learn absolutely positively why this kind of move is just so wrong.

i see some good play and good thinking, so keep playing and studying and you're going to improve.

i hope this is helpful. email me with any questions (adum@adum.com)

;W[jj]C[unusual but not bad];B[cd]
(;W[dd]C[this will end you in gote, so it's a big loss. see variation.]
;B[ce];W[qj]MA[bc]C[you really need B17 here, because the sente for black playing there is too huge]

(;B[qm];W[rl]C[this is not a good move. after black responds, he has a strong two-stone wall. you have a weak stone at S8 doing little right next to his strength. better to play P16, or R3, or O3, or E15, or such.]
;B[rm];W[oc];B[ee];W[fd];B[qg];W[rh];B[qh];W[qi]C[S11 is probably better as S13 is then not sente.]
;B[rg];W[si];B[ql];W[qk]C[Here I sacrificed so my group could still influence the middle --
and hoping to pressure the 3 stones at R13.

adum: a good idea -- the R13 stones are more important. but if you want to sacrifice, no need to play R9 at all. it just forces black to take S8 and get strong. if you simply play a move like O11 now, you leave the possibility of saving S8 later if it becomes useful. this way, you shut a door with no benefit. also, be very wary in general of making a group as strong as the S7 group becomes when you have an option.]
;B[rk];W[rj];B[sl]
(;W[oj]C[way too timid. you can extend farther from this wall. see vars.]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[oi]
(;W[pi];B[ph];W[oh];B[og];W[nh]C[taking is better. the ladder doesn't work, for one thing. even if it did, taking would still be better. taking makes the safety of your R10 stones sure.]
;B[qf]
(;W[pd]C[bad move. these stones are connected already. you're only forcing black to run out and make life and shape. better to try a containing move, and if black lives, he lives small and you get an outside. see variation.]
;B[ng];W[ni];B[oe];W[pf]C[very bad move. you have no chance of killing this group, so this move just provokes black to make life by pushing outwards.]
;B[re];W[rd];B[se];W[sd]C[why? something like O16 is much bigger. black still needs a move to make an eye on the right.]
;B[sg];W[od]C[bad shape: empty triangle. something like N16 is much bigger on the top.]
;B[ne]C[not much of a move by black, either.];W[lc];B[nl]C[Black ends up with a lot of thickness and a big corner here. Was
there a better strategy than the one I adopted?

adum: yes. one mistake was giving black that strong S7 group that seals in his moyo on that side. imagine how it would look if you hadn't done that...

you could have fared better in this exchange, but you did okay. there were a lot of mistakes on both sides. you've got a strong group in the middle, and some territory on the top. not too bad.]

(;W[nk]C[huh? "play away from thickness." this move helps your invincible white stones not at all, but makes black much stronger as he adds another stone.

this is a wasted move.];B[ml];W[mk]C[same again]
(;B[ol]C[useless move by black.];W[oq]C[i think q3 or r3 usually works out better.]
;B[pq];W[or];B[pr];W[lq];B[mq]
(;W[mr]C[this works okay.];B[mp];W[kq];B[nr]C[just take this stone]

(;W[ms];B[nq];W[ns]C[not a good move.];B[os]C[that's a pretty odd move too.]
;W[kr]C[ugly move. bad to get to this point.];B[op]C[small. bad.]

(;W[hr];B[ir];W[iq];B[hq];W[jr];B[gr];W[is];B[gp];W[ip]C[well, it looks like you're alive here on the bottom. (you're not, but you're close.) but at what cost? you made black strong on both sides. overall, a bad invasion. see variation to see how you're not alive yet.]

(;B[gm];W[ek];B[dk];W[el];B[ej]
(;W[dl]C[better to run out first, don't let black close you in. see variation. remember, play light contact moves when invading, not these heavy ones.]

(;B[ck]C[bad move for black, empty triangle.];W[bl]C[black doesn't need to respond to this, so...]

move than N13 I should have done?

adum: N13 is a good move. you might consider A9 first as it's probably sente, but i think N13 is very solid.]
