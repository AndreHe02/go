C[Hi. I'm your reviewer for this game. My comments will be prefixed with "Edgar:"]
;B[pd]C[kaktus [16k\]: good evening
Fosgen [14k\]: hi
kaktus [16k\]: have fun!];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[qn];W[nc];B[kc]
C[Edgar: A rarely used pincer.];W[ne];B[pf];W[ng];B[ph]C[Edgar: The last sequence seemed very good for black. Not only is black's R6 less weak now, he also has gained some territory on the right side. I think White's double jump (O13) is a mistake. Though I'd have been less agressive and played O3 instead of O17 myself.]
;W[pb];B[hd]C[ok until here? suggestions?

Edgar: This is a very bad move. It is tiny and it goes against the corners first, then sides. Plus, even as a natural move it is very inefficient. That area is far from safe (multiple invasion points at J17, F16, and of course C17), and you played the move with only the intention of trying to protect that area, which is inefficient. Always try to play moves that have more than one purpose.

On the other hand, R17 is urgent and, in fact, quite big (corners are always bigger than they seem). Also, R17 prevents the white dragon from getting a solid base so that you may be able to threaten the group and get something out of it (you probably can't kill it but you should be able to get something for attacking it). If white takes R17, black is left with VERY overconcentrated shape, which is what happened in the game.

Even a move like E4 is MUCH bigger than H16.];W[qc]C[Edgar: And white takes the gold...]
;B[qd]C[Edgar: Very bad shape for black, though he really has no choice. The mistake was commited a few moves ago.]
;W[np];B[ni]C[O11 good move? looked like a keypoint...

Edgar: This move by itself doesn't look bad, but maybe later. Currently I'd think E4 would be a good move. Or Q9 to secure the R6 stone and get some territory (I like E4 more though).]
;W[fp]C[Edgar: And white takes the gold... again. Shimaris are always big, and preventing them becomes big also. Attention to corners is a good idea. This is why O11 is not so good, it ignores the big moves in the corners for really not a lot of profit.]
;B[cj];W[cg]C[how to handle c13 best?

Edgar: I would probably have played C9 instead of C10 (since you can make a base with C6, and it limits white's shimari way more), but it's a hard position to evaluate, and it seems to depend on how both sides handle the situation (after C13 that is).]
;B[cd]C[Edgar: Seems overconcentrated. I'd go C15 to put more pressure on the white stone. Though there would be the threat of white C17 and some fighting, I still perfer C15 instead of C16.]
;W[eg];B[ej];W[fd]C[Edgar: And now you see why that part is not secure at all even with H16.]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[ef];W[ff];B[dh];W[fh];B[dg];W[fb]C[Edgar: White came out getting quite a bit, and without too much risk too. it is black's H16/L17 group that is weak now. White F12 is a nice sacrifice for sente.]
;B[gc];W[fc]C[Edgar: E16 better for white.];B[gg];W[fg]C[Edgar: All pretty much forced black moves.]
;B[hh];W[db];B[cb];W[cc];B[bc]C[Edgar: Both White's move and Black's are mistakes. White C17 fails after black D17 (why B17?). The point here is not to let white make a eye (which he does, in sente even).]
;W[dc];B[bb];W[he]C[Edgar: This is the weak point in black's shape. Though not the only one: H18 is also bad for black.]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[hf];W[ie];B[id];W[je]
(;B[le]C[Edgar: G16 actually doesn't work (see variation). One can only say that black is in very bad condition there without good moves in sight, and that white is connected.]
;W[gd];B[hc]C[Edgar: Looks like bad shape. I'd probably sacrifice the H16 stones and jump out with M13.]
;W[gj]C[what about the last sequence?

Edgar: See previous comments.];B[gi]C[Edgar: Bad move. You cannot seperate white, and you are merely forcing white to connect (ajikeshi), and making bad shape in the meanwhile.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[fj];B[ek]C[Edgar: This move looks small and overconcentrated. I think a jump is in order (at the very least E8 is better, though it might be better still with something like D7).]
;W[ij];B[jh];W[lg];B[ki];W[mf]C[Edgar: Bad white move. N11 much better.]
;B[mh];W[lh];B[li];W[ig];B[ih];W[hg];B[jg];W[if];B[kf];W[jp]
;B[cn]C[c6 good? or where to play else?

Edgar: C6 is ok.I'd perfer P6 however, as it looks bigger to me.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[eo];B[nn]C[Edgar: This jump is a little too lose for my taste. I like P6 more. But white's response is not so good either. See variation.]

(;W[qo];B[pn]C[Edgar: Now black is in surprisingly good shape.]
;W[ro];B[lo]C[Edgar: Bad move. It seems like ajikeshi (and a thank-you move). It forces white to protect that weakness (which he wants to do anyway, hence the "thank-you"), which you could have exploited (like how white exploited F16 before). On the other hand, you don't really get that much in return. In fact, it might be possible to play M4 right there instead of M5 because of O6 and the fact that all white stones are on the fourth line, which is ineffective for stopping invasions like this.

Also of interest is the third line open skirt at S6. It is huge.]
;W[lp];B[jo];W[kp]C[Edgar: Safe move, though L5 is *much* better.]
;B[ko];W[rm]C[huge for white to play s7 :\];B[rn

Edgar: Very huge play.];B[rn];W[sn]C[Edgar: This is going to be a pain for black.]

C[Edgar: This is a bad idea. This shape is usually bad for connecting (though it does connect) because of a few weaknesses including the peep and, here, the snapback.]

C[Could you enumerate and show my general mistakes, please? Do you have any other comments or general adives how to play? What are my weaknesses?

Thank you very much for your review!!! ^__^

(kaktus 16k)

Edgar: I always find it interesting to look at the final result of a game, and where each side made territory. For example, look at White's *huge* bottom territory that's between 4th and 5th (!) line. This indicates clearly a strategical mistake by black around that area. In this case, you first didn't approach white's 3-4 to break the shimari, and later on in the game played a bad ajikeshi move (M5) that helped white secure that side.

Another thing to watch out for are large moves in the corners. Like I said before, corner moves are usually larger than they seem.

At this point, the main way to improve is to play, and play some more. This is because you do not yet feel the value of moves in fuseki, something that can be remedied best through much play. Real studying usually starts around 10k KGS (I started studying around there too). Reviews should help though :) I used to get my "teacher" (who is 5k) to look at a few of my games that I don't understand where I went wrong.

Good luck! :)];W[lf]C[kaktus [16k\]: thanks
