C[Dear Reviewer,

 The following is a game between myself and GnuGo, which I hope you will critique. Sadly, I have not yet been able to defeat gnu with komi, thus I am approximately one stone behind. I am thankful, however, that you will review this game for me. So thank you very much. ^.^]
;B[pp]C[I opened with the classic 4-4 point, which I placed in the lower right corner. Just a tradition to put it in that corner, but I am also capable of playing with the 3-4 point as well.]
;W[dd];B[dp]C[again, the 4-4 point. Just a quirk to this particular game.]
;W[qd];B[dj]C[Ben: Approaching with p-16 is an easier game I've found.]
;W[ph];B[jp]C[Usually, i attack one of whites corner's head on with a knight's move, and while the shapes that emerge from that are fun, I am playing to win, so I decided to go for a gradual broadening out. Do you think this is a good idea? Or should I attack with, say... G17?

Ben: It's simply a matter of taste.  If you prefer a particular style try to find a professional player who also plays that way and see how they approach a situation.  Whatever the case there is no substitute for making efficient plays, plays that do more than one thing.]
;W[pn]C[White goes right for the throat, and I get a little nervous. Any good responses/variations here in the 6 moves that follow?

Ben: I found nothing wrong with the variation you chose.];B[np]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[rq];W[pk];B[gc]C[Bam, I attack. I definetely need to get some more territory. But is it good to go for the upper center, or should I play the center point?

Ben: It's difficult to suggest a great move here.  Like I said I find approaching (on move 5) with p-16 makes the game much easier and simpler.  I can't say for sure that alternatives aren't equally as good but it is much more difficult to find a proper course.  So let's just see what this gets you.]

(;W[od]C[WTF?

Ben: I probably would have played e-17.];B[df];W[fq]C[GnuGo does this A LOT. I find that she tends to attack when I attack, and I always end up defending attack after attack until she has built up a huge moyo. Which is why I ignored this and played the next point. Should I have defended instead?

Ben: I will show you something you can do if you want to settle an area and get to the task at hand, however you may equally benefit from an unstable situation.  If you examine professional games you will find pros often make an approach move and leave it after a response for aji while strengthening themselves elsewhere.]

(;B[mc];W[fo]C[Ouch.]
(;B[hq]C[Ben: I think just d-6 is better.];W[dn]C[Variations for the next 8 moves?]

(;B[eo]C[Ben: Try not to reduce your liberties on a weak group even if it gets you a cutting point.]
;W[en];B[fn]C[Ben: I think I would make sure I lived on the inside first.]
;W[go];B[fm];W[cl];B[bj];W[oc];B[ne]C[Here I am threatening to cut off her group from the side, but I'm really aiming for thickening my position towards the center. GnuGo always falls for that sort of thing.]
;W[dr]C[WTF?
Ben: Even though your stones are dead, I think it is try to reduce the aji.  Since the life of two of white's groups is contingent on them dying.]
;B[ng];W[cq];B[ni];W[ee]C[Ben: I was thinking g-15 or even g-14 here.]
;B[dc]C[Usually, i would have tried to halt whites advance towards the center by playing something like F14, but that usually ends up disastrously. So I experimented with going for corner teritory. It works out in this game, but I could benefit from a cleaner aftershape. Especially because things get reeeaal complicated. watch:

Ben: Touching weak stones this way is usually only helping white to get stronger.]

(;W[cd];B[cb];W[ge];B[ie];W[fh];B[ff];W[fe];B[gf];W[hh];B[eh]
;W[fc];B[jh];W[eb];B[ec]
(;W[gb]C[Ben: Evidently a genius move.];B[fd]MA[hc]C[Is this a good move or a bad move? Are there better moves?
Ben: Locally maybe at h-17 (X) is best.];W[fb];B[ed];W[gd];B[hc]
;W[db];B[cc];W[bb];B[bc];W[ca];B[bd]C[Check out the following sequence:]
;W[be];B[ce];W[de];B[ae]
(;W[cf]C[Ben: Computers are fickle things.  Human's are at least consistent in their errors.]
;B[bf]C[Ben: W can't really make a ko, maybe thats what it was thinking and only now realizes too late.  This is good a position to maybe put on the web like sensei's or goproblems.com or just talk it over with a strong player.  I am not 100% sure but I think white is in trouble.  

In any case doing the ko is the only reasonable thing to do at this point for W.]

(;W[ce];B[ab];W[ba];B[bg]C[Shabam!!! I'm alive.];W[cg];B[bh]
;W[ad];B[ac];W[hf];B[he];W[gg];B[if]
(;W[hg];B[eg]C[Shabam!!! White is dead.];W[hj];B[hd];W[ek];B[ch]
;W[gl]C[Darnit! White's a slippery little sucker. She just seems to ooze out of the cracks in my defenses.

Ben: Well you both have spent a lot of effort eliminating aji.]
;B[hn]C[I think I recovered nicely.];W[pf];B[jj];W[rp];B[hb]
C[Ben: Not necessary.];W[nn]C[Here I wanted to halt her advance into my territory, but I'm in miai. Because if I play something like O8 or N6, then she'll play something like L8 and vice versa! I think I'm learning how to get by this, though. Because I attack her solidity in the center of the left, and force her to defend, thus building a wall and sesaling off the miai. Do you think it worked, or could it have been done more effectively?]

(;B[nk]C[Ben: Small];W[mk]C[This is getting bad. Was there a variating to have prevented this?

Ben: See the previous variation for how I would have handled it.]
;B[nj];W[jl]C[AAACK!!!

me ayuda, por favor.];B[kl]C[From here things go to hell. I don't  know how, but I managed to climb out of the pit with the hellhounds in it. Still, I would learn much if you could show me how the following sequence could have been abolished to the wastelands of Kor.]
;W[kk];B[jk];W[km]C[Undo];B[kj];W[ll];B[kn];W[jn];B[ko]C[damn.
Ben: Probably you got of light.  A dan player would have done much much worse.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[nb];B[fi]C[tidying up loose ends is all.];W[gi]
;B[fj];W[fg];B[ef];W[gj];B[ga]MA[mb]C[Ben: What were you afraid of?  Just play X.]

;W[hs];B[is];W[gs];B[jr];W[jb];B[ia];W[sq];B[sr]C[White is jumping all over the place! I don't know what that means for a computer, but I take it as a good sign. :)

Ben: Since the number of possible outcomes decreases significantly towards the end of a game (and thus it easier for them to pare the variations) the computer can rely more heavily on what it is good at..brute force calculation.  I think you will find they play the end game quite strongly.]

;W[gq];B[hi];W[hp];B[ip];W[ho];B[io]C[This is where the end game is, huh. Whew! So much has happened! Basically, at this point, white has carved out a solid territory in the right, and upper right as well as the VERY TOP. Meanwhile, I have a  medium size area in the bottom right, which suits me just fine. But at this point, I'm worried about the encroaching white has done on my center area. She mutilated me, completely. (eesh) If it werent for the two large groups I captured, I would be in deep doodoo. Let's see how the remainder of the game played out, ok?]
;W[in];B[ik];W[lo];B[lp];W[no];B[mp];W[og];B[nf];W[ld];B[kd]
;W[jo];B[kp];W[oo];B[ja]C[Notice white has the initiative the whole time in the endgame. I honestly don't know how to take the initiative, and am under the impression that whoever has sente at the beginning of the endgame, keeps it all the way though. I know that's not right, though. So I could really use help with the endgame, please.

Ben: Like I said they play the ending strong.  I doubt a dan level player could do better.  Basically you have to beat them in the beginning and middle game.  Good luck on your future Go endeavors!]

Well, thank you, Mr. Reveiwer, for taking the time out of the day to help review this game with me. I hope I managed to keep you entertaineed, if even for a little bit, and am glad you took time out of your busy schedule to do this. Once again thank you.

And so...
When you coming up the shore,
and yourself wanting more,
theres nothing you can do
but ask her to whore!

Oh, yes that's what you do
in that little boat of yours.
Don't make me take it to
the HUTTS of the sta-ar wars!

And when you find you need a hand,
don't cry on your bed...
but slap one on and
wake
up
the dead...

Thank you, thank you, no really, you're too kind haha, thank you...]
