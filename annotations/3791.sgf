C[I have a few questions in here, but mostly I'd just like to hear what mistakes you see.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[qp]LB[cd:A]C[SGF:  While not wrong, a move at  'A' is probably better as it works with the top right and stops an approach from working with the lower left.]
;W[op];B[dd];W[cf]C[SGF:  It is usual to approach a 3-4 stone before a 4-4 stone.  At the moment it is hard to tell which is the best side to approach from.]

(;B[oq]C[SGF:  Not good.  Gives W a chance to make a perfect formation at the bottom....]
;W[nq];B[pq];W[np];B[qn];W[jp]C[SGF .... which he promptly does.]
;B[pe]C[I played this move because I thought it was more valuable. After white's move I was not as confident. Would it have been better to defend the upper left corner?

SGF:  It is the move I would have played.]
(;W[ef]C[SGF:  Good move!];B[fd];W[dj];B[cq]LB[jc:A]C[Normally I prefer thickness and moyos to this kind of territorial move, but I decided to try it since white has wide extensions on both sides of this stone... was that a good idea?

SGF:  It may be too early.  Whichever side W blocks on he will make a big moyo.  For W to take gote to finish this corner is big, but there are holes for B to reduce it with.
I would calmly at 'A' and wait to see what happens in the lower left.  After all, B's territory is more secure than W's and so he is not behind.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[hq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
;W[cn];B[fj]LB[jc:B][hj:A][jj:C]C[Would G14 have been better here? Is there another move?

SGF:  This is too deep.  It is just asking to be capped.  If W now plays 'A" the B stone will no die, but all of the thickness W gains by attacking will help him invade B at the top and right.  'B' is still the best move.  The best follow up W has for his moyo is 'C' and it is not obvious that this would give a clear lead.]
;W[gf];B[hd]LB[ij:A]C[SGF:  B has no time for this.  He must run with 'A']
;W[hj];B[hi];W[ii];B[fg];W[ff];B[ih]LB[hh:A]C[SGF: Bad shape.  Extend to 'A']
;W[gi];B[hh];W[gj];B[ji];W[if];B[gq]C[SGF:  What is this?  Just helps W get stronger with no obvious benefit.  B may be able to aim at the cut later (admittedly unlikely but do not close your options too early)]
;W[gp];B[gr];W[hr]LB[hp:A]C[SGF: Greedy - 'A' is better.];B[hg]
;W[hf];B[fh];W[jd];B[pj]C[SGF:  Better to defend to top.];W[gc]
;B[fc]C[SGF:  Too submission - must connect.];W[bd]
(;B[cc]C[SGF:  Look very submissive. 'A' seems better - at least it does not give way too easily]
;W[hc];B[ce];W[be];B[df];W[dg];B[de];W[cg];B[di];W[fi];B[ei]
;W[bc];B[gd];W[id];B[bb];W[ab];B[gb];W[hb];B[db]C[SGF: Strange sequence.  Felt like both players were saying "here, please ...".]
;W[mc];B[eg];W[ci]
(;B[jn]LB[ej:A]C[SGF:  Connecting at 'A' is much bigger.  It is also pretty much sente.  See variation.]
;W[ej];B[lp]LB[lr:A]C[SGF: Not very realistice.  If B is going to play in this area then 'A' is probably best, but pulling out the single stone in atari is essential.]
;W[lq];B[kp];W[kq]C[SGF:  What did this acheive for B? Just created 2 heavy stones.]
;B[me];W[md];B[go]LB[le:A]TR[me]C[Is this a bad forcing move? What if I play this and then play P6 or something instead of H6? is that better?

SGF: Need to follow up with 'A' first to make the marked stone work.  This move does not seem to do too much.]
;W[hp];B[hn];W[om];B[on];W[nn];B[oo];W[no];B[nm];W[pp];B[qo]
;W[nl];B[mm];W[ol];B[mj]C[SGF:  Nice.];W[ml];B[lm];W[ll];B[kl]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[lj];B[ij];W[km];B[ln]LB[jk:B][jm:A]C[SGF: 'A'  is better - it protects more against a W push at 'B']
;W[jk];B[ik];W[il];B[jm];W[hl]TR[ln]C[SGF:  B pays the penalty for the marked move. Either the group above or below is in trouble unless B now attacks the W stones above.]
;B[gl];W[gm]
(;B[fl];W[hk];B[hm];W[fk];B[fn];W[lh]C[I hadn't realized that this move more or less kills my central stones and ends the game.]
;B[qg]LB[cl:B][ep:A]C[SGF:  B can aim at 'A' so a splitting move at 'B' is called for.]
;W[ql];B[qk];W[rl];B[mr];W[nr];B[ir];W[jq]LB[le:B][cl:A]C[SGF:  B is just hitting random spots hoping to find something.  If the center group dies it is over, so B needs to look for something there.  These moves might be useful ko threats for later.  'A' and 'B' are the points to be looking at.]

;B[so]C[from here on my moves were rather rushed - in fact, the only reason I was still playing is that I had not paused to count]
