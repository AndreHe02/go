C[I'm black (9k IGS). My Opponent ist 7k. Please ignore the end game plunders of both players.
I'm mostly interested in general hints to improve my game.

(;W[jp]LB[oc:A][od:B]C[[jfc\]: The top side is biggest.  A white approach at A or B would be bettter than K4.]

(;B[jd]C[[jfc\]: I prefer K17 here.  If you are going to play on the 4th line, then L16 is better as 5 spaces is the ideal side extension.  See variation.]
;W[gc];B[oc]C[[jfc\]: securing the corner is big.];W[pj]LB[qm:B]
[qn:A]C[[jfc\]: white is invading.  White should play R10 so he can settle quickly with a two space extension along the side.  Q10 will take more moves for white to settle.  Moves like Q10 are not horrible but they lose a little ground.

OK, black to move.  Look at the whole board.  Where is black weakest?  Where is white weakest?

I wouldn't call Q4 weak but it is black's "least strong" group, especially when you consider that the nearest stones on each side are white.

Similarly, white Q10 is white's weakest group.  The best move for black is a move that strengthens Q4 and weakens Q10.  A and B are good moves.]

(;B[qg]C[[jfc\]: here we can see that if Q10 was at R10 then white could settle simply by extending to R7.  With Q10 on the 4th line white has fewer options.

regarding R13: the proverbs say "drive your opponent towards your strong stones" but black R13 is driving white towards black's weakest stone.]

(;B[nj]LB[ll:A][jj:B]C[[jfc\]: black has worked hard to build up a moyo in the upper right.  Don't let white in.  R11 instead of O10.

If the right side was already sealed off, then black O10 is way too slow.   A or B would be better. 

Also, notice that black Q4 is very weak.  white can gain a lot by attacking this stone.  Was it worth it playing Q8 instead of strengthening Q4?  How about black R7 instead of black R13?]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[ph];B[oi];W[qh]C[[jfc\]: after the blunder of N10, black is clearly behind.]
;B[of];W[pg];B[pf];W[rg];B[mq]C[[jfc\]: white S13 was a mistake.  If white attacks Q4 instead of playing S13 then white's hold on the lead is strengthened.

black is happy getting to play in this area first.]
(;W[gq]C[[jfc\]: this move illustrates why long side extensions (e.g. K4 from theD3 and D5) are generally more effective on the 3rd line (K3) than the 4th line (K4).  White would be much happier with K3 and G4 rather than the stones at G3 and K4 in the game.]

(;B[kq];W[po]C[[jfc\]: white Q5 is bad because it is small and helps black strengthen is Q4 stones.  White should be looking for a big move as there are no weak black groups to attack.]
;B[op];W[qp];B[qq];W[rp]C[[jfc\]: white S4 is small... white should be taking a big point.  Black has settled his weak Q4 stone with nice profit thanks to white's moves at S13 and Q5.

With white S4 black gets sente to boot.];B[jg];W[ib]

;B[gm];W[ho];B[gn];W[hq];B[ir];W[jl];B[jk]C[[jfc\]: at this point the game is close.  Sharp endgame play by either side can win the game.

recommendations: 

pay attention to which groups are weak and which are strong.  When there are no weak groups to defend or attack, look for the biggest move.  Experiment with playing more side extensions and splitting moves on the 3rd line.
