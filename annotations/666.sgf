C[arend (the reviewer): (to Chin=Black)
I think this was a close game until your final mistake. You made a big
and expensive mistake at move 53, which cost you the lead, but
apart from you played a steady consistent style.
I hope you can learn s.th. from the moves where I would have played
differently --- actually, there are only a few of them.];B[pd]

Locally, C (g3) looks better.];B[oq];W[qj];B[de]LB[ql:A][ce:B]
C[The result after B 21 is not very good, and here is the easiest moment to
choose a different route. A (r8) looks good; also, if Black plays B (low kakari),  it is not as easy for W to force him to spend many moves on the left side.]

(;W[ce]LB[ee:A]C[A (e15) is an alternative here.];B[cf]C[The ladder is good, the upper side more important than the left side -- B should
play d16 offering the small avalanche joseki. Whatever happens after B d16, Black
can take the right side.];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc];B[ck]C[This result looks not very attractive for Black. He has invested many stones into
the left side, but his position is still very low.
(Generally, any extension from a low and solid position as B has in lower left is not
very important.)];W[qf];B[mc];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[kq]C[Nice point for Black. But probably the upper side is more urgent.]
;W[ir]LB[kc:A]C[If w has to reply here, f2 must have been bad.
I would tenuki to play a (l17) here.];B[jc];W[qm]C[Last big point.]
;B[qh]LB[rb:A]C[The connection between Q 16 and n17 is very weak, so I don't think it is
reasonable for B to invade here.
So I think it is better to simply take the (very) big point of A (s18).]

the w stone at r7.];W[ok];B[rk];W[rj];B[pm]

expanding a possible left--side moyo?];W[lg]

Blacks upper group. I would either tenuki, or maybe offer W to
capture these stones as in the variation.];W[kg];B[hc];W[gb]
;B[jj];W[jf];B[je];W[ee];B[if];W[jg]C[Chih:
I have problem with this situation. I don't know which move I can make at this time. (My following moves here was e14, g13, h11 which was a kind of cheating moves because  white considered that my L17 group would die.)
The situation analysis:
1. All white groups are alive.
2. My N12 group is only a possible group could be attacked.
3. as the territory, I don't know how to calcuate.
   white: The upper right corner: 32 pts?
              The upper left corner:  13 pts?                The lower side: 8 pts?
              Total points:53 pts?
    Black:  The lower right corner: 30 pts?
                The left side: 18 pts?
 The upper side: probably only 2 pts
                Total points: 50 pts?

     So, I have 3+5.5=8.5 pts behind?
4. But I still have a chance in the center part, I consider that right now, my center part is much stronger than white.

So, under this situation, how to gain more points? E6 or other possible moves?

Arend:
To count territory, you should -- as you probably know -- always add the expected endgame sequence. If there is no unique sequence, take the expected average.
Doing this, I get only slightly different numbers than you -- I think you assumed
a fair share of points at most places (see Var.) I count a close game.

First of all, e14 is a nice move; it helps in the center, it is nearly sente, and a white move
there would be sente as well. After that, ...]
(;B[ef];W[fe]C[...a move like e7 looks best to get territory in the center.
The main alternative I see is the ordinary but large endgame move of A (k2).

(If you do not see an obvious place to make territory, very often
a big endgame move turns out to be the best play.)]
