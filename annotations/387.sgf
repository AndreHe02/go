;B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[od];B[ld]C[Olaf: good point. a pincer is the best way to utilise the strong position in the upper left corner.]
;W[qe]
(;B[pd]C[Olaf: not as good. There is a saying: play on the top of two stones! Now, if white playes at Q15 (as he did) its exacly that formation, known as good for white (he played at the top of your stones). For an alternative see the variation.]
;W[pe];B[oc];W[nd];B[nc];W[rd];B[rc];W[rf]C[Olaf: not necessary. In my eyes it would be better to play at Q10. The point is, that whenever black plays at S15, it would be gote for black, getting some points. But it is not necessary for the live of the white nor the black group, so black wouldn't play this early in the game.]

(;W[ij]C[Olaf: this move shows the reason of whites loss at best i think. White fears the loss of the group around M8. But actually what is the reason tho hang on this stones. Are they cutting stones, which enable an attack on some black stones? No, all black stones are secure. In this circumstances the best way is to abondon such stones and use it to destroy the black moyo.]
;B[gl];W[hl];B[hk];W[hm];B[ik]C[Olaf: Now that the escaping route is closed, white has a real problem.]

(;B[hg]C[Olaf: and here we see the reason, why black gets a lost game too. ;-) Black tries to kill all the whites. Truely, if black can do so, it would be very big. But if not? The best attack is only to treat a kill and make the points on other places. With H14 black would treat to cut and kill but actually protects the whole top. Whith your move you get only lots of cutting points that white can aim at.]

;W[jb];B[kb];W[kc];B[jd];W[lb];B[lc];W[ka];B[eb];W[ga]C[Olaf: white is alive uncondentially and black got a lost game. Try to count. Moreover, whites center group splits the former big black moyo in several small groups, which are weak for themselves.]
;B[qk]C[Olaf: blacks main weaknesses are in the center. Black can maintain this weakness by playing at N18, securing the connection between the center and the top right.]

Concluding remarks:

You played an interesting game. I don't know your ranking, but perhaps I
can give you some fundamental hints. The game was decided by the race
through the center of the board. Maybe there were some tactical mistakes
too, but the main reason was the try to kill white. Attack and defense
should have some more reasons as only to kill some stones. Attack can be
used to build strength facing other parts of the board while allowing
the other to live small. There are two deciding mistakes in the game.
The first was that white wanted to safe all the white stones and the
second was, that black wanted to kill them. Next time try to let the
opponent gain exactly what he wants (live for some stones = 2 points)
but take some more at the same time (> 20 points on the side).
I hope I could help you a little bit to get stronger at go, but please
don't belief in all I said in the commented game, because I am weak too. :-)

white has 56 points in the upper half of the board and another 20 points at the bottom.]
