C[Hello Raine,

thanks for sending your game to the Go Teaching Ladder (GTL). My name is Wenni, currently 9k on KGS and I am looking forward to review your game.

But please take anything I say with a grain of salt, a better player than myself might have completely different views.

That said, let's start the review.

Kind regards

Wenni

REQUEST FOR REVIEW
White: Samforte, 17k KGS provisional
Black: Raine, 18k KGS (Myself)

This was a close game.  It eventually came down to a fight in the center which I barely won, and with that, my opponent resigned.  I do think, however, that I gave my opponent too much influence in the center and too much territory around the side, and if I had not lucked into a capture, I would have lost the game.  I also had a tendency throughout this game to misread true eyes as false ones.  Additional comments on individual moves are inserted throughout.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[eq]C[Raine: Here I decided a close invasion was best, since Q3 would limit white's influence in case of a pincer.

Wenni: Well, hard to say this early in the game. Although it often makes sense to not allow the opponent a kakari (corner enclosure move), this might be seen as to be a bit agressive to start with.]
;W[dn];B[hq];W[nc];B[qf];W[kc];B[qo]C[Raine: I decided protecting my own territory here was more important that taking more.

Wenni: Well, as of yet there isn't lots of fixed territory, but the move itself can't be called bad, since it secures the lower right corner.]
;W[cf];B[cl]C[Raine: I don't like this invasion.  White's response at C10 completely boxes the stone in and it's already under pressure from D6.  I think playing myself at C10 and then jumping out to the center for influence would have been superior.

Wenni: I agree - the invasion (B c9) is asking for trouble, even playing C11 is close already, B R10 might be a bigger move.]
;W[cj];B[el];W[cn]
(;B[cr]C[Raine: Would C3 be better here for taking the corner?  I was afraid of (bC3 wD3 bD4 wE4 bD2) and with that I'd be quickly pressed against the side with F4.

Wenni: It is hard to say, since there are too many options to play. Nevertheless it can be argued, that there are bigger points on the board, i.e. R10, M 3 and even something like G17 or H17.]
;W[lq];B[nq];W[jq];B[fn]C[Raine: I decided White's invasion of the bottom was over and decided to cap the D6 area.]
;W[gq]C[Wenni: Tough approach by White, it is often better not to touch what you are attacking.]
;B[gp];W[fp];B[fq];W[go];B[hp];W[fo];B[eo]C[Raine: This move is better played at E6, I think.  After (wE6 bE4 wG6) white has almost all of the central influence.

Wenni: Altough it makes sense to try to understand the balance of power (territory vs. influence), you seem to be worried to much about center influence at this stage of the game. There still seem to be much bigger points on the board.]
;W[ep];B[en];W[dq]
(;B[er]C[Wenni: Try to avoid empty triangles wherever possible, it takes out liberties and is awfully inflexible (please see variation).]
;W[dr];B[ds];W[gr];B[cq];W[dp];B[hr];W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[ho]
C[Raine: This move was premature.  It should have been at A2 to protect my eye.  After (wA2), black has one eye.

Wenni: Technically I agree, but since B is out in the center and the fate of the W stones at K3 and M3 is yet undecided I wouldn't worry to much at that stage of the game.]
;W[ar];B[gs];W[bs];B[fr]C[Raine: This move was also terrible, as it doesn't create another eye without (bE1) and isn't strong in any other fashion.  E1 or tenuki would be much better.

Wenni: Agreed, there seem to be much bigger points on the board, like R10 for example.]
;W[gn]
(;B[em]C[Wenni: Bad thing, the horrible empty triangle (few liberties, inflexible). If you want to protect your E6 group, then playing F8 for a bamboo joint seems a much better choice.]
;W[gl];B[ej];W[ek];B[dk];W[fk];B[dj];W[dh];B[ci]C[Raine: I got lucky here.  I shouldn't have been able to get this stone.  Or perhaps my opponent decided that building himself influence towards the center was much more important.  In any case, my stone at C8 has suddenly become useful again.]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[bl];B[bk]C[Wenni: Well done!];W[ak];B[ck];W[ch]
;B[bh]C[Raine: This is a small reduction...  Is it necessary, or should I have played tenuki?

Wenni: Yes, tenuki seems definitely the better option, with the W C14 stone in place, the reduction is small and should be left till endgame.]
;W[bg];B[bm];W[cm]C[Wenni: Doubtful White move, doesn't do much and forms an empty triangle.]
;B[fi]C[Raine: Central influence stone

Wenni: Makes sense in a way, altough I tend to believe, that something like B R10 gives just as much central influence while greatly increasing potential territory on the right side.]
;W[fl]C[Wenni: A doubtful move by White, it doesn't acconplish much and forms an ampty triangle without any need.]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[kp]C[Raine: This was very risky.  I got away with it, but I can't help thinking there was a better way to kill these stones.

Wenni: Interesting, I like creative moves.];W[jp];B[lp];W[kq]
;B[mp];W[jn];B[io]C[Raine: I'm now safe, while wJ5 instead of wK6 would have caused me a lot of trouble.  Then again, white has gained a lot of central influence with those stones.

Wenni: Agreed, White helped you a bit here ;-)];W[kn]C[Wenni: Doubtful White move, it doesn't accomplish much.]
;B[mr]C[Raine: With this I was convinced that the K3 group is dead, though I think now that I misread and O2 would be much better.  It would allow me to defend against the cut at O4, and I could always play N2 or J2 after my opponent played the other.  I believe that those two points are miai for death of the white group.

Wenni: Hard to tell, but either way the White K3 group seems to be dead.]
;W[gi];B[gc]C[Raine: This is a much better invasion.  Though R10 is larger, this threatens (albeit vaguely) a connection to F11 while eating territory at the top.

Wenni: (Better compared to what?) It may be picky, but I like B H17 better than B G17, it seems to be giving a bit more flexibility towards the center.]
;W[fe];B[id]C[Here I threaten a jump to the center...];W[ke]
;B[jc]C[Raine: Here I decide to give my opponent the choice between forcing me into the center or life along the side.  I think I should have played J14 instead and made the decision myself.

Wenni: Agreed, never let your opponent force you to live small, if connecting is an option - even if you live small, your opponent will gain much useful influence, whilst you stones just surround a bit of territory.]

[rg][rh]C[Raine: Now that the top is taken care of, I solidified my territory along the side.

Wenni: Indeed a large move, the game seems to be over. Let's try to estimate territory:

White (triangles)
Upper left corner: 16 points
Lower left corner: 4
Captured: 3
Total= 23

Black (squares)
Upper right corner: 21
Lower right corner: 17
Lower side: 18
Captured: 2 + 8 = 10
Total: 66

Strategic summary:
Black seems to be ahead by 43 points in territory with significant influence radiating into the center, it would be a wonder if White could catch up that difference.]
;W[ql];B[oj]C[Raine: I decided that I had enough territory to win if I could nullify the center, so I decided to try to push my own influence into the center.

Wenni: I tend to agree, B P9 is a strong move, threatening the White R8 stone and creating valuable influence towards a) the center and b) the upper right side.]
;W[mj]
(;B[jj]C[Raine: After the capping play, I knew I had to act now.  I played Tengen in an attempt at a desperate invasion.

Wenni: You seem to be worried about the center too much, it is often very easy to reduce center territory effectively from the outside, therefore invading takes too much a risk, maybe something like B O10 might be an effective move, reducing the center as well as solidifying potential territory in the upper right.]
;W[in]C[Raine: This play completely baffles me.  It seems way too weak, when a play at L11 could have done much more and slaughtered any chance I had at life.

Wenni: Well, it seems strange indeed, but maybe your opponent was planning some sort of attack against your H3 group?]
;B[li]C[Raine: This is a feint to gain central territory...]
;W[mi];B[jg]C[Raine: As is this...

Wenni: no need to gain center territory, if one of your stones in the center lives by escaping to some living group the game is definitely over.]
;W[jf];B[hm]C[Raine: And this, though this is a bad one.  I decided by this point that my opponent was a very defensive player and would keep me from cutting instead of attacking my stone and forcing me out of the center.

Wenni: An awful Black move, it forces White to connect and does not do much for the scattered B center stones.

Tactially I agree - White has been playing a bit  too passive so far.]
;W[hn];B[hi]C[Raine: My last "force."];W[gh];B[hk]C[Raine: Trying to make a wall and eyeshape.

Wenni: Interesting, nevertheless: With an invasion like this getting out is much better than trying to live - just imagine how many stones  you need there to actually make a living group.]
;W[hl];B[il];W[hj];B[gj];W[ii];B[ij];W[hh]
(;B[ji]C[Raine: I feel like I would have lost the whole area had I filled here.  After wF10 I'm doomed, so I decided to attack and force the capture, after which I could make another attack and create shape.

Wenni: If W F10 scares you so much, why not just play it yourself, connecting your center stones to the living D10 group (please see the variation starting at move 116)?]
;W[hj];B[ih];W[hi];B[kk]C[However, I didn't think my position was strong enough to play J13 or L13 yet and solidify an eye.]
;W[lj];B[lh];W[kg]C[Raine: Now I'm in trouble...  I see at most one eye for my center group.  Time to try and escape or kill.  H11 is too well protected, connecting to the west requires too many moves, so I try to squeeze out through the lower right where I have some influence.]
;B[lk];W[mk];B[mh];W[nh];B[ni]C[Raine: With this crosscut, I'm am resolved to attack the N10 stones.]
;W[ng]
(;B[nk]C[Raine: Weak, I think.  This should have been at N8 to force my group southward instead of forcing white southward.

Wenni: Agreed, just jumping out with, maybe, M7 might have been enough (please see variation for some options).]
;W[ml];B[ll];W[lm];B[km]C[Raine: Eyeshape move, which is nullified by the next play.]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[ik]C[Raine: I realize now that white played into a false eye and I need another tactic.  After staring at the board for a while, I find a weak point at N7.]
;B[mm];W[ln];B[nm]C[Raine: I think O8 would have done just as well here.  Cutting wouldn't have served any purpose for white.

Wenni: Agreed, the game is finally over.];W[nj];B[oi];W[nl]
;B[ol];W[ok];B[pk]C[Wenni: Well, interesting game so far. To me it seems that your opponent let you off the hook a bit too often. It is very hard seeing lots of things to improve for Black in a game dominated so much by Black.

The only advice for Black I could read out of this game would be to a) avoid playing empty triangles, b) to be aware of effective reducing moves and c) not to worry about center territory too much.

I enjoyed reviewing your game and hope this helps a bit. Enjoy our great game.

Kind regards, wherever you are
