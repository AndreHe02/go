C[Hi, I'm Gigiduru (10k* IGS) and I played black in this game.
I have a few questions later in the game about some moves that didn't look right, and also could you please comment on my opening?
Thank you very much in advance.];B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[cf]
LB[ci:A][di:B][nc:C]C[I never saw such a move before. I would suggest 'A' or 'B', the chinese opening or maybe something like 'C'. On the other hand, I cannot say that your move is a not playable.]
;W[jc];B[nq];W[qn];B[kp]LB[kq:A][oq:B][jq:C][jp:D][iq:E]C[Is this too high? I got into trouble there later on.

No, that is ok. If you play 'A', white will directly play 'B' and you will get an overconcentrated position. Alternatively you can play 'C', 'D' or 'E'.]
;W[iq];B[gq]C[Good! White has no base now.

So far the opening is quite ok for b.];W[kq];B[lq];W[kr];B[ck]
LB[jp:A]C[Should I have pressed white on the bottom? C9 seemed bigger though.

Yes, you should press w. First, 'A' is a vital point for w's shape. As long as w's group is weak, it is a source of profit for you all over the board. But that works only as long as the b group is much stronger than the w group.

Golden rule: Play important points before big points.];W[jp]
C[Now w has great eye potential and b has a big shape-problem...]
;B[mo]TR[kp][lq]LB[lp:A][ko:B]C[If w captures one of the marked stones, he is (almost) alive. So you have to save them. E.g. by playing 'A' or, maybe better, by playing 'B'.]

;W[qe];B[pf];W[re];B[od];W[oc];B[pe]LB[nd:A]C['A' instead seems to be more natural. W can be happy with the exchange that follows now.]
;W[nd];B[qd];W[oe];B[rd];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[hc]C[Good, there is nothing very important to do and that is the last big point on the board.

All in all b is ahead in influence/territory and neither w nor b has a group to really worry about. So, b came with a lead out of the opening.]
;W[je];B[he];W[dj]C[How should I respond to this?

Look at the variation.]
(;B[cj];W[dh];B[di];W[ei];B[ci];W[gh];B[eh];W[fh];B[eg];W[fj]

(;B[dm]C[That is too small for a gote move. See var. of the last move.]
;W[cq];B[cp]C[Good!];W[dq];B[eq];W[bp];B[bo];W[er];B[fr];W[ep]
;B[fq];W[bq];B[cn];W[ds];B[gn];W[rg];B[rf];W[ri];B[qh]C[I thought about playing hane, but I figured that outside influence was more important. Perhaps I didn't know how to take advantage of it later...

Mh, there is not really much influence to expect. And you are deep into the middle game. The further you are into the game, the less important influence is.]
;W[rh];B[qj];W[rj];B[oj]LB[pk:A]TR[jp]C[Too small?

No, but gote. 'A' seems to be a must.

It is a similar situation like we had with the marked move. It is an important point for both of you and it is sente for both of you. You should not miss them.]
;W[pk];B[pj]LB[oi:A][ni:B]C[?? Why did you play that move?

'A' or 'B' are clearly better than an empty triangle like that. That should be obvious for you if you give it a try, I think.]

(;B[nr]C[See var. of last move];W[mq];B[op];W[pq];B[oo];W[nn]
;B[on];W[nl];B[ok]LB[om:A]C[That is the wrong side for attacking. 'A' is more severe. And it is again a point that is intersting for w, too. At least more interesting than your actual move.]
;W[om];B[ln];W[no];B[mn]C[Works, but it is more or less useless. You normally should ommit useless moves.]
;W[nm];B[np];W[jm];B[po];W[qo]LB[rp:A]C[Big mistake, w should play 'A'.]
;B[rq];W[qp];B[rp]C[Don't comment on this one, please :)

No comment :)];W[sr];B[ro];W[rn];B[ll];W[mk];B[kk];W[mi];B[ik]
;W[jj];B[jk];W[ng];B[ig]C[Ok, at least if you had read out properly that your right side group is alive.]
;W[jg];B[ij]TR[ig]C[The marked stone is the weak one, you should strengthen it by extending]
;W[ih]C[Again w gets the point.];B[ji];W[hg];B[if];W[jh];B[ki]

;W[sb];B[sd];W[ie];B[hf];C[I felt I was behind in this game most of the time. Was it because of a poor opening?

I don't think that your opening is that poor and indeed you had quite a lead at the end of the opening. It seems to me that your biggest problem is that you miss the double-sente moves in the middle game, like K4 or Q9.

In this very game you lost many points by dealing wrong with the shoulder hit at D10. Look at the variations I showed you instead. Isn't there a big lower left corner for you? And look at the lower left corner in the game-end position.

Ok, probably you got some more points on the left side. But really many points aren't there, right? Even regarding the ignored ko-threat.]

(;B[cp]C[Alternatively you can take the corner directly.])))
(;B[dk]C[This is the normal response to w's shoulder hit and I think it's quite ok in this situation]
;W[ej];B[fl];W[gj];B[cp]C[Maybe you can expect something like that. Let's have a look at the position:

W's lower and the lower right groups are togeher maybe a little bit bigger than b's lower right and right groups together. Therefor b has komi and two prisoners. W's upper right group is maybe as big as b's upper left group. That means, b leads more or less by the lower left group. That should be enough to win the game!]
