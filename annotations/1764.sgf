AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi, this is a game between me (black 15k) and White (10K) with 5 hcp.

I lost by 13 points, I think it is because of that I lost the lefttop corner, can you comment om my game, and tell me where I played wrong and how to think about a stone before placing it on the board ?
And I have some question you will see them in the game.

THNX

I don't know how often you play handicap against stronger players, but it calls for a greater emphasis on outward influence. Black wants to attack w's position in such a way as to build a strong wall or position facing away from w's position. This will work with the handicap stones on the opposite side of the board to build a large territorial framework. If white ends up with scattered small live groups in a handicap game he will probably lose. He wants to create complexity so that his stronger fighting ability will shine. In this game, you often help white create this complexity. You largely ignore the effect of the fighting on distant handicap stones until white attacks them. Further explanation can be found in books such as The Second Book of Go and Handicap Go as well as discussions of 4-4 point joseki and openings.

I think playing with handicap is very good for black's game. You gain experience by interacting with a stronger player and you learn about thickness and influence. It is often difficult to get stronger players to accept a fair handicap. When I play white against handicap, I am alarmed at the appearance of the board at the beginning of the game and am quite surprised when I manage to win.

I hope the comments on this game are helpful. Good luck in your future play.]

(;B[ql]C[R8 or Q10 better ?

I don't think this is  a bad move but it is not classic play with handicap stones. b's handicap gives him a very large, but loose framework over the entire board. The usual strategy is to exploit this by harassing w's stones while solidifying big pieces of that framework. The alternate line shows a typical way to do this. It might have been better to start this way in the upper right, but b's play there is not bad either.

The game move pincers w's stone as an attack, but the attacking stone may come under attack itself if w can play R10 or R11. It is not obvious how b is going to use this move to solidify territory. It has more of a theme of complicated attack and counterattack which w will probably be better at.]
;W[oo];B[po]LB[op:A][nq:B]TR[ql]C[Was this right to try and cut or atleast make some trouble for white.

It is hard to say. It continues a theme of complex fighting that w will probably be better at. Moves like A or B may be simpler and aim for territory, but are also passive and may allow w the chance for an attack against the triangle stone.]

[mp:B][lp:C][jd:D][dj:E]C[
I don't like this move. It more or less secures the corner for b, but it creates the so-called empty triangle (the triangle stones) which is considered bad shape. More important the move is in the wrong direction. w is strong on the right side now, but b has the advantage over the rest of the board. b should aim toward his other stones by playing something like A,B, or C or just play elsewhere (tenuki) with D or E.]
;W[pl];B[rn]C[
This move is too small to play this early in the game. At least the exchange turns out sente for b.]
;W[rm];B[ro];W[rl];B[no]LB[mp:A][lp:B]C[too small ??

The atari threat is, but the influence across the bottom is good. Since the atari is not the point, moves like A or B may be even better.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[qg];B[oc];W[nd];B[od]LB[jc:A][jd:B]C[Did I protect the corner right ?

OK until this move. This move doesn't add much to the corner and you really want to use it to play A or B to prevent w from making an ideal extension from his 2 stone wall and to work with your handicap stones.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[hd];B[hc]LB[fd:A][ge:B][fc:C]C[
This move is a mistake as is the whole line of the next few moves for b. Better would be A-C. I like B best.]

C[
Ignoring the handicap stones this would be an ok result. However, the remaining handicap stones are weakened by this exchange and w's 2 stones still have some potential (aji) to cause trouble.]
;W[df]TR[dd]C[Is the corner dead now ??

No, but while b is trying to escape or make life w will be able build outside influence.]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[cc]TR[dd][ee]C[I thought I heard from someone that a shape like this is alive...is it true (C17,D16,E15) Becasue I lost it...how should I have played ??

It all depends on the surrounding attacking stones, but seems like you should be able to get life. Lets see...]

This move removes the potential (aji) of w's stones but you have 1 last handicap stone to exploit.]

C[is this group alive now ?? (E11)

Yes, I think so. You have 1 eye around A and should be able to get another near the edge of the board or around B. Be careful! w can steal either of these last and you will need to get the other.]

A(J2) or B(H3), I played A

A is better. The 2 stones have more liberties and are therefor more effective as a cutting group.]

I think you could have played A15 to win. I think A and the game move are miai for life in the lower left at this point. Also if you need both corners to win, you should take the obvious one and let your opponent worry about the first move in a  life and death problem.]

b gets a stronger hold on 2 corners. w gets an ideal extension from his 2 stone wall and good overall strength on the right. This is more or less an even exchange, but it means that b has retained the advantage of his handicap over the whole board.]
