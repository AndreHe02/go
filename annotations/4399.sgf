First, no two places on the board are too far to think about their relation.

The mistaked happened earlier, now white needs to play safely and attach the l17 stone. Otherwise, white has problems with either d10 group or h17 group.]

It doesn't seem that I should have won this game, as the invasion at top right never should have lived.  Any advice you offer will be appreciatively received.  Thank you.

Many mistakes, a lot in the endgame - try to determine which are sente and which gote. Play sente first, gote later.

Good luck!])
