C[Comments for fuseki and early middlegame would be most appreciated. Where and why did black lose the game?

[gromit\] I'll try to answer these.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[jp];W[qn];B[cj]C[[gromit\] ok, B move at C10 is not *bad*, however one might wonder why he does not answer W approach move (at O4 for instance).]
;W[fq]C[Should white make double approach instead?

[gromit\] yes, it is more coherent. F3 is an important move but there is no hurry.]
;B[dq];W[fo];B[dn];W[np]C[[gromit\] The problem with W timing is that now, W is building 2 weak groups (F3 and O4)
Better get F3-F5 out of trouble before trying to do anything in the bottom right corner.]
;B[oo];W[mo];B[om]C[[gromit\] W has even 3 weak groups now!!!]
;W[rp]
(;B[nq]C[[gromit\] What is the meaning of B's move???
B should separate as he did and not let W get a life base, see variation.]
;W[mq];B[oq]
(;W[mr]C[[gromit\] W should get out around N7; B is not weak enough to be attacked on the right, but the center stone is a better target.]
;B[kq]TR[jn]C[[gromit\] W cannot connect underneath, so B should split and get out at the marked spot]
;W[iq]
(;B[hq]C[[gromit\] W J3 threatens to link up, but B should simply block that connection... see variations.
Instead he is now strengthening W left group :( and thus weakening his own center group!!]
;W[hp];B[gr];W[ip];B[fr]C[White to cap perhaps?
[gromit\] Descending is good enough: it cuts B and threatens to link
Anyway, even capping would probably link W and thus B has lost his attack because of the H3 G2 F2 sequence... The game is already getting good for W]
;W[ir];B[kn]
(;W[ln]C[[gromit\] "Don't play contact moves when attacking!"
W will reinforce B, instead simply separating with a one point jump also puts pressure on B's right hand group]
;B[lp];W[mp];B[lo]C[[gromit\] Bad: get out first!!!];W[km];B[mn]
;W[lm];B[nn]C[[gromit\] B center group is now very bad, as W can link underneath]
;W[ko];B[jn];W[lq];B[kp];W[kr]
(;B[hn];W[fm];B[jl]C[[gromit\] Not very good shape, see previous variation... (there is a weakness at J5)]

(;W[lk];B[ql];W[qq];B[pj]
(;W[jd]C[Where should black go now, white lives small in black side.
[gromit\] W K16 is big, but the center situation is not completed yet: W M9 group is floating and B K6 group too. W should use B weakness to reinforce his group before playing K16 (see var).]

(;B[qf];W[nc];B[qe]C[[gromit\]??? Very slow!!! This is a *bad* *endgame* move.
If B doesn't play here, the corner is still open. C14 for instance would be much bigger.]

(;W[ph]LB[fd:D][qd:E][ch:B][ph:A][cl:C]C[[gromit\] Why not, B has just lost one move, so any of the marked points seems fine...
It will be diffgicult to go very deep with A though (especially because of the weakness of W M9 group, otherwise one line deeper would have been possible, see var), so maybe B is the biggest.]
;B[qh];W[pg]C[[gromit\] Q11 first]
(;B[pi]C[[gromit\] no, R11, see var.];W[qg];B[rg];W[rh]
(;B[pf]C[[gromit\] no, B should aim at living in the corner, see var.]
;W[ng]C[[gromit\] capturing is a good way to separate B];B[qc]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[re];B[rf]C[[gromit\] now W HAS to capture];W[rc]
;B[sd];W[qb];B[qi];W[of]C[[gromit\] W has just lost his attack and lost initiative :(]
;B[nk]C[[gromit\] This B move doesn't split W groups, nor reinforce B... better play at C13 for instance.]
;W[mj];B[jj];W[mh];B[cf]C[Where this stone should be, in F17?
[gromit\] W answer at F16 is fine, it aims at C12...];W[fd]
;B[cd]C[[gromit\] B slow: this is a small move, and it loses the corner...]
;W[cc];B[de];W[ed]TR[ch][cl]SQ[jh]C[Has white given too much at left side. Theres some potential left. Can black still win? How?

[gromit\] W has not given so much, as he has taken the top as an exchange.
There are still weaknesses on the left at the marked triangles (C8, C12). Moreover, B center group is still not safe and W can use that to attack (see above) or build center territory (K12).

To win, B needs to reinforce his weaknesses and erode W territory. May be just getting his head out around K12 could allow to threaten to play the cricled spots... but it will be very difficult.]
;B[gl]C[How should black protect the weak group?
[gromit\] as said before, protecting will not be good enough, so jump toward W territory.
G8 doesn't link up, and doesn't attack W (connected underneath, so... not very good.]
;W[gn]
(;B[ho]C[[gromit\] dangerous...];W[jm]
(;B[im];W[io];B[in];W[jo];B[go]C[[gromit\] Damezumari (B is shortening his liberties), B should play G7 directly]
;W[gp];B[gm];W[fn];B[fl];W[el];B[il]
(;W[cl]C[[gromit\] Good idea, but dangerous (see var for a safer alternative).]

(;B[ek]C[[gromit\] As B is behind he has no choice but to cut and fight!]
;W[dm];B[cn];W[dk];B[ej];W[dj];B[di]
(;W[ei]C[[gromit\] too greedy? W is creating himself a new weak group in the center cutting the other side is enough.]

(;B[if]TR[hd][hf]C[[gromit\] B should live first!
Locally speaking, jumping here is too weak, if B plays here then simply H14, aiming at H17!!]

TR[rm]C[Can
white live, or should he quietly has made the jump. What is the worst thing
white can do here?

[gromit\] A Monkey jump is about the best W can get here, but there are other moves even bigger (S7 for instance is very big and sente for both players!!)]

(;B[an]C[[gromit\] quite unusual (play on 1st line!) B6 or even B5 are better]
;W[cr];B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[cp];W[ar];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds];W[bq];B[bo]C[[gromit\] Well, W started the game by spreading stones in the lower part of the board, getting up to 3 weak groups, but B allowed all these to get safe (especially the two center ones, which connected to each other). From that point B is the only one to have a weak group and that will be a big problem all along the game.
W managed (thanks to B mistakes) to ruin the left side territory (not speaking of the corner) and to secure the upper side, the game was thus over.

B and W should be more careful about not creating floating groups that will become under attack, that's their main weakness. Otherwise, the building and attacking were done quite seriously. (B might also study Life and death a bit...).]
