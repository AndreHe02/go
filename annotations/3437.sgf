C[I was asked to just make some general comments on your direction of play, but I couldn't resist going into detail at some points.  Hopefully, the detail will just make the general points a little clearer.

Check the comments that I left at the last move for a summary.

(;W[co]LB[cm:C][co:A][fp:B]C[is c5 correct move here? what is the alternative?

C5 is certainly a possibility here.  In fact, it's a pretty common move.  If black plays C6, it will work out nicely for both sides.  If black opts for D4, things can get messy.

Personally, I prefer something along the lines of B here for white.  It's a peaceful response that ensures that white will get something along the bottom and leaves black with something along the side.

Another choice would be something along the lines of C (a pincer).  A move like C will always lead to some fighting.]

(;B[eq]LB[cn:C][dp:B][eq:A]C[If black's goal is to keep white shut in the corner, he should consider B instead of A here.  It could lead to a situation very similar to what happened, but it keeps a little more pressure on white and turns out better for black.  (See variation for details.)

C is another possible response for black.  It would settle things quickly and avoid complication.]
;W[dp];B[ep]
(;W[eo]C[hmm cutting here?

When considering a cut like this, it's a good idea to think about what will result from your cut.  In this case, I think you can be pretty certain that black will extend to keep his stone alive.  So, you should ask yourself what you'll be able to do if that happens.  Will you have any chance of hurting him or will you put yourself into a dangerous situation?

I don't think you'll be able to weaken either of his groups enough to kill one of them.  You shouldn't be in danger of losing your cutting stone either though, although keeping it alive may end up being a lot of work.

So, ask yourself what you'll get out of the cut.  I can't see a whole lot to be gained from cutting, so I don't recommend it.

Instead, I suggest extending to C6 to help settle your corner.  (See variation)]
;B[dn]
(;W[cn]LB[cn:A][fo:B]C[Consider extending with the cutting stone instead of trying to keep pressure on black from the outside.  (See variation)

It seems like you're fighting with the goal of simply reducing black's liberties as much as possible.  This is a good strategy when your opponent is already confined and you just need to be aggressive to kill.  But, in a situation where your opponent can force his was through your contact moves, attacking by placing your stones next to his can get you into trouble because you're reducing your liberties too.  In these situations, it is often best to make wide moves that limit his overall range of motion.

Black has a lot of room to move with the D5 group, so keeping pressure on it, only gives it an excuse to get bigger and even harder to kill.]
;B[fo];W[en];B[dm];W[em];B[dl];W[ek]C[It's a bit to soon to try to jump this far.  (See variation for what black could do.)

This is a good time to stop and look at how you did in the corner.  I left some comments at the end of the variation where both sides settle things properly.]

(;B[dj]
(;W[qn]C[is the tenuki to early?

Yes, if nothing else, there's still E8 to worry about.  Notice that white playing there would be a threat to black.  (See variation)]

(;B[ql]
(;W[op]LB[pl:2][ql:4][qn:1][op:5][qp:3]C[my plan was to get influence on the button. dangerous move or? but it worked...

This is certainly a very interesting idea.  But, black could have opted to make things tough by going with Q3.  (See variation)

But, let's take a moment to look at your overall plan here...

You seem to change your mind about what you want very frequently in this game.  While constantly reevaluating the board is a good idea, it's also good to know what you want each stone to do when you play it.  If you find that your opponent always does exactly what you don't want him to do, find moves where you have a good second option if your opponent stops your first plan.

You started out by approaching the corner with 1.  This could be like saying "I'm coming in for your corner.  If you defend it, I'll make some territory on the side.  If you try to stop me from growing on the outside, I think your corner looks weak enough that I could do some damage."  If you consider two options like this, no matter what your opponent does you can be happy.

With 2, black decides that he won't make it easy to keep 1 alive and certainly doesn't want you to make any progress up the board.  But, he still leaves you with a couple of options.

So, 3 is when you get to decide what you really want to do.  Extending up the board isn't an options right now, but you have to decide what you want to do instead.  The place you played suggests that keeping 1 alive is a top priority.  With 1 and 3 as you played them, you shouldn't have any trouble making life on the side.

You could also have played 3 at R4.  Again this would give your opponent two options.  (Go back a couple of moves to see the variation.)

Alternately you could make your opponent decide between his two groups by play P6.  (Again, go back to see variation.)

4 is an odd choice for black.  He seems to have decided that no matter what happens, white will not move any farther along the side.  (See variation for another option for black)

R4 would have worked better to keep the pressure on white.  (Go back for variation.)

So, we finally make it to the interesting choice of 5.  White has suddenly decided that the most important part of the board is the bottom.  While this may be the case, the moves that white made before, don't help much with this goal.  Yes, the idea of 5 connecting to 1 and/or 3 is something black has to worry about now, so those moves do serve some purpose.  But, black has already used them as an excuse to strengthen the upper right side.  White might have played differently if his plan had been to work on the bottom of the board all along.

At this point, I think it would be better for white to take the territory which he is set up to take thanks to his other stones.  So, I'd suggest 5 at Q3.  (See variation.)

When deciding where to make your moves, try to make you decision based on what can get you the most territory in the easiest possible way.  Don't just look for the spots on the board that you think it would be nice to have.  Instead, look for the spots where your opponent can't help but let you have something.]

(;B[po];W[oo];B[pn];W[pq];B[qo];W[rp]C[better trying to fight for r6 here?

No, sacrificing R6 is a good idea at this point.  There is no chance of saving it now.  Playing more for the outside at P4 sealed its fate.]
;B[ro];W[qq]LB[oq:B][qq:A]C[Either A or B works to keep white's stones connected here, but B leaves less weakness later on.

In this game, it doesn't seem like the choice makes much difference, but consider what might have happened a few moves down the line if white had wanted to ignore black K4 and black had decided to come and threaten to cut with O3.  So, when you think you need a move to stay connected, look at a couple options that might work then pick the one that leaves your opponent with the fewest number of way to threaten you.]
;B[on];W[nn];B[jp]TR[fo][ep][eq]C[to small? where to play? contact move looks dangerous

I'm not sure if you're talking about black's move here, white's previous move, or white's next move, so I'll give my thoughts on all three.

Black's move here is great.  This point is huge for both sides because the both have some influence facing it.  It is especially important for black because his three triangled stones have no hope of life without a little help at some point.

That being said, it would have been a great spot for white to play the move before.  Always remember "Your opponent's good move is your good move." 

But, now the question becomes "What can white do to make up for it?"  (See white's next move and variation for more on white's options.)]

(;W[lp]LB[jn:B][lp:A]C[This is certainly one option, but I think there are better ones.  With this, white claims a bigger chunk of territory, which is nice.  But, this does look rather small.  Consider something around B instead.  (See variation)]

;B[qh]
(;W[qd]C[better p 14, perhaps?

What was the original intent of R14?  If white had hoped to expand downwards, it would have been good to go for that while black was going after things on other parts of the board.

But, now white needs to decide what else he can do with that stone.

Using P14 in order to try to split black seems like it would work well.  If white splits black first, black will have to respond, giving white time to make sometime good out of the stones. (See variation)]
;B[pf];W[pc];B[oc];W[pb];B[qe];W[od]C[i wanted to change the side. ok?

Well, it looks like you're being fickle again, and you end up losing a lot on the side for your effort.  But, at this point, switching to the top seems like a good idea.]

[hp:1]C[whis this moves i made the black mojo right side very big. i saw no alternative...

At this point, what you're giving black on the right is not just moyo, but solid territory.  Moyo is a lose framework that is still open to invasion.  Once it appears to be settled, it is territory.  The terms are not too important, but I wanted to be clear about the difference.

These moves aren't as bad as you think, and you actually still have some good possibilities.

First of all, you're working on a nice wall here.  Black was almost sure to get at least this much territory on that side.  He's solid there and not open to much more that some pushing and small reductions.

So, while black fights over the boundaries of what he gets, white gets strength where he previously had none.  Now it looks like white can get something out of the middle.

But, once white is satisfied that black has given him a nice enough wall, there's still a lot he can do on the rest of the board.

Black has quite a few weak looking targets right now.  The group on the bottom, the one on the left, and the one on the top are all far from being entirely safe.  You can often profit by attacking weak groups.

Deciding where to start can be difficult, but, it makes much more sense to attack a group that looks weak than a strong one.  I would consider starting by taking care of the weakness at E8 to solidify that wall and then going after group 1 as an excuse to connect your wall and your group to the right.]
;B[ie];W[li];B[mi];W[lg]C[better cut here?

While this move is threatening, attacking one of black's weak groups would be better.

But, if you want to attack the right group and reduce it, this is a good place to start.

This is another good place to start thinking about planning.

This move says "Give me L12 or I'm coming in."];B[mg]C[Black decides not to let you in.]
;W[mh]C[So, you carry through on the threat.];B[nh]C[And, black does his best to hold you back.]

(;W[mf]C[But, now you're getting greedy.  It seems like you're decided that because you have a ko, so you will be able to take what you want at any time, so you decide to make another threat.

It's not a good idea to push too much with kos because they can come back at you at anytime.  Instead take what you can get.  Don't expect your opponent to back off the ko and let you get away with a lot.

(See variation for a simple way to settle things.)];B[lh]TR[lf]
C[At this point, capturing M15 makes the most sense.  Capturing it both saves M13 and keeps N14 out of trouble.]

(;W[kg];B[nf]C[Now, it becomes more important to capture M15 because white will not be able to get N14 back if black takes it.]
;W[mh];B[me]C[With M14 gone, there's nothing to get out of the ko, so it's time to move on.]
;W[ni];B[mj]C[to much kos  for me :(

(;W[ik]C[this i do all he time, better j8 here?

A solid move like J8 is better when you can afford to make it.

J9 is a very nice move.  It prevents a cut while making a shape with at could easily get some eyes.

But, the problem with J9 is that it's not entirely secure.  If black can get stones at H8 and J8 or K9 and K10, white will be in trouble.  White should be able to stop black from doing this easily, but that doesn't mean black can't profit by trying. (See the variation on the next move to see what white might try.)

Go back a move and look at the variation to see the difference J8 would make.]

No, keeping those three stones alive is pretty important.  After working so hard to keep C5 and E4 cut in the beginning, you don't want to let them connect now.  It's good to keep the option of threatening the E4 group open, even though it can't help but connect to the right now.]

(;W[fb]C[is here a bigger move posssible? what means big monkey jump?

This is not a situation where you can make a monkey jump.  In order to make a monkey jump, you must have a stone on the second line while your opponent only has stones on the third line.  (See variation)

Note that this move isn't entirely safe.  Black would lose out overall, but if he really wanted F18, he could have it.  (Check the variation to see what I mean.)]

(;B[gb];W[eb];B[ec]C[This move by black isn't very good.  It looks like his stones might be a little easier to surround now because they're touching white more, and it doesn't even force white to respond.]

It's a little more difficult to see that there is no way to stop something in the squared area from becoming an eye.  The best way to tell is to try reading things out.

The main thing to work on is planning.  Think about what you want to do with your moves and what might happen after your opponent moves.

It seems like you are already pretty good at considering the board as a whole and looking at where the game is going.  That's an important part of strategy that many people around your level that many people don't seem to understand.

Now you just have to work on developing the analytical skills to match.  Work on reading out what your moves will happen if you move in a certain place, and don't forget to work on reading out what might happen if your opponent moves somewhere you don't want him to move.

Keep playing and keep reviewing your games to see where your choices throughout the game lead, and you should improve.

The other nice thing about extending is that it makes your stones stronger and more solid.  In this case, it would also help you threaten to break out.

The only thing to watch out for when trying to decide if you should capture or extend is the fact that as long as your opponent's stone is still on the board, it can still turn into a threat.  For example, if you catch some stones in a ladder and your opponent puts one of your stones that make up the ladder in atari, it might be best to capture so that a ladder breaker can't threaten to save the stones later.]

This is a good to look at what each side has following the cut.

Both sides have pretty big walls.  But neither wall is very good.  Black's wall seems to work on side territory with an escape route to the center.  But, white can sneak underneath with something around B8 at anytime.  White's wall faces out which could be good for center influence.  But black already surrounds a good bit of it, so it could end up spending more time fighting to stay alive than being useful.

White also has some corner territory. It's not huge, but it is pretty solid.  Meanwhile, black has what could become large territory on the side.  But, since it doesn't have the support from the corner that white has, wit is weak.  White could threaten it and end up making some territory of his own.]

(;W[cn]C[This is the sort of result white should expect from playing C5.  He keeps the whole corner and works towards one of the sides too.

Now black is in an awkward position.  With C6 in place, white can actually expect to do some damage by cutting now.  If white plays here next, he force black to chose between D5 and E3-4.]

;W[cp];B[eq]C[Compare this situation to the original position.  Black gets slightly more this way, and still has the advantage of some nice influence facing his stone on the right.

From here, white may decide to start some complex fighting much like he did in the original when he decided to cut.  I encourage you to play around with variations to see where things might go.  Just remember that situations like this could lead to ladders, and black has a ladder breaker at Q16.]
