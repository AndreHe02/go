C[[M\] Thank you for reviewing this game. I am a somewhat new player, though I learned the game in High School (Grad 1996). I didn't play long because I quickly learned to beat the computer program we had at school. Recently I discovered Internet go (and Hikaru no go after someone asked me if that's why I started playing ;)

Thank you for helping us become stronger players!

D:  Hello, I'm Darrell.  I'll look it over and give you my thoughts.  Feel free to ask any followup questions.  I'm about 6k AGA ratings.]

LB[pj:a][jp:b]TR[oc][qd][co][dq]C[D:  Black should have moved around 'a' because of the way black's marked enclosure faces, or possibly at 'b' to reduce the effectiveness of white's enclosure slightly.]
;W[pn]LB[cg:a][jp:b][pj:c][pk:d]C[D:  This strikes me as a very poor move.  It invites black to pincer around 'd' which is both an attack and an ideal extension from the wall in the top left corner.  Giving black such a good move must mean the white move is bad. 

A move at 'a' would threaten black and make an extension from the corner.

'b' or 'c' as a followup is big.];B[mq]C[Black misses the opportunity.]
;W[pk];B[pi];W[jd];B[ld];W[jq]C[Good move.];B[df];W[cl]LB[fd:a]
[dh:b]C[This looks big, but the top left is being left a bit weak.  If white answers this move at 'a' instead, it protects the corner and also threatens an invasion at 'b'.  It pretty much forces black to make a defensive move in the area and white can still get c8 afterward.]
;B[fd]C[complex.  But white is outnumbered in the area, so the fight favors black.  This should not have happened since white got here first.]
;W[ee];B[de];W[ed];B[ff];W[fc];B[gc];W[gd];B[fe];W[hc];B[ef]
;W[hf]TR[gb][dd][ed][ee]C[[M\] solidifying this connection might have been better?

D:  Yes, this was necessary.  The clue is that you have only 3 liberties on the marked group.   Less than 5 liberties is a danger sign.]

;B[kb];W[lc];B[ec]LB[dc:A]C[[M\] Driving to the wall with A wouldn't have worked, so I decided to cut my losses.  I needed to protect this group.

D:  Nice move by black.  It will be difficult to recover.];W[eb]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[db];W[cc];B[ea];W[cb]C[D:  Good move.];B[fa]
;W[cf]LB[bf:a]C[D: 'a' works out better.  Can't be cut.];B[ce]

;W[bj]C[D:  Way too small.]

;B[rj];W[qm];B[rl]C[???];W[rm]LB[ih:a][el:b][qq:c]C[Does nothing.  Either 'a' or 'b' or even 'c' would be more interesting.]
;B[nn];W[gq];B[jh]C[Very big.  Now white has no territory in the middle.]
;W[lj]LB[el:a]C[No purpose that I can see.  

Nothing to defend.  Nothing to attack really.  So take some territory.]
