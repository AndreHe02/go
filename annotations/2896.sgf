C[Hi there!
please report ANY BIG failure.

EVS: Hello.  A remarkably close game, it must have been exciting for each of you.  I will mostly review for the white side, though I will comment on some black moves as well.  The time settings do not seem to have saved into the SGF, if there were any.

Please remember that I'm only 13-14kyu.  Stronger players will disagree with my of my comments.]

;B[se];W[re];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[ra]SQ[re][qf]C[At this point i was quite confident about the opening and the early middle game :)

EVS:  I like black in the upper right, huge, strong solid wall in exchange for 6-8 points.  Also, I would have considered the marked stones dead, you did an amazing job saving them and taking a ton of points from black.  I would not count on saving them always.]

[sd][se][nf][pj][pn][pp]C[should i have sacrificed my two stones after turning my corner to life i dont get that much there later while black gets strong influence towards the center.For W32 i was considering the following options:
-attachment at O13 to live or to establish a center group
-O12 keshi
-F15 as in W82
-C10 or D10
-R3 or Q2
which of these mentioned moves would be best?
what is best the strongest move on the board?

EVS: D10 looks like the biggest move left, though I'd play D8 or D9.  Also consider K16.  See variations.  Note that you did a great job in this area, saving those stones at huge cost to black.  With that wall and supporting stones in place, I would have extected the entire marked area.]

[dr]C[How should i have responded to B111?
i was a bit unsure how to handle it properly.
i considered K5 aiming to play around B105 or B107. does that make any sense?

EVS: Your response is very strong if the triangle marked stones are alive.  Are they?  Maybe. F5 was a good dual-purpose move, it cuts F3 from F6 and forms moyo with square-marked.]
;B[iq]
(;W[jr]LB[ip:A][jp:B]C[wrong answer here?

EVS: Very good play, works at making asolid base with N3 and pushes on J3.  Lots of choices though.  I think B might be the best.]

EVS: I would cap J2 group.  Black will have a hard time making a base or escaping.]

;B[lm];W[es];B[gs];W[fd];B[sg];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[OK, THANKS FOR THE REVIEW!

EVS:  Very good game.  One thing to think about that I got from a dan instructor recently.  White has 4 groups, black has two groups.  Generally fewer groups wins.  Try to think of cutting your opponents groups off from each other so that each has to go through the trouble of making life.  You can push on a group and make it small while it is doing this.

You did a great job making two small live groups under difficult conditions.  I hope my comments have been helpful and positive.]
