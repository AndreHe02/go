C[I never have my game reviewed before, could you point me my weaknessess and if any, my strong points?
Also from this game, what aspects should I improve to be a better player?

--

S: Hi, this is Eric Piotrowski, aka Scartol on the GTL. I'll begin my comments with the S: symbol.

Your main problem (it looks like your opponent has it too) is a lack of focus. Each move you play should have a definite purpose, and the best moves have more than one. Hopefully I can show you what i mean.]
;B[qd]C[This is one of my worst games. I lost
with a huge gap at the end. I never had my game reviewed before, so
could you please point me my main weaknesses, and, if any, my strong
points?];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[ep]LB[dn:A][dq:B]C[S: There's nothing wrong with attacking white's komoku. White should have played at A or B, but she gets around to B eventually. In the meantime, black should keep in mind that black has the advantage in the corner, since white didn't respond. Black is now in a position to inflict some damage by putting pressure on that corner.]
;W[oc];B[oe]LB[pe:A][pf:B]C[S: This is greedy. It seems to say to white: "I plan to take all of the right side."   A and B are joseki.]
;W[qo]
(;B[qp]C[S: This is pretty small. See the variations for a more solid approach.]
;W[ce]C[S: This is big for white. Now she has the corner more or less in the bag.]
;B[kc]C[S: This is a good response.];W[qk]LB[qm:A]C[S: A good move for white, but notice that she's jumped three stones up. That means black can invade at A, threatening to split them apart. White has left a weakness -- use it!]
;B[ph]LB[qh:A]C[S: This is less effective than A. As this is played, white can still slide in underneath black's stones.]
;W[mb]LB[kc:A][hd:B]C[S: This is pretty small. White is threatening the marked black stone, but there are definitely bigger moves elsewhere on the board. B does a better job of making a moyo on the upper left for white, and puts more pressure on the black stone.]
;B[nc]LB[dn:A][dq:B][gd:C]C[S: Of course, answering white's small move with a small move is small for black. Either A, B, or C is better.]
;W[dq]
(;B[jq]C[Should I cut W group on the left early?


S: Well, this isn't a very solid response. It's a big retreat. How about the variation?]
;W[gc];B[dj];W[eq]
(;B[fp]LB[fq:A]C[S: Oooo, no. A is joseki. As soon as white attaches at E3, play the hane. See the variation.]
;W[on];B[cn]LB[np:A]C[S: This attacks the white left side and makes a base for black, so it's a good move. But white's last move is threatening to black's bottom moyo. To protect the bottom, black needs to play at A soon.


Otherwise, white can get in there and make things complicated.]
;W[kb]LB[mc:A][nb:B][jb:C]C[S: Right here (before you look at where black plays next), ask yourself: What do you want to do? You should play:


A if you want to link up the black stoneat L17, in order to attack the middle;  

B if you want to cut off the white stone at P17, making a big corner for black; or


C if you want to risk getting cut off, but try and make a living group in the middle to use in attacking white's upper left corner.]
;B[mc]C[S: Black chose the first option, and so he needs to stick with it! Just assume that white will connect up with the P17 stone -- let her have it and use the center influence to stay connected and attack the left.]
;W[lc]
(;B[nb]C[S: By trying to do everything, you can easily lose it all. See the variation.]
;W[ld]C[I can't figure out why I kept being pressed by the opponent at the mid-game.


S: White seems to realize that if she can keep you separated, she'll have the upper hand. Therefore, you should work on keeping yourself connected.]

(;B[me]C[S: This is okay, but the variation is better.


If you DO play here, lock into your mind that if white plays N16, black MUST play O16. (You realized this, I think.)]
;W[ch];B[je];W[ic];B[kd];W[gf]C[Move 34 seems a big move from the opponent, should I have placed there before instead?

S: Yeah, Fiddling around with the N17 area was probably too small at that time. Meanwhile, white has been making the upper left corner bigger and bigger. By now it's really solid. Remember that the longer you wait to get into a big corner like that, the harder it will be to invade or reduce it.]
;B[hh]LB[np:A][cj:B][eh:C][ch:D][gf:E]C[S: This move doesn't really do anything. A, B, and C are all bigger.


If you're going to invade, invade (at E16, for instance -- very risky!). If you're going to reduce, you have to play inside the opponent's territory.  

Imagine there's a line between the D and E white stones. An invasion has to be on the white side of that line. A reduction should be on the line itself.]
;W[cj]
(;B[dk]C[S: Again, when white attaches, black should hane.]
;W[mj];B[ci];W[ji]C[S: This is a strange series of moves coming up for both white and black. You seem to be fighting over very little. Black's area in the middle left is open on so many sides; white has many ways to whittle it down to nothing. But white isn't making much progress either.]
;B[ij];W[oj]
(;B[lh]C[S: See the variation.];W[nh]
(;B[kj]C[S: See the variation.];W[le];B[lf];W[og]
(;B[pf];W[if];B[jg];W[ih];B[ig];W[ma];B[na];W[mf];B[nf];W[md]
;B[mg]C[I think I should play at O16 instead, because later I lost all the top stones.

S: Yes. By diverting your attention, white caused you to sacrifice four stones to gain just one.]
;W[nd]
(;B[ob]C[S: Learn to recognize when your stones are dead as soon as you can, so you don't waste extra moves trying to save them. See the variation.]
;W[pc];B[pb];W[qb];B[qa];W[qc];B[la];W[lb];B[rb];W[rd];B[rc]
;W[pa];B[oa];W[kf];B[re];W[fi];B[fj];W[di];B[bi];W[bk]
(;B[ei]C[S: The variation is better. Try to save those stones on the left.]
;W[dh];B[fh];W[bj];B[cl];W[pg];B[qg];W[qh];B[rh];W[qi];B[rg]
;W[gr]LB[fq:A][hr:B]C[S: Black definitely needs to answer this. A or B are common. See the variations.]

(;B[ll];W[ln];B[mp]C[S: Finally!  =)];W[jf];B[kg];W[do]C[S: This is big for white. Notice how hard it will be for black to make that center thing into actual territory.]
;B[en];W[no];B[bo]LB[jn:A]C[S: Small. Try A instead.];W[bp]
;B[id]C[S: These stones up here are gone. Don't waste time pretending to do things with them. Black might as well pass.]
;W[hd];B[bl];W[lp];B[lq]C[S: Good.];W[lk];B[kl];W[kk];B[bh]
LB[jk:A]C[S: Again, these are gone. A is desperately needed.]
;W[bg];B[ff];W[ee];B[gg];W[jk]C[S: See?];B[jl];W[mq];B[kq];W[np]
;B[nq];W[mo];B[oq];W[jo]C[S: This was big. Black should have played here a while ago.]
;B[mr]C[S: Well handled.];W[ml];B[ik];W[il];B[im];W[gl];B[hl]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[fm];B[dp];W[ho];B[co];W[gn];B[jj];W[ir];B[iq]
;W[jn]C[S: Whit gets very solid and black is now scrambling to find territory. From here on out, white has a pretty easy time of it, so I'll end my comments here. You have a good set of skills, just work on keeping connected and knowing where the big moves are!


Keep practicing and have fun!

(;B[ne]C[S: White can't cut. Try it and see. This is also good because black gets thickness with the P15 stone. Getting thickness is very good -- it makes it harder for your opponent to put you into atari.]

(;B[ld];W[lb];B[kd]LB[nb:A][md:B]C[S: Now black is solidly connected. White can still link up by playing A, but black has created a nice, thick center wall that can probably turn into some good territory. (Notice that there's still a cutting point at B, but if white cuts there, her stone will be pretty far away from her friends.)]
))
(;B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq]C[S: Black builds a solid wall and forces white down onto the second line (where she can't make as much territory).]
))
(;B[eq]C[S: This is more assertive. It says: "Hands off, white! The bottom is mine!" of course, white can still play at K3 or K4 later on, but black can profit from such an invasion by attacking the invading stone. Meanwhile, the black wall on the left will make it harder for white to connect up, which means black will get a nice moyo. Follow this path and you'll see what I mean.]

;W[no];B[lq];W[kq];B[np]C[S: Black ends up with two decent groups. Yes, he's separated, but white doesn't have a base on the bottom, and black is very solid.]
))
(;B[qj]LB[ql:A][oj:B]C[S: This alternative puts pressure on white to keep her from making a base. She still has a good two-space jump available at A, but then black can just jump out to the middle at B and make a nice right side moyo. White gets scrunched on the bottom. Of course, black is weaker on the bottom here.]
)
(;B[np]C[S: This is another very solid move -- and in fact, this is probably played more often. Notice that the three stones on the bottom are all working together -- it's very important to get your stones to work together, instead of just sprinkling them around and hoping they meet up. Of course, white can now make a solid base on the right, but you can't be everywhere at once. It's important to make a plan for your attack. Be flexible in the beginning, but at least have an idea of what you're trying to do.]
