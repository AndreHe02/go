C[Dear Reviewer.
Starting our game we both had 18k.
Could you like to review our game for both sides and show our misteaks, failures and the way to punish it, as well as small points and missed biger one. We were studed our game and detected a lot of misteaks. Could you shaw us the hidden on?
Thank you very muche for advance.

Localy K17 for B is better, but even that might be to slow. 
I wouldn't complain about K17 because I fail to see the differens K17 an for ex. K4,  R-Q10, or C11.  They all look good enough to play for me.]

There is a saying : 

If you can cut then cut.

I guess that's what B is aiming for, it's sente anyway because W isn't gonna not answer at Q9 that would be to give away the whole edge.]
;W[pk];B[pe]C[??

Same as Q10, W don't wanna ignore it. but after W Q16 I think B15 is better then what happend.]
;W[pd];B[oe];W[qe]C[My estimation after only 20 moves. I'll make these estimations every 20 moves until the midgame makes it to hard, after your in midgame I'm down to 5-10 p at most on a move. This is my way to deside how I have to play agressive or if I can afford to take gote and make a group 110% alive, when I play tournaments. Not every 20:th move but every now & then to around 60-100 moves or so. 

W has app. Upper left corner 17p + upper right 19p = 37p
W influence on the under edge is app. 15-20 p and the Q9 group should make at least 5-10 p.
This gives W a sum of  57-67p 

and 

B has app. Lower left 11p + Lover right 17p = 28p
B influence is app. 24 one the left edge(C5 to C13) and the lower edge 75-76 p 
B sum is 101-102 p

Hm.. could be that W only wanted string to break up your lower side, but at least W should play something like C12 or maybe L15 if he finds a way to cut.]

Good luck I say..  ;-)

W has to either be lucky or good at reading to live now but it's possible.]

(;B[er];W[fq];B[fp];W[gp]C[The 60 move estimation.

W has UPLC 15 p + UPRC 49 p + center 2 p + left edge 8 p Lower edge 5-8 p + 1prisoner=78-80 p
influence center 5-10 p  
Sum : 83- 90 p

influence lower left center 8-12 p + Upper right center 10-12 p 
Sum : 77-81 p

W has taken the lead, time for B to remeber the frase : When the going gets tough the tough get going.


After this W know he has to defend. Preferd defend mode Agressive so that he keeps B busy. 
And B know he has to Attack very hard, but not an all out attack and forgetting to secure point when possible.

Any more estimation of the score is unessesary, after this I would start to count every point on the board. (ofcurse some 15-30 moves has been played or something dies ect, ect before I count again)]

C[Hm, W wanna kill a dead group?
Well one sometimes has to do that just to win a won game.

btw. this is one of my hardest learnd lessions I've ever had to learn.
To put it simple : A "dead" group can all of the sudden start to live because it wasn't killed in time. In this case if b played S14 and lived W loss would have been around 35-40 points.]

That depends on W answer on B's crosscut.


If you want to know more about when to crosscut and when not to I recomend the book " Crosscut Workshop "

But be warned it's confusing book. After I read it I realeazed that I thought I know how to use crosscut but I know nothing or even less about crosscuts....
And it made me 3-4 stones weaker after reading it and do I need to say that I still don't when to crosscut... though I have learned a bit on when not to.
If I read it a couple of time I'll problably learn how to use crosscut. but I gotta find the time and energy for it.]

Now B has to try make every move sente and he will win. And also don't forgett W is problably so pissed that his brain high on adrenalin and playing 2-3 k(if not even more) stronger then normal for the next 20-30 move or maybe the rest of the game.]

Move 237-247 shows a important aspect when it comes to end game. 
That is : To save points for my self is only half as important as stealing them. Usually endgame moves tend to be sente and even if they are only 1-2 points that huge, because there's no more moves to get points with after endgame. So the thougt behind every endgamemove should be : Where can I cause the most damage? And caclulate if the damaging move is worth more then the safe move.
Ex : move 240 should be played safe at move 241(E16) because for W. The safe move(E16) is worth more then the damageing  move he did play at B14. This way the walue of the edge is reduced and the value of E16 gets boosted to 2 (one at D17 and on at A16) points because B can't push as far into W territory as he can with W move 240 at B14.  

The 237-247 exchange :
When B managed to force W to play at B-E17 W lost 3-4 points while B lost 1 point. B should be wery happy.]

I know most players in my club would say there's better moves out there, but my point is that you should always know what your move want to accomplish otherwise thay are pointless to play.

So in this case O13 might be better but it only runs and doesn't help with any eyeshape as P12 do.]

Better from for life and it's gote, but this move is still here after the Q10 exchange. So there is no need for it now. And Q15 is sente for B so if Life it's all that matters there, B should play Q15 then R14 or 15]

(;B[ci]C[better?

Maybe, maybe not. At least it feels stronger to me, but I'm not strong enough to tell if it is. But this gives B a much stronger left side. W doesn't have time to play K17 because if W does that B play K3 and get somewhat missplaced san-ren-sei and the strong left sida while W only got the san-ren-sei.

And even if W play K16 or K17 and B played K3 there is some rome to live around E-H3 for W it only help B to get stronger and make it harder for W.
