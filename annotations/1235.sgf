C[I am hyalau.  I play with my friend Armageddon.  So hope you can comments for both player.  Thanks very much.
I am playing as white.
[DP\] OK, I will look at the game mainly from the white viewpoint, but with some notes on black too.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[qn]C[I am weak in opening and what to have improvement.  Hope you can give me more comments on that.
Since I think it's very hard for me to defense black 3 star on the right hand side,  So I try to attack black and leave the upper left corner.  Is that not a good approach?

[DP\] This is unusual (I do not mean unplayable!).  If the black stone were on an asymmetric point like 4,3; 5,4; or 5,3 then an approach move would more normal.  As it is, if I were black I would immediately take the open corner, since Q4 is not in immediate danger.  You should also not be afraid of the san-ren-sei from Black - a good opening, but plenty of responses available. However, O3 might have been preferable - see next move]
;B[pj]C[[DP\] Black makes his san-ren-sei anyway, since he can play an ideal move at Q10 which is an extension from Q16 and a loose pincer on R6.  But if he did that first, would you want your stone to be on R6?  So I think if you want to play an approach move, it should have been on the other side at O3.  This early in the game is still personal preference though.]
;W[nq]C[[DP\] Good, this is consistent with your idea of ignoring the upper left corner]
;B[oo];W[qq]C[[DP\] and again, a sound follow-up];B[dd];W[nc]
;B[oc]C[[DP\] This is a mistake from black.  You can now make a stand at O16 and then an ideal extension to K16. This in itself is not too bad for black - what makes it a mistake is that he is missing big points at C10, K10 or even R4]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jc]C[[DP\] I would prefer K16 for influence - all your bottom left stones are 3rd line territorial, so it would be good to ensure presence in the centre. Minor detail, though.]
;B[hc]C[[DP\] A strange move by black.  I would have gone for D10 - not much point making a blocking extension at H17 when the extension at K17 has already been made!]

(;W[cf]C[[DP\] This doesn't feel right.  I think D10 (or C11 as you suggest later) would be better - see variation from previous move which shows white developing on a larger scale and more quickly than black]
;B[cn]C[[DP\] Black is hoping you will reply with something like F4 here, so that he can make an ideal move which is both an extension from C6 and a pincer on C14.  You should really go for something like C9 here, so that *you* get the extension and pincer.  See variations]

(;W[cp]C[[DP\] This is a strange move, best reserved for special occasions when it is really necessary to maintaina small corner territory.  By this move you encourage black to play his preferred move.]
;B[dj]C[[DP\] Black seizes the initiative with an extension and pincer]
;W[cl]C[It seems I loss very much in the opening.  And black is still so strong on the right side.  So I don't want to loss the left side and play C8.   But after review, I think C8 is too dangerous.  Am I correct?  (I have made another variation for this)
Should I save the C14 instead say C11?
[DP\] Your opening was fine until your response at C4.  This was too territorial - the pincer would have been better.  Black is not so strong on the right side, and if this was your main concern you should play R4 not C8, undercutting all of Black's "strong" position.  C8 is the wrong move because C14 is feeling very lonely since you didn't play the pincer.  C11 is the right kind of idea but a move too late - a bit like Black's H17 move earlier]

(;B[en]C[[DP\] As soon as Black does this, you can probably see the problems that C4 has created.  Which way does White defend now?]
;W[bi]C[[DP\] A strong black player would now squash you on to the second line, the line of defeat!]

(;B[fq]C[[DP\] This is an overplay by Black, which you should exploit by cutting in the F5 area]
;W[fp]C[[DP\] a good start];B[gq];W[eq];B[gp];W[kq]C[[DP\] OK, this is the first move with which I seriously disagree :-)  Black can now play F5, link up all his stones and the game could well be over.  F5 is urgent and essential]
;B[ck]C[DP\] Black is toying with you, but F5 would be better for him. It is of course, still the move you should be playing here next]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[bo];B[dm]C[DP\] C7 would be more solid for black in this situation]
;W[iq]C[[DP\] I like this even less than L3.  You've had 3 opportunities to get F5 in; black won't give you another one!]
;B[fo]C[[DP\] Black now has tremendous thickness in the centre, and good territory in the top right.  Game over. You go on to win because black makes mistakes, but at this point I would place Black about 15 points ahead. So, coming back to your original reason for getting the game analysed, I think your opening is OK, but your early middle game shows some areas for improvements.  Attack and Defense is a good book to cover this area.]
;W[eo];B[gn]C[[DP\] Black consolidates his thickness and can look forward to an easy game]
;W[je]C[[DP\] Good, play *away* from thickness - this is about as far away as you can get!]

(;B[pn]C[[DP\] Strange move. R4 to separate better.  See variation from previous move]

(;W[qm]C[DP\] I would prefer R4 here to consolidate the corner]
;B[pm];W[io]C[[DP\] Too close to thickness - achieves very little.  Black should ignore it and get moves like R8 and O14 played as soon as possible]

(;B[qo];W[ro];B[pq];W[qr];B[ql]C[[DP\] Black would be better off separating white with Q2 here]
;W[qp];B[po];W[rl]
(;B[qk];W[oh]C[Here I attempt to make white terrorities with K18, K15, O17, O15.  I think although black secure his terrority on the upper right, I can get more terrorities and also invade black lower right.  Is that move ok?

[DP\] This is an overplay.  Black is strong on all sides of you apart from top left.  O13 is about as far as you can go.  Personally I might have gone for Q2 to link all my stones. Black should respond to this by an immediate O14 and white is in big trouble.]

(;B[qh]C[[DP\] No fighting spirit here from black.  Negative move, missing the attacking opportunity at O14]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[of];B[pe]C[[DP\] White has been allowed to get away with murder here.  Black is too concerned with territory, when he should have his eyes on the weak white groups and ways to attack them.]
;W[re]C[my aim reach.  And next I want to reduce black terrorities.  But I fail to do so by S15.
My intention is my next move to R17.  or if opponent place R17 I move down to S12.  But only after my moving on S12, I realized that I cannot make this two pieces life.
Should I just place to R17 directly and life there?

[DP\] You were lucky to reach your aim with such an outrageous overplay as P12! However, S15 is even more rash since black has been strengthened by your previous sequence.]
;B[qc];W[rh];B[rf];W[qi];B[pi]
(;W[rj];B[rk];W[ph]C[[DP\] Nasty empty triangle, caused by your overplay at S15 and your unwillingness to see the mistake and let it go.  White, having got away with P12, is now giving away his gains by throwing stones at black.]
;B[rm];W[rn];B[sl];W[jh]C[[DP\] White has been very lucky to get this small territory here.  Black, through being defensive, has thrown away his 15 pt lead and the game is evenly balanced now]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[lh]C[How can I response this black move?  Should I secure the potential terrority and place around M13 or destroy the potential terrority for black lower right?  I choose P11.  Should I place like O11 / N11 to threaten the black M12 and then invade black terrority?

[DP\] It's not threatening.  It's another overplay like P12]

(;W[oi]C[[DP\] Yes, good answer];B[mj];W[oj]C[[DP\] And again, keep pushing!]
;B[ok];W[nk];B[nj];W[ol];B[pk];W[mk];B[lk];W[ll];B[kj];W[mm]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[nm];W[kk];B[lj];W[km];B[jk];W[kl];B[ik]C[[DP\] M14 might be good here to consolidate. The stones you've played have destroyed black's potential territory, so a defensive move would not be out of place now.  Your response to M12 was OK]
;W[jj]TR[lh][kj][lj][mj][nj][lk]C[I want to kill black marked pieces.  But in the end I fail to do so.  black placing K13 and escape easily.  What is my best response when black place K13?

[DP\] Best response is not to try to kill these stones while you have weakness at P15 area.  Hence the M14 recommendation earlier]
;B[ne]C[[DP\] Excellent move by black - kills the white stones - game over again!]
;W[oe];B[jg]C[[DP\] What? Black misses P16 and so gives the initiative back to white]
;W[ji]C[[DP\] No, white is determined to kill himself.  Black still has P16 to win the game...]

(;B[kg]C[[DP\] Missed again...];W[hi];B[ng];W[og]
(;B[nf];W[od];B[hg];W[hk]C[This is what I think a critical point that black loss.
Here black two pieces have no way to escape, am I correct?

[DP\] No, black can live escape easily with J7]
(;B[il]C[[DP\] There are reasons why empty triangles are bad shape :-)  J7 was the correct move. The empty triangle is a death sentence to the black stones, and to the game since now white's stones are out of danger]

;W[nn];B[om];W[np];B[mo];W[no];B[ko];W[gm];B[hn];W[fm];B[fn]
;W[ep]C[[DP\] Black is now in some trouble, and should be looking either for eyes or to link to another group]

(;B[ip];W[jp];B[hq];W[ir];B[dl]
(;W[cc]C[seems there is no hope to capture black lower pieces after black placing D8.  So I want to get some more terrority since black upper right got so much.
Is C17 a good choice?  I guess there maybe a better way since D16 and H17 seems so far away.

[DP\] B16 better to live and connect your stones. C16 will now separate you and kill C14 and C11]
;B[cd]
(;W[dc];B[ec];W[bd];B[db];W[bc]C[[DP\] Again, very negative from black.  White now has the corner and is linked to his stones. The game is now white's]
;B[df];W[ed];B[fd];W[ee];B[de];W[ef];B[dg];W[gf];B[hf];W[ge]
;B[he]C[[DP\] This is good from black.  By attacking G15, he has separated and killed white top centre stones.  Game to black now.  This is going one way then the other!]
;W[fc];B[gd];W[eb]
(;B[ld]TR[jc][nc][nd][od][je][oe][of][og][pg][oh][ph][oi][oj]
C[Actually I am not so confident about the life and death for the marked stones.  Can black kill them with another move?

[DP\] Yes. Previous move variation];W[lc];B[kd];W[kc];B[jd]

;W[ih];B[jf];W[ob];B[pc];W[mb];B[cg]C[[DP\] Black should be more concerned about his lower right stones now...]
;W[di];B[ci]C[In fact I think black will place E11 instead of C11.
When black place C13, I think C13 is so good that I loss so much for this.  I just think of getting more terrority between line E and G.  So I place D11 and wish black to place E11 and then I go E12, F11, E10, etc.
Or should I directly place E11 instead of D11?

[DP\] You should stop worrying about territory!  Think influence.  Also, had you counted by this point in the game?  You're miles ahead and you should have done the sums to know this!]

[DP\] Why worry?  One eye will only be an issue if you get into a seki or ko fight, neither of which look likely]
