C[Hi,
I play white in this game with -5.5 komi.  I had serveral chances in the game but I didn't seem to be able to take advantage of it.  I lost by 8.5 points at the end.

Thanks for reviewing this game!

[JB\]Ok, I will try to help. My comments are marked [JB\].]
;B[qd];W[dq];B[cp]LB[ep:a][fp:b][cq:c][dl:d][dp:e]C[I don't know why he played at c4.  I don't know what is the best way to handle this.

[JB\]First of all, you should be prepared for your opponent to play different from what you expect. Second, I have not seen this move very often but I tend to play E4 or F4. In a couple of professional games I have seen C3 or D8 (a thru d). There is an example in variation 2, but remember that the right move to choose would be based on the rest of the board.
Your move (e) does not look bad either to me.]
(;W[dp];B[co]C[detachedp: why everybody is attacking me on c4 today:-)]
;W[cq]C[CalmWind: lol];B[cm];W[gp]C[[JB\] This one is too close. With a 2-stone wall you should jump 3 spaces, and here it is more noticeably because C3 makes this group very stong. For the same reason, playing G4 so close makes it overconcentarted and inefficient. Two provervs are broken here: from 2 stones jump 3 spaces, and play away from thickness.]
;B[jp]C[[JB\] By playing this your opponent (he likes to fight, you can see) tries to make you more overconcentrated (of course he may have not intended this but it would be the effect).]
;W[op]C[[JB\] And this is too far, allowing your opponent to jump 2 spaces, the perfect extension from K4.
K4 was not a good move probably at this moment, for several reasons, but it will become good after you play.]
;B[np]LB[mp:a]C[[JB\] A lot better at N4 (a). Did I say that your opponent loves to fight? In this case you may reject the fights and just reinforce yourself, your opponent probably will end up with lots of unconnected, poorly located stones.]
;W[qp]LB[oq:a][oo:b]C[[JB\] Better at P3 or P5 (a, b). When a move touches a stone it is giving the opportunity to reinforce it. Think this way: if you play e.g. P5, your opponent black stone at O4 will be a stone too close to the thickness. Or: if O4 was not here and white P5 is, black would never play O4 (this is called tewari). So: O4 was bad, and P5 would have been good.]
;B[oq];W[pq];B[oo]C[[JB\] Now you are reverting to a star-point joseki which has been moved one space to the side (the right. So, if the joseki was even, this is not good for white because the territory he gets is one line below (worth at least 4 points, not too much but...). Also, the balck stones are now at a very good distance of K4, making it a  good, efficient stone.]
;W[pp];B[or];W[pr];B[po]
(;W[qo]C[[JB\] Even to defend, this one looks too submissive to me. Variation 2 looks like a good way to defend while attacking.]
;B[pm];W[od];B[qn];W[qc];B[pe];W[pd]C[Is this a bad move?

[JB\] I don't think so. In fact I think Q15 was not good. Other possible responses would be at S16 or S17.]
;B[rd];W[oe];B[pf];W[rc];B[of];W[kc];B[jd]C[[JB\] Still your opponent is afraid of letting you play big extensions. He shows a lot of himself... At this point you can bet:
- if you play a long extension he will play inside
- he thinks his territory at the right cannot be invaded (well, it is quite strong and you should invade it ASAP... Black could close lots of points at the right and win the game quite easily)]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[kf]C[[JB\] Stop and think. L15 was worth 1 or 2 points! In exchange you let black the opportunity to (a) expand his huge moyo at the center, right and part of the bottom, and (b) to create influence to the left and top-left with his C7 and J17 groups...
At this point it is difficult to understand why black was only 8 points ahead at the end...]
;W[cc]C[[JB\] Very good, probably your last chance to avoid resigning. You need to invade here, end here with sente and enter in the center.]
;B[cd]C[[JB\] Black should play the standard joseki at D16. This one is not recommended.]
;W[dd]C[[JB\] Good!];B[de]LB[ce:a][bd:b][ed:c]C[[JB\] Worst... you have several choices depending on your strategy, like a, b or c (see variations)]

(;W[ec]C[[JB\] Small, leaves black in comfort.];B[ed];W[dc]
;B[fd]C[[JB\] Probably C15 is a better choice (good prospect on the left side for black). The following sequence...]
;W[ce];B[fc];W[cf]C[[JB\]...gives black a few points on the top and looses lots of points on the left.]
;B[df];W[fb];B[gb];W[ib];B[eb];W[db];B[fa];W[bd];B[hb];W[dg]
C[Here I decided that the center is too much for the black.

[JB\] You took some time about deciding this... It could have been too late but black thinks big moyos cannot be invaded...]
;B[jb]C[[JB\] Why here? Too small again. Black only needs a couple of moves at M14 and near L10 to win the game. And he lost sente... again, for a couple of points!]
;W[kb];B[ia];W[eg];B[ff];W[cj];B[ck]C[[JB\] Too small. M14 enough and he would win by about 20 points.]
;W[dj];B[dk];W[ej];B[ek]C[[JB\] Black loses more points playing by nothing. E9 does not make territory  and he will not eat the D4 group so influence is worth nothing here.]
;W[mo]C[I slipped on this one:-).  But I was searching a good entry point.  Should I just be more patient and attack slowly may on j3 or f10 or q10...?]
;B[no];W[mp];B[mq];W[ko];B[jn]C[[JB\] K5 better. There have been some mistakes in this sequence and white will probably live.]
;W[jo];B[io];W[ip];B[kp];W[kn];B[jm];W[lp];B[lq];W[km];B[kl]
;W[mn];B[lm]
(;W[ll]C[[JB\] There is a complicate fight starting with J6 instead of this one (see variation), so probably it was ok to leave those stones.]
;B[ln];W[mm];B[lo];W[mk];B[nl];W[ml];B[nk];W[kk]C[I'm in such a bad shape right now.]
;B[lj];W[lk];B[jk];W[kj];B[li];W[jj];B[ij]
(;W[jh]C[[JB\] See variation.];B[kh];W[ii];B[hj];W[hi]
(;B[ki]C[[JB\] Nonsense. White has no eyes, black is helping. Variation 2 looks better for black, though a bit complicated fight will arise.]
;W[ji];B[gi];W[gh];B[fi];W[fh];B[ei];W[di]C[here he got greedy.

[JB\] Black could have killed white probably, but not at this point.]
;B[eh];W[ik];B[jl];W[hk];B[gj];W[gk];B[bj];W[dh];B[bi];W[bh]
;B[fk];W[fj]C[[JB\] Stop again. Yu are lucky you survived this invasion and got 15 points, and reduced the center a lot. Are you ahead?
If black now plays M14 let's count... (I always count worst case for both sides)
W about 60+komi, black about 70.
You are quite close...];B[jg]C[[JB\] M14, O10 and J3 bigger.]
;W[iq]C[[JB\] Good, this one is huge.];B[jq];W[ho];B[hn];W[gn]
;B[gm];W[fn];B[fm]C[[JB\] Black again plays neutral points... :-(]
;W[dn];B[do];W[eo];B[em];W[en];B[dm];W[hm];B[in];W[cn];B[bn]
;W[gl]C[[JB\] B4 and N10 MUCH bigger.];B[im]C[[JB\] Again, playing very small points when there are huge points still available!]
;W[hl];B[fl];W[ci];B[ir];W[hr];B[js];W[gr];B[bq];W[br];B[fq]
C[[JB\] ???? See variation. You do not need the J3 stones.]

(;W[gq]C[[JB\] No need, just play B4.];B[sc];W[sb];B[ne];W[nd]

(;W[qg]C[This is the worst move.  I should have played at 1.  Then I would have won easily.

[JB\] Probably but I will not comment this sequence. It is like a desperate move to make something happen and anything could happen. You could have used the points at O10 or S7 to help yourself.
When you try to live in such a space, you have to be ready to abandon some stones, usually the first ones you put. So you don't need S14 any more, and that's why R13 could be regarded as bad.
And again: you both could have win the game by just playing the big points at yose first.]

C[[JB\] B8 is a good point now. See variation; the difference is11 points. In your game, black made 9 points. In my variation and ending white in A4 (like you played now) black has 3 points and white 5 (including A12).
You would have won the game :-)

At your play level, there are several things to improve but some important are:
- do not follow your opponent move's blindly
- be careful at fuseki: keep the balance and play away from thickness 
- be careful at yose: play big points first and try to keep sente
- invade big moyos before they are closed
- if you cannot invade them, reduce as much as possible... look for weak points in the walls
