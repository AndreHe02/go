C[hello, I'm black

Comments by Azazel (2 dan AGA at the time). bixbyr@umail.ucsb.edu]
;B[pd];W[dp]LB[pd:1][dp:2];B[pq];W[po];B[cd];W[pj]LB[qf:a]C[Dubious move by white, easy for black to gain an advantage by taking a big point in fuseki now. 'a' would be a natural move, hindering white from approaching further that way and laying the groundwork for an invasion into white's loose extension]
;B[ec]TR[pd]LB[id:a]C[Though not terrible, this seems a weak move to me. It ignores the rest of the board too much, and doesn't really work with the marked stone. If black wants to play on the left corner, 'a' might work better with the rest of the position]
;W[jc]C[c10 was attractive or M17 to attack white K10, but i was worried about my alone Q3 stone

Az: Black should develope the upper right corner and push white against your thickness. If you want E17 to be a useful move, pushing white against it with M17 is the correct line of play. Black can always then defend q3, but M17 is sente]
;B[np];W[dj]C[is C12 or something like that still interesting?

Azazel: C12 is too small now. M17 is a big point since it pushes them against your thickness, f3 is another big point since it prevents white's moyo from getting out of hand]
;B[fq];W[ip];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co]C[This is a mistake by white, in response to which black punishes properly]
;B[cr];W[dr];B[do]C[Excellent work by black];W[cn];B[ep];W[bp]
;B[er];W[dn];B[eo]C[at that point i'm quite happy];W[mq];B[pp]
;W[oo];B[nq];W[lp];B[mp]LB[mn:a]C[This is too slow, better to move out with 'a' or the like. This is also bad since it's a move white can ignore]
;W[lo];B[mn]TR[lo][mp]C[Exchanging the marked stones was bad for B, black should play here initially]
;W[qo];B[nn];W[qf];B[pf]LB[nc:a]C[Mistake in direction. The k17 stone is weak, black should play 'a' to menace that stone]
;W[pg];B[qe];W[of];B[pe];W[rf]LB[og:a][nd:b]C[what should black play?

Az: Black should cut at 'a'. The joseki of playing at 'b' is not good here]
;B[re]TR[pj]C[Too slow, and bad shape. Black is making clumsy shape in the corner while white surrounds him and utilizes the marked stone. This is very good developement for that stone]
;W[ph]LB[og:a][qg:b][qh:c]C[Slow move by white, 'a' better (if black 'b', white 'c', etc). I know you're black, just pointing pointing out that this is a mistake]
;B[nc];W[gc];B[lq]LB[pm:a][in:b]C[Too small, white can afford to give up a stone easily. Black should play 'a' in sente, then attack at the vital point for the shape, 'b']
;W[kq];B[mr];W[cg];B[ee]C[This is inefficent shape for black, but it's hard to avoid a reinforcing move now. B should not have let white play g17]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[bd];B[bc];W[cb];B[be];W[fa]LB[fb:a][gb:b][ea:c]
C[Black should play 'a', white 'b', black 'c'];B[ea];W[eb];B[db]
;W[da];B[bb];W[fc];B[ca];W[eg]C[Black is being taken advantage of in this exchange.]
;B[pl]LB[pm:a][qm:b][ql:c]C[too far, isn't it?

Az: Try 'a', white must respond with 'b', and if you're feeling adventurous you can consider 'c']
;W[om];B[on];W[pm];B[pn];W[qn];B[rg]C[This is a tiny yose move. You should attack with 'a', not play a 4 point gote move. White should just ignore]
;W[qg];B[sf];W[rh];B[lc]LB[in:a]C[was M17 useful?
i should focus on white group around K4,
 L2 to take life base
or F7 to isolate white?

Azazel: This is too small, black is behind in terroritory, but white was a weak group on the bottom. Black should attack this group. 'a' is the vital point because it is hard to escape after that, and living locally is very hard]
;W[gm];B[fm]LB[hn:a]C['a' is the vital point, if white pushes white might as well write off the lower group.]
;W[fn];B[en];W[em];B[fl];W[gn];B[dm]LB[gl:a]C[This move makes no sense. 'a' is the common sense move]
;W[el];B[cm];W[bm];B[bn];W[bo];B[bl];W[an]C[here come the fight]
;B[ek];W[dl];B[dk];W[cl];B[gk]C[Black needlessly made white stronger and has bad shape. This is a result of black's perplexing move]
;W[ej];B[ck]C[This is a big overplay. Black should move out with j9. Deal with that latter, you're in a life and death struggle.]
;W[fj];B[fk];W[kl];B[gj];W[gg];B[bi];W[ch];B[ci];W[bh];B[eh]
;W[fh];B[cj];W[dh];B[ik]LB[jj:a]C['a' better, this is too slow]
;W[hi];B[jl];W[kk]LB[jn:a]C['a' is the logical followup];B[km]
C[This is an overplay that asks to be cut];W[jm];B[im];W[jn]
;B[in];W[io];B[kn];W[jo];B[ho]LB[go:a]C[Play at 'a' instead]
;W[gp];B[go];W[fo];B[hn];W[fp];B[eq];W[hp]LB[ij:a]C[Black needs to run as fast as he can with 'a'. A ponnuki does no good if you have to fill it]
;B[hl];W[hm];B[il]C[Since white is all but alive, this makes no sense. Give white the stones and try to save you group. This just invites a larger loss]
;W[ln];B[ij]LB[ii:a]C[Try 'a' instead];W[hj];B[lm];W[ko];B[ii]
C[Very slow];W[kg];B[ig];W[hh];B[ki];W[ih];B[lj];W[lk];B[mk]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[ll];B[kh]LB[mi:a]C[Play 'a' to protect the cut]
;W[mj];B[lg];W[lf];B[kj];W[jh];B[mi];W[nj];B[mg];W[mf];B[nh]
;W[ng];B[ni];W[lh];B[oj];W[nk];B[ok];W[ml];B[nl];W[mk];B[oi]
;W[mh];B[li];W[ql];B[ol]C[B shouldn't have lived, both sides floundered around.]
;W[qm];B[qj]LB[pi:a][kb:b][rp:c]C[Pushing at 'a' is  better, though playing here at all isn't very big. 'b' is big, so is 'c']
;W[pi];B[pk];W[qk];B[hr];W[ir];B[gr];W[bq];B[rq]C[One line higher up....]
;W[rp];B[qp];W[so]C[Bad shape for b, almost no gain for having played here first]
;B[ge];W[he];B[kd];W[lb];B[mb];W[kc];B[ld];W[md];B[kb];W[nd]
;B[oc];W[jb];B[jd]LB[ka:a]C[This is a mistake since it makes white's capture at 'a' sente. So b should play 'a' instead]
;W[id];B[jf];W[ka];B[mc];W[od];B[pc];W[bf];B[ie];W[hd];B[hf]
LB[sq:a][kr:b]C[This isn't worth any points since B is filling dame. Playing here makes no sense, play somewhere like 'a' or 'b'

End of commentary. Summary: B missed chances to attack for a large portion of the game and then picked an unreasonable fight that he survived only because of sloppy play by white. Black's endgame was fairly good, but it was a foregone conclusion after the middle game.]
