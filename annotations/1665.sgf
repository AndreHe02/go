C[Dear reviewer,

This was a game I played on KGS recently.  I played black, but please review for both sides.]
;B[pq];W[qc];B[cp]C[I typically play the high chinese fuseki, but I've been trying to switch it up a bit.  I was a bit thrown off by his san-san opening move though.

Hubert : If you want to play chineese, it's common to begin with 4-4, not 4-3.]
;W[cd];B[pd]C[san-san is not a typical opening move and I figured the reason for this was because it is too close into the corner - therefore the way to exploit it is to close it in and take the influence on the outside.  unfortunately it didn't work that way.  is this the wrong approach?

Hubert : This move is correct but can be delayed if you want to open the possibility of playing an aproach move instead.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[ob]
(;B[ph]C[Hubert : This move look slack, if you want top lay on the right side, R15 is THE move. But the normal variation at N16 works well too.]
;W[rf]C[Hubert : Very strange move. White is doing nothing here. He is already alive and there is no territorie here neither for black nor for white.
It's just small yose.

White should poke out at O16 or leave the position as it stands]
;B[rh]C[I didn't like how it turned out at all and that P18 stone came back to haunt me in the end.


Hubert : This move is clearly wrong, you leave cutting points behind. You will pay for it later either loosing territory on the side ar leaving your two-stones to white.]
;W[dj]C[Hubert : too slow. Black moyo is bigger, invade. E4 or Q5.]
;B[ed]C[Hubert : Jalous
Black moyo is bigger, expand your moyo. D8 is good enough. Or J4.]
;W[ec]C[Hubert : no need to answer, the bottom is bigger.];B[fc]
;W[dc];B[gd]C[Hubert : heavy, no need to answer, E16-F17 are light, play at the bottom.]
;W[cf]C[Hubert : Very slow; at least play E15 to attack black 3 stones.]
;B[jd]C[Hubert : Because you are heavy, you must defend, now white play first at the bottom. You didnt achieve much at the top. White territory is strong now and your stones are inneficient. Because of D10 your strengthy vanish in th center. Because of O18 you dont make territory at the top.]
;W[qo]C[Hubert : Heavy. This move is possible, but I dont like it.
In black sphere of influence, high kakari is lighter.];B[np]
C[Hubert : correct];W[qq];B[pp]C[Hubert : R2 is joseki, you give white too many points in the corner.]
;W[qp];B[ql]C[Hubert : Very bad move. You dont make much territory and white is clearly alive in the corner.
You 3 stones in the bottom are weak, you MUST extend.
It should be a reflex.
Extend from weak wall to make strong moyo is the most valuable move possible in the opening. It turn the balance.]
;W[ep]C[Hubert : A direct confrontation at K4 is sharper. Black can pincer here and save the day.]
;B[dq]C[Hubert : Bad shape. E3 is joseki. But a pincer here is the best way.]
;W[co]C[Hubert : Just E3 is clear and good . Two stones against a kosumi is good shape. It open the possibility to play C5 LATER.]
;B[eq]C[Hubert: good, white must deal with the cutting point.]
;W[fp];B[gq]C[Hubert : slack. Cut and fight. White is mocking you. The only way to anwer his overplay is to fight now and hard.
D5 leave white with two weak groups.];W[bo]C[Hubert : White wants all ! Just D6 is good enough.]
;B[ho]C[Hubert : The next moves prove it's wrong];W[gp];B[hq]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[io];B[jp];W[hn]C[Hubert : White is so happy.]
;B[ch]C[Hubert : The game favour white and there are weakness  with B5-C5 stones. But this move seems too direct. Maibe C10 is more devious, but it seems an overtrick, ask a high dan here. D11 is my move is I play here.
But I would have tried something like G11 to make a hiuge center.

Don't forget to play the kikashi move K5. Should white play there, his thickness will be tremendous.]
;W[ei]C[Hubert : Yes the center is important.];B[dg];W[fe];B[fd]
C[Hubert : G15 is possible.];W[ef];B[bj];W[bk];B[ck];W[bi];B[bl]
;W[ci];B[el];W[dp];B[en]C[Hubert : No, you must answer the kikashi.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[bq];B[fq];W[gm];B[cm];W[qg]C[Hubert : Good timing]
;B[pg];W[qh];B[qi]
(;W[pf]C[Hubert :  The cut at Q11 is frightening too.];B[of]
;W[qf];B[oi];W[oe];B[ne]C[I chose to cut my losses and end in sente rather than fight with P16 - it seemed risky to me

Hubert : The fight is possible but doesnt appeal very much.]
;W[od];B[nd];W[oc];B[gg]C[i thought this move worked well to help build me territory in the center - also a threat to save the D13 stones

Hubert : Same error as before : you leave many cutting points.
H14 is clear.];W[fg];B[fh];W[eh];B[eg]C[Hubert : Doesnt work, you loose yose and ko threats.]
;W[ff];B[df];W[de];B[gh]
(;W[ee]C[Hubert : not necessary.];B[hf];W[nf];B[og];W[lc]C[ugh - it seems here is where i lost the game.  surely though i made other mistake - perhaps the biggest was playing 4-4 on top of his 3-3... how should i have played differently?
Hubert : this move seems coreect for white. The mistake was not your 4-4 move indeed. You lost because you THOUGHT your 4-4 move was wrong and didnt play at you level.]
