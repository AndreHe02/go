C[I p
layed as zeiz.  I think I started ok but would like a strongerstart. At end
I goofed failing to protect the right side. I needhelp with keeping solid
positions without giving up too muchand keeping sente at same time!

Joshua: WOULDN'T WE ALL LOVE TO KEEP SENTE ALL THE TIME!

Also need solid help with myend game moves. I believe, even after all the
errors I wouldhave won by playing a good end game, but how?Thanks in
advance for the review];C[Igc2000 Generated Sgf

;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ir];W[op]C[this is the wrong direction for white.  THe
lower side is not important now because of the stone at J2 (white can't
make territory) and J4 (black can't make a big territory either).  White
should play at C10 or thereabouts, or approach O17 or R14 or something
...];B[mq]C[This attack might get interesting, but white's J4 stone is very
light, and black doesn't look like making much territory.  I would prefer
Q6.];W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[rr]C[I always get confused choosing between S2 and
S5.

S2 grabs the base in the corner, making it harder for white to settle
locally, but I think the area up the side is a lot more important (to work
with the Q16 corner stone).  Of course I would have played Q6 to start
with instead of N3...];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[pp];B[rp];W[qm]
;B[qk]TR[on]C[white seems to get
bad shape here.    Perhaps white should have been at the triangled point
instead of R7.];W[mo];B[kq]C[This is very small for black.  White can't
really make any profit by cutting off the N3 stone anyway.  The upper side
and left side are bigger.];W[ko];B[ok]C[This move is too close to white's strong group, unless you
are planning to attack it by playing P6?];W[nc];B[pf]C[Q14 is wrong?

It does seem a little slow.  Attaching at O16 will probably make a bigger
space on your side.  But I think Q14 is
fine.];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qd]C[This is the mistake.  P18 is better (let
white live in the corner, capture the O17 stone).  Here white gets to live
too easily.];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[de];W[fc];B[cl];W[cr];B[ci]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[fp]C[Your P9 stone has
now lost most of its meaning.];B[cc]C[This is a big point indeed.]
;W[cd];B[dd];W[bc];B[cb];W[ed]C[Need help here

I think you do fine, white has made a big
overplay!];B[db];W[ec];B[bd]C[Does B18 put you a move ahead in this fight?
Hmmmm.  I must admit that reading in this type of situation is not my
strong point.  I would play C15 followed by B18 instead of your move here,
but maybe I would lose big then ...];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf]
;W[df];B[eb];W[fb]C[black has lost the game already here.
Letting white get such a solid outside while you crawl on the second line
... and even give white two captured stones ... terrible for black.]

(;B[bb]C[B18. Necessary? I did not see a problem with tenuki but was notsure.

Now white gets sente too!  The problem with tenuki is if white plays B13.
You will want to answer at C13 ... but does it work?  If you want an extra
move here, why not C13 instead of playing in the corner?  But I think at
this point you have to leave it.];W[jd]C[This is too close to white's
strength, L16 would be better or even M16.];B[ld]C[A good
response.];W[ne];B[md]C[This looks like aji-keshi, just jump out and maybe
O16 will become possible later, or other things exploiting the move at P18,
or ...];W[nd];B[lf];W[ng];B[lh];W[ni];B[oh]C[This doesn't really defend your territory, and it makes white's
shape stronger.  You might want a move on the other side later.  P9 is
looking more and more like a
mistake.];W[nh];B[jf];W[he];B[jh];W[ke];B[mf];W[og];B[pg];W[ph]
;B[qh];W[pi];B[qi];W[pj]C[what is white doing here?  black can still cut at
O14, so white got one eye.  I guess white can now link up at Q9 if black
cuts at O14.  OK.];B[bn]C[This is just a territory move, pretty big but
white's group is quite alive already.  LInking up at S7 might be bigger ...

Let's count.  Black has 30 points left side, a few points on the bottom, a
few points on the bottom right, and 15 points upper right, say 50+ total.

White has 5 points upper right, 20 points upper left, and that's about it.
So white is behind in the territory battle.  Where can white get more
territory?  In the center.  Where can black get hurt?  The right side.  In
other words, instead of taking more territory here, since you were already
ahead in territory you should defend the right side now.
S8?];W[dj];B[cj];W[dl];B[di]C[This looks like a thank-you move.  What do
you gain by forcing white to enclose the center?  K10 instead would be
better.];W[ej];B[jj]C[But D11 is sente, OK, so my criticism of it wasn't such a big deal
after all.  You do strengthen white's center with that excchange
(d11-e10)];W[jl];B[ik];W[il];B[gk];W[hl];B[hk];W[fl]C[So white gets about
20 center points, and now the balance of territory is even.  It's a close
game.];B[pk];W[of]C[Good exchange, forcing white to connect while you
eleiminate possible territory at the top.];B[jc]C[This is too aggreesive with your group still weak in the center.
Just defend the right side, gaining territory while doing so, and you'll
have an easy ending.];W[ic];B[kc];W[ib];B[co];W[cm];B[bl];W[bm]

;B[jo];W[jn];B[kp];W[lo];B[om];W[lj]C[I did not see W R10 and tought the group in
middle needs help.How should I have responded.

Defending that hole in the right side a long time ago was big enough to
play (just for territory alone, S8 is a big move, linking the two groups
so you don't have to worry about making eyes for the lower one ... prevents
white R2 from becoming sente, takes another several points right around S8
as well.)

It's true your center group is weak.  Instead of playing the K17 moves, try
moving in a direction that gets them eyes ... H14 looks like a good idea,
or just pushing up at E11 though that can get complicated.  F14 is also
sente.];B[hf];W[gf];B[hg];W[qj];B[rj];W[ri];B[rl];W[qg];B[rh]
;W[rg];B[si];W[pe];B[qf];W[qe];B[rf];W[re];B[sg];W[se]C[you just lost about 15 points there in that exchange ... at
least you got to play S8, that was good (it gained you 5, and you lost 20
in the upper right corner).];B[ie];W[id];B[ge];W[hd];B[gg];W[ff]
C[good to
make eye shape for that center group.];B[nn]C[P6 would threaten to cut, and
then you could still play here in sente too.];W[no]C[I guess now you can
still play P6 too, so O6 was not aji-keshi.  Good.];B[lm];W[km]
;B[fk];W[el]C[My end game is bad.  please point out the better
moves duringend game.];B[fi]C[you need to make life for the center group,
so this is a good endgame move.];W[eg];B[bp]C[this is pretty big too.
White playing here would make bad shape for you and white gains points.
Other big poings: C13, N18, E2.  Which one is biggest?  Here you take away
2 white points and gain one or two for yourself, maybe 4 points total
compared with white playing here.  C13: hard to say how much white gains
around there.  It's certainly a few points in reverse sente (while B4 is
gote), so C13 is bigger than B4.  E2: next you can hane into the corner,
so white loses 2 points and if white goes there first you lose 5 more ...
something around 7 gote points there.  N18: hard to count.  You gain one
point at M17, plus a bunch of threats to take more points ... too hard for
me to evaluate, though.

I'd say E2 is biggest, then C13, then maybe N18, also P2 is worth playing
since if you also get Q2 that's really a lot of edge
points.];W[bg];B[bh];W[ch];B[ag];W[cg]C[That shows C13 was 4 reverse sente points.  SO E2 (7 gote
points) really was not quite biggest.  C13 was bigger (reverse sente
counts double).];B[oo]C[wait!  You need to answer one more time at B11!
Or do you plan to fight that ko?  crazy!];W[nq]C[why does white play here
instead of Q5 atari first?  What am I missing?];B[po]C[wow, this is 12
points gained, minus whatever you lose by letting white play O3, that is
very big gote indeed!  Of course white probably made a mistake here.  And
you still have some bad aji (starting with white throw-in at P6) But B11
....];W[bi];B[ah];W[af];B[ae];W[ai];B[ac];W[af]C[That was also just about 12 gote points, for white to play
B11, so it's actually about an even swap (black lost a little by taking Q5
instead of defending B11)];B[ei];W[fj];B[hi]C[you lose even more points up
here.  The conclusion is that B4 was very small, and even Q5 was not worth
it, compared with defending up here.  C13 first, and even if white goes
first, defend at B11 instead of letting white get all
this.];W[iq];B[jr];W[mm];B[ml];W[mn];B[nl]C[this takes care of that bad aji, but it shows that you really
didn't gain a full 12 points by capturing those 3 stones.];W[er]
C[7 or so
gote points for white, another big move.];B[fr];W[ds];B[nr]
C[in the absence
of white O3, this move could have been one line farther.  This shows the 2+
points you lost here as a result of capturing the 3 stones.

In short, the big endgame issues were C13 (defending that area) and then
B11 (defending after white got the first move) but instead you tried to
take some offense.  When the opponent makes a sente move, answer
it!];W[or];B[mr];W[lb];B[lk];W[kk]C[white shouldn't answer here.  L18 is
bigger.];B[kj];W[li];B[mh];W[nj];B[kb];W[kf]C[this is a small move for
white.];B[mb]C[black gains some points here, but it's too
late.];W[nb];B[la];W[ki];B[ji];W[kg];B[kh];W[jg];B[ig];W[gj]
