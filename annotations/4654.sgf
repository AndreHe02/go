C[trosle [4k?\]: hi
nub [4k\]: hello

To reviewer: I feel that this is one of the better games I have
played and would appreciate if most of the game is reviewed to
see where I can improve. I'm also a bit new to counting, it would
be helpful if you could mark key locations where I should take
a count before making my next move.

Notes have been left at some locations as well but please do
go over things which I do not ask myself as I may have missed
it, thank you.

CommanderW: Hello. I'm your reviewer. I'll call myself CW. I'll
take it for granted that you play White side form your sidenote,
but I'll review for Black side too.
I'm glad that you appreciated the importance of counting territory
to decide how to play. I hope you'll get better with it.];B[pd]
;W[dd];B[dp];W[pp]C[Are there known pro opinions on the cross fuseki? I like to play
games heavy on reading so when I'm white I always invite the
cross fuseki, not sure if this is correct...

CW: Ancient Chinese has this cross-star pattern as the set up
before the game so it's of course reasonable. You can't say that
a move is correct or wrong in such a situation when there are
very few stones on the board, unless you're opening on 1-1 point.
If you prefer fighting, then it's good for you, since naturally
the pattern will lead to some fierce ones. As for pro's opinion,
I don't know, but I took the following quote form Sensei's Library
wrote by Calvin: Takagawa played cross-hoshi as black almost
as much as he played a parallel point, and Ishida Yoshio seems
to have actually favored it.];B[nq];W[lq];B[no];W[pn]
(;B[iq]C[I see that black makes a mistake in joseki or so I believe
I'm not sure if my followup moves are correct.

CW: This move is good, although deviated form joseki. The fighting
is tougher for White, but he already got komi to compensate that.
You played well around here.
Concept: As long is the move is good enough, it doesn't matter
if it's joseki or not, and sticking too much to joseki is a good
way to lose your strength.];W[lo]C[CW: The only move of course.]
;B[nm]
(;W[pl]C[CW: This too is good and the only move.
Concept: Almost never allow your stones to be blocked at the
head (their direction of development). Please underline the word
"almost" too. Every rule has exceptions.];B[io];W[lm];B[nk]
;W[pj]
(;B[cf]C[CW: Black can try to attack White continuously too. but if he's
unsure how it will turn out, tenuki like this is a good idea.
Black has an acceptable framework on the bottom (There is a serious
defect at 3-3, if White invades then she'll get almost as much
territory as Black, but Black isn't worry now since he can block
on C4 side to get useful influence instead. He must watch out
for the potential, however.), a weak group to attack (well, at
least weaker than his own group) and gained sente to play C14
that combines with his lower side strength, he's doing well.]

(;W[fd]TR[dp][io][cf]SQ[lm]C[I'm not sure if this is correct, my thoughts on this was to reduce
the influence that the triangled stones will emit and at the
same time make it easier for the squared stone to connect. Or
is it better to play F17 with the b stone at Q16?

CW: The framework Black threats to make is serious, you must
upset
Black's plan no matter what. It's more important here than worrying
about the squared group. As I've said, you've got komi to compensate
your disadvantages about that group. This move almost doesn't
reduce Black's lower influence at all. I think if White had lost,
I can call this the losing move.
For your question, both
moves are playable, though you must play around the upper side
after F16, otherwise a Black attack at H17 will be severe. In
this game though, Black's framework become too serious and thus
in
reality White has no time to play in the upper side (though I
see you did that). So I prefer F17 between these two moves.]

(;B[cj]C[CW: A one line but huge mistake. The scale of Black's moyo has
reduced dramatically. Moreover, White now has C12 in his disposal.
Concept: Play on the fourth line for large frameworks.]
(;W[nc]C[CW: Oh...I can't understand this move at all, does White really
want to give it all to Black? It's a quarter of the board!]

(;B[qf]C[Not sure if this was the correct direction of play...

CW: Of course not. Black missed his second chance to wrap up
the game.];W[jc]C[CW: Again, you must care about the framework.]
;B[cc]C[CW: This is the fourth move by both players that show no interest
in 40-50 points framework. I think I'll not saying anything more
about it for the moment.];W[cd];B[bd]
(;W[dc]C[Unsure if the alternative at B15 is better...

CW: It's of course better.];B[bb];W[cb];B[bc];W[oq]C[This seemed like a good move

CW: I don't know. You gained something in this move but if Black
plays correctly, he gains something too. I don't know which side
gains in the exchange.]
(;B[nr]C[CW: This move makes White P3 really good.];W[lk];B[ni]

(;W[qh]C[CW: This move is way too small! You're already perfectly alive,
why claim for such small territory? If you say you want to attack
Black, I think he isn't in that much trouble since your left
side group is unstable too.];B[cp]C[This hurt :( I was planning to play there soon

CW: You have had a lot chances. Now let's do some counting. In
counting, we count the minimum points possible plus potential.
Black
has 24 points on the lower left corner, 5 in upper left, 4 for
his two groups on the right side (two eyes each) plus loads of
potential on the left side. I don't know how much that's really
worth, but it's safe to assume at least 15 points there, so Black
already has 49 points in the pocket. White's upper side still
has defects so I'll give it only 9 points (6 on left+3 on right),
2 for his center group and 22 for his right side, plus komi then
it's 39.5 points. Moreover, Black has much more potential than
White, he can still expand his territory everywhere while White's
territory can only be reduced (with his center group, it's hard
to collect all of the upper side or invade Black's framework).
Black's safely leading, if he just play to secure his groups
(but not too slackly) then he wins easily.];W[pb]C[CW: Good move. Now White's only chance is to try to attack, though
I must say it's unlikely to success.]
(;B[nd]C[CW: This move helps White. Just closing 3-3 is enough, White
still has to worry about his M17 defect.];W[md];B[ne];W[qc]
C[Not sure if n16 was correct...

CW: It is. You must gain sente to occupy 3-3. Now that White's
points almost catch up with Black, he must now watch his steps.]
;B[oc]C[CW: Nice probe.];W[nb]
(;B[me]C[CW: Bad style. Black's just helping White to fix his defect.
Concept: Any unneccessary move is a bad move. The exchange between
the moves in extra-important. The result of a game of Go is the
result of the exchanging of each move.];W[ld]C[CW: Before this, Black can aim at M16, M17 or, if the situation
guarantees it, even N17. Now all of them has gone.];B[qq]C[CW: Nice probe. If White cuts, Black can devastate his capitol
at any time he wants. If White lets Black connect, he can attack
form the other direction.];W[qp]
(;B[or]C[CW: Not the joseki at all. Moreover, it's timing is wrong.]

(;W[pq]C[CW: Playable, though risky. White is defying Black to attack
his group, she hopes to counterattack in the course.];B[pr]
C[CW: Ew, dubious one. You can make more profit later by descending
to R2.];W[qr]
(;B[im]C[CW: Not pressuring White enough.];W[li];B[ng]
(;W[fq]C[Is this the correct place to invade?

CW: The game is lost for White. If you think of it as a desperate
do-or-die move, I can't blame it. But logically, you should invade
on the wider side to have more breathing space.];B[eq];W[hq]
C[CW: Nice try.];B[ir];W[fo]
(;B[fr]C[CW: Better to attack whole, even without killing this group,
Black wins easily. This move gives White a chance for complications.]
;W[gr]C[CW: Nice.];B[fp]
(;W[hp]C[CW: This is your chance to start the flower-viewing ko. That
is, you stand to lose next-to-nothing (only exchanged H3 to J2),
but if Black loses, hopes spring up for White.];B[ip];W[gm]
C[Not sure if this entire invasion sequence was correct];B[gq]
C[CW: Nice, calm move. White gains a little in this fight, she's
got G7 and F5 stone for free, she's also able to cut Black later,
though that's very far-fetched chance. Black's only gain is the
J2 stone.];W[gp];B[fq]
(;W[hr]C[CW: I've just said it's not the time for the cut! Before this,
your G7 stone is very light, you can discard it anytime. Now
it becomes heavy group. Having two undisposable group like this
never bodes well. Moreover, I see some tesuji coming. If you
want to cut, you must exchange H6 for J6 first.]
(;B[fn]C[CW: Black missed his chance to play a beautiful tesuji.]
;W[hn]C[CW: Nice counterattack.];B[in];W[fm]C[CW: The exchange of F6 for F7 is now very bad for Black.]
;B[en];W[gn];B[ik];W[gj];B[ii];W[hl];B[il]C[CW: Hurt your right side group. You may want to play K8 or J8
later if the situation is proper.
Concept: Any unneccessary move is a bad move. Keep your options
open as much as possible.];W[jj];B[ij]
(;W[gh]C[CW: I think your right side group is in much more danger. It's
cramped against Black's two walls. Your left side group still
has many breathing space.]
(;B[le]C[CW: Huge mistake, White needn't to answer this move. After seeing
the game further, I think this move is Black's main cause of
loss. It's the losing move.
Concept: A leaning attack is about leaning in sente against opponent's
other groups to help attacking the target. This move is gote,
so it's no good.];W[kg]C[CW: Now the situation is really unclear.]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[ig];W[jf]C[CW: Now Black must watch this group closely or it may die. This
is miraculous for White.];B[ln];W[mn];B[kn];W[mo];B[mp]C[CW: Unneccessary.]
;W[lp];B[mm];W[nn]C[CW: Now White can kill Black's lower right group with another
move. Please note that if she doesn't, Black can still live.]
;B[ll]
(;W[ke]C[CW: With Black's so many slack moves, White can now win the game
by just connecting his center-left group to safety. Killing the
lower right and saving the center-right group is somewhat almost
miai (two eqivalent ways).]
(;B[ls]C[CW: It's the golden opportunity to counterattack!]

(;W[lr]C[I see my mistake here :( I have included the variation I believe
to be correct

CW: Yes, you can cut and kill, but why? This too is your golden
opportunity to win safely.];B[ks];W[ci]C[I am looking for a move to reduce the left side, it took me awhile
to decide on this one. My thought process for it even I am unsure
of lol

CW: There's no need to reduce the left side, White has won the
game! You can't just counting, you must use what you counted
to decide how to play too.];B[dj];W[df]C[CW: Folks, this is very complicated.]

formation like this, the corner is larger than the side. Invade
anywhere on the side and Black can just enclose a huge 20+ points
corner easily. This is true even if the black stones on the lower
side is nearer than this, say, H3 or G3. Moreover,  if White
invade on the left side then he has two weak groups but this

like to play.];B[ef];W[fd];B[dl]C[CW: Now I don't know what will happen next, but at any rate both

no man's land in the game. Moreover, the Black group is now settled
(no more worries) and the corner group now has problems. Black
can aim at several points in very near future (R3, R5 for example).

she'll just help Black to strengthen his group and his potential
on the right side. In short, this is terrible for White.]))
