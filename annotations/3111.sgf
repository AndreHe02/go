C[Hello,
I play Black. Any comment is welcome :)];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
;B[fc];W[dg]
(;B[cc]C[Here, I wonder if it is better just to play at D18. I want to play C17 because of the extension W made.

I think you can treat White's weakness calmly. See variation.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]
(;W[fb]C[This is bad. White can get a much better result with e17. See variation.]
;B[cd]
(;W[de]C[Because of White's mistake at f18, he can no longer hane here. See variation.]
;B[bg];W[ce];B[be]C[W move seems a little bit aji-keshi to me.

I agree.];W[jd];B[oc];W[mc]C[White is crowding himself here. He has a very limitted moyo because Black can easily start a reduction with, for example, g15.]
;B[qk]C[Very good.];W[qf]C[Too close. White is inviting attack, because Black is strong on both sides.]
;B[qh];W[of];B[jp]TR[qh][qk]C[I prefered to play here so as to have better structure when W plays around Q6, since my East group is rather strong now. I'm not very confident, though :)

Yes! It's good!];W[qo]C[It would probably be safer for White to play on the fourth line, where running away or switching to the bottom side are easier.]
;B[np]C[This lets him off too easily. p5 or q5 would be better.]
;W[qm];B[qq]C[S3 would be slightly bigger, and a stronger attack.]
;W[om]C[Black is looking weak. Q14 is one of the weaknesses of the one-point jump White made with p14. Perhaps  Black can play it now. See var at next move.]

(;B[ok];W[oh]C[everything worked as planned, but still i don't know what to do ...]
;B[rf]C[This move abandons r9 and p9. Instead, you should play q11 to keep you group strong and allow you to attack White's group below effectively.]
;W[qe];B[re];W[qi];B[qg];W[pd];B[pc];W[pi]C[I am rather happy with the result. W made many mistakes in this sequence, what should i have done if she hadn't ?

You should not be happy. I can not see any obvious mistakes by White. White would be happy that he has isolated two of your stones.

Now there are two weak groups next to each other. You must straight away attack the White group, because in the process, Black will get stronger. If you ignore the situation, White will attack, making himself stronger.]

(;B[fq]
(;W[dm]C[You are both ignoring the most important area. A move like White o8 or n7 would be devestating right now.]
;B[lk]C[Finally];W[hp]C[h4 is a classically bad move. When invading betwwen stones on the third and fourth line that are three spaces apart (f3 and k4), you should use the third line (h3), not the fourth line (h4).

White should, of course, be defending the three stones around q6.]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[ip];W[gq];B[hr];W[gp];B[gr]C[Correct sequence by Black.]
;W[fp]
(;B[fr]C[This is too small. N7 would be much better. See variation.]
;W[eq];B[mm]C[O8 would probably be better, because it keeps you connected while attacking. Here, White has the chance to attack back.]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[nk];B[nj];W[oj]C[Disaster.];B[km]C[Is the sacrifice that good for me?

Very bad for you. L7 is good shape locally, though.];W[ne];B[jh]
C[A little too far away from the edge for an invasion, but a little too far away from the Black group for a reduction (how would you handle White l11 or l10?)]

(;W[ck]C[This leaves b13 access to the middle. White c11 would be better, closing Black in.]

(;B[cq]C[It's too early for this. Remember, White e2 (stopping this invasion) would be gote, and your invasion is gote also. Black c12, g17 would probably be bigger.]
;W[dr];B[cr];W[cp];B[bp]C[Maybe B4 was a little bit too greedy. Is the variation better for W than the actual game ?

I don't think so.];W[bo];B[ap]
(;W[ar]
(;B[er]C[Seems to let White have a ko. See variation.];W[dq]
;B[ds];W[es];B[fs];W[bs];B[br]
(;W[ao]C[See variation, where White gets a ko.];B[bq];W[ig]
C[Very, very big move.];B[ri];W[rj];B[rh];W[rk]C[Just like f18, it should be at r10.]
;B[hk]C[Probably better at c12. The territory you try to enclose here is open at two sides (towards h4 area and towards p14 area), so it will be very hard to close off.]
;W[jg];B[dh]C[D12 shouldn't have work I think. Where should i have played ? C12 better ?

C12 would have been my thought, but let's see if White could have cut d12 off...]

(;W[cg];B[ch];W[eh];B[nb]
(;W[mb];B[rp]C[This does not really have to be responded to. Why not try n19 instead?]
;W[ro]
(;B[ei]C[Perhaps this leaves too many cutting points? Even if White responds with f11, This are is not really where you want to be playing, because with h9 there already, no one will be able to get territory here. Perhaps m12 would have been better, making some territory.]

;B[cj];W[ih];B[dk];W[bm];B[fk];W[fm];B[fh];W[eg];B[gh]C[You made some profit here that White should not have allowed.]
;W[fg];B[dl];W[cl];B[ma];W[la];B[na];W[kb]C[Yes. It is gote and small.]

(;B[pe]C[My move seems bad to me (see variation). Am i right ?

No. I think otherwise White could capture.];W[pf];B[od];W[oo]
;B[no];W[qp];B[rq];W[op];B[oq];W[hm]C[The area around m12 is bigger.]

If he plays at C or further away, he still leaves you the invasion at A, and he is still leaving all his stones on one side of the board and giving you sente to make all your stone work together.

Yet White can not tenuki to try to settle things elsewhere, because he has no move that you would have to respond to (not even White D).]
