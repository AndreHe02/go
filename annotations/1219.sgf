C[This is my first game from a tournament held by my club.  I took
black and gave white a .5 komi.  Both of us are around the 5
kyu level, but white usually beats me.  I tend to play better
in the opening then make a mistake and lose later in the game.
Any comments for black or white would be appreciated.  Thanks.

a: my name is aaron, i'm about 1d. i hope my comments help you.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[dd];B[jp]C[I wanted to start san ren sei]
;W[nq]C[Not sure if this is the right attack for white since I can pin
him in and build my territory?

a: white usually approaches from the outside, r6 is probably most common.

o3 allows black to attack immediately];B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[kq]
;B[jq];W[jr];B[ir];W[lr]C[This sequence 7 through 14 is pretty much what I expected and
I am happy to have a good hold on the bottom right corner and
maybe good moyo on the left and I still have sente.  Not real
sure what to do next....so

a: i think that i would atari at k1here, it keeps pressure on white and you wont have to worry about this point in the endgame.]
;B[dk]LB[iq:a]C[I anticipate a weak point at position 'A' so I play 15 to one
extend my moyo and cover my cutting point at 'a' with a ladder
blocking move... so far I like my chances

a: i think this move is too slow. it is too close to your other stones and you have still not developed on the top of the board.

like i said before i think atari at k1 first is best. h3 after k1 would be pretty solid.

to expand the moyo i would probably go ahead and go one space up to d10.

and as a note, the ladder at k3 is good for you until white plays a block around d9.]
;W[cn]C[I assume white sees my large moyo and attacks I am not sure how
to cuunter attack]
(;B[dn]C[I choose 17 to pin him down and hope to make D-J a large territory
plus the lower left corner. I also considered someing like the
above variation.

a: i tend to like your variations a bit better because you already have a pincer to attack with]
;W[dm];B[en];W[cl]C[Now I am a little stuck.  white seems to have made shape there
and now I have to be concerned about d9.  I tried to figure out
a local play to solidify my position, but I tend to make overplays
in an area and I figured that I had the upper hand still so I
choose to use sente to play in upper right corner... any suggestions
on better play in local area that presses white and still lets
me have sente?

a: i think c5 here is a very big move, it takes the corner and keeps white uncomfortable. if white doesnt reply to that it could be trouble.]
;B[nc];W[nd];B[md];W[ne]
(;B[lc]C[
a: this isn't a normal move for black. i think p17 or q17 could be better here. see variations for a couple of examples.]
;W[oc]C[
a: p17 is a good move for white];B[qg]C[not sure if this is the right place to play I just wanted to
prevent any large white moyo on the upper right.

a:  i think this is a bit too close to white's strong shape. it might be better to just go to r10, or help the three stones on top.]
;W[qk]C[Is this a good play for white? I anticipated that If I played
something like r13 that he would try to pincer me, and considered
playing somewhere closer to r10 but then I though it might be
nice if he jumps in then I can attack him and build my wall while
he is defending.  When we play white generally makes overly strong
agressive fighting moves and hopes that I make a mistake....which
I usually do.

a: we all know how that goes :). if white doesnt go here black has an excellent move at q10. it's hard for me to say which move is the best globally, but this move seems ok locally since white is strong at the top.

my only concern would be how the continuation affects the white group on the bottom.]
;B[pj]C[Okay not sure about this I really don't know how to properly
attack a stone like r9 so I went with the assumption that r13
is weak and I need to strengthen it.

a: i would prefer r11 here to q10, r11 is better for making a base and keeps white from pushing in that direction.]
;W[rm]C[Is there a better move for white here?

a: these situations are tough even for me. (or maybe especially for me :) ). it takes a lot of reading and the right move depends on the actual whole board situation.  my instinct would have been to push out at q10 and up at p9, or even to peep at r5.  white's continuation is at least careful not to hurt the m2 group too much.]
;B[ro]C[this felt weak, but I needed to defend the corner

a: this seems like a very good move to me, black must protect the corner.]
;W[pk];B[oj];W[ri];B[qi]C[again this feels weak, but I was beginning to worry about the
q11 group];W[rh];B[qh];W[qj]C[Is whites play here necessary could he play somewhere else, now
black has sente

a: i think white needs to reinforce, this move seems ok.];B[re]
C[but is 39 really the best usage of my sente.  just thought that
I should reduce that corner while I have a chance and would probably
still retain sente.];W[rd];B[qd]C[I think this is probably a stupid move on my part,  I played
it without really thinking but I thought that I saw a way to
still the corner

a: well things can get tricky here but it seems to me that white will come out on top, the reason for this is because black can't play p18 because white will atari with o18.]
;W[qe];B[qc];W[rf];B[pe];W[qf];B[pc];W[od];B[ob]C[this is pretty much the move sequence that I expected white to
follow so I thought that my guess worked but later I find that
the corner is not really mine (see the next alternative sequence)

a: yes this didnt seem to work too well for black.]
(;W[of]C[Seemed weak by white but

a: hmm, i would probably take advantage of o18 right away.]
;B[oh]C[I feel that I must protect my stones with 51

a: well it is good shape, i just wonder if it would be better to connect the stones on top.

its a tough choice. even though you have five stones there already and it seems like you dont wan't to lose them, but the stones are not as important because they do not cut white. white is connected and settled.]
;W[bp]C[white 52 makes me feel sick that I didn't finish off that area
earlier

a: this is a big move by white, but i would be a little worried about the group on the bottom. p2 is a good move for both black and white.]
;B[cq];W[bq];B[rc]C[I use my sente here to try to protect the weakness in my corner

a: that is pretty big];W[se];B[pb];W[cj]C[This seem to be a weak play by white, but honestly I don't think
I really understand what is going on in the area of d9??

a: f17 might be bigger for white.];B[fc]C[so I ignore what I don't under stand and attack the last open
corner

a: f17 is also a good move for black!

it might be a good time to make some forcing moves against the white group at the bottom like p2 and k1.]
;W[hd];B[fe]C[didn't think very much about 61 just felt like the right thing
to do, spilt up the stones and see which one white protected

a: this seems like the right idea to me];W[hf]C[okay was 62 the right move for white?

a:  i think d14 or c14 would be better for white.];B[cc]C[and was 63 really the right way to attack the white stone in
the upper left corner?

a: i think white came out slightly ahead in the sequence to black 86, but i really couldn't come up with anything better.]

(;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[ef]C[these moves are much like I expected.. I figured on giving up
the two lone black stones but wanted to threaten to let them
escape to build my territory and squeeze white];B[ib];W[hb]
;B[ic];W[hc];B[db];W[eb];B[bb];W[da];B[cb];W[ec]C[my plan has seemed to work okay so far]
;B[cg];W[df];B[gg]C[again I threatend to let them escape];W[gf]
;B[fg];W[ff];B[hg]C[with 87 I get a little worried about the 3 stone group sort of
floating in the middle and wonder what white will do next

a: i think black can do better than h13];W[fl]C[white plays over in the area that I really don't understand too
much

a: white is about 10 points behind give or take. this seems like a reasonable move because it aims at invading your area of influence at the bottom while at the same time casting a glance at the three black stones above. the only problem is that your d9 stone is in an annoying spot.]
;B[gk]C[I tried to think out different sequences here but it seemed very
confused and hard to figure out so I played 89 to build a little
space for my black group

a: this seems ok to me];W[ej]TR[ok][gi][kh]C[White 90 just feels too weak... he has made a lot of plays in
that area and is not really making much territory and after a
quick scan of the board and with all four corners for black I
really feel like I can win this game.


a: as white i woul probably push at f9 and then go from there

my ideas for black here would be g11, o9, or somewhere in between your two center groups. you could even possibly take territory with p2 and b2 and let the stones fend for themselves.]
;B[fj]C[91 seems weak... during this sort of transition phase of the
game I am at a loss as to what kind of play to make.];W[ei]
;B[fi];W[mg]C[94 seems weak but yea I get the idea that he is trying to split
me.... is there a better play for white here

a: white still has a weakness because of d9, but black might not be able to use it because of j3. (see variation)

concerning the white move, i don't think it is very good. it seems to aim at attacking both center groups, but doesn't attack either one very well. because of p12 the black group on the right is pretty strong. this move doesn't take any territory either.

an alternative for white might be to connect at e7 then attack the middle or invade the bottom.  o2/p2 and c2/b2 are also prett big.]
;B[if]C[I play 95 in a hopes to insure that I can connect to the living
group on the top...];W[ie];B[jf];W[mk]SQ[mg]C[with 98 I now get a little worried about my group and white marked
stone seems like a much better play but I figure that I will
still be able to live or run away

a: yes you can still live fairly easily, this is why n13 wasnt really a great move.]
;B[mj];W[lj]C[now I am getting just a little bit worried and start spendin
a lot more time thinking out the sequences.];B[mi];W[li];B[mh]
;W[lh];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk];W[ml];B[nl];W[jk];B[ng];W[mf];B[je]
C[Any comments on that sequence... am I alive right now unconditionally?

a: yes but it looks like white is getting closer.];W[eg]C[
a: this doesn't seem useful to me. white should take a big point.]
;B[ij];W[gn]C[This move of white 116 really irks me it is in the area that
I really didn't understand and now it seems to really hurt the
size of my territory.];B[gp]C[I think this was pretty weak, but I think that I am still ahead
and change my strategy to play moves that will lock in the win
for me.

a: at this point it seems like white might be able to get away with h6, so black h4 seems ok to me.

white is getting closer ..];W[cr]C[ouch!! I really didn't realize just how many points that was
worth for white I should have taken that corner much earlier
and in just a couple of moves I lost lots of territory.

a: yes, really big];B[dr];W[cp]C[
a: this destroys the aji of the peep at f3 though.];B[dq];W[br]
;B[om]C[not sure about black 123 I was still kind of worried about the
group on the middle left side

a: i could be wrong but you look alive to me.   if white played inside you have this move in reserve. if white plays outside you can either play outside too or live inside.

o2 is still big, b11 is pretty big.];W[mn];B[jn]C[I play 125 to prevent white building territory in the middle]
;W[km]C[but he still gets some];B[bi]C[I liked this play... was it okay?

a: yes, imagine the difference between that and white c12!]
;W[bj];B[qq]C[okay I guess this probably was not a good play... I figured that
I was still ahead and wanted to play very conservatively to lock
in the win but eventually I play to easy and white fights back
to win.

a: this move is very costly, because you have s5 in place and you are also connected to another living group, you should be able to easily kill any attempt by white to live on the inside. just o2!]

C[okay I'm playing too weak but I still figure I'm ahead by like
10 pts.

a: hmm i think its closer than that, here is how i count. both sides have about 60 points plus or minus a couple. black is slightly ahead and has sente.]
;B[em]C[seems like an okay attack];W[el];B[fm];W[dl];B[fk]C[was this the right place to play... I got myslef a little lost
here

a: too bad, black k8 or k7 looks like you can get a few points.]
;W[im]C[now white can escape];B[hn];W[gm];B[go]C[okay again a weak defensive play with no initiative]
;W[ek]C[ahhh I think I should have played that];B[hm];W[gl]
;B[hl]C[
a: since the black group in the center is connected, it is probably better to take some big moves on the side.

k1 and d11 look biggest to me.];W[ds]C[damn.. more points lost to white]
;B[es];W[cs]C[

a: hmm... does j1 or k1 work here instead of connecting?   don't limit yourself to the normal moves, always try to think if there is a better way!]

(;B[er];W[is]C[again];B[hr]C[was this the right   a: i think its okay to play h1 then connect]
;W[ia];B[jb]C[again maybe not the right play

a: this might be best here.];W[sc];B[sb];W[sd];B[rb];W[bh];B[bg]
;W[ci];B[ah];W[ai];B[ag];W[ji]C[damn.. now with those end game moves white moves ahead... but
during the game I figured it was about even

C[I thought I saw a trick play here to catch white but I was wrong

a: NO YOU WERE RIGHT!!!   my heart jumps out of my chest when i see situations like this come into play. this is a situation which can occur quite frequently and knowing this tesuji can win games for you!

I recommend reading "Tesuji" by James Davies.

white should s8 here];W[rn]C[
a: see the variation]

(;B[oi]C[move 237 is not necessary and now I am in trouble]

is but i couldnt find it?

but in game review I see tha I was behind anyway];W[nf];B[ko]
;W[fn];B[fo];W[no];B[on];W[me];B[ke];C[and with that I lose again to white... I think white always makes
overly aggressive attacks too me early in the game and I usually
tend to play well against him in fuseki, but he gets by with
these plays because I cannot properly counter attack him and
usually make a reading mistake.  Also... I really have never
studied the end game...I though it was not necessary and boring,
but if I had I probably could have won this game and many more...
any good advice for studying endgame
Thanks


I think you could have secured your lead by being a little more forceful with the white group at the bottom, though the game was lost in the endgame.   To improve i would recommend first reading a tesuji book, and after that moving on to an endgame book.    I hope I helped and didn't just confuse you, best of luck!]
