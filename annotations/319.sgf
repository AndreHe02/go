;B[qd]C[Hello everyone,
This review was requested by black. I will try to do my best to pin point to some critical steps in the game...

sita: And the commenter requested a comment on his comments, which were done by me and indicated by the 'sita:' sign in front of my comments.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[oc]C[I will be making comments for both W and B.

What we generally see, is a sequence where W goes takes the fourth corner. In this case, W play on one of Black's corner to stop him from making a corner enclosure.

It's fine...];B[pf];W[dd]C[AFter W takes his corner, ...
See variation.]
(;B[qn];W[lc]
(;B[pj]LB[pc:A][jp:B]TR[pq][qn]C[Black choses to solidify right side, which is fine...

sita: The two marked stones are pointing towards the left, so I think a move around 'B' is better, here.



B has to option of making W overconcentrated by playing at 'A' Q17. (see variation). When W reponds, he his stone at M17 should have been at L17. That would be the good shape. In this shape M17 is close to the 2 W stones.

sita: Very good hint for the black player. The two stone extension is easy to recognize and (at his playing strength) it is almost always good make this shape overconcentrated by playing 'A'.]
;W[nj]TR[dj][jp]C[This W move doesn't help any of the other stones on the border.   Would be better on the other marked locations.

sita: Yes, a caping move like the one above is only possible, if the b stone would be on the third line. (That was probably what w had seen in games from stronger players and what he was immitating.)]
;B[jq]LB[dj:A]C[In this case, I would play on the left in the middle of W. Just to in a large sense split W.

sita: But as I pointed out two moves before, I like this move much better. Even better (more balanced) would be a move at the fourth line. To play around 'A' looks a bit unambitiously.]
;W[gq];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc]
(;W[cd];B[dc];W[bd]C[Was white 18 strange?  Shouldn't it have been at B17?]
;B[ed];W[df];B[ee]C[I was thinking this was slow and I should have extended out along
17.

Well, it may kind of be considered as a forcing move...   But you could definitely play f17

sita: definitely, I think so, too. But on the other hand I like the actual move, because it spots the weakness in w's position.]
;W[fc];B[hc];W[gd];B[eb]TR[ec]C[this move had to connect at E17,.]
;W[gf];B[gb];W[ec];B[fb];W[ef];B[jd];W[jf]LB[co:A]C[W should have played on the left side. W was planning to either claim a huge area in the middle and left or trying to keep B in. But it is not possible to do any of these with this move.

sita: Indeed, this move is more or less dame. 'A' would eg. be a good choice.]
;B[he]
(;W[ge]C[could be played at the marked location. see other variation..

sita: And the variation is at least consistent with move #32.]
;B[hf];W[hg];B[le];W[jb];B[gc];W[fd];B[hd];W[qc];B[pd];W[pc]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[ck];W[en]C[B was to the first to play on the left. If W had played there before Black, it would be very difficult for Black.]
;B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[cg];B[gg]C[I thought this was pretty good, but I lose it later.]
;W[ff];B[gh];W[hh];B[gi]C[it is good till now.];W[hi]C[Here, I should have connected the two groups of stones instead
of playing G5 which meant nothing in the game.];B[go]LB[gj:a]
TR[hi][hh][hg][gf]C[yes you are right. playing at G5 does not give you anything. you should have continued playing in that region. playing at 'a' would be good.

'a' serves 2 purposes. 1) connects your stones with two 2 at D11/12. 2) Keeps pressure on the W group in the middle.

sita: Perfectly correct. Furthermore three stones in a row which are surrounded by enemy stones like the w marked stones, are very vulnarable and should nearly always be extended.]
;W[gj]C[Is there any way to save the three stones?]
(;B[cj];W[fi];B[fh]C[sita: I think, this is a very important mistake to mention. White can set black into atari with his next move an black can't do anything to escape from this atari. This is fairly easy to see, even for a weaker player. Ommiting such mistakes would help a great deal.]
;W[eh];B[ei]C[sita: Again, this move does not work and does not do anything good (but wasting a ko threat). It is very important for a player of b's strength to learn to ommit such moves.]
;W[fg];B[fj]C[sita: And again. B has to learn to change plans, when they show to be unreasonable. This move is really worthless without the just captured stones in place.]
;W[ek];B[dj]C[The last few B moves were not helping in any way...

sita: Yes :)];W[cm];B[bm];W[dm];B[cl];W[bj];B[bk];W[bf]C[Was this necessary now?
Something around N3 looks good for white to me.

You are right!

W lost sente. The last 2 white moves were definitely not necessary. Actually the same is true for the 2 moves coming before them. Afger B connected at D10, W could go for N3.

Q8 and Q12 are other points for W but N3 looks better.];B[bo]
;W[co]C[Why C5?  I would have played white at B4.

so would i :)

sita: And me :)];B[bp];W[bq];B[bi]C[I don't think I needed to take this stone.  Maybe it wasn't worth
enough now.  There are probably bigger places to play...

OF Course! Weren't you the one mentioning of N3? You should have played at N4 (not N3).]
;W[ip];B[mp]
(;W[pl]C[sita: Not deep enough, see variation.];B[ql]
(;W[pk]C[sita: Mistake, see the standard sequence in the variation.]
;B[qk];W[pn]
(;B[po]CR[oj]C[here P 10 (marked place) would be better I think... see variations...

It attempts to cut W, enforces B formation towards Q14.

And then, you could come back for Q5 after this P10, P9 exchange.  (Actually W could respond with O8 which is better.

sita: Don't agree, see variation.];W[on];B[li]LB[kn:a][ln:b]
[oj:c]C[I felt I needed to invade this center white was developing...
but is this the best way?

Well, i guess not... i would use  'a' or 'b'.   maybe later consider extending from top.

sita: I would start a sente-sequence at 'C', reducing w's moyo while building own territory. After that a move around 'B' would still be possible]

;B[mk];W[nm];B[no];W[im]C[Why white here?  Wouldn't it be better to play at L8?

He was thinking of blocking the connection of M9 stones with G5... He did not want to lose all that area.

sita: Yes, something like this. Again b's very small move was not answered. B lost a lot in the last moves.]

C[I lost a lot of points in those center stones.  What could I
have done better?];B[jm]C[As for the rest of the game.  Are there any points that I really
missed in the end game?  This game was close, only 5.5 points,
so I was wondering if I could have taken those in the end game
and I missed it.];W[il];B[kn]C[Actually yes, i noticed very big moves that each side missed.]
;W[mm];B[ko];W[lm];B[km]C[now B lost sente :(];W[in]TR[rc][bc]
[aq]C[W gave big points here....

Let's look at the board now. and find the points. Now it is the end game. Groups are well defined but the borders are not.

I will just mark the areas bu Triangles. They do not represent moves. Because the appropriate move changes depending on who plays there and the investigation of sente/gote.

sita: IMO a very good and helpful analysis for the players. Again, see my last comment.]
;B[nd];W[nc];B[md];W[mc]C[These two moves helped W to get a solid top. And B got no territory for those moves.  B should have played at S17 for example.]
;B[bc]C[good.
W could play at B18.];W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[lf]LB[if:a]C[B should have played at J14.]
;W[ig];B[ni];W[mj];B[jc];W[kc];B[ib];W[al];B[ak]SQ[bh]C[??

C[sita: Well, where is the second eye? This should be easy enough to see. B needs a little bit confidence in his reading ability. B should not play moves like this any longer. He should not fear to lose a game due to such ommitted moves. What is a lost game against the leraning potential which lies in a good reading!]
;W[sq];B[sp];W[ro];B[so];W[os];B[ps];W[mr]LB[mq:A][nr:B]C[sita: Again, it is very easy to see that there is no threat. 'A' would be answered with 'B'.]

;B[kh];W[ih];B[ag];W[af];B[ne];W[dl];B[dk]C[Any overall comments of the game?  The beginning, middle, end?
Things I need to work on?  Thanks.

The only meaningful suggestion I can have for you is to look at the whole board and try to identify the most important points to play...

There were very small points that were played when there were huge points waiting on the board. A bit more careful look could easily change a game drastically...

sita: Mh, correct, but we would all get stronger if we would play more important and bigger points, right? To me, your comment seems to be a bit too general. The crucial question is, how to identify the big moves. One advice, which is maybe a little bit more practical, would be, to hold yourself back from time to time and have a look at the whole board and ask yourself, if there is nothing bigger going on, appart from the actual flow of the play.

But when I comment a game, i try to find one or two points, which I feel the player had not understood and illustrate them with some examples. Of course it is of some help, to show some different tactical or strategical variants throughout the game, but really important are these concepts that are not understood well. The concepts you show should be the easiest ones you find missing, because only these could be understood by the player.

The b player of the actual game should IMO try not to play stupid moves. That means, moves which he could identify of being worthless or even contraproductive in a second or two. To say it more simple: He has to learn to read! One possibility to do this is, to ask yourself: "Will this work?", every time you want to play a move in a critical situation. Another possibilty is, to have a second look at a situation which just went wrong, replay it in mind and ask yourself "Why hadn't I foreseen this one or two moves earlier?"

Examples of this you can find throughout the game: #63 ff, #111, #121, #239 ff, etc. You will find more examples if you go through the game.

A completly different matter is move #9. The two space extension is a very simple to recognize pattern and the possibility to make it over-concentrated is something b can and should learn.

These two comments are the only ones which I would give to him in general. If he remembers only this, it should help him a great deal. Normally I won't give more than two final comments, because otherwise the student won't probably remember any of them. Finding one or two key points is normaly enough.]
