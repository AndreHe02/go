C[Hello.  My name is Joe, and I'll be reviewing this game.  I've been playing go off-and on for the last year, and am around 17k - 16K.  I hope you find my comments useful.

On the note of plays in the beginning, make sure you keep an eye out for the larger plays, and not get stuck on small point plays.  (See bottom right corner in game)]
;B[qc];W[eq];B[co];W[po]TR[qc][co][eq]C[(Joe) - I must say, I've nev er seen a game start like this.  Although the 3x3 point can be played first, it is ussually considered too defensive.  Likewise, the 5x3 and 5x4 points (white's plays) are a little loose.  There's nothing wrong with that, it's just a different style of playing, but generally the 4x4 or 4x3 points are good starters.  The others are either more for territory and no influence, or abandon the corner in hopes of large influence.

Also, the shap in the bottom left is strange.  It needed a response from white, since the play by black wasn't a good response.  However, if white ignores it (like he did), then it's as if black had the corner and white attacked it, so black should now be able to make a good play.  I would say that C4 is the best play for white here (D3 for black).

*Note - I'll try to keep my comments short.];B[qp];W[pp];B[qq]
;W[pq];B[qr];W[pr];B[qs];W[ps]C[(Joe) - The chain on the wall there is not nearly as important as the open corner, in my opinion.  Those last eight moves werre small in compairison to D16.]
;B[go]C[(Joe) - Still the open corner, and this play is a little loose for black.  White could have broken it up or still solidified his corner with C4, although that play is a little less good now.  Looks kinda bad for white.]
;W[dd]C[(Joe) - Good!  That corner needed a move.  Also, K4 is a big play for white, since it builds off the influence.  R5 is good too because it keeps black from getting much more of the side and strengthen's white's influence.]
;B[cc]C[(Joe) - the usual response is to play touching black (see var).  Playing the 3x3 point is ok in some cases, but ussually not this early, because if played properly, white ends up with a huge influence!  (see var)]

;W[ei];B[fc];W[eb];B[db]
(;W[da];B[ca];W[ea];B[fb];W[dj];B[bi]C[(Joe) - Up until this move all the plays were very tight.  Generally, if you play a little looser in the beginning you can end up with larger territory.  But don't play too lose.  A good rule of thumb is to play a one or two point jump or knights move, unless you have a large enough influence to support a larger jump.  Also, play alnog the 3rd and 4th lines to secure territory and the 4th and 5th lines to secure outward influence.]
;W[bj];B[cj];W[ck]TR[bj][dj]C[(Joe) - This shape is bad if left unaided.]

;B[cg]C[(Joe) - Wasted move by black, white should take advantage of it.]
;W[pc]TR[oc][pd]C[(Joe) - Too close.  In general, your first play shouldn't be touching, because it puts you at a disadvantage.]

Likewise, the white formation from O19 to T10 was still alive, since it has two eyes.  Most of the mistakes were due to playing trivial points or chasing black around the board by playing touching moves.  

My advise is to study life/death problems online and to practice more on smaller boards before trying to tackle the larger ones.  Keep playing go, its a good game.]
