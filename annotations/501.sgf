obtaining a good coordination between all black stones.];W[fq]
;B[ck]C[Is is more common to play B4 first];W[bo];B[co];W[cp]
;B[bn];W[po];B[op]C[Black should play at O4 instead of P4.]

(;B[lq]C[M3 is not bad, but black could also play R3 to attack the white group
above (see variations)];W[lr]
(;B[kq]C[Good. The double hane at L2 ends in gote (see variation).]
;W[kr];B[jq];W[jr];B[ml]C[good.];W[ql];B[qq]C[This is a bit of an overplay since white can now push at P9 and cut at Q10.]

(;B[sr]C[White can connect at Q1 so black Q1 is better but white lives anyway
(see variation)];W[rr];B[ps];W[qn]C[To ensure life white should play instead Q4 then R7]

(;B[qo]C[This is not good, black reduces his own liberties. Black should play R7 instead (see variation)]
;W[rm]C[Good move];B[rk];W[pp];B[oq];W[so]C[White lives in gote so the result is still good for black.]
;B[cf]C[Good.];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc]
(;B[jc]C[Black doesn't need a deep invasion to win (see variation). Erode instead of
invading when erosion is sufficient to win. K17 could be called the losing move.]
;W[je]C[now while black struggles to saves his stone, his potential in the center disappears.]
;B[id];W[ie];B[hd];W[hb];B[lc];W[mc];B[kd];W[ke];B[le];W[md]
C[L16 and M15 are not very good since white can now capture at M14.]
;B[fd]C[H15 instead of F16 would give a better shape];W[ed]
;B[gf]C[H15 would still be better];W[lf];B[me]C[This move is useless]
;W[nf];B[gc];W[gb]
(;B[lb]C[Too small. Black should play E14 instead (see variation)]

(;B[jb]C[Black E14 would be bigger since black still has a ko to save his stones (see variation)]
;W[fe];B[he]C[This shows why F16 was not good. Black ends up playing H15 anyway.]
;W[gd]C[Much too small for white. The F16 stone was not important.]

;W[dg];B[cg];W[eh];B[ig]C[This is not good shape. Play G12 instead.]
;W[di];B[ch]C[Now black's center has disappeared and black still has a weak group.]
;W[ci];B[bj]C[B10 is very bad. White is extremely happy to answer at B11. Since black
still has B4, the bottom group is not in danger.];W[bi];B[ei]

(see variation)]

;W[kg];B[jh];W[ng];B[ik];W[mh];B[lh]C[M12 is not good, too close to white's strength. Black should play M11 instead
to make some territory.];W[kh];B[li]C[M11 would be better at L11 to make some territory]
;W[ki]C[Now black has lost almost all territory in the center.]
