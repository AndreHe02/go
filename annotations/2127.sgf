RE[B+2.5]

C[This was a nice "friendly" game I played with my brother recently.  Didn't notice many mistakes on either side, except for possibly some costly moves/choices in the end there.

If you could I would like a review for both sides for this particular game, so we can review it later. Thank you for your time.

( I played white stones; he played black )
------------
Hi, thanks for the opportunity to review your game!  You two seem well-matched.  Congrats on winning a close game.  This one was really close until the very end.  Those games are always intense!  My name is Peter, and I play as tartuffe 7k on KGS.  I will do my best to point out a few things, but of course, stronger players might have better ideas. :-)

See the last move for a summary of ideas.
If you have any questions feel free to ask!  If you are on KGS/IGS and see me, feel free to ask for a teaching game.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dq];W[qd];B[co]C[I was wondering if this was a common opening on a 4-3 joseki.  I see this alot of 4-4's but seldom on this.  Just wondering your opinion.

[tartuffe\] It is hard to criticize this move.  Completing a shimari here is certainly very big, and k3 is now a very large follow-up.  If r16 were on q16, black c5 would be "the" standard 5th move.  The p16 approach is also very common in this position.  Also, c9 and d9 are common 5th moves.
Don't worry about joseki, as players of our ability do not have a good feel for the value of influence yet, and correct choice/use of or deviation from joseki can vary greatly depending on the other corners.  Just playing according to opening theory should guide you past most of the rocks in the opening.
One good thing to know about the shimari made by d3 and c5 is that it focuses on the lower side.  k3 is now bigger than c10.

Why?

If black gets both k3 (and later k5) black develops an imposing moyo.  k3 + k5 would be better than c10 + e10.  Also, k3 is a good point for white considering the q4 stone.  Thus k3 is now a huge point and should be snapped up by either side at the earliest opportunity.]

(;W[nq]LB[jq:B][od:C]C[[tartuffe\] k3 is better here since it is a natural long extension for both black and white (especially with d3 and c5).  Also, white has the opportunity to complete a shimari.]
;B[od];W[pe]C[I wanted to start an interesting fight here.

[tartuffe\] :-) Q14 is a standard way to begin this kind of fight (again, a quiet-looking move with violent follow-ups).  But it is good to experiment!]
;B[md];W[cf];B[dh];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd]C[I found it strange that he didn't push me up and decided to allow me to connect.  I did note the strong wall he was starting to form though.
[tartuffe\] Black is giving you the corner in return for a wall.  If black had a stone at k17 this would be very playable.  As it is, black is developing, but will need a follow-up move on the top-side to finish using this strength.]
;B[de];W[cg]
(;B[gd]LB[ic:B]C[[tartuffe\] This is much to close to the black wall.  See the variation.]
;W[fq]TR[ch][db][jc][qj]C[[tartuffe\]  If you want to leave the upper left, that's okay, but note some very big follow-up moves here: d18, c12, k17 are all huge.  Outside of that local fight r10 and j3 are the biggest points.  White can also plan an invasion around k17.]

(;B[qn]LB[hq:B][qk:C]C[Hum once someone does a knights jump out from 4-4 is it wise to attack like this?  Maybe R10 would have been a better alternative?

[tartuffe\] This is perhaps the most common approach to a 4-4 point.  The next white move is worth consideration.
Considering your two stones in the upper right you want to make territory on the right side.  This means a pincer (attack on the other side) is in order.
If the right side is not as important you can defend the corner with r4, or if you want to develop the lower side, press with q6.
If you have a stone at r10 already you can attack with r5 (though this leaves the corner slightly vulnerable).

If black wants to avoid this pincer he should play r9 instead of r6.]
;W[ql]C[[tartuffe\] This is exactly the move I would have played. :-)]
;B[on];W[qi]C[[tartuffe\]  Good!  Now white is developing well!  However, now we see that o3 should have been played at k3.  Imagine if you had a stone at k3 and had the chance to play o3 at o5!]

This was a pretty good game for both sides with no major mistakes.  I hope you enjoy looking through it; I enjoyed examining the game!  Thanks for using the Go Teaching Ladder!

Three things that will improve your play (for both sides):

1. Avoid empty triangles.

In this game empty triangles were played by both sides (moves 29,38,61 and a few in the endgame).  Empty triangles are bad shape and cause weakness in your position.  Do not play them unless you have a VERY good reason (connect groups, make eyes, endgame points).  These moves cost both sides points.

2.  Identify big points.

Points that should jump out at you are:
k3 after move 5.  You will see this kind of opportunity often.
f5 n14 after move ~40-64.  Points good for both sides should be snapped up quickly.
c1 after move 66 (monkey jump).  Both sides missed this... LEARN THE MONKEY JUMP.

3.  In the endgame keep sente (the initiative) and find the biggest move.

Do not play neutral points that surround nothing.
Do not cut/connect groups that are both alive.
Keep control as long as you can.
Moves in the corner are often much bigger than you would think.
sente = keeping the initiative
gote = losing the initiative])
(;B[qs]SQ[pr][ps][sr][ss]C[This move is worth 8 points because if black gets r1, t1 and t2 become black territory and q1 and q2 are filled by white (+2 for black and -2 for white), whereas if white gets s1 black loses t1 and t2 while q1 and q2 become territory for white (+2 for white and -2 for black).  The total difference is 8.]
