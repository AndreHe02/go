C[I'm playing against gnugo (I'm black). As you can see, I get stomped pretty badly. Around move 40, white makes a move that I don't (know how to) answer. I don't have a rating on IGS (or NNGS), as I'm just beginning to learn the game in earnest.

Any insights you can give will be most appreciated.

Thanks

Ken,

Delighted to try.  I have been playing seriously only since April; I am currently 14 kyu on KGS and 17 kyu on IGS, so I am not tremendously expert, but I have bought many go books and even read a few, so I'll do my best.]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[dn]C[5: As a kakari (attack on a corner) I think this is a bit gentle. White has the option of going on either E3 or E4 and building a substantial shimari (corner enclosure) without interference. A more conventional attack would be E3 or R6.  Note that gnugo does not feel compelled to respond, but does its own kakari on P17, analagous to E3.  D6 is an extension from your star point stone on D16, and does block a natural white extension from its possible shimari, but white can also wedge at C11 and build a base on the left.]
;W[oc];B[mc];W[oe]
(;B[ph]C[The pincer at N17 is good, but the extension at Q12 is not.  It is too far from R16 to make territory and too far from P15 to harry the enemy.   
When responding to an invasion, there are two possible goals, kill or torment.  You have rightly determined that it is too early and open to kill, so torment is your goal.  The idea is, as long as possible, to threaten the life and cohesion of the invading group with stones that work with each other either to build influence or bank territory, all the while keeping sente. Have a look at the variation to see my own version, which gets a bit more territory than yours, I think.]
;W[fc];B[cf]C[Good kakari from gnugo; good response from you.]
;W[db];B[id]C[I think you move at J16 because you don't want the enemy to move there or J17 and have a sound base.  The trouble is that the enemy later moves to C17, establishing an amply secure base in the corner, and getting, according to my Many Faces of Go analytical software, a 15-point or so territory shift in its favor.  I think C17 ought to have been your move here.  If white J17 then black N15, harrying the invasion and staying alive.]
;W[fe];B[di]C[good move.  Attacks the top white group; works with the stones around it; banks a chunk of territory.]
;W[ep];B[hp]C[The books say that this 3/4, 5/4 kakari that gnugo has made has a weakness, not where you have played, but at G3.  If white defends at E3 or F3, it is overconcentrated; if it doesn't, black plays E2, taking some of the corner from white.]
;W[cc]C[Now you have lost the corner and the white group is quite safe. You can't attack it and it can freely expand.  It is much harder to contain a group with a base than one without.]
;B[gg]C[This is where go turns into a nightmare for us beginners, I think. The opening is mostly over, though there is some still to be done in the lower right hand corner.  Then where to play?   
People have probably told you that go is won by moves that accomplish more than one thing.  Make sure, though, that the moves accomplish the things you hope for.  Don't be afraid of moves that secure territory or make things cleaner or stronger.   
Move 19 seeks to contain the threat from the group at the top, while giving you some presence and power in the middle.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite do either.  Look at the 3x2 gap between it and the two nearest neighbors; it's just too big.  The trouble is that there is too much open space and the group has too solid a base.  He can attack D16, try to go through the gaps to the middle, or slide along the top.  You just can't stop him with one stone.  Pick one vulnerability and use your stone there. Try H17.  He is blocked in, you have a base and some territory.
Try C16, giving you the left.  Try "peeping at G16 and sidling toward the middle to channel him one way or E14 then F13 the other.  These may not be great moves, of course, but the point is you cannot win everything.  If you try, you could lose everything.]
;W[qj];B[nk]C[His move threatens your control of the side, then follows up with R7, giving him a nice presence on the side.  O9 neither threatens his shape nor defends your corner.  The 3x2 jump is just too far to control or menace anything but the weakest groups.

Instead, try S11 and get some territory going, Q7 and threaten to split him up, or sail in like Lord Nelson and put a stone on R8!  Then he has a choice.  He can jump out to P10, in which can you put a stone on R5 and bust up the side. Or he can go to R6, in which case you jump out to P8 and now his stone is weak and needs assistance.]
;W[qm]C[Now, barring a brilliant attack by you, he has a big chunk of land and a strong base.  Your three right side stones are still not settled.]
;B[nq]C[This is an excellent kakari, but must be followed up.  Do F3 next and you threaten to get a big chunk of land, just like he did.  O4 or M4 help too.]
;W[fn];B[in]C[The move to F6 is an attack on D6.  gnugo may not even realize it, but acts on it later.  Your move to J6 does hamper the white stones, but does not build up territory.

There is a proverb about one stone taking a two space extension, two stones a three space, etc.  By this proverb D6 needs to be three stones, not one, to cover the jump to D11.  25 should have been at C6 or D8 or something like that.  The left side should be yours, or white should pay a hefty price for taking it, but you need more stones there.]
;W[fl]C[I think I need to contain W in the lower left. Is that right?

Yes, yes, yes!

D6 is now being threatened with encirclement like the 6th at Stalingrad.  It is almost too late.  To my beginner's eye, you can defend at D8, see variation, but even that may not do.]

(;B[gj];W[cm];B[dm];W[cn];B[me]C[This is an good move, treating the invasion the way it ought to be treated, while marking off a bit of land.  Watch out though, R16 is a bit lonely.  Of course, you are sort of giving up in the lower left.  Better to win one battle and lose another than to lose all the battles.]
;W[pb]C[White tries to get a base.  You need to keep attacking.  Q14 or R18 or S18]
;B[kb]C[Unnecessary move.  If you were going to do this, do it at H17 or H18, but mainly don't do it.  R16 needs reinforcement.]
;W[rc]C[Ahem.];B[rf]C[White now has a strong base and you can't threaten this group any more.  At this point you are right to run away, but Q15 or R14 might have been better.]
;W[dl]C[The stones at D6 are lost?

Yep.  Leave them there for the "aji" or residual influence.  You can later threaten to liberate them and gain some benefit though, so move on to other battles.  
By way of example, a stone at F4 or F5 threatens to connect to them by going to E5.  The stones stay dead, but the enemy is needled by the aji and loses ground.  See variations.]

(;B[pn]C[Another lonely stone.  You are trying to reduce his area on the right. At this point you need to firm up some of your own.  F3 is still crying out to be occupied, and is sente, since he won't want to lose the corner.]
;W[lk];B[ik]C[Good response.  I make you about 20 points behind by now and without strong, well- structured groups.  You may decide to try for a big kill, to make up the difference.  Like the Bismarck, 38 is stuck out there in the Atlantic surrounded by your fleet. 39 is a good move for trying to kill it, but if you are going to do that, you have to kill it.  M9 and anything else white puts out there has to be killed, or you lose the game.  If you don't try to kill it, then try to contain it.  39 is not that great a move for containing it, because it is not in front of your strong areas at the top and bottom.  It is in between 38 and the white group on the left. If you play to contain, maybe M4 or M13 or something?]
;W[li]C[(post game) Looking back, my failure to answer M9 correctly makes M11 the death of me.

Yes and no.  I think in the short run, your answer was good, strategically at least.  M11 doesn't make M9 good yet.  Now the two of them are stuck out there lonely, like Bismarck and Prinz Eugen.   
The trouble is not the idea, but the details.  You just aren't that good at killing yet and your stones are pretty loose.  That is just a matter of playing and studying a lot.]
;B[ng];W[kl]C[... and Hipper ...];B[lj]C[(Post game) Too late...]
;W[kj]C[Ugh... That was a mistake.

No, it's all right.  It robs him of eye space.  It might have been better to peep at N10.  Takes the eye space and threatens to cut him up or else leave you sente.]
;B[mj];W[qn]C[This move of gnugo's is ok.   You should look for more moves like it too.]
;B[ql]C[No!  Much more than your moves in the middle, this cost you. 47 is weak and can be attacked.  In attacking it, white reaches out to the group in the middle, like Tirpitz leaving its fjord. Much better Q7 or O7.  If you are going to do this, make sure you kill O10 and get some compensation for the damage wrought by white in the middle.]
;W[rl];B[pk];W[qo];B[po]C[This had to be at Q7, although white never takes advantage of the hole.]
;W[pm];B[om];W[op];B[no];W[jq];B[qp]C[I don't think you are in a position to kill those two stones, so this is a wasted move.  gnugo doesn't see a threat and instead uses the next move to cut up a group.

At this stage, you need to be using your stones to smother the guys in the middle.  J8, K9 or L5 come to mind.]
;W[io];B[ip];W[qq];B[rp];W[rq];B[pq];W[kh];B[il];W[ii]C[65 was not a bad move, but the group in the middle is getting beefy and you need to keep attacking it.]
;B[lm];W[np];B[mp];W[oq];B[or];W[pr]C[p2 was bad, W can now connect the groups O4, R3 and Q2. Yes?]
;B[mq];W[hr];B[nr];W[pl];B[kq]C[K4 would be much better.  You are trying to bridge a gap between J4 and N3-4.  J4 is one stone wide, surrounded by white.  N3-4 are two stones in the clear.  L3 is much more easily connected to the right then the left.  From L3 to J4 is a knight's move, which can be cut.  There is a proverb: "Aim at the waist of a knight's move."  The waist is either of the stones directly in between.  In this case, one of the waist positions is already occupied.  If you go to K4, say, it is easier to fight your way to the right.]
;W[fr];B[qk]C[You are trying to save every stone, it seems.  Let some of them go and use your stones to better effect elsewhere.  This same stone at K4 or K10 changes the rest of the game, and you have only lost one stone.

Always look for bigger moves.  
Have you noticed that gnugo will make odd jumps around the board, making bold moves on one side, to which we respond, and then moving on the other side of the board, letting us throttle their bold thrust?  And yet, for all this seemingly irrational jumping around, if we play the least imprecisely, we lose to the machine. My guess is that the machine is just calculating projected scores and taking the move that, in combination with our similarly projected moves, shifts the score the most in the computer's favor.  I get the same impression when I try to figure out what is going on in pro games, so maybe we should be playing the same way. Just go for the big moves when they are there.]
;W[jp];B[jo];W[ho];B[gn];W[go];B[gm];W[jn]C[The same thing happened here.  You saved the stone on G6, a four or five point move, maybe?  and let the machine cut your position in half]
;B[ko];W[jm];B[im];W[rk];B[rj]C[Not a good move.  First of all it is dead if white wants, with a move at S11.  Second, it can't kill  S8-9, which is quite safe. Third, it is small.  White doesn't bother killing it, because it has bigger problems it has to solve.  Imagine if you had played this stone at N8 instead.]
;W[ml];B[nl];W[mm]
(;B[nm]C[I think to keep a fighting chance in the middle, this move needs to be at M6.  Don't forget that O8 and P7 are connected.

I think black M6, white N6, Black N5, ... See variation

Letting white curl around M7 makes at least one eye.];W[mn]
;B[mo];W[ln];B[nj]C[This connection is unnecessary.  Diagonal joints can't be broken, unless other factors intervene.  If white ever went to N9 you can play 010, and vice versa.

Although the white group is probably now alive, there are still other places you could play.]
;W[ig]C[Not sure what the best way to prevent W getting to the UL corner...

Once a group is strong and save, you can't really attack it, only contain it.  It is true that cutting apart groups is a key part of go, but once two groups are strong, as here, there is no point struggling to keep them apart, unless you are trying to keep your own connections open.  In this case, you can't prevent white from getting to the UL corner, because white already owns it.  You need to be using stones to make some of your own groups more robust.]
;B[if];W[hf];B[ge];W[gi];B[hi];W[hg];B[ih];W[ji];B[jg];W[hh]
C[A beautiful slashing attack through the middle of these groups. Presumably in a desperate effort to introduce complication and whip something out of it.  It shows great fighting spirit.  You should hold on to that spirit.  This sort of thing turns games around all the time, certainly at the kyu level, and even when it doesn't, it forces us to consider the unusual and avoid defaulting to reflex moves.  
There are three reasons why it's not great here though.  One is in the details:  This double atari cuts it up and leaves it weak.  Second is that the strategic goal of cutting the center and upper left apart is ill-conceived.  Both areas are strong, so there is little benefit to cutting them apart.  Better to use your dashing cavalry to guard your own flanks, not to charge the cannon.  Last is that you are playing against a computer: It will stubbornly not notice that it is supposed to be confused now.  You may have introduced complexity; it eats complexity for breakfast.  When playing against computers, which you will soon be able to beat, you have to do it by being thoughtful and precise.  Humans are another matter.  It is actually possible to gain advantage over a person in go by confusing things enough that you exceed their capacity to be precise and thoughtful. Not gnugo.]
;B[jh];W[hj]C[Not sure how to proceed. W seems to have connected to the UL, or at least s
trengthened his hold on LL. Hrmmm...

White might already have two eyes in the center, has probably got an easy time getting to the upper left and can probably kill your six stones around G7.  At this point, I don't know what to do about it.  Your stones on the left and top are just too weak to use.]
;B[kp];W[fj];B[gk];W[gf];B[ff]C[You just can't usefully cut these stones off here.  There are too many ways to cut and groups to threaten.  L13 or J15 would protect more.  On the other side D13 might accomplish something. When you get up too close to strong groups, there are too many ways to get killed.]
;W[ef];B[fg];W[eg];B[ee];W[fd];B[ec];W[eb];B[fb];W[jf];B[kg]
;W[je];B[ie];W[jd];B[gd];W[gb];B[gc];W[fa];B[ha]C[Playing on the edge in the absence of immediately neighboring stones is rarely a good idea.]
;W[hb];B[ia];W[lg];B[kf];W[mf];B[nf];W[ic];B[ed]
(;W[ne];B[fb];W[md];B[le];W[ld];B[lh];W[ke];B[ki];W[mh]C[The game pretty much falls apart for me at this point...

This last sequence is very revealing of the computer's cold method. It seemed quite unnecessary for it to ignore your atari and lose the three stones in the F column, but the fact is it was gunning for bigger game.   
If I were in gnugo's position, no way would I have let your G and J column stones live.  Too big and too easy to kill.  I would probably have forgone the bigger prize, though.

You have lots of good big picture ideas and great gusto as a player.  You clearly have some opening concepts and have the basic idea of cut the other guy and connect yourself.   
Do you play on KGS?  It is much easier on KGS to play handicap games and the people are nicer than on IGS.  Playing handicap games is really good.  Not only it is good to play against better players and try to use of an advantage, but it is enormous fun to play giving someone else a handicap.  It forces you to be very, very efficient and still bold.  It improves your game a lot.

This is the first one of these I've done.  I hope I wasn't too long winded.

All the best,
