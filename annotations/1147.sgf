C[Hi, my name is Diogo Martini, from Brasil. I start playng GO for about 3 months, I realy don't know even my rank (i think is 27k) :) Well, I am sending this file just to know if I am playing well and to know what rank I am, this will realy help cause I could chose better my opponents on IGS. I realy apreciate some advice too! By the way, I played with black stones in this game. Thank you very much, I'll be waiting for the review, hope you can help me ^_^.]
;B[pp];W[dq];B[qd];W[cd];B[do]TR[ec][qj][co]C[This attack doesn't really threaten the corner, so gives W the opportunity to develop elsewhere. I would've considered C5, or E17 which could work together with R16 later on. Play at R10 could later be linked up with either the top or bottom corner to take at least half the right side.]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[ec];B[cq];W[gq];B[nq]TR[qh][ck]SQ[od][pi]C[WIth the 4-4 stone at Q4, this can be played later on either side. I would consider extending the top right corner down the side R12, or the bottom left corner up the side C9, or put attack P17, then extend down the side Q11. These may seem like large, unsafe extensions, but you should realize that there are still bigger places for W to play than in between your extension.]
;W[dp];B[cp];W[jc];B[kq];W[nf];B[qf]TR[pf][qg]SQ[od]C[This play is not as strong as it could be. Attacking P17 now could weaken O14.]
;W[ir];B[jr]TR[dk][qk]C[This is a small move compared to the unclaimed sides still available. Preventing W from getting under into your territory is important, but see how far W would go and compare that loss to the gain of claiming one of the sides.]

;W[hr];B[ql];W[ol];B[fl]TR[eh][nh][ll]C[W is making quite a wall along column O, and B should either split that, or cut into the big middle area on the top half, or squeeze the lower part of the wall in the bottom half.]
;W[cr];B[br];W[cs];B[bs];W[er];B[bp]TR[cj][jm][ln]C[I don't think that needed to be played, it looks relatively safe for the moment. Playing at one of the marked places would build up for B, or get into the top area as suggested before.]

;W[fc]C[That was good to cut into W's territory, although I think W could've defended a better.]
;B[od];W[ne]TR[nd]C[W should've played this differently to protect the top edge.]

C[That appears to be unnecessary, and you could've played elsewhere requiring a defense, taking a point away from W.]

;W[om];B[je]C[You played a good game. I think your rank is a bit higher than 27 kyu, but I play on KGS, and IGS ranks may be stronger. In any case, you have some good foundations. I would say you play too safely, especially at the start of the game, and let the opponent control more of the board. You do make up for it by good fighting and having the other make mistakes and not yourself. At the start of the game, try not to cluster all your stones in just a few areas of the board, spread them out more. Even if you lose some of those stones, they will pay off in reducing space of your opponent--as long as you don't play defending stones that need too many moves to save.]
