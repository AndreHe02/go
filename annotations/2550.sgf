C[When I played this game, I was an overrated 5k, so my opponent was obviously stronger than I. Nevertheless, I would like to learn from this game and see what my main errors were, both strategic and tactical. Thanks.]

C[This is a very common joseki... With the move at O3, the South side is not so important.]

(;B[de]LB[ec:B][de:A]C[>I didn't choose variation B because I felt that whit would get too much power in the >top-right after move 18, but this turned out even worse.



I think this is not a good explication... See the joseki in variation.

You must to not play in B, but there are many joseki...  And A is not a joseki. Why not D14 ? (See variation)
And you can also make a pince like H16 (see variation too)]

(;W[ee]C[This is not the good answer, say the book ;-) (See variation)]
;B[ch];W[df];B[cf];W[dd];B[ce];W[cc];B[bc]C[I think the result is good for you : white is weak and you've got a lot of points...]
;W[nc]C[How to answer at this keima kakari ?]
(;B[qf]C[I think this is not a very good answer : you can make a pince (see variation)...]
;W[jd];B[qh]C[The goal is to establish a base and indirectly attack the white group on the right.

Yes...
To establish a base, Q18 is better (take points of the corner and prepare M17).
But this prepare R8, and it's not bad.];W[pb]C[Oh, this is *not* a good move. Of course it's not black who play, but however i will explain : this move is better in R17 to take points of the corner or in O15 to create a moyo...]

(;B[oi]C[You must to play in R17 (see variation)];W[ok]
(;B[nk]C[This attack started pretty well, but I failed to capture any white stones.


It's not really an attack : this is a contact play, so you renforce white. You will create influence, but the problem is that the influence is not in the good direction... Maybe you must to play in E14 (see variation)]
;W[ne]C[I assume white tries to prevent m17

White has to play in N8, i think. Now you can play P8 in sente !]

(;B[rk]LB[rk:A][rm:B]C[I didn't play s7 because of the variation shown... Was R8 already a mistake?
Yes... see variation in the variation :)];W[qk];B[pl];W[rm]
C[It's not so good :-)];B[mj]C[Not very important... i think R17 is better to live.]
;W[mi];B[lj];W[ni];B[fp]C[Of course you create a moyo, but here are a cutting point (N9) and R17 is very important !]
;W[hq]C[I think it's too agressive, white can play at C6...]

(;B[gq]C[This turned out to be another disaster... How do should I have taken advantage of the thickness on the right?

I think you can simply play G5 (see variation)];W[hp]
(;B[jp]C[Terrible... a move at F6 would be better (for attack)]
;W[gp]
(;B[eq]LB[fo:B][eq:A]C[Would the other variation be better?

Yes, it would be better, but with another variation (see variation in the variation).]
;W[fo];B[cq]C[This seems a huge mistake - what's the right play here?]
;W[ep];B[fq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cp]C[Probably here you can play another move :]
