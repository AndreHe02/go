RE[W+R]

;B[dp];W[pp];B[dd];W[qd];B[oc];W[pf]C[Too passive? In retrospect, P16 looks 
better.

DM - What about a pincer to break up 
Black's potential moyo?];B[md];W[pi];B[pk];W[qm]C[This seemed like a good move to keep 
black from getting a base.  Was there a 
better move?

DM - looks okay, but R6 does the same 
and is stronger for the corner.];B[qi];W[qh];B[qj];W[ph];B[ql]
;W[pm];B[jp];W[rm]C[Too soon? It seemed like it would be too 
easy for black if he got to play here.

DM - Because Black has option of running 
to center this doesn't seem so urgent.];B[nk];W[oq]C[Too small?  I figured if I didn't play 
somewhere around here, black could 
easily live after playing in the corner (at R3 
for example) and then I would have to 
worry about living.

DM - I like the idea, maybe O3 is better 
spot.];B[dj]C[White seems too concentrated and black 
has unchallenged influence over 2/3 of the 
board. Is this really as lopsided in black's 
favor as it seems to me? How did this 
happen?

DM - starting with the non-pincer move in 
upper left, but Black moyo only seems 
scary.];W[fc]C[This seemed like the most empty area to 
jump into, but maybe that's the wrong 
approach?

DM - I prefer C6, striking in the center of the 
moyo before it is too late.  22 is at edge of 
moyo.];B[ec];W[ic]C[DM - why not play joseki at F16?  If then 
B24, White plays D15.];B[kc];W[fd];B[df]C[Black seems to have gotten as much, if not 
more, out of this exchange.  Did I play this 
wrong?

DM - yes, see last remark.];W[pb]C[I felt this group as somewhat vulnerable 
and I needed to attack it before black got 
another move in here.  Was doing 
something in the lower left more important 
at this point?

DM - yes, upper left white group in no 
danger of death, and reducing big Black 
moyo more valuable than saving a few 
points for this group.];B[pc];W[qc];B[ob];W[qb];B[fb];W[gb]
;B[eb];W[ib];B[qq]C[This seems like a big mistake on black's 
part since his group in the uppper right is 
not yet alive and living here is going to be 
very hard.  I feel like I never could have 
won if black hadn't helped me so much.

DM - that is true of every kyu-level game 
ever played.];W[qp];B[mq];W[or]C[The best move here?

DM - again, White is in no danger of death 
so play big lower left corner.  Locally I 
think O2 is better.];B[nr];W[eo]C[I knew I needed to play somewhere in this 
area, but had no idea what was the best 
play.  I felt that playing in the corner (at C3 
say) would result in black getting a lot of 
potential territory on one side or the other.  
Would it be better for white to take the 
corner and then try to reduce black's 
territory?  Where could white threaten to 
run to when the reducing move is attacked? 
 I felt I could reduce blacks territory better 
from the outside than the inside.  Bad 
thinking?

DM - 42 looks interesting, but C6 and the 
standard sequence seems straight-forward. 
 Less can go wrong for you.];B[do];W[ep];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr]
;B[cr];W[es];B[dr];W[gq];B[en];W[fn]C[DM - 54 seems to give up hope of reducing 
left side.  Maybe better not to strengthen 
Black.  I2 or I3 or J2 undercut Black's 
bottom center group and keep options open 
on left.];B[em];W[fm];B[el];W[jr]C[Was there anyway to avoid helping black 
get such a nice wall on the left?  If I don't 
successfully attack these stones, it looks 
like black has again come out better in this 
exchange.  How does this keep 
happening?

DM - see last remark];B[jq];W[kr];B[lr];W[ir];B[kq];W[lp];B[lq]
;W[mp];B[jn];W[ko];B[jo];W[lm]C[Keeping the two weak black groups 
separated seems like the right approach.  
However, at this point, I feel like my only 
chance is to kill at least two of black's 
three weak groups.  That seems like a 
tough way to win the game.  Was there 
something I should have done about the 
left side before it became all black 
territory?

DM yes - instead of making your 
opponent stronger by pushing Black along 
the E line you could have:  1) reduced with 
D12 or D8 or E13 or E11; or invaded with 
C10 or C12 or C8.];B[jl];W[lk];B[kk];W[mk];B[rh];W[rg];B[ri]

;W[ne];B[me]C[I think that K19 or L16 was probably better for 
black and might have at least resulted in a ko 
or seki.  I'm guess that a seki would be 
enough for black to win since cutting off the 
black group in the lower middle is going to be 
very hard for white.  Is this a reasonable 
assessment?

DM - 119 at L15 and Black lives [last 
comment\]];W[ja];B[ka];W[kd];B[ld];W[kf];B[mf];W[lg];B[jd];W[ke]
