C[Hi! I'm your reviewer Edgar. Feel free to e-mail me questions if you don't understand any comment in the review.]
;B[dp];W[od];B[pp];W[dc];B[pf]LB[qc:B][qd:A]C[This is not a very good idea against a 5-4. I won't go much into the 5-4 josekis since I don't believe learning (relatively) rare joseki when you have just started playing go is a good idea. However, this move is wrong even if you don't consider the joseki.

The reason is because the point of the 5-4 stone is to grab influence, which it does well due to its high location. On the other hand, its weakness is the fact that it is not very solid; it does not actually claim solid territory to any large extent, since it is so high. Hence, the correct idea would be to attack the weakest aspect of the opponent's formation, which in this case means actually grabbing territory.

The two common replies to this move (I've labeled them "A" and "B") do this very well. Remember: a stone on the third line is more territory oriented, and a stone on the fourth is more influence oriented. The point of influence is to gain an upper hand in any sort of fighting that might break out in the center, while the point of territory, is, well, points :) Usually, it is a very good idea to strike a balance between the two. 

By playing an approach stone on the fourth line to the 5-4, you are not only fighting white in the aspect of his formation that is the most strong (influence), but you are also allowing white to solidify that huge corner into actual territory with another move.]
;W[pe]C[While I'm certainly not a fan of this white move (both R15 and R16 are much better), this does to a certain degree solidify white's corner (but not as much as R15 or R16). This is exactly what black should have avoided letting white play, because now white has both territory and influence, while black has a stone that doesn't really seem to know what it is doing.]
;B[og]LB[ph:A][pi:B]C[This move is too overconcentrated. Overconcentration reduces the efficiency of the black stones because they become redundant. In this case, "A" is a much better choice.

Even "B" might be possible, but it might be slightly too thin because white is fairly thick with P16 and Q15. It's usually a good idea to have similar thickness as your opponent in a certain part of the board, unless you are using techniques such as sabaki, but that's much more advanced. However, note that overconcentration is *not* thickness.

Don't worry if you do not understand the idea of thickness; you will with more playing experience :) You can also look up Go terms that you don't know at senseis.xmp.net]
;W[of];B[pg]LB[qc:A]C[This move also seems fairly overconcentrated to me. Before playing any move that covers the cut, I would first play O14, which forces white to make bad shape with P15, since giving black a ponnuki is intolerable for white (a ponnuki is terrific influence; as the saying goes "a ponnuki is worth 30 points").

Then I would decide whether I would bother preventing the Q13 cut with a move that is gote. To me, a much better move even in that region would be to invade at 3-3 (R17), which is a huge move. If you succeed in taking a fair chunk of the corner from white, the cut at Q13 would seem tiny indeed. Plus, in this case the Q14 stone might actually come in handy, even if it is ultimately taken by white (it's presence might force white to make moves that he doesn't particularily like).

Remember: corners first, then sides, and lastly center.];W[jc]
C[Not too bad but I'd perfer C6.];B[cf]LB[ce:A][de:B]C[This is a good move. However, it is probably a good idea to familarize yourself with the most used josekis against the 3-4, namely the low (5-3) and high (5-4) approaches. The distant low approach (the move you made) is very playable, but rarer and more advanced.]
;W[df]C[This is a bad move. Attaching to a (relatively) weak and isolated stone is usually not a good idea.]
;B[dg];W[ce];B[ch]C[This move is not a good idea in light of what white will immediately play the next move (and which white does play in this game), which makes bad shape (farmer's hat). Bad shapes are, well, bad because they are not efficient. You can learn more about shapes (both bad and good) on the site I mentioned earlier (senseis.xmp.net).

To avoid this, I would do what I suggested on the other side of the board: first play E14 and force white D15, and then do something else, like K4 or even R17. The C13 cut here is even smaller than the Q13 cut because it is a 3rd line cut, whereas Q13 is a 4th line cut. This means white will get comparatively little territory even if he does decide to cut in the end.

Also notice that preventing the cut is gote, i.e. you give away initiative, which, in the fuseki can be generally considered to be worth around double komi (13 points). Of course, don't overapply this principle, and lose everything you have just to preserve sente. The technique of not overapplying this principle is not easy and comes only with experience and much thinking (even I overapply and underapply this principle constantly) :)]
;W[bf];B[cg]C[Here you will see why the farmer's hat is not efficient: does it really make much of a difference to black whether C12 is there or not? C12 is completely unnecessary, which means you spent a move for nothing.]
;W[fp];B[de];W[ef];B[be];W[cd];B[bg]LB[hp:B][hq:A]C[While this sequence certainly seems impressive for black, it is, in fact, a mistake.

First, you give away sente for mere morsals. Second, you actually helped white solidify his position by forcing him to play E14, which is quite a huge move. E14 helps white to protect his vast moyo on the top, making an invasion/reduction harder for black.

Second, you ignored the high approach to your 4-4 stone, which is generally not a good idea. In this case, because you have a relatively solid position on the lower half of the left side, I'd suggest a pincer at H3 or H4. But even the traditional reply at D6 is not *too* bad (somewhat overconcentrated though).]
;W[dn]C[Now white pincers. Not an especially good situation for black, especially considering what he got for it (i.e. not a lot).]
;B[eo];W[fn]C[White mistake. F7 or G6 is better; F6 makes very weak shape.]
;B[en];W[em];B[dm];W[do]C[Bad move. I think C6 is much better, and gives white chance to do real damage to black's side.]
;B[cn];W[co]
(;B[ep]C[This is a very bad move. You could have captured the three white stones if you continued the ladder via B5 (see variation).]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[el];B[bn]C[This doesn't really accomplish much if white answered with B5 immediately, but white doesn't...]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[ei]C[Bad move. White could have lived if he played B5, which catches the two black stones.]
;B[fo];W[go];B[gp];W[gn];B[fq]C[Bad move that is overconcentrated. Black should have played H4, which prevents white from pushing him down to the third line with a later H4. It can also act like an invasion route against white's (growing) center (the followup would be black J6 later on).

Of course, there's always the unresolved B5 conflict, and whoever gets there first gains at least 50 points (by gain I am also including the opponent's losses) :)]
;W[io];B[ip];W[hp]C[Bad white move because of the followup. I like K4 much more.]
;B[hq];W[ho]C[Now white has horrible shape.];B[iq]C[But... black follows suit. While J3 doesn't exactly make "bad" shape, it is still quite overconcentrated. K4 is a *much* better move, for the same reason H4 once was.]
;W[no]C[Bad move. White tries very very hard to make a huge center, but O14 alone would negate all of his work. Plus, a center based on the 5th line is not going to be in any sense big after all the reductions that black can do, even if white does succeed in sealing O14.

This is partly why the center is not worth very much: reductions are very easy. Of course, there's also the fact that more stones are required to enclose the same amount of territory compared to the corner or even side.]
;B[on];W[oo];B[po];W[nn];B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[ko];B[jp]C[Very bad move. Not only is this horrible shape, overconcentrated, but also fails to notice white's point, which is to build up a large center. Black can destroy all of white's ambitions in one stroke by playing O14 followed by N9, which completely decimates white's center.

Another way is E9, but that should be played after resolving the B5 problem.]
;W[kp]C[Not a really meaningful white move.];B[kq];W[op]C[Bad shape, and also not very meaningful.]
;B[oq];W[nq];B[pq]C[Locally, P2 is better, though there are much bigger moves elsewhere on the board (O14/N9, B5, and even R17).]
;W[lq]
(;B[nl]C[I would perfer N9 (see variation).];W[ml];B[nk]C[Bad move; N9 much much better. Black has nothing to fear from a O9 cut since he can just catch the offending stone by a ladder starting with O10. This also loses one opportunity of seriously reducing white's center.]
;W[mk];B[mj]C[Now this far worse a place to hane than N9, because it is comparatively much harder to catch the cutting stone than if white had cut O9 after black N9.]
;W[nj]C[And white cuts.];B[ni];W[bo]C[And white abandons O10, probably a wise choice, because while it is much harder to catch than an O9 cut, black is still too strong in that region to give white a reasonable chance of surviving.

And white also finally notices B5.];B[bm]C[This is not going to work :(]
;W[bl];B[cp];W[am];B[ek];W[fk];B[fj];W[fl]C[Bad shape. G9 is (slightly) better, though still bad shape.]
;B[ej];W[gj];B[fi];W[eh];B[di];W[fg]C[Weird move... why not E13? F13 makes fairly bad shape.]
;B[gi];W[gh];B[fh];W[eg];B[gg];W[hh];B[ee];W[fe];B[ed];W[ec]
C[I'd very much perfer F16; the E13 group looks awfully weak to me, with horrible shape (of which the ultimate cause is the weird F13 move, which should really be at G13 here, rendering also H12 unnecessary).]
;B[fd];W[gd];B[fc];W[hi];B[gf]C[Nice move!];W[ge];B[ff];W[hf]
;B[dh];W[hg];B[oj]C[Too small. White already conceded that he won't survive in there, so this would be -1 point for black (one more black stone in his own territory). M10 is much better.]
;W[lj];B[he];W[hd];B[ie];W[jf]C[This looks nice, but is a bad move, as the continuation shows. J16 better.]
;B[id];W[hc];B[ic];W[hb];B[ib];W[jb];B[ha];W[ga];B[ia];W[fb]
;B[gc]C[Good. Also note that the snapback at G18 is also possible.]
;W[gb]C[Bad move of course.];B[eb];W[if];B[jd];W[kd];B[kc];W[je]
;B[fa];W[ke];B[kb]C[Not a bad move, but M17 better. The two white stones can't escape anyway.]
;W[li];B[mh];W[mi];B[nj];W[lh];B[mg];W[mf];B[nf];W[oe];B[ne]
;W[nd];B[me];W[lf];B[le];W[md];B[ld];W[lg];B[mc];W[nc];B[qe]
;W[qd];B[qf]C[Bad shape... S15 is much better (also sente unless white doesn't care about the monkey jump to T18). Life in the corner might even be possible via R17.]
;W[mb];B[lc];W[nb];B[rd];W[qc];B[rc];W[rb];B[ck];W[bp];B[bq]
;W[ap];B[aq];W[bk];B[ao]C[Even though many moves could use some polishing, this is actually a very well played game for someone starting Go. Congratulations :)

Don't let all my criticisms scare you; learn as much as you can from them and keep playing. Playing many games and gaining experience is at least as important as having guidance for a beginner; after all, experience itself is a great teacher.

Good luck! :)

Yours,
