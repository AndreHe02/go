C[Me 
(Joachim) played black. Even if I would not have lost the central group in 
the middle a move 241, I would still have lost. Could you point the major 
strategic errors out to me?

I added question after the moves 15, 21, 61, 73, 147 and 241.

Thank you for your comments!

;W[ep];B[cp];W[co];B[do]C[I would have to say this is the first mistake.  Your stones don't 
seem to be strong enough to play this aggressively.];W[dp];B[cn]
;W[bo]C[Now you have too many weaknesses to fix with one move.]
;B[dn];W[cq];B[bp]C[Now White has a big corner.  This fight has been a failure.]
;W[bq]LB[bn:A]TR[bo][co]C[You should not play this move - the black stone 
can't get away, and you're making White's corner stronger.  I see that 
you're trying to get a forcing move at A, but that move is already forcing 
without this one.  If you play at A instead of here, and White ignores you, 
you will capture the two marked white stones.];B[bn];W[ap];B[dd]
C[Is black better than white in this position?
Should I rather have played the usual extention at D11 instead of D16?

I think D11 would probably be better.  The reason is that your black group 
could get into trouble if White plays there.  Right now you haven't gotten a 
whole lot out of the fight in the corner.  If White gets to attack those 
stones, you will wind up with less than nothing.];W[pd];B[df]
;W[jd];B[hc];W[ch];B[md]C[Was this too agressive?
I also thought about D10 and R14...

I think so.  I would probably play C10.  This serves a couple of purposes.  
It makes your black group below strong. White will have to run away with his 
C12 stone because there is not enough room for eyes on the side, and you 
will get to make your group in the upper left corner bigger and stronger 
while attacking the white group.  Your move by itself is not unreasonable, 
but when looking at the whole board, it's probably not a good idea.  What if 
White plays at C9 now?  Your black group is threatened, and after you defend 
it, White can still take a big chunk out of the upper corner at B14.]
;W[bf];B[be];W[cf];B[ce];W[dg];B[bg]C[Here you only have one move.  You should be happy to play E14.  If 
you do, White is helping you make a lot of territory in the corner, and he's 
not getting much out of it.];W[ef];B[de];W[cg]C[This is MUCH better for White than it would have been if you played 
E14.];B[af]C[This is way too small for this stage of the game.]
;W[bh];B[ee];W[ff];B[fe];W[jc];B[he]LB[mf:A]C[This stone doesn't do much.  Are you trying to separate the 
white groups to attack?  The group on the left edge is pretty strong, and is 
not going to be easy to attack.  Thinking about attacking the stones at the 
top is good, but after White's next move, it is your stone at the top that 
is in trouble.  A is a better idea.];W[jf];B[mf];W[pf];B[pi]
;W[oc];B[mc];W[jg];B[mh]C[I wanted to separate the two white groups.
Should I rather have played K4?

No, this is good.  You need to protect your group at the top.  If you don't 
do this, White could play something like O13, and you would have a tough 
time getting away without damaging your other positions.];W[nq]
;B[pn];W[kp];B[hp]C[This is a terrible move.  Now you have two weak groups that are 
close together.  White can play a move that attacks them both, and you will 
only be able to defend one or the other.];W[fo]C[I think F6 is better for White, but he's got the right idea.]
;B[hn];W[fm];B[ck];W[ek]C[White should probably be attacking the group you didn't defend.  
Somewhere around K6.];B[fn];W[gn];B[en];W[go];B[ho]C[This is no good.  If you're going to attempt to cut, you need to 
follow through.  You should have played at G7.  The other problem with this 
move is that it makes your stones heavy.  This means that now they will all 
live or die together.  Before, you could have let the stone near the edge 
die to help the others get away.  Now you have to try to save them all.]
;W[hm]C[That group is in big trouble.];B[el]C[I guess, I should have connected around L6, right?

At this point, both groups are in big trouble.  A move like this will help 
the group on the left live.  White should probably then play at K6.  If you 
play around K6, White can probably kill the group on the left.  It's a tough 
call, but it looks like the group on the left will be easier to kill, so you 
probably did the right thing.];W[im]C[This is not as good as K6.  Now if the black stones are going to 
live, they have to run to the right.  This will weaken the white stones 
there.  It would be better to chase them out into the center of the board 
while building strength.];B[ko]C[This is the right idea.  I think K5 is a little better.]
;W[jo];B[jn]C[This is a mistake.  You should cut at K4.];W[in]

(;B[io]C[This is a bad move.  You're forcing White to connect and make 
himself stronger, but the move isn't helping your group.  The three stones 
are already dead.  You should make moves that threaten to save them while 
making more strength on the outside.  See variation from the previous move.]
;W[jp];B[kn];W[lp];B[mp]C[This is too aggressive.  The three stones to the left are pretty 
weak.];W[mq];B[jq]C[Now, knowing in how much trouble I got myself, I would rather play 
N6...

No, this is ok.  The thing you need to worry about when trying to save dead 
stones is whether or not you're going to help the opponent make his walls 
stronger.  In this case, he already has strong wall around your stones so 
this shouldn't cost you much.];W[ip];B[iq];W[hq];B[oq]C[Another too aggressive move.  N6 would be much better.]
;W[np];B[mo];W[lo];B[ln];W[mn];B[no];W[mm]C[Now your weakness comes back to haunt you.  You can't save both 
groups.];B[oo];W[lm];B[lq];W[gp];B[nr];W[lr];B[kq];W[mr];B[kr]
;W[or];B[pr];W[ns];B[ol]C[Good move.];W[oh]C[You need to immediately realize that this move is intended to cut 
off the group on the top edge.];B[ni];W[oi];B[oj];W[nj];B[og]
LB[ji:B][mj:A]C[This looks like a mistake.  You have no hope of 
capturing these two stones.  A play at A followed by B is probably a lot 
better.  Your group needs some room for eyes, and White's group at the top 
is still not stable.  Try putting some pressure on him.];W[ph]
;B[pj];W[pg];B[mk];W[mi];B[nh];W[mj];B[lj];W[li]

[nf:C][jh:B][kh:A]C[At this point, there is no way for you to 
make two eyes inside if White plays correctly.  You should play at A to try 
to run.  If White plays B, you play C and have two eyes.  If he plays D, you 
play at B and hope to connect to another group or find a way to make an 
eye.];B[ng]LB[ne:A]C[This move doesn't help you to live.  If White plays at A, 
you are dead.];W[nf];B[ne];W[jh];B[kh]LB[lg:A]C[Could I have made the two eyes faster?
I have the impression,that I allowed white to chase me for too long.

This is a wasted move.  Playing here or at A would give you two eyes, so you 
should play somewhere else.  I don't think you could have made two eyes 
faster unless the whole fight was different.  The way it went, you were 
lucky to live at all.];W[nk];B[qh];W[qg];B[rg];W[qf];B[ri];W[rd]
;B[nl]C[This move is pretty small, and you really have no chance of saving 
those stones.  You should play on the left side.  The group over there could 
still die.];W[ml];B[hg];W[gf];B[hf];W[dk];B[dl];W[fl];B[gj]
LB[bj:A]C[This isn't a great idea.  White will ALWAYS connect, and 
then your stone is not very useful.  You need eye space for your group.  You 
should probably play at A.];W[fk];B[cj];W[ag];B[bi];W[ci];B[bj]

Could I have saved it after white H10?

You needed to play H10 here.  That's the only way to save the group.]

at A or B next.];B[gi];W[gk];B[ah]TR[ae][af][bf][cf][ef][ff]

that point, I had the stupit idea that the whole
white group is captured. Oh dear!

many weak groups, and then they all managed to get into trouble at one time 
or another during the game.  Look at how many stones you had to play on the 
left edge and at the top right to get a total of 7 points.  As a general 
rule, don't create weak groups unless you have to.  Try very hard not to 
have two weak groups at the same time, and never have two weak groups close 
to each other, because the opponent will be able to attack both at once.  It 
looked to me like you were a little bit outclassed in the fighting, too -- 
White won most of the close encounters.  That is something that will come 
with practice.])
