C[Dear reviewer,

I played yfh2, 16k*, black in this game, against hall, 9k*, white

I won this game because W played not very efficiently, and did not
really concentrate on its weaknesses. I don't consider I made a
performance above my IGS level.

Basically, I would like to know, where in the
beginning of the game I could have improved my development scheme.

Thanks in advance for your diligence.

(;B[qe]C[I dislike this position, but I
wanted to keep the corner and use
lower right shape. Any viable option
? 017 seems useless to me. How wrong
am I ?

** I think you are right that this is not the best play.  You have the good shimari in the lower right and you should use that like you said.  A Pincer would be better here around Q10 or Q9.  I personally would prefer a higher position with the larger ogeima  shimari.  I think it is too early to worry about losing the top right corner.  If your opponent wants to take it, that's OK.  Build a huge wall on the outside.]
;W[qi]
(;B[rf]C[seemed to me the best way to take advantage of R11 not being Q14 ...

** This is fine, but you could play it at anytime.   It isn't such an urgent move.  You shouldn't really have a problem living in the corner if attacked because you have this move and can crawl to live on the second line.  I still think you should play an extension from the shimari on the bottom.  Now, it has become a little more crowded and low. You could probably play R9.]
;W[qg];B[re]C[** I am not sure that you need this here.  An extension from the shimari is still bigger. White does not have a living shape on the right, and the extension will put pressure on white stones.

** You could also play something aong the top at K16.  By playing S15, you are taking gote with a slow move.  An attack on the white corner stone is also an option here.]
;W[jc]C[** This W12 is why a black move on the top looks good.]

(;B[cn]C[** This doesn't look like the best way to play here.]

(;W[fq]C[** I don't think I would have responded with this either.]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[ob]C[This w sequence looks good to me.

** I think so too.];B[pb];W[oc];B[pc];W[ch]C[** Here white attempts the double wing but he is a bit crowded.

** He could have played at O15 and it looks good.];B[cc]C[any better than this idea ?

** Usually when faced with a double wing you should invade the 3-3 point.]

(;W[cd]C[** I would have answered on the other side. @D17. and built a wall on the outside.  It looks like it would be worth more.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[fc];W[ed];B[gb];W[db];B[fa];W[cb]
;B[fd];W[qm]C[This seems bad to me. W should not let F17 group alone ...
I thought W joseki clever, because it left F17 facing K17, which could be easily reinforced.

** I don't see anything really bad for black with this. The white posistion looks less stable.  The stones at P17 and K17 are extended too far.  They could be cut in two.  White made a good wall on the left side but it is a little crowded with the stone at C12 (better would have been C11).  The black group at F17 is doing fine.  couldn't ask for a better shape.  The black stones in the upper right are also secure.  This would tell me that it is almost time to play something like M17.  One of the white groups will suffer.

Also at this point white took the very big point at R7.  The problem is with the string of stones on R.  They aren't doing enough and still don't have good shape.

The last big move in the opening is at K3 and black needs it at this point because white took R7.]
;B[qk]C[This is OK, but you should take the largest point on the board in the opening before attacking.  If you took K3, you have a much better position to attack the white group.

Since you asked for help in the opening, I will finish the commentary here.  I made a few notes answering your questions in the later parts of the game, but I didn't write much from here on out.  I hope it helps.

** IT looks like White was playing like he was far behind.  Cutting everywhere and hoping there would be a mistake he could take advantage of.  Which he did by living in the center.  Notice how much territory you actually made in the center with the stone at G5. It really isn't very much.  It is always better not to play for center territory because it is usually easy to play keshi.  You got a lot more territory on the top because of white's plays.  Use walls to attack your enemy, as you attack create territory, or more strength in another part of the board. The move at G5 was not attacking anything.  It's whole purpose was to secure center territory which is not always a good idea.]
