;B[pd]C[I am black.   I think I got off to a reasonable start, but lost some ground in the middle game.   I'm just looking for general comments.   At various places I have placed comments and questions about what I think is going on, but please correct me if you disagree.  Thanks.

-Calvin];W[dc];B[dq];W[pq];B[ce];W[ed];B[co]LB[ci:A]C[Usually black will pull back at about 'A', but I felt going for a shimari is okay, too.

----------------------------------------------

i fell ok.];W[df];B[cg]
(;W[cd]C[i looked at gobase - joseki section. and i didn't find a move like c 16 for w.

Maybe he could continue (look at to the variation)]

;B[or];W[jq];B[hq]C[Pushing toward the wall, but there is a defect in the wall, so maybe something is wrong here.

----------------------------------------------

Not wrong.];W[np];B[op];W[jo];B[kp]LB[ho:A]C[Maybe I should have just jumped at 'A' (H5) instead of peeping.

--------------------------

Yes. A is better. Try to make box like shapes. and also A put pressure to the group with the thickness. than you could play the previous variation for example.]
;W[iq]C[I think this move just helps black.

---------------------------------------

I think not ;)];B[hp];W[io]C[With 30 white is in good shape]
;B[no];W[kq];B[lp]LB[ok:B][gn:C][mp:A]C[Maybe 'A' (N4) instead?   'B' (P9) and 'C' (G6) are also big.

-----------------------------

the white group is in good shape, he has on eye at the bottom for sure. So move 33 or A are little.

B is a good point to play i guess...];W[mq]C[Little...];B[lq]
;W[lr];B[mp];W[mr];B[hr];W[ir];B[de]LB[dg:A]C[More usual at 'A' (D13).


---------------------------

yes A is better, look at the variation];W[nc];B[qf];W[qh];B[oc]
LB[pb:A]C[The following moves may be too aggresive for black.  Maybe black should have just played at 'A' (Q18).

A or P17 is ok.];W[nd];B[kd]

--------------------

You are right.];B[kc];W[lb];B[kb];W[ob];B[pb];W[od];B[pc];W[mb]

(;B[hc]C[This move seems kind of slow for black to me now.

i think l14 is better. puts pressure to white group...];W[jb]

Not gote see the variation]

-----------------------

AFter R9, yes.];W[rm];B[gn];W[ho];B[go];W[hs];B[ks]TR[gs]C[This is probably a slip for black.   If black just played G1, white J1, black connects, white still needs do defend this group.   I think black lost a lot of points with this.   Do you agree?

-----------------------------


White is very probably alive so it's better to play at G1];W[gr]
