CEG: I wasn't terribly happy with Q15 afterwards...should I instead  have played a pincer against white O3?  Or D10?  Or K17?

Olaf: This is not an easy question, at least not for me. :-) I would say, that your aproach-move is ok. I would prefer R15 but perhaps this is a matter of taste.

C[Olaf: this way you let white build up a wall against the upper left corner. This wall will make it difficult to aproach the corner later for you.

C[Olaf: maybee now it is time to pincer at the bottom. Sure, you feel uneasy about the possible moyo on the top. But now a pincer becomes ideal for white. If you pincer at the bottom and white plays E16, you still can enter the top or build up the bottom area. If instead white answers your pincer at the bottom, you get both the pincer and the play at the top.

;W[hc]
C[Olaf: now you see the drawback of the sequence in the upper right. This move acts as a pincer and at the same time it builds territory on the edge.

C[Olaf: it is a little bit risky tostrenthen your opponent in just that direction where you are weak. I would prefer H15 immidiatly.

;W[kg];B[lh]
(;W[kh]
C[Olaf: in my eyes this move is an overplay and gives away a lot. first, there is the cutting point at L14. This point will help black in the following fight. second it doesn't affect the weak black group and third, it induces a reply at M11, which is great for black.

;B[he]
C[
CEG: I'm not sure about this move either (H15).  I thought it put a  little pressure on H17, and also threatened to creep over toward the  L14 cutting point, while giving a little more space to my weak group.  But is white strong enough in this area that H15 was an overplay?

Olaf: Doing something to help your weak group now seems absolutly necessary now.
]
;W[id]
C[Olaf: its hard to find a good answer for white. Perhaps this is the safest move at all.

C[Olaf: now white has suffered a big loss. the black group is safe and the amount of territory white gained on the top isn't that big. What is more, white has a weak group in the center and while black can attack it, black can hack a plan against the stone at O3.
]
;B[dg]
C[
CEG: I couldn't decide between pressing on white's upper left corner  (expanding my influence and making a little territory) or playing  on the bottom or right.  I thought about putting pressure on O3 in  order to gain influence to use against white's center group, but his  group seemed to have a lot of open space to play with.

Olaf: To give you a hint for decision in such a position: Your group is safely connected due to the capture of L12/13, so you don't need to reinforce it. Second (and you found it out by yourself) there is a weak group around N11 and the aproache stond at O3 on which you can put some pressure. 
The focus should therefor be clearly somewhere in the lower right quarter of the board. White would be happy to play around F3 next as this stone would help O3, the center stones and would be a kakari against blacks corner. So you should play at the bottom first, perhaps at K4

C[
CEG: Another tough decision, and I don't know that P5 was the answer.  I didn't want white to play around Q12, but maybe Q10 could have  escaped.  Playing a purely defensive move seemed out of the question.  Suggestions?

Olaf: The right is small compared to the bottom.

C[
CEG: I'm not sure whether or not this exchange was good for me...I  secured the top, but white's obviously going to get a lot of  lower/center territory.  It seemed bearable at the time, and I  thought that K10 and something around F7 were both potential entries  or reducing points.

Olaf: The bottom has gone away and with it the chance to build up a moyo for black. Now you has to take the right side, so your move here seems to be ok. Lets try to count some points now: White has 12 points in the upper left, 25 points at the top and about 35 points at the bottom, makes a total of about 72.5 points. Black has 30 points on the left and 30 points on the right and around 15-20 points in the center, makes about 75-80 points. There are no weak groups left so the game is nearly the endgame. there are some very big engame moves left at R15, R3 so perhaps white can catch up a little. I would think, it is still a close game.

C[Olaf: this is big, but perhaps R16 is bigger.

C[Olaf: Here white should abandon some stones. The focus of the center is around J9 because it effects both territories, black and white.

C[
CEG: Kind of a questionable move by me, I think.  Maybe the whole  sequence starting with L9 wasn't correct.  I thought about H6 instead  of G6, but I thought that white had slight weaknesses at G4, F6, and  the J6 group that I might be able to exploit.  Thoughts?

Olaf: i like G6. the whole sequence from K10 on is a big success for black. It limits whites territory and gains a lot of territory for black too.

C[
CEG: Tough decision here.  The lower corner I'm giving up is worth no  small amount, probably slightly bigger than what I stand to gain up  top.  But I thought that the top might leave some possibilities to  threaten his group.  In retrospect, probably not the right choice.]
