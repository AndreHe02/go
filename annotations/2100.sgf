[qf][rf]C[Traditionally it is considered polite for black to open in the upper left corner, on the lower half of that corner.  So Q16 is correct.  Some people ignore this tradition online, but I see no reason for this.]

(;B[nc]C[may be not the nest place to invade ? Better move ?

This is a common mistake -- O17 is already feeling pressure from K17.
There is no potential for this stone to make a large territory.  You are not thinking about your own territory, but simply scared that white will get "too much".  So to reduce white's chances you play a move that has no possibility for yourself. R14 is much better.]
;W[pg];B[kd]C[This is a little vague, I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish here, maybe R17 directly is better.]

O2 is possible but I would not play it here.
See the variation.];W[nr];B[mr]C[N3 is correct, this is a mistake.]
;W[rp];B[ro]
(;W[sq]C[wrong move, see variations];B[qo];W[pc]
(;B[pb]C[you should live R17, but killing w's bottom group is big too. Also R16 is possible but not necessarily better than Q18 here.
See variations for both.];W[qd];B[rc]C[S18 is considerably better.]

(;W[rd]C[w should P18 without question];B[ob]C[correct play ?

Absolutely.  W let you get away easy by playing at S16, now you have to play here or (or P17) or w will P18 and the corner will die.]
;W[qi]
(;B[qj]C[S2 instead now, the biggest move on the board by a large margin]
;W[om]C[ambitious play by white ?

This stone can run, but while it runs b will make territory.  A move at C6 for w is much better.]

(;B[lm]C[correct capping ?


maybe a little loose, see variations for two other possibilities.  You may also ignore P7 and tenuki, C8 looks nice.]
;W[cn];B[co];W[bn]
(;B[bo]C[may be better B3 ?

You are right that B5 is the wrong idea, but B3 is actually worse.  D6 is the move here.]
;W[jj]C[D6 now is big and sente, you should play it.]
(;B[mk]C[too small.  you can capture P7 on a larger scale, or you can tenuki and let it run.  pulling out P7 will be hard for w and will only help you.  So I say ignore instead.]
;W[jm]
(;B[ko]C[small];W[jo]TR[jj][jm]C[How to deal with this ?

There's not much need to "deal with" it, just leave it be and play a big move like D6, or C14, or of course S2 which is still the biggest move on the board.]
;B[hp];W[lh]C[White already seems to have established a big framework while mine is small and threatened.

W does have a big framework, but it is only that... a moyo, not territory.  Invade!]
;B[cf]C[And b invades :-)];W[fc];B[ci]C[C12 is better];W[cj]
;B[cc]C[Right way to invade ? Maybe E16 was better ?


C17 is possible, but it conflicts with the moves you already played.  See the variation for w at 54.]
;W[cd];B[bd]
(;W[dc];B[cb]C[B18 is the correct move, again, same mistake as in the UR corner.  Or you can give up the corner and play at B15.]

(;W[ef]C[extremely slack];B[df]C[looks kinda useless now...

Yes it is almost completely useless, C15 instead stays connected.]
;W[eg];B[di];W[be]C[guess I played too late

yes, w finally plays here, now either C14 or C18 group will die.]
;B[bc];W[ce]
(;B[ae]C[this doesn't connect and doesn't help the corner live.  However it makes it more likely that C14 stones will die.  Not the best move.]

;B[bj]C[hopeless];W[bk];B[bi];W[ho]C[Here the frame work becomes more solid and I'm not able to do something about it

W is a bit aggressive to play this contact move, it's actually rather bad.  You should play at G5 and push into his moyo.]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[ck]C[bad idea

Yes.];W[dk]C[and expensive as it turns out];B[cl];W[bl];B[cm]

(;B[jp]C[better to play H6 here ? May be something else ?

Simple moves are often best.  You can't really H6, but why not just connect?]

(;W[kc]C[too soft, see variation];B[lc];W[mf]
(;B[ne]C[play O14 and go for the fight ?

W is quite strong on this part of the board... see the variation.]
;W[nf];B[db]C[not a great move... may be just play J13 or H13 ?

Of course w can play D18 at any time and you must defend, but when you play it, you still must defend after w E18.  So in effect this move gives away sente.  J13 or H13 are not possible, you are just giving stones away if you play there.]
;W[eb];B[ab]C[now w has sente, so you are right, D18 was not so great.]

Moves like this lose liberties and buy you nothing. S11 indeed is better, and of course S2 is still there]

I've seen very strong players miss atari before, don't worry about it.]

C[K6 fixes the same weakness but doesn't lose points, play there instead]

(;W[pr];B[rr];W[os]
(;B[ms]C[Big mistake on two accounts... much better to play R1

R1 is better and S3 is even better, but there's another possibility... tenuki.  Even if you tenuki, w cannot live here.]
;W[mq]C[this is a good move by white


It's w's only hope, but actually this move doesn't work unless you make a mistake.]

(;B[lq]C[another mistake...


see variation.  Don't atari automatically, read first];W[mp]
;B[np]C[of course this doesnt work];W[lr]TR[lf][kg][lg][kh]
[ki][rp][pq][qq][sq][nr][or][pr][os]C[This is the end I resigned.

I think I could have quite easily won by being a little more secure regarding the marked group I lost and the White corner group which could have been killed. Even though the problem with white's huge moyo persists, please advice.

Actually, see the variation starting at move 153, playing a normal yose for both, without the missed atari, and if w does not even try to make S4 group live, the result is very close, within two points, so in fact the game may be determined by yose mistakes even if w dies and the L13 stones survive.  The biggest problems in this game were losing the groups on the left side after C17, and invading at O17 which gave you a fairly small group on top.

Many thanks,
Lothar.

You are welcome!  If you have any questions about the review, you can usually catch me on KGS and I'll go over it with you, or you can email or IM me.
