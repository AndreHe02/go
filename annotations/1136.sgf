AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi,
my name is Peter. You didn't ask any questions, so I will go through the points of interest, as I see them.]
;W[dd];B[pj];W[jp]
(;B[im]LB[fp:E][gp:F][mp:C][np:B][fq:D][nq:A]C[It seems to me, that b(lack) has no idea, how to attack W(hite). The first move was ok, getting a strong right side and the chance of a double wing extension. But now b plays too straight to shut w in. This stone leaves w many consecutive plays (A-F), but misses to strengthen B's position.
Try not to kill w at any rate, but to put pressure on him and thus take profit on your own.
See variation.];W[jd];B[kf]C[That's the same problem as before. The b stones are played too losely and don't work together as good as they could've done.]
;W[dj]C[A nice double wing with potential to cut off the L(ower) L(eft) corner. But you should think of strengthen the marked stone before getting under attack.]
;B[ie];W[id];B[he];W[hd];B[gf]LB[ge:A]TR[hd][id][jd][he][ie]
C[If b wants to play for a big moyo in the center (what I certainly wouldn't wamt to), he should play at A. Why creating artificial cutpoints? b leads in the race between the marked groups and has no reason to pull back.
But why a center moyo?
It's very hard to close a center moyo, namely against a stronger player. In this situation b forces w to ensure a territory, which he should have to fight for, but now gets for free. And B gets only a wall facing a foreseeable invasion. If W gets save territory too early, he has a nice backup for many forms of destructive play.]
;W[md];B[le]C[same as before.];W[ld];B[me]
(;W[nq]LB[md:A][cn:C][fq:B]C[Good, but a stronger b player wouldn't have waited for you. This move is bigger as A was. Another option is B or C.
see variation.];B[no];W[op];B[oo];W[pq];B[po];W[rq];B[lp]LB[lq:A]
C[There is a cutpoint at A, but in b's moyo strategy this move is logical.]
;W[lq];B[kp];W[kq];B[jo];W[ip];B[np]
(;W[so]C[Too early for this endgame monkey jump. There is stil much left at the LL corner.

(;B[fi]C[Forget this center moyo idea until you are 5k. There are other possibilities.
Here you can try to cut off the marked stone or attack the UL corner.
see variation.];W[dg];B[ee];W[ed];B[fe];W[de]C[That's pretty easy for w.]

[jj:E][sk:D][cn:B][cp:F][gq:A]C[So much for the moyo. Now it's time for b to change strategy. That means: Attack the w LC group, save the LL and UR corner. Think about moves like A-C, or at least D-F.]
;B[df];W[cf];B[eg];W[ch]C[These cuts are no danger!];B[cn]C[Good!]
;W[cm];B[bj]C[As said before; no danger.];W[cj];B[bl];W[bm]

C[no danger.
Better play is local at A or B (see move 225), but most important is to save the UR corner by playing C. That move also looks far into the w upper side, thus combining attack and defense in a nice way.]

Nice game.
Black did well to try to get territory by playing solid moves. But look for the corners and sides. Better to save a corner at the right time with a defensive move (even if you are not very fond of fighting) than to hope for a big moyo which can't be saved.
Try to play functional moves. No in betweens like "I play somewhere nearby the opponent's stones, maybe it is some kind of attack or defense."
If you are afraid to fight, play moves to strengthen your own stones and put pressure upon the other by taking territory instead of placing loose stones in the area. Connect your stones and let them work together. The better you get in this, the better the fights will come out for you.
It's hard to say much about White. It was a bit easy, so you tended to play a bit lazy, not always searching for the biggest move on the board and so giving away a few unnecessary points.

Maybe you should try again with five stones. That gives Black the chance to develop his defensive style and White has to play concentrated to improve his board-reading and fighting skills.

I really would like to see such a game, if you play it to comment your improvements.

Hope, I could help a little and you enjoy this review. If there are any questions, feel free to ask.

Bye, Peter])
