C[

i would like to know if i can kill the bottom right and bottom left group also can the black group on the left live, thank you.

(dv) I will answer these questions as well as point out some strategic issues. I hope the review will be useful.

;B[hc];W[cd];B[de];W[kc];B[he];W[gd];B[ie];W[ff];B[ch]C[(dv) Fairly normal moves up to this point.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[cn]LB[fq:a][qh:b][qc:c][qi:d]C[(dv) You are extending from your strong side. This goes against conventional wisdom. The left side has become uninteresting after 14 and 15. Instead, approaching at 'a', forcing him to develop towards a stable position, is better locally.

Globally, I'm not sure it is wise to tenuki from the top. You have one weak group (7-11-13) already and you want to keep it that way, so leaving 1-17 as a target for attack at 'b' may be problematic. Therefore I'd be inclined to defend at 'c' or 'd'.]
;W[cl]C[(dv) Consequently, pincering here is a bad decision: W20 can't develop towards Black's strength and Black has hands free to play with B19.]
;B[en];W[fq]
(;B[cj]LB[el:a]C[(dv) This is also a bad choice, for the same reasons still. Black is strong there and should attack from his weak stones towards his strong stones, at 'a'. See the variation.]
;W[dk];B[qj]LB[ei:a][fi:b]C[(dv) This is a very big point but I would prefer to keep White separated with 'a' or 'b']
;W[fk];B[gm]LB[gn:a]C[(dv) The keima is a move to attack. You are not in a position to attack, now that you have "tenuki-ed" at 25. Ikken tobi at 'a' is the move to defend here]
;W[di];B[ci];W[eh]C[(dv) this connection is the price you pay for the tenuki at 25 and I think the price is too high:

White has no weak groups anymore and can attack freely. Black has two weak groups now and a third one on the left which is surrounded. As far as the balance of power is concerned, Black is behind.]
;B[jp]LB[ld:a][nd:b][gp:c]C[On the other hand, Black now makes a double extension and builds a large moyo. There will come territory off this moyo so you are not in a hopeless position. But your weak groups are problematic.

You may now think of forcing moves like 'a', 'b' or 'c' to connect your weak groups.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[bk];B[dj];W[ej]
(;B[ck]C[bad move i think don't know what i was thinking

(dv) We'll have a look at this L&D situation.  First of all, although your group is surrounded and in need of attention, it doesn't look easily killable. Yes, your move takes away a liberty.]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[bj];B[bi];W[bg];B[dh];W[ei];B[eg];W[fg];B[ef]
;W[cg]LB[dg:a][el:b]C[apparently this group is dead in your assessment. I disagree. See var 2.  Also, after the connection at 'a', you can exploit his weakness at 'b'.]

(;B[cq];W[cp];B[bp]
(;W[dq]C[dv: This is the wrong side: W lets B settle a weak group and gets a weak group in return; See var for a way to keep Black under pressure.]
;B[bq];W[iq];B[hr]LB[jq:a]C[(dv) This move shows anger and revenge. If you calmly welcome his bad move  54 by playing at 'a', you recover already from your (alleged) loss at the top left.]
;W[hq];B[gq];W[gr];B[gp];W[er];B[jq];W[ir];B[jj]C[(dv) Good. Now we have a moyo against a captured group (which still isn't properly captured).]
;W[qn];B[rp];W[ql];B[ok]C[dv: Good attacking move: here you ARE in a position to attack and the keima does just that.]
;W[om];B[ml];W[oo];B[np]LB[op:a]C[dv: 'a' would be stronger]
;W[op];B[oq];W[ro];B[rl]LB[rm:a][rk:b]C[(dv) If you want to keep this group under pressure, this attachment is wrong; His shape point is 'a' and you give it to him in sente. You should play 'a' yourself or 'b' and/or play tenuki.]
;W[rm];B[rk];W[po];B[qp];W[sn];B[pl];W[pm];B[no];W[nn];B[mn]
;W[ke]LB[ld:a][nd:b]C[(dv) This is a painful move. Your moyo gets reduced and your weak group is now cut off. Therefor, one of the previous moves had better connected these stones, such as the earlier suggested forcing moves 'a' and 'b'.]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[fb];W[ec];B[lb]C[(dv) This is either an endgame technique or a killing move, neither of which you are in the position for. See var.]

;W[qc];B[qd];W[rb];B[rd];W[ob];B[na];W[oa];B[nd];W[qa]C[(dv) this group was never killable]
;B[jg];W[ic];B[ib];W[hd];B[lf]C[This is a big move.];W[id]LB[fo:a]
[nq:b][mo:c][pq:d]C[(dv) With tis move, White is connected and has more territory than Black. 

That is, if we believe the left side to be dead, which I don't.

The game is not necessarily lost, but there are many weaknesses in Black's position and none in White's. See for instance 'a' to 'd'.

To conclude: the whole game became biased due to both players misjudging the left side as "Black dead". Whenever you would have connected at D13 you'd have won the game, because White has played rather meekly after his alleged capture.

(;B[el];W[dj];B[eh];W[fj];B[gh]LB[cp:a][ep:b]C[(dv) through the invasion, White has helped Black to curl around the White corner. 19-21-23 are weak but light. 20-24-26 are also weak but rather heavy. I mean by this that Black has more possibilities to settle himself, e.g. the attachments at 'a' or 'b'.]
