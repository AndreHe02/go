;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[nc];B[lc]C[I don't think that I would play here.]
;W[qc]C[Good.];B[qd]C[This is the wrong direction.];W[pc];B[od]

(;W[mb]C[This is the wrong shape.];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd]TR[mc]
(;MA[oc][ob]C[With your diagonal move, black's shape is a lot stronger, thanks to the black atarti at the triangled point.

Note that black should probably not play the exchange marked with squares until later. It jsut fills one of black's own liberties.]

(;W[pj]TR[qd]C[Basically good. Now we see why black's block at the marked point was in the wrong direction. White has room to wedge* on the side, so black's thickness will go to waste.

* Just to make sure that we are both using the same terminology:

A "wedge" is a move on the side between two of your opponents postions, so that which-ever side they approach from you have room to make a 2-space extension on the other side, and hence you get a settled group in their area, instead of a weak group.

This should be compared to:

An "invasion" is when you play a stone inside you opponents area which does not have space to make eyes locally and so will end up running into the middle as a weak group.

So with that in mind I woudl strongly suggest that you would be better playing this move on the third line. You want to quickly build a settled group in front of your opponent's wall. The strongest group you can build with 2 stones is a 2 space extension on the second line.]

(;B[pi]C[This I don't undersand. Black should be trying to attack white, and you don't attack with contact moves. See the variation for a better move for black.]

(;W[qj]C[Daniel: ?

Tim: When you opponent plays a (seemingly) nonsense move ti can be very difficult to find a good reply. It is important to think clearly about what you want from the position and don't let yourself be confused. Also, the last thing you should worry about is your opponent playing bad moves! If your opponents move really was bad then it should be enought for you just to play ordinary moves and you will probably get a good result.

So what do you want here? We were just saying that you wanted a settles group in black's sphere of influence as quickly as possibly. So your next few moves seem fine.

The only worry is that this move might be a little bit slack. The hane you suggset as a variation also looks possible. Let's analyse it a bit, see the variation.

The conclusion seems to be that it gets very difficult for white after the cross-cut so this move is quite good.]
;B[oi]
(;W[qn]C[This is good. You want a base on the side and this is a 3-space extension from a 2 stone wall. Ideal.]
;B[qo];W[pn]
(;B[qi]C[Tmis seems to be a bit greedy of black. He really ought to defend at O4.]
;W[op]C[Good shape point locally. The problem is that in this game it results in black getting too much solid territory, and you don't get enough thickness in return.]
;B[oq]
(;W[np]C[Perhaps the problem is this move. Perhaps it is just too passive.]
;B[nq]
(;W[mp]TR[jp]C[You need to think on a bit here. How far do you want to go on crawling? If you go to far you will hit the marked black stone which won't be very nice. If you are going to stop crawling then you need to find an elegant way of doing that. In fact this move is O.K.]
;B[mq]C[Black would realy like to jump to M3 here, but that is jsut too thin, so he has to keep on "pushing the cart from behind."]
;W[po]C[This may be a little bit crude. You have another possible move here at the 3-3 point. It is a pity to eliminate that aji. In fact it might be better to play the 3-3 point move earlier.]
;B[qp];W[lp];B[lq]TR[kr]C[It is better shape for black to play at the marked point.]
;W[rd]C[This really is an endgame move. It is gote whoever plays it. There are much bigger moves on the right side of the board.]
;B[re];W[rc];B[oj];W[pl]C[This seems a bit timid but it does leave you with very strong shape.]
;B[nn];W[mm]C[Good.];B[ol];W[nm];B[pk];W[qk];B[ok];W[pm];B[kp]

(;W[ic]C[I don't think that this is the biggest move. Two reasons:

1) There is just room for black to play a wedge move at C11. A white move that prevents this makes it much harder for black to deal with the right side.

2) It is quite difficult for black to make much territory at the top. Black is open-skirted there because of the the white stone at N18. If black starts trying to surround territory there white can just leap in.]
;B[cl];W[ci]C[Good.];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[br];W[bq];B[cr]
C[The exchange in the corner seems fair enough.   What shoudl white do next. The biggest point on the board by far is the 3-3 invasion in the top left corner. On the other hand there is the situation near the bottom left corner with the one black stone and the white stones. There might be an urgent move here and the proverb says "Urgent points before big points."

It would be vary nasty if whte got attached here, Back L6 could well be sente against the group on the right, so balck is quite strong round here.]

(;W[dl]C[So all-in-all this defense is quite wise.];B[cc]TR[ic]
[ci]C[But you have to admit that this is a really obvious, realy good move for black. This is why it is often a good idea to avoid having two medium lenght extensions from a 4-4 point stone like the marked moves. They are too far away to help when defending the against the 3-3 invasion, but one of them ends up in the wrong place in realation to the wall you build. It would be much better for you if the stone at J17 was actually at F17, say.

Of course at the time both the marked stones were quite good moves, but perhaps this is a third reason why the move at J17 was not as big as it looked.]
;W[cd]C[Yes. This is definitely the wider side.];B[dc];W[ec]
;B[eb]
(;W[fc]C[Daniel: ?

Tim: I would definitely play double-hane. The problem with the normal line is that black ends in sente. It is really depressing for white if black lives in the corner in sente then reduces the white framework on the outside.

It shoudl be possible to make quite an intellegent choice in the corner. After the corner invasion the position will be settled enough to count. So we can bese out choice of what to play in the corner on those counts. Let's do that.]

(;B[eg]C[I think that this is too deep. We have seen that white needs to get about 20 points more than black in the middle, so black can afford to play a much more gentle reducing move that also expands the black territory on the right.]

Black: 78

I think. Black wins by about 20.

It is not totally clear where this margin of victory came from. What were the main mistakes?

11: Black blocked the wrong side.

(Unfortunately errors of direction in the opening are often quite small.)

18: White played on the 4th line, when the 3rd line was better.

But then black misplayed on the right edge so that this error got cancelled out.

25: Black played a greedy move completing his territory on the right instead of finishing the joseki. Perhaps he wasn't punished enough for that. The result was that black took a lot of territory at the bottom whilst white got something in the middle. The black territory at the bettom ended up being bigger than anything else really. Perhaps white needed a more aggresive approach round here.

(this maybe cost 10 points)

36: White played quiet a small hane-and-connect that was gote when there were plenty of big moves to be had.   (this maybe cost 5 points)

50: Black extended at the top rather than down the left. Perhaps this is like playing a 20 point move when there is a 25 point move available.

(this maybe cost 5 points)

61: Black invades the corner which is a good move. After this it is difficult for white to get enough territory to win. This invasion makes black 50 look decidedly sub-standard. But there doesn't seem to be any way that white could have prevented this invasion.

66: White doesn't double-hane. This makes black's life just a little bit too easy. Black lives in the corner in sente.

71: Black reduces white's centre too deeply.

72: but white refuses to attack and plays passively.

Nothing dramatic happens in the endgame so that's that.

You din't do anything that could be described as a blunder. But your opponent made even fewer mistakes. Could that be evidence that you weren't putting enough pressure on your opponent. In particular when you are loosing you can't afford to go quietly, which is one reason to count, and to practice counting until you can do it in the middle of a game without too much hassle.   Perhaps you should try being more aggressive for a bit. Playing too aggressively is a great way to lose a lot of games, but it is also a great way to learn a lot about fighting. Pay those double-hanes even if it seems a bit risky. The double hand can be a great tesuji - if it works - the best way to find out when it works and when it doesn't is the hard way. In following up aggressive moves like that it is important to be flexible. Often you play the double hane and then sacrifice one of the stones. But in exchange you get a few ataris and take profit somewhere else. You have to know the follow-ups of these aggressive moves. You also do need to be able to spot when these moves are just wrong because they are overplays. And you also need to learn how to punish them in this case.

Sometimes it is obvious that the aggrassive move is the right thing or the wrong thing. The you should do what you know is right. When it is boarderline It is much harder to know what to so so you should try "if in doubt doublt-hane" to find out in more detail which side of the boarderline various cases lie on. The following books cover this sort of thing:

A number of the problems in "Get strong at tesuji".

"Beyond forcing moves" is all about all-out plays.

If you've got a joseki dictionary have a look through that to see when double hane-s are, and are not applicable.

I don't quite know why I am focussing on double hane's here. They are jsut one particular example of agressive plays that you need to understand in order to become a strong player.

Of course once you do understand these moves a bit more you can go back to being cautious most of the time, playing good solid moves and winning by 5 points in the endgame. I approve of the sort of go that relies on good judgement rather than just hacking you opponent appart. But one reason to make strong poritions is so that you can attack safely later if the position merits it.]

Probably not. You are right that this is a big move. (Actually the marked knight's move may be better shape for achieveing the same purpose). But moving this way feels like an endgame move. Black is quite strong above, so this is just about how much territory black gets on the edge, it does not cause black to worry much. The middle game moves realy ought to be to do with keeping your opponent worrying, if only a little bit.

There is a resk that this move will be gote for whoever plays it. Would you be unhappy if your opponet gave up sente to wall of these 20 points? Bear in ming that black built his wall at the top in exchange for the corner territory, so you have already gained something from that.

The move in the game, approaching the corner is better because it threatens to black's thin position at the bottom.]

(;W[qi];B[qj]C[S what will happen after this cross cut? It is a difficult question. Let's start with three general principles:

1) Corss-cuts often lead to ladders. Be aware that almost any ladder starting round ehre is going to favour black. That makes white's life more difficuld.

2) Cruss-cut fights tend to lead to both side being strengthened. In general this shoudl be good for white. White is trying to build a settled group is black's area, black has a wall quite close by above. So white can aim for a result where whte ends up strong and black ends up over-concentrated.

3) The proverb says "Cross-cut? Extend!". Most of the Exceptions to this proverb apply when there are other stones nearby. There are very few stones nearby, so an extension is probably correct.]
