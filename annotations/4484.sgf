C[*** Hi, I'm Alex.  Supposedly a 3d from Canada, but I haven't been playing as much in the past couple of years, so I'm a bit rusty.  I hope my comments are useful anyway...  I'll put them between "***" like this, to distinguish them from yours.

My #1 observation is that you're way too focused on territory in general, but especially in the first 50 or 75 moves of the game. I know the proverb is "corner, then sides, then centre," but that's only about where you place the stones, not where you make territory.  Remember that a stone in the corner might not be there to make corner territory; a stone at 4-4, for instance, is aiming to make big moyos on the sides.

It would be incorrect for me to say that invading 3-3 is ALWAYS wrong, but maybe you should pretend it is, for a while.  It's usually not worth taking a small corner territory if you make your opponent really strong in the process.  

Anyway, try not to be greedy, play patiently, make good shape, don't make weak groups, and your game will improve.

(;B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cc];B[ic]C[To reviewer:
Which side does this result favour?

*** White, I would imagine.  The exchange of B D16 for W C16 is a beginner's mistake, strengthening White for no reason.  I believe the alternative sequence I showed is joseki. Either way, White is bound to get a lot of territory after Black chooses the approach at E16 instead of D17.  I'm not convinced the top side is big enough at this point to have justified that approach, so that's another plus for White.  Lastly, because White's corner is so strong, she can aim at the G18 invasion later without worrying about losing her base.]
;W[jq]C[To reviewer:
Best move?

*** It's very hard to talk about "best" moves in the opening.  This looks okay to me though.  Because the result in the top left put you ahead in the balance of territory, breaking up Black's sphere of influence and preventing the game from turning into a moyo battle seems like a good plan.  R6 would also have been possible. ***]
;B[cj]C[To reviewer:
Is this black's best move?

*** Absolutely not.  The top left corner is settled, so the left side is very small.  Black has played a pretty terrible opening so far. A couple more mistakes like this and he will have given you an advantage about equal to komi. 

Q10 or R10 is clearly better than this, but G3 and R14 are also moves I'd consider as Black. ***]

(;W[mq]C[To reviewer:
Is this too slow?
I was thinking of strengthening the stone for later 3-3 invasions

*** Yes, I think it's too slow, because there's only one big point left on the board - R10/Q10... so you can either play there immediately, or you can approach Black's corners, but only if you're going to get sente in the process.  I tend to play a fleet-footed opening, so my instinct would be to play as in the variation. ***]
;B[nc]
(;W[lc]C[To reviewer:
o-17 occupied a good point... I couldn't think of what to do

*** You can't panic every time it looks like your opponent is starting to get a moyo.  A pincer is a bad idea here because Black is strong on the top side.  I'd probably play R13 or R14.  Q14 would be a bad idea because then Black R10 would be too good. See variations. ***]
;B[md];W[qg]C[*** This is inconsistent.  Why exchange M17 for N16 if this is where you wanted to play?  Imagine Black plays M16 now... see variation for some tewari. ***]

(;B[qf]C[To reviewer:
What should I do? Was it a mistake earlier on that lead to this?

*** Well, this is a bad move for Black... just Q14 should be fine, as long as you're willing to make some sort of exchange. ***]
;W[pf];B[qe]
(;W[qd]C[*** This is your big mistake.  You can't have everything!  You have to give Black the corner and use your thickness to rescue M17 and attack Black's two stones.  See variation. ***]

This is wrong probably. Maybe I should just invade 3-3. Or is there a better place?

;B[hq];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co]C[To reviewer:
Is this correct? What kind of weakness would it lead to?

C[To reviewer:
Should I invade 3-3 now or is q-2 better?

*** Stop thinking about territory!  Think about attacking.  His stones on the right are still weak, so you can attack those... but also, B7 is a bad move that leaves many cutting points.  I think you should exploit those immediately. ***]

(;B[kc]
(;W[mf]C[To reviewer:
Maybe I should have played somewhere around a-11 instead

*** A11?  I don't understand what you mean.  There's no tesuji around there. I think you want to press Black with R11 and D13 and take control of the centre. See variation ***]
;B[pi]C[*** Now the game isn't so easy for you because you missed your chance to press at R11. ***]

What should I have done?

*** Hard to say... there isn't much territory in the centre anymore, so your main goal is to stop Black from getting anymore and hope your four corners are enough to win.  From that point of view, this looks like the right direction, but it's hard to say exactly where the best point is. ***]
;B[rm]C[To reviewer:
A bunch of moves following seemed like wandering without reason. Not sure about a lot of hands.

*** This is a pretty big endgame move for Black.  I think you have to continue reducing the right side now that he's blocked you off from this side.  O8, maybe? ***]

dumb move

Nice play by black, probably sure to lose now

To reviewer:
Thank you!

*** You're welcome.  There were a lot of greedy and/or careless moves by both sides in this game.  Try to focus more on steady play - attacking your opponent's weak groups, and strengthening your own - rather than on grabbing territory and freaking out and invading every time your opponent looks like he might get a few points.  Go is a long game... if you try to grab all your territory in the first 50 moves then spend the rest of the game hoping to stop your opponent from making any, you're probably going to lose.  If you make good shape and keep your groups strong, you will maintain pressure on your opponent and will see a lot of territory appear for you later on in the game, while his territories will get smaller and smaller. ***]
