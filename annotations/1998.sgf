C[Hi Dreamrace,

My name is Walther, I'm about 5k AGA. There wasn't any fighting in this game, so I can't really comment on your tactical strengths and weaknesses. Still, shape played an important part of the game; bad shape made white development very difficult. 

Looking over the game, it seems that what really defeated you was the lack of development in your upper left star point. Part of this was due to the plays in the bottom left (tried to do too much) and top right (perhaps should have chosen a different approach). Also your followup to  "too greedy" move on the bottom ended up hurting you because black pushed you down, totally dominating the center. That center group (together with Black c8) was definitely a sore point in terms of white's development. 

On the positive side, you play reasonable moves in a local context (which can be surprisingly difficult) And you were able to keep the endgame margin equal even though black had a great advantage in terms of thickness. Now, you just need to set yourself up a little better, everything else will follow.

Please keep in mind i'm only 5k, many of my comments are probably incorrect to stronger amateurs and pros, but hopefully they'll get you thinking about the things that you need to improve on. I'm sorry if the commentary is disjointed or overwhelming. Please let me know if you have feedback or questions.]

(;W[cq]C[This move is unnecessary for a number of reasons: if you plan on pressing down at d6. Playing at c3 first means you plan on settling yourself on the bottom. See variations here and at w10. There are a lot of variations for the 4-5 point, you might refer to senseis.xmp.net for some info.]
;B[bq];W[dq];B[bo]
(;W[dn]C[Normally at j3 instead];B[cm];W[dm];B[cl]
(;W[kq]C[a little greedy of me i think

W: It depends on what you're trying to do. If you're trying t take territory immediately, the normal move at j3 is better, but overconcentrated (because of your tall wall). If you're trying to build a moyo, having pushed c8 from behind makes a reducing move at e9 very easy for black. I guess this all leads back to playing c3 and d6 trying to get everything, but not getting a great result.]
;B[jp]LB[kp:B][nq:A]C[maybe variation is better.

W: variation is probably better, although the variations of shoulder hits are beyond my complete understanding. In the game, o3 could have been dangerous.

See var. on your var. for a more playable game for white.]
(;W[nq]C[overplay. I guess, after some thought, that black's resulting thickness makes game almost unplayable for white]

;B[kp];W[lq];B[ip];W[hq];B[hp];W[gq];B[kl]C[this black group is not really attackable. Your wall made the opponent give you territory, but was it enough?]

(;W[od]C[if you don't want black to pincer, you can try o16 or o17. Another way to play is k16. See vars]
;B[mc];W[md]C[Here, we have another choice of joseki. o15 is another common choice that is probably a bit lighter and separates black. Attaching forces black to solidify his position around k16, which is exactly where you want to play to develop your star point stone]
;B[ld];W[me];B[nc];W[oc];B[ic]LB[pe:C][of:B][pf:A]C[C might have some more playable variants]

(;W[pf]C[perhaps the fifth line is better?

W: Since black decided to protect the side, you should be able to attack the corner more severely. see some variations. Otherwise, I can't say fourth or fifth line is better]
;B[pe]LB[oe:A][qf:B]
(;W[oe];B[qf];W[pg];B[qg];W[le]C[This move is aji-keshi (removing possibilities) because it removes any chance of invasion, and it doesn't give white much more space. q12, on the other hand, is huge.

At this point, though, you should ask yourself who's ahead, and where you can develop the most territory (or where you can prevent black's.

Choices are: q12 to prevent bad shape, help for upper left (which looks very small now) and attacking the center group (very difficult).]
;B[kd];W[dl]C[This move is bad. Although innocuous, it may be the only move until now which definitely has negative value. You are gaining nothing in the center because black is not very weak. on the left, you not only give black more territory, you are preventing your own expansion from your star point.

Plus, q12 is urgent (urgent before big points)];B[cj];W[fk]
C[this move is a bit nebulous. Doesn't really attack black]
;B[hk];W[dj]C[another bad push from behind];B[ci];W[cf];B[ph]
C[this point is huge, pushing white into small shape (a pro commentator might say that white's shape crumbles) while expanding black's moyo (almost solid territory). After this, there is almost no chance for white.]
;W[oh];B[oi]C[very good for black];W[nh];B[ni];W[pi]C[too early

W: in itself, not too early. you can leave it and aim at it later, playing at q7 or so]

;B[mi];W[nn]C[The game is now in endgame (yose). This move is small; no points, no attack or defense. e17 is probably your best bet here. White is in a difficult position here because of black q12 (I count maybe 15 points behind already, with more potential for black).]
