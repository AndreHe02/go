C[Hi im white in this game and im from KGS.
I would really like advice on the opening moves and how
to make better shape, middle game advice would also be
appreciated :).
Thanks for reviewing :D

MM-  I am Mike Malveaux, "wegobad" on go servers, 6k in the AGA, and I am happy to make this review.  Thanks for asking the GTL!

For further study of the opening, you can download Kogo's Joseki Dictionary at http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm
Also, please see Sensei's Library at http://senseis.xmp.net/?Joseki
For making good shape and middle game fighting, the best bet is to study life and death problems.  There are some at GoProblems, http://www.goproblems.com/ and other places.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd]C[i dont really like playing both 4-4 points because leaves
both corners open but i read something that if the variation
was to go like 3 it would be very good for black and bad
for white do u have any ideas?
d3 is fine??

MM-  I feel that playing both 4-4 points is ok.  Check out 
http://senseis.xmp.net/?NiRenSei
for some ideas.

D3 also would be fine.]
(;W[dp];B[fd]
(;W[ec]C[MM- E16 seems too tentative.  The usual move is at F17, but that joseki seems too good for Black here.  Other possibilities given by Kogo's Joseki Dictionary are D14,  K16, a pincer, or tenuki.  Kogo's says H17 or H16 pincers are good if there is support on the top, which is not the case here, so perhaps those are not best.  I think I would advise D14, patient and strong.]
;B[fc]C[MM- The obvious move.  Seems to work well with the Q16 stone.]
;W[dg]TR[df]C[i was gonna play a one space jump but it seemed to slow
and then i got cut kind of and i think made bad shape

MM-  The one-space jump to D14 is correct, not "too slow" but rather "strong".  A 6-dan used to tell me, "make your stones strong, then you can do anything you want".  On the 4th line, this two-space jump gives Black too many chances to cut, I think.]
;B[de]C[maybe should of played    c15 =/];W[ee]TR[ce]C[MM-  I'm not sure.  At first I thought this was reckless because it invites Black E16.  As I tried different variations, it seemed like White could get at least an even result, because the Black D15 stone is not strong.  In fact it may be that E15 is correct, and White C15 would be too submissive... I'm not sure.  I would play C15, and look for O17 when a chance comes later.]
;B[ed];W[dc];B[ef];W[ce]C[MM-  Good.];B[df];W[cf];B[eg]C[MM-  Overall, this seems good for Black.  But there is still some aji in the dead White stone, and White gets sente, so this is not terrible for White.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[qf]C[MM-  Good timing, wrong direction I think.  Maybe this should be at O17 to disrupt Black's framework.  If Black now plays a normal move like O17, it looks like White will have trouble reducing Black.]
;B[qe]C[MM-  Black is helping you get stronger.];W[pf];B[nd]
;W[qk]TR[qj]C[i guess im gonna stop playing so loosely i would say i had
to kill black at this point or both groups would be very
weak

MM-  Yes, R9 is too loose.  R10 would be stronger.  On the other hand, R9 can make a good extension to R6, threatening the corner.  On the whole, I think R10 is safer.

I do not know which Black group you think you need to kill.  They all look strong to me.  If anything, I think White needs to make sure Black does not start cutting around the C16 and C13 points.]
;B[qi]C[MM- Black jumps right in, which seems too impatient to me.  I guess this is the Black group you felt you had to kill.]
;W[pi]TR[oj][pm][qn]C[MM-  The usual advice is do not play contact against a weak stone.  Rather, smother it from a distance.  All you have to do is cut off its escape routes and limit its eyespace, and it will die.  If it manages to live, it will be small, and you will have strong walls to help you throughout the rest of the board.

The natural follow-ups to a contact move will tend to make both players stronger in the local situation.  Since Black was outnumbered 3 to 1, why help Black get stronger here?  Also, your new stone has only 3 liberties.  True, the Black stone also has only 3 liberties now, but it's Black's turn to move.

So Q11 hurt you more than it helped.  P10 is what I probably would have played... or maybe something like Q7 or R6.]
;B[qh]C[MM-  A natural response to the contact move.];W[ph]
;B[qg]
(;W[rf]C[MM-  This might be too ambitious.  Maybe it's better to play the solid connection at Q13, allowing Black to connect underneath in gote, and trust your center thickness to create territory elsewhere.]
;B[qj];W[pk];B[pj];W[oj];B[pg];W[og]C[bad shape i guess but i was desperate]
;B[rk];W[rl]C[MM-  Bad shape can only make your desperation worse.  I think Black could have been more severe.]

(;B[ok]C[MM-  This does not seem right.  I think Black has stronger moves.]
;W[nj]
(;B[rm]C[he could of killed me with r8 guess he didnt see

MM- Hmm, I don't see it either.]
(;W[ql]TR[rj]C[MM-  This is very bad shape, the "empty triangle".  S10 would be much better.]
;B[qm];W[ol];B[nk];W[mk];B[rj]TR[sl]C[MM-  Black should play the T8 atari first.]
;W[sl]C[MM-  Good, you should punish Black's slack move like this.]
;B[sk]
(;W[of]C[MM-  Connects a scary-looking cutting point, but misses the chance to kill the Black group with T12 (see variations).]
;B[si]C[MM-  Black lives now.];W[nq]TR[np]C[MM-  Good timing, right area.  Good.  Maybe O4 would work better with White's strong center stones.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[oo];W[jp]C[MM- Excellent!];B[no];W[rd];B[qc]
;W[kd]C[MM-  Too loose, not connected to your strong P14 stones.]

(;B[jc]C[MM-  ?!?!  Why on earth would Black not cut?];W[kf]
TR[eh][eg][ef]C[MM-  Good, makes shape and starts to connect you, and since L14 ruins the value of Black's E14 wall, I think this is better than N15 (which is probably what I would have played).  Now get a stone near C6, and the game should be yours.]
;B[kc];W[ld];B[lc];W[mc]TR[di][cn][cq]C[MM-  Simultaneously too slow and too aggressive.  Of course Black will cut, wouldn't you if you were White?  What's wrong with simply getting a lot of points with something like C6 or C3?]
;B[md];W[me];B[ne];W[mf];B[if]C[MM- Too bad, White never got to peep at G14.  But that's ok, White has sente to grab the southwest corner.]
;W[ie]C[MM-  I'm not sure what you are after here.... You must still be in desperation mode.  If you look at the whole board now, there is no need for panic.]
;B[je];W[jf];B[jd];W[ig];B[hf];W[dj]C[MM-  Yes, finally!  Great move.]
;B[jg];W[jh];B[kg];W[lg];B[fq]
(;W[hq]C[MM-  I think it's better to play D3, since the K4-O4 stones are stable enough for now.  The best Black could do is make a small 4 or 5 points group while you get the corner and a larger side group.]
;B[dq]C[should of just played c3?];W[ep]C[MM- Yes, I think you're better with C3.]
;B[cp];W[eq];B[dr];W[co];B[bp];W[bo]TR[er]C[MM-  You might as well cut at E2 now, I think.]
;B[er];W[hh];B[hg];W[ih];B[fp];W[do];B[fo];W[dm];B[dl]C[MM-  This seems reckless, not sure what Black hopes to do here.]
;W[el];B[dk];W[ek];B[di];W[ci];B[ei];W[cj];B[ej];W[fm]TR[ho]
C[MM- Right idea (block off the center), wrong area.  How about H5 instead?]
;B[lp];W[lq];B[kq];W[kp];B[mq];W[lr];B[mp];W[kr];B[mr]TR[lm]
C[MM- Too slow.  The O3-O4 stones are only worth 6 or 7 points.  If this were at M7 instead, White's center would be ruined and I think Black would have the lead.]
;W[nl]C[i probably just looked at black's stones and thought he
could escape but  one point short];B[ln];W[kl];B[ki]C[MM-  This should not work because White is too strong throughout the center.]
;W[ij];B[kk];W[jk]TR[jl]C[MM-  Why create cutting points that dead stones can use to revive themselves?  The solid connection at K8 is far better.]
;B[jl];W[ll];B[ik];W[jj];B[hk];W[il];B[jm];W[hl];B[gj]C[MM-  A good reduction for Black.]
;W[gl];B[hn];W[sm]C[MM-  Nice endgame reduction.]
(;B[rn]C[MM-  Better at S5.];W[sn];B[ro];W[so];B[sq];W[rp];B[rq]
;W[sp];B[qp];W[pm];B[pn];W[on];B[po];W[rc]C[MM- Excellent!]
;B[rb];W[qd];B[pe]C[MM- Saving 1 stone is too small.];W[qb]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[ra];B[re];W[se]C[lucky for me =/

MM-  You can't afford T15, you should capture at T18 right away.  Now your S16 stones have only 2 liberties.]

(;B[oh]C[MM- Black is thrashing uselessly.  T18 would take back the corner.]
;W[oi];B[nh];W[nf];B[kh];W[kj];B[lh];W[mh];B[le];W[lf];B[ke]
;W[sf]C[misread this and thought top group was safe now but i
guess i was lucky since  he still never played it

MM-  Ah, I guess that's what you meant by "lucky for me" about 10 or 12 moves ago.]
;B[gh];W[sh];B[rg];W[sg];B[rh];W[mi];B[hr]C[MM- Overplay.  G2 is good enough, and this H2 is reckless.]
;W[gr]C[MM- Good way to punish Black's overplay.];B[iq];W[ir]
;B[gq];W[hp];B[en];W[em];B[dn];W[cn];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl]
;B[ao];W[an];B[ap];W[fr]C[MM- Wow, that's a huge capture at this stage of the game.  Even if he gets T18, I think Black is far enough behind that he can resign.]
;B[br];W[gn];B[ho];W[go];B[ip];W[gp]C[
he resigned here, i guess a little b4 centre and this since
he invaded and cut alot so this made me try to learn better
shape and play more solidly i guess
thanks for reviewing!

MM- Yes, I think you have a handle on what you need to practice -- better shape, and connecting more securely.  I would add two more concepts -- don't touch weak stones, because it helps them get stronger... Rather, surround them loosely at a distance.  And, don't create cutting points for the opponent to use against you.

Every few moves, make a habit of looking at the whole board.  As the game progresses, often you will see an area that was important is now not so important, and it's time to play somewhere else on the board.  Usually the player who realizes this first will gain a big advantage on the new battlefront.

It was my pleasure to review the game.  I hope my commentary is useful.  If you have questions or comments, especially if you find some of my mistakes, please contact me at mikem@hilltopgo.com
Happy games!
