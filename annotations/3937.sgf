C[Hi!
This is my first review. I'll try to answer your questions and point out major mistakes. I will also comment some of the black's moves. Enjoy!]
;B[pc];W[cp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qe];W[ci];B[fc]
(;W[cf]LB[hc:A]C[This move is too slow. White already has a stone at c11 and therefore should pincer the black stone for example at a. See variation]
;B[jd];W[pb]C[is tis a good move?

I think it is too early to play this move. Later it could be useful. But if you want to play it so early on, you could regard it as a probe to see which strategy your opponent chooses. Still, you should leave it there and not try to live with it immediately.]

(;B[qb]C[Wrong side. Black has more potential on the other side. See variation]

;W[ja];B[ic];W[rb];B[rc];W[qa];B[qc]C[The result is horrible for white. White has only 5 points of territory, whereas blacks strong position is worth much more. Crawling on the second line is almost always bad.]
;W[nq];B[sb];W[ra];B[sc]C[This and black t18 aren't necessary.]
;W[qj]LB[qg:D][ql:C][po:B][qo:A]C[is this a good move?

Yes, it is good to try to split black, and this move also reduces greatly the influence of the black's wall. White can look forward to double approaching at a or b or if black extends to c, white can be happy with c]
;B[pn];W[qg];B[ql]
(;W[oj]LB[rk:A]C[is A better?

No, the one point jump is a good way to defend. Playing at a would be too small. If you want to have a solid base, you should play something like s8. See variation]
;B[sa]
(;W[pa]C[Instead of connecting white could tenuki, because this move doesn't threaten to kill white group. See variation]
;B[no]C[A thank you move. forces white to defend, which is what he wants, and black gains nothing.]
;W[kq];B[mp];W[op]C[should i connect 1st?

No, I don't think so. Black n3 would be bad, which is why he cant cut. Still, I don't see why p4 should be played. It doesn't gain anything. See variations]

(;B[pp];W[mq];B[oo];W[pr]C[is this too dangerous?

Yes, this move doesn't work. See variations]
(;B[qr];W[or];B[oq];W[np];B[lp];W[lq];B[ps];W[os]LB[nr:A][ns:B]
C[is A better?

Yes. I think I don't have to explain this one :) B works too.]
;B[nr];W[mr];B[ns];W[ip];B[fq]
(;W[fp];B[ep]
(;W[eq]C[is cuuting risky?

Yes, but the result can be good. Other possibilities include extending after blacks hane and playing cap instead of attachment. See variations]
;B[er];W[dq];B[gp];W[fo];B[gr];W[go];B[hp];W[ho];B[hq];W[iq]
;B[ir];W[jr]LB[io:A]C[Too small. Protecting the cut at a is more urgent]
;B[js];W[ks];B[is];W[fs]C[is black alive already?

Yes, black is unconditionally alive.];B[es];W[dr];B[gs];W[kp]
;B[ln];W[fj]C[is this a good move?

Yes. It enlarges the moyo and strengthens the r10 group.];B[io]
;W[jp]LB[jn:A]C[With this move, white still has only one eye. It would be better to escape with a]
;B[ls];W[jo];B[kr];W[in];B[jq];W[ik]C[Protecting the upper corner would be wiser. Black could get a nasty ko in the corner. See variation]

(;B[of]C[Slow!];W[oh]LB[dc:B][og:A][rl:C]C[is  this a good move? I thought that A would be touching what i'm attacking

Actually, attacking the black wall is pointless because it's alive no matter what way you look at it. Yes, your move is better than a but even better would be to play at b or locally a good move would be c]
;B[mg];W[li];B[kh];W[lh];B[lg];W[ng];B[nf];W[ki];B[jh];W[ji]
LB[hg:A]TR[jh][kh][ki][li]C[Your wall doesn't give you any territory, whereas black is gaining lots of points. You can live with your group, so it isn't necessary to escape. Instead you should reduce, for example at a]
