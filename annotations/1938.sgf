C[===
I start my comments after "==="

A couple points if I may:
  don't let yourself be pushed around
  don't overdefend
  always look to the whole board and play BIG points even if it means losing one or two UNIMPORTANT stones somewhere else

Thank you for sending your game for review
Hope you like my (second only) review

Best of luck and good games];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[qf]

(;B[dc]LB[dj:A]C[Was this move alright? or should I have defended top-right?

===
I don't know, but I don't like any of those moves
I like A -- or thereabouts -- stake a claim here and split white stones]
;W[qd];B[qc]LB[pc:A]C[best move? (best defence?)

might be ok, but you have to pay attention to Q17 (A), as you noticed later]

(;B[ob];W[qb]TR[rb]SQ[sb]CR[pa][qa]C[what move should I have played here?

===
not here :) it's back at move 19

right now your group has 2 liberties (square and triangle)
and the white group has 3 liberties (circles and triangle)
-- you can't save those stones --
better play somewhere else];B[rb];W[ra];B[pa];W[sb]C[Shiroki19 [?\]: oh

you're leaving your top group very weak];W[qn];B[pn];W[qp];B[qo]
;W[ro];B[po];W[qm];B[qq];W[rp];B[rq];W[qj];B[pr]C[good move?

===
I don't think so -- you're playing too close to the stones you already played, protecting too much and letting your opponent take the big points]

;W[nh];B[nf]SQ[ji][jj][jk][jl][jm][jn][jo][jp]C[didn't want white to take it all, so I started pushing here from above.. Don't know if this should be it, but it felt good at the time

===
play the BIG points first -- don't let yourself be pushed
your first thought after opponent plays a stone should not be "How do I answer that?" or "What does he want from there?"
It should be "What's the biggest point still available?"

White built a formidable wall (squares) while you put yourself enclosed in the corner]

White is shutting you in real tight ... and you're letting him do it !]

(;B[dm]C[I've played d7 here, but I guess there are better moves here.. didn't want white to control this whole area.. please advice.. :)

===
you moved in too deep into White's influence zone (the wall to the right) and without support
better start nearer the border];W[dj]C[how should I react to this one, at this point I lost left-bottom I think

===
well ... D7 is doomed :)
if you want left-bottom play C3 -- but there are better things to do -- the most urgent thing is to protect the top-left]

too late now, I think];W[mf];B[nl]LB[gh:A][cq:B]C[I don't know if this was bad or good.. I think it was a waste.

no way to invade and keep the invasion connected to the right.
If you really wanted to invade the best way (and probably would work too) is C3]

C[was this good? or unnecessary?

bad, because unnecessary];W[ri];B[rl]SQ[so]C[Here i'm trying to kill the S6 group, I failed, but i'm wondering if there was a way.

===
if there is a way (I didn't check too deep) it is by playing there ... BUT ... but first you have to play T5 and remove that liberty]
