C[Hello, I'm Maxdwolf and I'll be reviewing your game. I'm 4 kyu in the AGA and 10 kyu on KGS. I hope my commentary will be helpful.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[op];W[dd];B[pg];W[jj];B[jd];W[jp]C[White(stronger, about 8k) acted by purpose "experimentally" in the opening. Black (myself, about 13k) tried to play for influence in the beginning, but he had no clear idea how to develop his stones, is it true?

White is already ahead in  building large frameworks, but this framework is thin and should be easy to reduce.  Since his stones are in the way of more rapid development on your part, I would just focussing on attacking his framework.]
;B[dg]LB[cf:A][cg:B][cj:C]C[Right to invade, but I would try to play on the third line (A,B). Perhaps even a splitting attack like C.]
;W[fd]
(;B[ge]C[Is this too "greedy"? At this point it is already clear that one of the black stones will be cut out? I think it is the wrong direction. See variation.]

C[Now your marked stone has gone to waste. The exchange has strengthened what and built up his moyo. Another problem w. m3 is that it doesn't add many points, particularly w. the bottom right corner being wide open.]
;B[gh]LB[cn:C][qo:B][qp:A][fq:D]C[Small move. Development at A or B or invasion at C or D are much bigger.]

In the overall game, you seemed to fall far behind in the initial sequence in the upper left and slipped farther behind as the game progressed. Failing to attack white's center group or seal off the upper right, combined w. some slow moves that allowed white to develop more rapidly.
