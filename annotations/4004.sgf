C[Hi, I'm white in this game.  This was a game from my go club.  I'm almost 100% sure I remembered all the moves correctly at least until the game was pretty much decided. Thanks for reviewing!

Comments: Andre Bergholz (3K, marked AB)];B[pp];W[qd];B[cp]
;W[dc];B[iq];W[qn];B[np];W[pk];B[od]LB[de:a]C[AB: Very good opening. Here, 'A' is a good alternative as it expands Black's framework naturally.]

(;W[oc]C[AB: White should probably choose the joseki starting with Q14 (see variation).]

(;B[nc]LB[pd:a]C[AB: Black may be afraid of complications but he really should choose a joseki starting with 'A' (see variation).]
;W[pc];B[md];W[qf];B[ic]TR[pk][qf]C[AB: The result is still not bad for Black as the position of the two maked White stones is a little bizarre.]
;W[gc];B[ce];W[cg];B[ee];W[ge];B[eg];W[cj];B[dg]LB[ie:a]C[AB: A little bit too passive. J15 would be better. Protecting against White D14 is not urgent as the three White stones on top are not stable either.]

(;W[lc]C[AB: Black's move should be answered (see variation).]
;B[mc]LB[mb:a]C[AB: The standard response is 'A'.];W[jd]
(;B[lb]C[AB: Way too passive. Black needs to fight here.];W[jc]
C[AB: Very good, White has taken the advantage.];B[kc];W[jb]
TR[kc]C[AB: Good again, the advantage has gotten even bigger. The exchange of the two marked stones is clearly good for White. Most importantly, the complete upper left corner is now not so weak anymore.]
;B[ch]C[AB: Big.];W[bh]LB[cm:a]C[I guess I thought that this would end in sente.  This ended up rather badly for me.  I guess I should just play c6?

AB: C7 is perfect. Stabilizes the group in an area of Black influence. If you play C6, Black will immediately invade at C8. This is an area of Black influence, he will be interested in a fight.]
;B[bg];W[bi];B[cl]C[AB: Perfect.];W[ep]C[now those stones are rather heavy.  I didn't want to jump out as that would give black way too much profit.  I decided to approach the corner, and maybe get something to attack the c8 stone with.  I'm thinking the best move for black is d5 or d6.

AB: Risky. But a flexible approach is needed. That you will be able to attack C8 is optimistic thinking.]

(;B[eq]C[AB: You are right, Black has much better choices than this one (see variations).]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[co];B[bp]
(;W[bo]C[AB: This is slow and makes the group heavy.];B[fp]
LB[el:a]C[AB: My first instinct was to jump to 'a', but maybe Black's move is even better...]
;W[fo]LB[dn:a]C[AB: Had to be at 'a'. But painful anyway. The mistake was the slow and heavy move of B5 (probably caused by your optimistic thinking of attacking C8...).]
;B[do];W[eo];B[dn];W[dm];B[cn];W[cm];B[bn];W[bm]
(;B[em]LB[en:a]C[AB: Should be at E6 to avoid the atari (see variation).]
;W[en];B[ao]
(;W[gp]LB[dl:a]C[AB: An overplay. D8 is the only move here. The result would be quite acceptable for White considering the initial position (see variation).]
;B[dl];W[el];B[fm];W[bl];B[go]LB[ek:a][ld:b]TR[el]C[AB: Black could also opt to capture the marked stone with 'A', but there are some risks as White can start complications around 'B'.]
;W[fq];B[fn];W[ho];B[fp]C[AB: A nightmare.];W[hq];B[ip];W[hp]
;B[jn]C[AB: And the nightmare continues...];W[gn]
(;B[fo]C[AB: Mistake. There is no point in saving this stone (see variation).]
;W[in];B[jo];W[gr];B[ir]C[trying to get 1 eye in sente.];W[er]
;B[dr];W[fs];B[hm]C[I couldn't decide whether or not to move out, or live.  I decided to play it safe.]
;W[hr]C[AB: Good idea.];B[im]C[AB: The result is very good for Black. What a nightmare...]
;W[ne]C[Maybe I should have pulled out with m16 first?  Things tuned out okay though.

AB: Yes, M16 is better as Black will ignore this peep.];B[ld]
C[AB: Good.];W[nd];B[pi]LB[ob:a][ek:b]C[AB: Normally I see no big risk in this move, but it turned badly later on. Maybe Black shouldlive wiht P18 first. That has also the advantage of taking all risks from the ladder of 'B', which in turn threatens to kill the White group on the left. Black has a clear lead, so he should play safely.]
;W[nj];B[qk]LB[ni:a]C[AB: Maybe running out with O11 is better?]
;W[ql];B[qj];W[nb];B[mb];W[ob]C[AB: Yes, in fact now I'm sure. The upcoming trouble is already apparent now.]
;B[je];W[id];B[mf];W[nf];B[mg];W[ng];B[kd]LB[kg:a]C[AB: Way too slow. Should be at L13. No way is White ever going to kill this group. Severe mistake!]
;W[kf];B[ke]LB[jf:a]C[AB: Should be at K14.];W[me];B[jf];W[mh]
C[leaning attack on the m15 group to try and kill the r9 group.

AB: Makes good aji for the right, but maybe R12 directly is ok. Hard to say, but White is behind and should take risks. Now, Black should ignore this move and play S8 and R13 for example.]
;B[kg]LB[rl:a]C[AB: That was the last chance for Black to take care of his group on the right.]
;W[lh];B[lg]C[AB: The final mistake. Black should ignore the White move (hence White shouldn't play it) and take care of his weakest group on the right. The top group is not easy to kill. It can run in two directions and Black can use the weak White group on the left to support.]
;W[qh];B[rl];W[qm];B[rm];W[rn];B[ri];W[qi];B[rh];W[rg];B[ph]
;W[qg];B[pj];W[ok];B[sk];W[rj];B[ni];W[mi];B[nh];W[mk];B[og]
;W[oh];B[of];W[oi]C[AB: The game is over.];B[fd]C[AB: C17 is the move locally.]
;W[fc];B[gd];W[hd];B[jj]C[AB: Not good, because...];W[ek]C[AB: Very good!]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[fi];W[cd]C[AB: Big.];B[bd];W[ed];B[fe];W[bc]
;B[he]LB[rp:a]C[AB: Tiny. S4 is MUCH bigger.];W[ie];B[hf];W[if]
;B[ig];W[ji];B[ki];W[kh];B[jh];W[qq]C[after I got this corner, it was pretty much over.

AB: It was already over when you killed the group, but you also got the biggest endgame plays such as C16, E9, and now R3.]

;B[bk];W[ck];B[al];W[dk];B[am];W[bj];B[ak];W[aj];B[an]C[dont remember the rest, but the game is decided.  I'm surprised I turned the game around after the horrible start in the bottom left.  I guess doing life and death problems really pay off!

Thanks again!

AB: You deservedly won, because Black has a clear weakness in local fighting. His group at the top was at the heart of his loss. It was involved in two lengthy sequences, and in both Black played cowardly. The first time it helped White to get a good result for his own group in the top left, the second time it led to the killing of the Black group on the right. You on the other hand are quite an agressive player, You need to play more cautiously in areas where the opponent has more influence. Otherwise you will be crushed by players of equal local fighting ability. Give your opponent some territory. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact me at bergholz@gmail.com. Good luck!]

(;B[pd];W[pc];B[qe]C[AB: There are many possible continuations from here, but the idea is that Black needs a wall to attack the two White stones at the bottom. Getting moe influence and confiding White to the edge works well with Black's overall position.]
