C[My Second game at the Cambridge Trigantius held 2nd March 2003. 

My comments all start with CG>

pheno : Hi, my comments are preceded by "pheno :".];B[dp];W[qd]
;B[dc];W[pq]LB[oc:A]C[CG> I was playing W and this was my strategy I'd worked out for playing Black. 

I realise now that this isn't as good a strategy for W, but I hadn't prepared a strategy for playing W. Some suggestions would be helpful please. 

I think B should play P17 next.

pheno : I think the best is not to have a strategy decided in advance, because deciding upon your strategy must take into account the opponent's moves. You have a lot of freedom in the opening and can play about any move you like.
The two white opening moves are good, this is a solid way of playing, the komoku (3-4) stones take some territory and are ready to pincer approach movesâ€¦ It is true that this pattern works differently with black or white : with white, you'll probably have no time to enclose the corner around A.
I think playing around A is indeed a natural direction of play for black's next move, because this move would work with the other black stones.]
;B[po]C[pheno : Black choses to approach the other corner. There is less room fro development on the right side for him, but that doesn't mean his choice is bad. We can't say at this stage where is the best move.]

(;W[np]LB[pl:A][qm:B]C[pheno : The same here. I can't prove this move is bad. I suggest however an alternative play. As white is strong on the right side, I'd like to fight here and pincer the approach stone at A or B, rather than playing o4, which is a quiet move letting black extend on the right side.
I won't give any complicated joseki variation here. I advise you to try to pincer approach stones even without knowing joseki, because the subsequent fighting is a good way to improve. I give one simple variation after the pincer at A.]

(;B[qp]LB[qq:A]TR[pq]C[pheno : This is the first bad move of the game. Playing on the third line (r4)  in diagonal of a fourth line stone (q3) is bad shape. It only reinforces the opponent and weakens black's own stones when white descends at A. See the variation for a correct sequence.]

(;W[oc]C[CG> I took the chance to tenuki and take P17 thinking of R3 and l3/k3 as miai.

pheno : The bottom is an urgent area and this is not correct timing to play elsewhere. By doing so you failed to punish black's mistake. r3 and l3 are not miai. r3 is a very important point for both, as it affects the mutual basis of the groups. See Variation.]

(;B[de]LB[qq:A]C[pheno : Black plays a big move instead of the urgent move at A too. We still don't know which player will end with a weak group, whereas the opponent will have a strong one, in the bottom right corner. So for the next few moves, my comment is "A is more important than this move".]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[jp]LB[jd:D][dj:C][qj:E][lp:B][hq:A][qq:U]C[CG> I was pleased with this so far, I'm making some territory, but not as much as B, but if B plays C10, I can get ahead with R10, and If B plays up the RHS I can invade around C11

pheno : In fact, the last two moves don't make territory. But they make  good shape on the bottom side. The white position can still be invaded (at A or B for instance), but this is not so interesting for black for the time being. There is no way to make big territories in the opening, and this should not be the aim of the players. Rather, the purpose of opening moves should be to build a good position for the middle game fighting.
About the position now : there are still three big points (around C, D, E), and still the urgent move at r3.]
;B[jd]LB[ci:B][di:C][qj:A][ql:E][qq:D]C[CG> This suprised me, A and B looked bigger.

pheno : This is a big point too, an extension from a shimari (corner enclosure) is always very big.
I think B is smaller, the reason being that black has already played four stones on this side, so playing here would be too slow. Note that there is now way to secure the left side territory with only one move for black, and this area should not be thought as territory, but rather as a zone where black is strong and would be happy to fight if white invades. If black wants to play on the left side, I prefer the high move at C, to get balance with the low one at c6. After k16, a black stone at C would make a huge moyo, so invading around here is now urgent for white.
On the right side, A is a big move too (extension from a shimari again), but I prefer to exchange D for E first, then to make the checking extension at A (and black group is then still insecure).]
;W[ql]LB[qj:B][qk:A][qq:C]C[CG> Too far and overplay, probably at S9 instead?

pheno : The normal extension from a shimari is at B. Here I prefer to exchange C for r8, then play at B, to keep up pressure on black. After C, if black extends farther than r8, he only exposes himself to a severe invasion.]
;B[qq]C[pheno : This is a very good move, now black is strong, and as a consequence white is thin around here. Black may invade and even attack some stones on the bottom, and r8 is too close to black's strength too.
I hope after replaying this game, you'll feel how a move at r3 is powerful, and more urgent than just taking big points.]
;W[ci]LB[pi:A]C[CG> So I get both the big points (I think).

pheno : Well, not really, because r8 is over-extended and is rather a target for black than a big point. Usually in the opening, players share the big points. If one player tries to take more big points than he should, he'll end with thin positions. Here, locally, white needs a move at A to complete his shape on the right side.]

(;B[cg]LB[ck:A]TR[dc][jd][de]SQ[cn]C[CG> Wrong side, B should have played C9?

pheno : I think it is ok. c13 is small an extension indeed, but still it is a good shape in relation with the upper side moyo. White has only place to build a cramped position on the left side, between two strong black positions. Perhaps white should have invaded at c13 himself, because the upper side is more important than the bottom.
This is related to the high position of d15, and the low position of c6. Usually regions with 4th line stones are important because they can grow/be invaded easily, whereas 3rd line stones make stable groups and don't require further play.
See variation for a black play at A.];W[cl];B[qj]LB[cq:B][dr:A]
C[pheno : This is an attractive point for black, but maybe the timing is not good. The proper move is at A, to complete black's shape on the left side. After a black move at A, he can aim at invading the bottom or attacking the left side group. On the other hand, a white invasion at B would be annoying, taking territory, and maybe unsettling the whole black d4 group.]
;W[qh]LB[qg:B][ol:A]TR[qj][ql]C[pheno : I like this move, now the players have both one weak group and can fight. If white plays at A instead of r12, black extends at B and black is the only one with a weak group, this is not interesting.]
;B[oj];W[oh]LB[ol:A]C[pheno : Wrong side, white should jump at A. r12 is a strong stone, r8 is a weak one. During fights, one should play from the weaker side, because this is the side in need of reinforcement. Maybe black's strategy is to sacrifice r8, but it is a big loss to let black capture it, stabilizing his own group, whereas a jump at A would keep the r10 group weak.]
;B[mc]LB[ol:A]C[pheno : But this move is completely out of direction. It is a big point, but the right side is a very hot area now, black can't play elsewhere like this! "Urgent moves before big moves" again. Black should play around A.]
;W[ol]C[pheno : Good move, now black's group is very weak.]
;B[mj];W[ml]C[pheno : Good direction this time, white plays correctly from the weak group.]
;B[pm]LB[pj:A]C[pheno : Not so good, black will reinforce white and this creates a weakness at A. Note that black peeps from the strong group (after r3 this one is stable) and weakens the weak one, so this is a mistake we have already met in this game.]
;W[pl];B[nn]LB[kl:A]C[CG> I thought my R8 stones were doomed, so I thought for about two minutes for the next move - because they needed rescuing

pheno : Black is weak too, a simple jump at A to continue the running fight seems ok.]
;W[on]C[CG> I spent a while thinking about this move. I was intended as a sacrifice to connect my stones]
;B[om];W[nm];B[oo];W[mn];B[no];W[mo]LB[nk:B][lm:C][mp:A]C[CG> B played out the sequence I'd read so I was happy with  this, + I've got further plays at R6

pheno : You are not really connected, black will cut at A now. White has only pushed black on his potential territory on the bottom. Moreover black has forcing moves at B and C. Nothing fancy was needed, a simple jump in the center was ok.]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[mq];W[lq];B[mr]LB[nr:A]C[pheno : Correct shape was at A. This would have been a big loss for white, he would have given many points in order to reinforce his weak group.]
;W[lr]C[pheno : Now black may lose all the benefits he could have gained at the bottom.]
;B[mh]LB[nh:B][ni:A]C[pheno : Reinforcing this weak group is urgent, but black leaves a weakness at A. When one is weak, contact moves are called for. Here I'd play at B instead of black's move.]

(;W[nr]LB[ni:B][oq:A]C[CG> My opponent missed this so I guess it could have waited.

pheno : In fact you could have played at A and capture the three stones. (See variation). But indeed this is just points and it can wait. Maybe you can attack in the center instead (how black will answer B?).]
;B[nq];W[ms];B[oq];W[or];B[op];W[dr];B[cq];W[eo]LB[ep:A]C[pheno : Bad shape. This leaves a cut and this may help black to reduce white's moyo. A simple jump at A is better.]
;B[em]LB[dm:A]C[pheno : This is not so good too, for the same reason. Black could have gone in the center without leaving a cut with A.]
;W[dm]C[pheno : Cutting is attractive, even if white's shape has some weaknesses too.]
;B[dn];W[en];B[ep];W[fp];B[cr];W[ki]LB[ni:A][gn:B]C[CG> To get some control of the centre and to help capture E7 if it starts to cause trouble.

pheno : I think this is a vague move. If you want to attack, A looks severe; it allows to cut and forces black to fight near white's strength. If you want to defend against e7, B is good shape. Here it is not clear what you accomplish with this move.]
;B[ne];W[pe]LB[ni:A]TR[ne]C[pheno : Both moves are slow, black wasn't really threatening anything, and white just defends. White A would have been annoying here.]
;B[nh]LB[ni:a]C[My opponent was worried about 'a'.

pheno : With good reason.];W[oi];B[ni]LB[nk:A]C[CG> P11 was to give B bad shape.

pheno : But it reduces your liberties, perhaps better omitted. To give bad shape, continue with A]
;W[kk]TR[em]C[pheno : White's moyo is big, but e7 can easily escape while threatening the left side group.]
;B[og]TR[em]C[pheno : Not to the point, white should ignore and do something about e7.]
;W[pg];B[pi]LB[kf:A][kg:B]TR[ci][cl][dm][em]C[CG> W at L13 or L14, after all two stones is only 4 points.

pheno : Yes, very small, the fight is on the left side.];W[ph]
;B[of]C[pheno : Very small move again.];W[eh]TR[em]C[CG> L13/L14?

pheno : It's good to play around here to control e7.];B[pf]
;W[qf];B[fm]C[pheno : Here we go, let's see what black can do here.]
;W[gn]C[pheno : Good shape.];B[ff];W[fg]LB[gg:A][gh:B]C[CG> G13 instead ?

pheno : Yes, A gets ahead of black, as does B, which is more solid.]
;B[gf];W[gg]LB[hg:A]C[pheno : White A instead gets ahead here too.]
;B[hg];W[hh];B[ig];W[ih];B[dh];W[di];B[eg];W[fi];B[lk];W[ll]
;B[kj];W[jj];B[lj];W[jk]LB[jg:A]C[CG> I think I could have managed the cut at K9 and should have gone for K13 instead.

pheno : Hmmm, A is dangerous, your move is ok.];B[gh];W[fh]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[jh];W[hi];B[ji];W[jg]C[pheno : This leads to nothing. Unnecessary moves are bad moves (you lose ko threats, and maybe some other moves around here).]
;B[jf];W[kg];B[kh];W[ef]LB[nb:B][bh:D][bm:C][qm:F][er:E][qr:A]
C[CG> Silly cut - R2 looks good.

pheno : This is the endgame indeed. It is time to roughly estimate the score and to find the biggest endgames points.
Black has about 80 points on the upper side, 10 points in the bottom right corner, 10+ points in the bottom left corner, so 100+ points.
White has about 75 points in the center, 20 points in the upper right corner, and the komi, so about 100 points too. This is a close game.
Now the big points. In the endgame it is important to try to get about half of the big points, and the gote/sente relationship is important. B is big and sente for both sides. A is big too. C and D are a bit smaller than B because there is less white territory here. Still you can probably play them in sente. E is a big gote point. F is quite big and sente for white.
Let's leave perfect yose (endgame) for professional players, but we shouldn't be too lazy about this stage of the game. In close games like this, it is easy to win or lose fifteen points during the endgame, if one doesn't pay attention. Let's recall the game is close now, both players made equivalent mistakes during the middle game and they cancelled out.]
;B[dg];W[kf]C[pheno : Again bad and unnecessary.];B[je];W[qn]
LB[qm:A]C[pheno : A is better, it is sente and doesn't leave white with a weak stone after black defends.]
;B[pn]
(;W[oe];B[nd];W[nc]LB[nb:A]C[pheno : Here white misses the sente endgame at A.]
;B[nb];W[ob];B[mb]LB[na:C][oa:A][pa:B][pb:D]C[pheno : This is a big loss, black has at least the sente endgame sequence A-B-C-D for later. Please compare with what happens if white plays here first (instead of p15, see variation).]
;W[qr]C[I was glad to get this move in.

pheno : Yes, this is big.];B[rr];W[rq]LB[qs:A]C[r1 instead?

pheno : s1 is possible, I can't see the meaning of s3.];B[qs]
;W[pr];B[rp];W[ps];B[qm]C[pheno : Punishment for earlier white r6 instead of r7.]
;W[rm];B[rn];W[rl];B[rs];W[ns];B[cm];W[dl];B[od];W[pd];B[oa]
;W[pb];B[pa];W[qa];B[na];W[qb]C[pheno : Finally you lost nearly ten points here, and maybe the game.]
;B[rj];W[qi];B[pj];W[ri];B[nk];W[nl];B[bh]C[pheno : Black is grabing nearly all the big points (see the importance of sente).]
;W[bi];B[er]C[pheno : Big again.];W[fr];B[es];W[eq];B[dq];W[fs]
;B[ds];W[do];B[co];W[ch];B[bg];W[bm];B[bn];W[bl];B[sm];W[sl]
;B[sn];W[sj];B[ai];W[aj];B[ah];W[mk];B[am];W[al];B[an]C[pheno : The game is nearly finished now. j10 end s9 are the last points.]
;W[le]C[pheno : This leads to nothing. Except if you are in time trouble (and need to play some moves to get more time to think), this kind of moves shouldn't be played, it only hopes a blunder by the opponent. This is considered to be rude, and anyway it destroys your style. Don't forget there is alternate play, and here it is easy to verify that if black answers, there is nothing for white.]
;B[mf];W[rk];B[ii];W[ij];B[lh];W[bp]C[pheno : Same remark, you can't kill a group with two eyesâ€¦]

[jg][le][md][qn][rq]C[CG> Even with 6.5 points komi I was 12.5 points short. 

Looking at the board now it looks as though I should have got into the upper left earlier in the game.

pheno : Well, the upper left is big, but so is white center. My commentary was a bit long, but let's recall two important principles.
The first one is "urgent moves before big moves". This is because go is more about fighting between weak groups than building territory. Territory is the goal of the game, but not the way to achieve it. So a move which make one's group strong and the opponent's one weak is very important. Try to feel the importance of r3 in the opening. Later in the game, the same principle indicated to play from the weak side and both players made mistakes by playing from the strong side.
The second principle is that a game is long, and the endgame is important. I do believe the game was still closed before yose stage. So in a tournament, try to stay in a state of concentration till the very end of the game. Keep quiet, look for the big points, and play double sente moves as soon as possible (see around o18 in this game).
Ok, this is a good game and I was happy to review it. Feel free to ask any question or correct any error I may have made in this commentary.]
)
(;W[nb];B[mb]LB[la:B][ma:A][na:C][lb:D]C[pheno : Later, white has the A-B-C-D sente endgame sequence. The difference with the game is more than 5 points. Three mistakes like this and you lose 15-20 points.]
))
(;W[oq];B[nq];W[op];B[or];W[ms];B[nr];W[pr]C[pheno : Black is one liberty short.]
))
(;B[ck];W[be]C[pheno : In this case, black has not a lot of room, but a move ar b15 is annoying. Black is clearly splitted on the left side.]
;B[cd];W[cg]C[pheno : This is a simple continuation. White isn't so weak.]
))
(;B[qq]C[pheno : Now blacks plays r3. Suddenly his group becomes very strong, white has no hope of attacking it anymore : it is already alive. On the other hand, white stones lost their basis and are weak now.]
;W[kq]LB[iq:C][mq:A][oq:B]TR[oc][qq]C[pheno : Even after an extension around l3, white's shape has weaknesses at A or B, so a black move at C is troublesome. So the extension at l3 and r3 are not miai.
In conclusion, r3 is very important because it makes one's group strong and the opponent's weak. This is what middle game figthing is all about. r3 is an urgent move, and p17 a big move. The proverb says "urgent moves before big moves".]
))
(;W[qq]C[pheno : White plays r3. Now his group is very strong, and black is weak.]
;B[ql]LB[pn:B][qn:A][rp:C]C[pheno : Black must extend but he has a cramped shape and still a weakness at A (threatening A, B, C). If he extends further the weakness at A is all the more troublesome.]
))
(;B[qq]C[pheno : Here is the correct shape to build a base for the group.]
;W[qr];B[qp];W[or];B[qk]LB[oc:A][qh:B]TR[np]C[pheno : This is a simple joseki. White has a solid group on the lower side, black has a stable group on the right side. Now, if white encloses the corner at A, black might answer at B to limit the potential of the enclosure. That's why I prefered to pincer instead of o4. But this is playable too.]
))
(;W[pl];B[no];W[nq];B[lo];W[lq];B[pi];W[nl]TR[qd][pi][pl]C[pheno : For instance here white takes some territory on the bottom and black in exchange pincers the q8 stone. But white is strong on the side, and q11 is not so strong, so the fight is quite feasible for white.]
))
