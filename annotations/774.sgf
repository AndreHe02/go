C[teh: Dear, reviewer.  I played black in this game, and managed to win 1.5 points.  However, I thought I had a clear lead after move 54.  Especially I would like to get some ideas how and when I should have reduced White's moyo, and when and where should I have taken big points.  I am looking forward to your comments.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[nd];B[pc]LB[lc:A]
C[teh: I guess the pincer at A would have been more efficient.

SGF: Nothing wrong with this if you are to move in the corner.  It is steady.  However, the W move is not a strong threat again the corner so B can consider tenuki.]
;W[id]C[SGF:  I would prefer low, for better balance.];B[cc]
C[teh: I decided to switch to territorial game.

SGF:  A bit early to make such a commitment, unless it was really made from the start.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[pn]
(;B[qp]LB[ql:A]C[teh: The pincer at A is probably good again.

SGF:  Not really.  See the one possible variation shown.  A stone at 'A' would be misplaced.]
;W[jq]C[teh: Now it was hard to choose the next move.

SGF:  W has a funny looking shape at the bottom.  Hard to say what is best but with B  having 3 solid corners it would make more sense to try for a large moyo instead of playing on the fhird line.]
;B[cq]LB[qk:C][cn:A][jo:D][mq:B]TR[ld][pg][pl]C[teh: I considered also A, B, and C.

SGF:  I think this is too early.  If W takes out time to strengthen the corner B has sente to do something in the center.  Most likely B will get to play here later.  I prefer the triangle stone to 'C' and 'B seems too low.  Also, 'A' does not seem too urgent with the circle stone on the board.  The three points which came to my mind where those marked with a triangle.  Actually, 'D' was the first think I thought of but I dimissed it as not having any good followup.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[co]C[SGF: Pushing W on the fourth line cannot be good.  There is nothing wrong with the standard joseki.  If B wants sente so badly then he should not have invaded.]
;W[dn];B[cm]C[SGF: What has this gained?];W[el];B[mq]LB[dk:A]
C[teh: Now I was happy.  In my eyes White's stones do not work very well together.

SGF:  On the contrary, they are working very well.  'A' now for W gives a nice whole board position.  See the variation on the next move.]

(;W[eg]LB[df:A]C[teh: Especially from now on I would like to hear ideas how and when to reduce White's moyo.

SGF: Not as big as it looks. Pushing at 'A' is better.];B[nb]
LB[mc:A][og:B]C[SGF:  Undoubtedly a big move , but is it big enough?  Playing on the second line in a moyo game is questionable.  W can simply play at 'A' threatening to seal the top or expand around B]
;W[lc]LB[mc:A]C[SGF: 'A' is better.];B[pj]LB[pl:A]C[SGF: This seems like an "in-between" move to me.  If the idea is to play against the W stone then 'A' seems more powerful.  I it is to extend from the top right, then the connection is tenuous at best.]
;W[nj];B[ph]LB[lj:A]C[SGF: seems very slow. this stone is on no danger so perhaps B should try to get into the center before it is too late.  How about a counter-boshi, not with the intention of capturing the W stone, but using it to reduce the center.]
;W[mn]C[SGF: nice move];B[kp];W[nq]
(;B[jp]LB[kn:B][np:A]C[teh: Perhaps I was too eager to reduce White's territory here. I guess A would have been better.

SGF:  I prefer B.  See variations.];W[mr];B[iq];W[lq];B[mp]
C[SGF: No point in trying to save this stone];W[lp];B[np];W[lo]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[jr];W[op]LB[io:A]C[SGF: Very small.  If W attackes with 'A' the game swings very much into his favor.]
;B[oq]C[SGF: even smaller];W[no];B[nr];W[mo]C[teh: Now I was happy.]
;B[nh]C[SGF:  These last few moves were very small.  More like yose.  For W to lose sente in this exchange is disastrous.]
;W[nq]C[teh: Still not sente.

SGF:  W lost the game in these last few moves.  If he plays correctly there is no way B can win.]
;B[oe]LB[lh:A][im:B]C[teh: Would it have been better just to jump further at A?

SGF: Absolutely.  B is even better becasue it reentforces the bottom group]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[sq]C[SGF:  The moves served no purpose for W]
;W[lh];B[df]LB[dh:A]C[teh: Misreading here.  I first thought that I can jump to A after this.

SGF:  You can, but whether you want to is a different matter.]
;W[ef];B[jm]LB[im:B][jn:A]C[SGF:  This can be cut by 'A'.  I prefer 'B']
;W[cn];B[bn];W[cl];B[bl];W[dm];B[bm];W[jn];B[in];W[kn]LB[io:A]
C[SGF: should be 'A'];B[hm];W[il];B[hl]C[SGF: Cannot risk this.   Just connect and bide your time.  The center is getting smaller and there is lots of aji.]
;W[io];B[ho];W[im];B[hn];W[ik];B[hk];W[ij];B[mi]TR[mf][gi]C[SGF:  This does not seem so big.  For W to play here is gote.  Both triangel moves look bigger.]
;W[gq];B[hq];W[gp];B[hp];W[jo];B[hj];W[ii];B[gr];W[fr];B[hs]
LB[gh:A]C[SGF:  Not urgent.  Play 'A' first.   If W capture the one stone there is plenty of room for an eye in the middle.]
;W[hi];B[ir];W[mf]C[SGF:  W has got to protect against both the B moves suggested earlier.]

SGF:  Why?  Just play 'A'.];B[pf];W[pe];B[nf];W[og]
(;B[pg]C[SGF: Wrong side.  Look at variation at 'A' for one possiblility.  (Of course, W will not play as in the variation, but B wil still do much better than the game,)]

;B[jq];W[nn];B[ol]C[SGF:  This was a game of lost opportunities.  It is surprising the result was so close.  W had a clear lead for much of the game and B did not really have a good chance to catch up with correct play by W.   However, W played several small gote moves aroound N4 and gave B his chance.  At this stage B should have fnished the game of more quickly but missed some vital points to reduce the center.  B's initial strategy of playing so many low moves is questionable.  If he is going to take low corners in the opening then he must be either very good at amashi or have a definite reduction plan.]
