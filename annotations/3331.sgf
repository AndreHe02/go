C[robau [16k\]: hi
Hello, reviewer.
I played black here, and lost with 4,5 points, and I would like a pretty much general review. I'm learning a lot about fuseki, lately, so remarks on that are very welcome.
Biggest questions are how I could have prevented black from getting such a big topside, and his other big territory, around the H2 area. I don't really see how I should have gotten into those, once it became obvious white was strongest there.
I'll go through the game, making remarks and asking a few questions, but I find that rather hard, and would be more interested in some general remarks, really, although I realize that's a lot harder on you.
Thank you for trying and for this review, in advance.


Hello, 

I will try to provide general outlines if I see relevant ones.
I will sum up at the end of the game.];B[pd]C[Nyterz [17k\]: hello

(;B[de]MA[cd]C[This is usually not satisfying, unless you have a very special purpose in mind.

The usual play is at C16, so as not to leave the corner to white.

Here, the idea of D15 is to make influence, but this is difficult to master and use properly at your level.]
;W[cd];B[ee]C[This is probably way too small... Where would be better?

As a matter of fact, the joseki is at C15.

Otherwise, white will play at C15, and secure the corner with no compensation for black]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[oq]C[good];W[hc]C[His top is now pretty huge. So i guess i played too focused on one place and should have spread out more over the board? I find this rather strange, since I'm actually pretty pleased with how I played so far, except for E15
I suppose if E15 would be for example D12, the game would still be balanced so far? But as it is, I think white's got the advantage, no?


1) the top, on the contrary of what you think, is not that huge : 
- all the stones are low
- there is no real potential of development
- Black R18 is big and sente

2) look also at your potential : with a play at R10, you make much more than what white makes on top

3) D12 would be a good idea now, but C15 is urgent. White does not have a significant advantage yet since it is your turn to play]
;B[ci]C[ok, but C15 is needed.];W[ce]C[argh !

This is big.];B[cf];W[cl]C[this is too lose and has few effect on black]

MA[em][fc][ne][ok]C[Though it is sente, this move is not good :
it is called a 'thank you move'

You force white to connect, which is what he will want to do anyway.

But you gain no compensation for that

There are bigger points on the board];W[iq];B[no]MA[fc][hb]
C[In hindsight, this was rather small, i suppose? and playing around where white played next would have been better?
Also, it becomes quite apparent to me, in hindsight, that at this point, white has his territories as he will have them later, and black has just a lot of influence. I suppose I just didn't collect on my influence enough later on?

No, this move is big, you should have played it instead of J4.

White has 35 points top, 20 points bottom, and few potential, but the sente now.

Black has 40 points right, and much potential there, 8 points bottom left, and maybe 10 up left.
Hovwever, with its influence, it can start destroying some white territorry with plays at F17 oh H18 (be carefull : the idea is not to settle there, but to erode the territory)

Overall, the situation is balanced.];W[eg]C[good play by white]
;B[dg]C[ok];W[ei]
(;B[bk]C[No, this is a mistake :

You have two white stones that tried to attack 5 black stones.
You should punish this and try to impair them.

First, try to make them heavy and try to cut them from their support (see a possible variation)]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[dj];B[gf]CR[ge]TR[bg]MA[ne][ok]C[I don't like this :

The white stones are now connected, so G14 does not have effect on the white stones. All the more : it can be cut and should be at G15

Your left group is alive in 1 move if needed (B13)

You'd better construct your own territory.];W[fe];B[ge];W[fd]

;W[gg];B[oc]MA[qb]C[I had my doubts about this move, when going over it again, but it turned out to be quite big. Is there another move I could have played at this point that would get me solidly into the center?

R18 is the move you want to make locally (worth 14 points).
Is is sente, because if W does not answer, Black plays P18 and grabs an other 6 points.]

C[Was this good enough?


this is a little loose on your terrritory.

I'd prefer the marked stones, and even if W invades, you can choose the side where you want to construct (up or down) and make pore territory in the centre.]
;W[og]C[this is an absolute overplay, and calls for punishment.]

;B[re];W[qe];B[rf];W[jn];B[km];W[ko]C[If white had cut here, I would be in a world of pain, i think. So i should have played a move to secure that earlier? Or did white just get lucky to get to use this as both a ladder breaker and a threat?



No, this IS both a ladder breaker and a threat.
So W is not lucky, but just playing sound.

This is also why N13 should be at N12, because this way, there is no ladder to break.

However, W can cut, but you have much support to fight anyway]

;B[nj]SQ[km][kn][ll]MA[nm]C[At this point I really just said to myself: enough, just play it safe. thinking i'd still have enough influence either way. Now i'm thinking that was wrong, because I gave up a lot around O7.


No, I'm fine with this move. 

You can give away your stones, and secure the territory with O7]
;W[lm]SQ[km][kn]CR[ll]C[oK, there is an important point here :

You have to realise that 2 'groups' of black stones are threatened.

But one is more important than the other.

Can you figure out which one ?



The fact is : the square marked stones are CUTTING stones, that separate the 3 white stones.

See variation to understand the result :]
(;B[ml];W[ln];B[ji]C[I guess, first protect cut at J8? That would be really painful there...can't believe i missed that, or that white didn't play there, later...

yes, this is important];W[ki];B[kh];W[nm];B[pm]C[I know, I know, N7 would have been so much better...
Played it too defensively again, like I usually do.
I was just thinking too much about my huge right side, i guess... Cost me a lot, in the end...

yes.];W[on];B[pn];W[oo];B[nn]C[don't 'bump' your head in white stones, this is bad.]
;W[om]
(;B[po]C[see variation];W[op]C[Hmm, maybe O4 here, and if white goes O3 black goes N7?
Anything wrong with O4?

you have to see it by yourself, but you cannot play O4];B[pp]
;W[nq];B[or];W[nr]
(;B[id]C[Poor attempt at getting into top.

You won't 'get into top with this mowe, you'r just reducing in sente, which is good.

But, with many cutting points in W formation, you can be agressive and play J17 (see one possible line of play)

However, the J8 problem is not totally solved ...];W[ic];B[gd]
;W[gc]C[In hindsight, I should have stopped here, I think. Maybe just played B14, which should be sente, and then play a big move in the center, like G11 or just L10? Or, again, the cut at J8.]

Any other, general remarks on style and such?

Yes, you were lucky that W did not kill at A11, or cut at J8

Also, at your stage, there is no winning or losing game, because both sides made some mistakes.
But if we focus on the biggest black error of appreciation, it is certainly the play around B14, that reduced you territory to a mere 4 points, where that should have been 10 to 15 points. ...


Overall, I think you should focus on 2 points :

1) look at the moves 7,49,143,129.
You just add stones to a group that does not need it. If, doing so, you lose sente, this is bad.
You should pay attention to not spend stones that add nothing to a group.


2) more difficult to make up : you seem (like many players betwwen 15 and 20 kyus) more concerned with your opponent territorry, and less by yours. Go is a game of exchange : while your opponent builds territory, you can also build yours.
Making this too late can help your opponent easier to prepare for reducing it.

That's what happenned on the right side.

Hope this review helped.
