C["Hello, I am requesting a review for the Black player. This game was played with 60 minutes for each side and 15 byo-yomi minutes with 25 byo-yomi stones.   I recently played this game on IGS and I felt like it was a fairly even game then all of a sudden things collapsed and I am wondering what happened?  I am looking for comments on where my opening could have been bigger as well as points in the middle game where I overplayed or neglected to keep safety in mind.

Thank you very much,
-Paul Thordarson"

Hi Paul,

Thanks for asking me to review your game!  It was very interesting.

I think you played well overall.  The biggest thing I noticed was that you played a lot of wide extensions that left your position thin.  White was able to exploit that later, since you never went back and solidified those positions.

Also, there were times when you submissively answered White's moves, instead of fighting, even though you had more stones in the area.

I hope you find the review useful.  Remember that I'm not such a strong player myself, so if you disagree with my variations or ideas, you could easily be right.  If you have any questions or comments, please email me.

-edgy];B[pp];W[pc];B[cp];W[cd];B[jq]LB[iq:a][ip:b]C[This is a little odd.  Usually, if Black plays on the bottom here, he plays
'a' or 'b' (the Chinese opening).

Now, I don't advocate that you go and learn that fuseki, but later in the game we'll see a couple of reasons that 'a' or 'b' is more usual.]
;W[qn]
(;B[mp]LB[np:a]C[On the one hand, this is a little 'loose'--one point to the right (at 'a') is more common.  It's also seems a little overconcentrated, with those three stones in the lower right already.    I think a pincer would be better.  See the variation.]
;W[qj]LB[ql:a][np:b]TR[mp]C[This might be over-ambitious; you should consider an invasion at 'a' at some point in the future (not now).  But, that would have better prospects if the marked stone were at 'b']
;B[fd];W[hd];B[ef]C["Is there a better way to respond to this pincer here?  I'm not sure if this was the best I could do."

Offhand, this looks OK.];W[cf];B[eh];W[pe]LB[jd:a][cl:b][ch:c]
C["Right here I was debating the pincer at a or a big point at or somewhere around b."

Both are attractive, but I'd like to suggest 'c' as an alternative on the left.
This closes White into the corner, starts marking out influence on the left, and makes 'a' a bigger threat.

White perhaps should have played 'c' himself.];B[jd]LB[je:a]
C["Was this the best place to play the pincer?  Or would it have been better to play at a and trade off alowing him to escape under in exchange for influence towards the center?  Or is there another pincer play that would have been even better?"

If you're going to pincer, this is the right place.];W[ld]C[Good move by White, extending from the ehimari in the upper right and putting pressure on Black.]
;B[if]LB[ie:a]TR[hd]C[Not sure about this.  'a' might be better, putting more pressure on the marked stone.]
;W[fe]TR[fe][hd]C["Watch the following sequence of five moves.  This is what I thought would be best to keep the marked stones weak.  How was this played?"]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[ec]LB[fc:a][ge:b]C[You could consider 'a', which is more solid, or 'b', catching the White stone in a ladder (though it lets White connect underneath).]
;W[dd];B[fc]C[See, you've gone back and played here anyway, but now White is more solid than if you hadn't ataried him.]
;W[he];B[hc]MA[fe][he][hd]LB[ic:a][jc:b][nc:c][nd:d]C["Too agressive and overplayed I think.  I think maybe I should have played at a or maybe even b. Which still would have kept the marked stones weak.  Do you have any thoughts on this?"

This move actually worked out OK.  'b' is attractive because Black might be able to invade at 'c' or 'd' later
.];W[ic]C["Yuck."

I don't think this is so bad for Black.]
(;B[ib]LB[hb:a][id:b]C["I realized how much this move hurt right after I played it.  I was expecting my opponent to play at a.  He didn't.  Did he just not see it, or am I the one who has failed to notice something?"

Perhaps 'a' is not so strong for White (see variation at White's next move.).  By the way, 'b' ( instead of the move played) is also interesting (see variation).]

(;W[jc];B[hb]TR[jd]SQ[fd][fc][ec][hc][hb][ib]LB[gb:a][id:b]
C["At this point I think I have given up on the stone marked with a triangle, and am trying to save the stones marked with a square and keep white from pushing into the center.  Is the right line of thinking at this point?"

The triangled stone has quite a bit of life left in it, but you are right to treat it lightly.

However, Black's move is probably not the best.  If he plays 'a' instead, the marked group is pretty much alive already, and White has to worry about a cut at 'b'.]
;W[je]TR[hc][hb][ib][fc][fd][ec]C["I don't mind so much because I have already given up on that stone.  In the following sequence of four moves, I was trying to wall white off from the center.  am I actually weakening the marked stones?"

The marked stones can still take care of themselves.];B[ff]
;W[ge]C[Maybe White should play elsewhere instead of answering here.]
;B[hf]LB[ch:a]TR[if]C[At this point, I think it's better to play a big point like 'a', which seals White into the corner and strengthens the left side.  The marked stone can be treated lightly.]
;W[dc]C["Now I am going to do my best to make life.  Can you tell me at what point my group lives?  I wasn't sure and may have played it out longer then I had to.  I am worried about this because once I have life, enlarging my group is small and I am afraid my opponent may take a big point somewhere else. "

That's correct thinking.];B[eb];W[gb];B[jb];W[kc]
(;B[kb]C[I think this is unnecessary.  Black can play elsewhere (see variation)]
;W[lb]
(;B[db]LB[ch:a][cb:b]C[Again, I think 'a' might be better (see variation).  Also, this gives up the possibility of 'b' later.]
;W[cb]LB[gc:a][gd:b][gf:c]C["Do I have life at this point?  I wasn't sure whether to secure life at a or b, or if I should close the wall at c."

You are alive.];B[gc]LB[gd:a]TR[fe][ge][he][hd]C["I opt to secure life.  I play here because I am worried about my opponent potentiall separating the right and left sides of my group.  Was this a valid concern, or should I have played at a instead? a would have allowed me to put more pressure on the marked stones I think, but I didn't want to risk the life of my group."

'a' is safe, but really you need to play elsewhere.];W[gf];B[gg]
;W[fg];B[gh];W[jf];B[ih]LB[hg:a][ch:b]C["Here I wanted to play it safe to prevent white from eating the marked stones.  Was there a better way to do this?  Also, I've been noticing a lot of big points left on the board, and am trying to get to the point where I need not respond to my opponent so I can take a big point."

This is the right move to prevent the cut at 'a', BUT saving those stones might not be as big as a point like 'b' (or enclosing one of the bottom corners.]
;W[kh]LB[cl:a][fp:b][ch:c][ql:d][qh:e]C["For my next move I was contemplating taking a move near a or b, but I was worried that my opponent would respond my enlaging his already big territory on the right side.  So I attempt a reduction."

The problem I see is that, if Black takes time to reduce White's area, he'll lose the chance to establish territory of his own.  Also, a reducing move will allow White to solidify his territory.

So if Black isn't going to start making territory with 'c', maybe he should invade the right side at 'd' or somewhere around 'e'.  One thing Black has is some thickness in the center, so he may be able to fight.]
;B[li]LB[lh:a][mi:b][mh:c][mm:d]C["My aim here was to threaten to push up into his territory.  Is this the right way to reduce this?  Also I was expecting the sequence a,b,c,d"

This just looks like it helps White make territory.];W[ki]C["Instead I got this.  Is my response played well?"]
;B[mi]C[I'm not sure; maybe you should just leave it as a forcing move and play elsewhere.]
;W[og]TR[li][mi]C[See, now those stones feel threatened, and White is expanding his area.]
;B[oi];W[pi];B[oj];W[mg];B[ol]LB[qk:a]C[This, in particular, seems bad.  Fighting with 'a' seems more likely to help.]

[br][as][bs]C["I decide the marked stones are okay for now and am deciding where to play a big point.  I was contemplating around a or b.  In hind sight would c be any good?  Are there any points I am missing?  Also, how serious a threat do the marked stones pose? "

Those are all big points.  I think 'c' is still the biggest.

The marked stones could be a real pain in the center, but I think 'c' is bigger than trying to close them in right now.  I could be wrong, though.

Look at the balance of territory.  White must have about 70 points (20 of which he solidified in the last 10 moves!), while Black has very little solid.

'c' would start marking out the area marked by squares, and a followup on the lower side or in the lower right corner could expand your area again.  If White doesn't invade the left or bottom side, he'll have to fight for the center.  The marked stones give him some influence there, but it's a fight at least.

If White does invade one of the sides, you fight there; if you can kill him, great, if not you'll solidify the part he didn't invade and get more influence in the center.]
;B[fp];W[cn]LB[ch:a]C["He responds after I play the extension.  Is this a common thing?"

He might have just expanded his left side area with 'a', but this is reasonable, too.  Also, you're extension is, again, a little wide, so he can think about jumping between your stones.]
;B[cl]TR[eh][gh][ih]MA[cp][fp][jq]C["After the game, I am really wondering about this whole fight.  At the time I thought I was fairly strong on the bottom and that it would be good to make him run the gauntlet.  I also thought I was making territory between where I was attacking, and the marked stones.  In hindsight I have this feeling that it may not have been such a good idea.  Can you tell me if I handled this all right or if there was a better way I could have done it?"

Making territory while attacking is always a good idea.  However, the marked stones at the bottom are fairly 'thin' in relation to each other, and the left side is still open.    Remember your fifth move?  because of it, even though you made a wide extension from the lower left corner, the corner still isn't well-connected in the middle of the lower side!

Still, this is the right start.];W[en];B[el]LB[do:a]C[In view of your thinness, I wonder if peeping at 'a' first would have been better.]
;W[dp]LB[do:a]C["Eww.  Didn't look so bad at the time, but afterwords I am starting to see that maybe I was too thin along the bottom to chase him that way.  I can keep him out, but this threat allows him to easily make two eyes.  Is there anyway to prevent him making an eye around a at this point?"

You could still try 'a' and fight it out.  You have lots of stones in the area, so fighting should be good for you.  Don't submit when you have more stones in the area!]

(;B[dq]C[See variation.];W[ep];B[eq];W[co];B[bp];W[gn]
(;B[gl]LB[hp:a][eo:b]C["So I start the chase up again.  Was his poor of me?"

You're still a little thin.  Maybe 'a' is better.  That also chases White, while making more territory on the bottom.

After 'a', black would be up to about 60 points, and White would still be attackable.

Possibly 'b' is better, too, trying to break up White's eye shape.  See variation.]
;W[fo];B[gp];W[in];B[il];W[fm];B[fl];W[em]LB[ip:a]C["He's got two eyes."

Yes, but he probably could have waited on this, perhaps playing 'a' to reduce your territory, or even breaking into the left side.

Anyway, you see how White's invasion helped you make territory on the lower side.]
;B[km]LB[ch:a][qp:b]C["This surely is an overplay right?  Should I have strengthened the bottom instead?"

This does nothing for Black.  'a' or 'b' to secure more territory would keep Black in the game.]
;W[ko];B[mn]LB[jo:a]C[This seems bad to me.  Black can cut and fight with 'a'.]
;W[kk]LB[jo:a]C["From this point on, my territory does nothing but shrink.  Any and all comments from this point out would be greatly appreciated, I'm not sure much what to say."

I'd still start by fighting with 'a', or by closing the lower right corner or the left side.  White is ahead, but it's still possible for Black to fight.]
;B[lk];W[kq];B[jp];W[jo];B[ij]LB[kp:a]C[This doesn't help.  Pushing through at 'a' would at least preserve lower-side territory, though the game is now very difficult for Black.]

'a' is small anyway.];W[qq]C["Ewww."
