;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dq];B[nc]LB[jd:a]C[The standard play is at a, making sanrensei.]
;W[oq]LB[pj:a][fd:b][cf:c]C[It is usually better to start pressing on black than to concentrate on your own formations, and it is much too early to think of taking territory, as in the lower right corner. A move at a would prevent a powerful black formation, while a move at b or c  would require a response from black, giving you the initiative.]
;B[cf];W[pj]C[Good.];B[dj]LB[jd:a]C[Black is much weaker on the upper left than white is at the lower right. However, if black gets to move at a, his formation becomes very strong over half of the board.]
;W[cn]C[White has sketched out more than half of the board, andBlack a bit less. The holes in both formations at top and bottom center are about equal. Both of black's corners are open to invasion at the 3-3 points. White has a clearly superior position.]
;B[fc]LB[jd:a]C[Black should not play for territory around a 4-4 point, which can be invaded. Using the wall on the left to build influence is the right way, and a is still the point to do it.]
;W[iq]LB[jp:a]C[Playing at a is better. It builds from strength on both sides, and leaves less room for invasion.]
;B[jd]C[Correct.];W[pg]LB[jm:a][jj:b]C[It is more important at this point to start building into the center at a or even b. These moves sketch out large two-dimensional spaces, whereas your actual move gives you only a small extension of territory on the side. The difference is more than ten points.]
;B[pf]LB[kh:a]C[Black should also move into the center, at or near a, rather than dispute this tiny side territory.]
;W[of]LB[qf:a]C[However, if you are going to dispute territory, do it on the edge side.]
;B[oe];W[ng];B[jg]LB[jl:a]CR[sf][rf][qf][nf][mf][lg][lh][ki]
[jj][ij][hk][gl][fl][el][dl][cl][bl][al]C[Good, but rather late. Black now has a bit more than one and a half sides of the board, plus an area on the upper left side surrounded by six stones. White has considerably more than one and a half sides, and excellent opportunities in the center. A move at a would give White a large prospective territory on the left and a huge territory on the right. The line of dots shows where the influence of the two sides would extend to. White would have a claim on rather more than half of the board.]
;W[lf]CR[ji][ii][hi][gi][fj][fk][li][fn][gn][hn][in][jn][lo]
[mn][nn][om][ol][nk][mj][ki][el][em][ko]C["I decide to push in to try to reduce some of black's territory at the top and buil influence in the center."

It is too soon to worry about reducing   Black's territory, when there is so much that you can grab by moving up from the bottom. The unclaimed area, outlined with dots, amounts to 35 points or more.]
;B[le]C[Sound defense. Invading the center is worth more, though.]
;W[jf]C[A clear overplay. There is no way you can maintain this connection.]
;B[kf];W[kg];B[ke]C[You have forced black to build a strong wall, so there is no further opportunity for invading along here.]
;W[jh];B[ig];W[lh];B[hh]CR[sf][rf][qf][pf][of][nf][mf][lf][kg]
[jh][al][bl][cl][dl][ii][hl][ik][ij][em][fm][gl]C[The line of dots shows that White stll has much larger territorial claims than Black.]
;W[ii]LB[jk:a]C[Too close to black. A move at a would close off the right side much more.]
;B[hi];W[ij]LB[il:a]C[Too tight. Extending to a is better.]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[dk];W[gk]C[Good.];B[bn];W[co];B[bo]
;W[cp]TR[dq]LB[bp:a]C[You can play at a, since you have the marked stone to protect the joint.]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[ek];W[gj];B[gi];W[qf];B[pe];W[qc]C[Once you invade, you should make sure to live. See variation 2.]

(;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[pc]LB[qe:a]C[Should have been a.]
;W[qe];B[rf];W[qg];B[qb];W[rb];B[rc];W[bj]LB[rg:a][cc:b]C[This stone shouldn't live, even if you get to move again. Block at a, or invade at b.]
;B[sd]C["I was happy that he ignore my ko threat because I didn't feel that hopeful about the top right corner anyway. But I thought I could do something with the left side."

Not against sound play.];W[ck];B[bk];W[cj];B[al];W[ch];B[dh]
;W[bg];B[ci]LB[bf:a]C[If Black plays at a instead, White cannot extend along the edge to get eye shape.]
;W[bi];B[di];W[be];B[cg]LB[cc:a]C[Black's 3-3 point, marked a, is still open for a White invasion. See Variation 2.]

(;W[bh]LB[cc:a];B[bf];W[af];B[bd];W[ae];B[ad]LB[ce:a]C[Playing at a would seal white in more effectively.]
;W[bp]LB[ao:a]C["I knew I was going to struggle to live on my own with the top left group, so I decided to try to kill the lower black group."

But Black at a makes the group unconditionally alive, with a line of four points.]
;B[ce]C[With this mistake the black group can be killed, and seven dead white stones come back to life.]
;W[ao]C[Correct. The Black group is dead.];B[ag];W[bm];B[bl]
;W[an];B[kq]TR[iq]LB[jp:a]C["He seemed to have an easy time invading. He did it to me twice. If I could have avoided even one of these I would have had a good chance of winning this one. What did I do wrong? If more defense is called for, when should I have played in here?"

As I said earlier, the marked stone should have been at a. However, there is still plenty you can do. The essential principle is not to let Black have a base on the edge, as in Variation 2. Then it is easy to deny him room to make eye space in the middle.]

(;W[jp];B[nq];W[np]LB[nr:a]C[Take out the base at a first.]
;B[mq]C[Black still lacks room to live.];W[kr]LB[jr:a][nr:b]
C[Too far. Black can play at a. The hane at b is better for White here.]
;B[lr]C[An error.];W[jr]C[Good.];B[or];W[pq];B[pr];W[qr]CR[os]
[ns][nr][mr][ms]C[Although you have not hemmed in Black as far as possible, it is enough. So far, Black can only make a five-space big eye out of the marked points, which is not enough to live in.]
;B[mp];W[no]LB[kp:a][lp:b]C[Black is threatening to make another eye by playing at a. This must be prevented. A White play at b on this move would not only prevent the eye, it would threaten to cut Black.]
;B[mo]LB[kp:a]C[An error. A Black move at a makes a second eye, but with this move White can take a.]
;W[nn];B[kp]C[Black makes a second eye, and is alive.];W[mn]
;B[ln];W[lm]LB[ko:a][lo:b]C[White at a would force Black at b. Then make the marked move.]
;B[kn];W[km];B[jm]C[An error.];W[jn]C[Yes. This cut walls Black in.]
;B[jo];W[in];B[ip];W[hp];B[io];W[ho];B[jq]C["I just wasn't sure about what to do to limit this invasion more? Suggestions?"

To summarize: Go for the vital points which Black needs in order to make eye shape, first along the edge, then toward the middle.]
;W[hr];B[el];W[em];B[im];W[hn];B[gl]LB[fm:a]C[You can connect at a in safety.]
;W[hl];B[fm];W[gm];B[fl];W[fn];B[hk];W[hm];B[hj];W[ik];B[nf]
;W[og];B[mf];W[lg];B[rg];W[rh];B[mg];W[mh];B[qh];W[qi]LB[ri:a]
C[You should play at a, saving your stone and preventing further invasion.]
;B[sh]LB[ri:a]C[Black should play at a.];W[ri];B[qs];W[rs];B[nr]
;W[ps];B[os];W[qs];B[ks];W[js];B[ls];W[ah]LB[si:a][sg:b]C[The point a is much more important. Your actual play is gote, giving up the initiative, since you will have to make the last move here. A move at a is sente, keeping the initiative, since Black's response at b is required, and is the end of the matter.]
;B[af];W[am];B[ql]C["I felt like I needed to play one more move on teh left side."   Yes, it was a life and death move.

"But then I missed the opportunity to solidify the right side. I still feel like it was my game to this point. Help!"

Yes, you were up about 15 points, even without another move on the right. If you crush this invasion, you win decisively, but if not, you lose.]
;W[qm]LB[rk:a][qn:b][qo:c][ro:d]C[Take out the base and seal the upper right with a instead. Push Black toward your stronger wall at the bottom with b or c, then cut the base from the other side at d. Black will have the minimum space for one eye along the edge, and neither time nor space to create one to the left.]
;B[qk];W[pk]LB[rl:a]C[The right move is at a, cutting out the base. Black cannot invade the center without getting eyes on the side first.]
;B[rj];W[si];B[rm];W[rn]LB[qn:a]C[One point higher, so your shape is solid. Black's base would not be wide enough to live. Even if he can stretch one point further, all he gets is a five-point big eye.]
;B[qn];W[qo];B[pm];W[pn];B[qm];W[om]LB[ro:a]C[You must protect your stone on the second line by playing at a. This is a 35-point move, the difference between winning by 15 and losing by 20.]
;B[ro]C[Now Black has a second eye, and the lead.];W[rk];B[sk]
;W[so]LB[rp:a]C[It is essential to wall Black in at a.];B[sn]
;W[sp]LB[rp:a]C[Wall Black in at a.];B[rp];W[rq];B[sq];W[sr]
;B[sp];W[qj];B[rl];W[sj];B[rk];W[sg];B[sf];W[sh];B[pl];W[ol]
;B[ih];W[ji]LB[qc:a][cc:b][ai:c][ak:d][lp:e][sm:f]C["I feel like I really messed up the defense against that last invasion. I got rattled and I was under some time pressure. Hmmm. . . I feel like I did okay in the opening and the early middle game

Right. You were well ahead then.

"but not after that."

Right. Your invasion at a should have succeeded (15 points given away there, or -15 points), and you should have invaded at b in the same way (-15 points). The White group around c should have died (+10 points), and the Black group around and below d should have lived (+ 20 points). Both of the Black groups e and f should have died (-50 points, -35 points).

"Please let me know what you think I did right and wrong in this game. Also, if you have study suggestions, I would be very interested."

I recommend "The Second Book of Go" from Ishi Press to anyone who needs the basics of life and death, invasions, countering invasions, the elementary strategic principles of the opening and middle game, and the elementary tactics of the end game. Some parts of the book may seem too easy, but much of it will be just right.  After that, there are books on every aspect of the game, so you should go to the publishers' Web sites and see what looks right for your stage of development.   "Thanks,
