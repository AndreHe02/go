C[Hello Bernhard, I'm Paavo Pietarila, 1 kyu from Finland. Since you seem to like fighting, I will try to show you how you could try to build positions that allow you to fight properly.
The points in this game were that:
1) in the beginning, you should have separated the white stones at upper right
2) at many places, you chased the enemy groups into the wrong direction
3) You tried to kill groups that should have been reduced
4) You failed to reduce the bottom, and it became white's territory
5) You made some "forcing moves" which only made white stronger, and resulted in some catasthrophes (bottom left)

I hope that this commentary does not discourage you! Fighting is the way to become stronger at Go, but you should prepare you fights! Make thickness before attacking! Keep your enemy separated! Use your attacks to build you territory and to reduce your enemys territory!]
;B[pc]C[This is a traditional, peaceful opening move. Traditionally though it is played at R16, which is supposed to be mote polite. Maybe you weren't trying to be polite?]
;W[qe]C[Approaching the corner right away shows initiative. Black could tenuki (play in some other corner) if he is not afraid of mokuhazushi (5-3 -point) josekis.]
;B[nd]LB[od:A]C[This move is common in some other situation, but here it decides the direction that black is going to play in and also allows white to tenuki. If you must play in this corner right away, I would prefer A, because it makes black stronger.]
;W[qh]LB[qd:A]C[This is a little cramped. Black can now play at A and make white slightly over-concentrated.]

(;B[qp]C[If you do not want to play the hoshi (4-4 -point) here, this is the right direction, because it is difficult for white to use his stones at the top. It is also a little boring, I would prefer a hoshi.]
;W[oq]C[White seems (over-?) active again. A calm move will do black no harm. On the other hand, black has no really good aswer to this, maybe a 2-space high pincer? (see variation)]

(;B[po]SQ[qe][qh]C[Q: Can this move turn bad if W pincers?
A: This move creates power, also in the direction of the marked white stones. The white stones are strong at this point so maybe there is some overlap of power here?]
;W[lq]C[White seems to favor small groups. Black has nothing to worry about here, because white is playing on a small scale.]
;B[qk]C[This is good. The fuseki so far seems strange to me, but since white has not achieved much, it must be OK to play this way. It makes black safe.]
;W[mc]C[This is weird, and an overplay and bad shape and whatever. Black has to play on top of this stone at N16.]
;B[qd]C[Forcing first seems like a good idea but..];W[ld]C[..it was too late, white can tenuki. Now since white did not answer your kikashi (forcing move) you must continue with it, or white will regard you as indecisive.]

(;B[id]C[This is an overplay, too. The white kosumi (diagonal shape of two stones) is strong, and it cannot be attacked without backup. You should have played further away, at the corner.]
;W[lf]C[Now, the black stones are getting weaker. Now it is about the last chance to play Q15: it keeps white separated and it makes you stronger.]

(;B[ed]C[This is not good. "Play urgent points before big points" - the upper right corner is much more urgent.]
;W[dp]C[But white also takes the corner. Now you have to play Q15, but..]
;B[cn]C[This is not urgent. You should try to imagine how unbelievably much stronger white will get if he gets to play at the upper right corner first.]
;W[fp];B[cj]SQ[lf]C[This developement favors white, because of the influence of the marked stone.]
;W[cd]C[It would be more normal to approach at the 3-3 -point. Black is happy to have white invade here.]
;B[ce]C[This move should give black a good result.];W[dd]C[(This is crude.)]
;B[de];W[ec];B[fd];W[fc];B[bd]C[This allows white maybe to cut off the J16 stone later?]
;W[bc];B[gd]C[No no. *Must* connect at B15, since you played B16 in the first place!]
;W[bf]C[OK, now this is weird. Looks like a misclick.];B[be]
;W[cg]C[This white group should not get very far, but black must be careful because 1) the cutting point at E15 and 2) walls may have ears, but they do not have eyes.]

(;B[eg]C[Q: Here I feel that in the continuation, I didn't gain enough profit from attacking the white invasion stones, which go in very deeply in a black stronghold. Should I have tried harder to capture them? I played in a smooth manner because often I attack too aggressively. What should I have done?
A: This looks like a correct move. It defends the black cutting point and chases white. The problem is: where you should chase him? There is aldo the problem that the black group on the left side is not very strong either.]
;W[dh]
(;B[eh]LB[eh:A][ej:B]C[Q: Perhaps it is better to try and build a moyo on the lower left, see the variation?
A: I think This looks good. The scale of the "moyo" with B is too small.]
;W[di]
(;B[dj]C[This is not too good. White separates your groups cleanly.]
;W[ei];B[fk]C[Wrong direction. The group at the top should extend instead. This looks if it is trying to catch white, but it can't.]
;W[gi];B[gc];W[cb];B[jg]C[This is good You separate the white groups from a distance. The only problem is that the groups at the top are not separated.]
;W[jc]C[This is not good as black does not have to answer.]

(;B[ic]C[This is not worth very much.];W[ib]
(;B[hb]LB[hb:A][jd:B]C[Is the variation better?];W[jd];B[fb]
;W[eb];B[ea];W[db];B[hk]LB[ij:A]C[As said before, the move at A looks better.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[ii];B[kh]C[Good, keep the groups separated.]
;W[pe]C[And FINALLY someone played this move. Now the white groups at the top are safe, so black should build thickness while attacking the only weak white group and then invade the lower side. The game looks good for black at this stage.]

(;B[nc]LB[nc:A][nf:C][hh:B]C[Q:Perhaps it is better to shut black's left group in (see the var.)?
A: Definitely. This move threatens to separate the white groups with C, but it is likely that they will live anyway, so chasing the group in the left is better.]
;W[jj]
(;B[lj]C[This is wrong. See variation for a better idea.];W[kk]
C[Now you are chasing white to the bottom, where he is safe.]
;B[nf]C[This splits the white groups apart, but it is unlikely that they will die. Also, since the points at this area of the board are mostly neutral, you cannot expect to gain much from this.]
;W[nb];B[ob];W[mb];B[kb]C[A bit overkill. Also makes the black group weaker, since the possibility to get an eye by playing at K18 is gone.]
;W[jb];B[je];W[ke];B[kf];W[kc];B[rg]C[Again you are trying to kill. Rather reduce the group from the outside first.]
;W[rf];B[qg];W[pg]
(;B[qf]C[Mistake. 
Yes. The white group will not die.];W[rd];B[rc];W[rh]C[Q:Would there have been a way for Black to kill white?
A: I dont think so, and there is no need to. Just reduce white to a very small group and attack the one on the left, if possible.]
;B[sd];W[re];B[nh]C[This move does not do much. Why separate two living groups?]
;W[rj];B[rk]C[No need to answer here, these are just points. You should chase the eyeless group.]
;W[qj];B[lk];W[kl]
(;B[ok]LB[pj:A]C[Better at A?
No. Better to play at the bottom.];W[fh];B[hh];W[hi];B[fg];W[ih]
;B[bp]LB[kn:C][ko:B][gp:A]C[OK, this is big. However, the white potential territory at the bottom will almost match black's territory, so this move is probably better at A, B or C.]
;W[cq]C[Now it is time to recude the white bottom..];B[pq]C[But you make more territory. This makes the game more close.]
;W[op]C[Now, if white gets too much at the bottom, he is ahead. Last chance to reduce. White has been too kind to answer you at C3 and P4.]
;B[nn]C[Is this reduction sufficient? You should try the other side. And remember, white still has no definite eyes with the center group.]
;W[mo]
(;B[eq]LB[eo:B][ho:A][eq:A]C[As the continuation shows, this is a mistake. I wanted to prepare an invasion on the bottom. Or should I reduce white, e.g. at A? Or the variation?

This is way too deep, and not a very good probe. It is sufficient to reduce white.]
;W[fq]C[After this, black can do next to nothing, but white is beginning to get a lot of territory at the bottom.]

(;B[ep]C[This is useless. Nozoki (peep) instead.];W[eo];B[bq]
;W[br];B[er];W[fr];B[dr]C[Not good.
Nope.];W[cr];B[cp]C[This exchange is bad.];W[do]C[The white stone at D5 is dangerous for black, as the game shows.]
