LB[pp:A][nq:B]C[Hi Benedikt!!
I'm Tim, Und ich komme aus Belgien:-)
I'll do my best to explain some things in your game.
I will add some variations and so on... maybe you will find not all of them to be very 'correct', but it is mostly to make clear what i mean.
First of all, maybe a detail, but when playing the 4-4 point, the 6-3 point is not really an attack, it is more an approach.
So... Let's see what I can do :-)




Dear teacher!

This is the first game I send to GTL to get comments, so I tried to put enough thoughts beside.

The game was played over IGS.
I have black.
At IGS, I play 28k.
White was ranked 26k on IGS.

In the opening, many moves seemed very new to me because I'm rather used to the 4,4 opening points A and the 6,3 attack B. I don't know if my opening moves were ok.

Later, I happened to see the chance of getting a moyo.

Then I did some mistakes and gave away a lot of this area.
From this point on, mistakes increased in an embarassing way and I finally had to resign.

The second half of the game contains many silly moves I've already understood (like fighting for already killed groups), but up to the invasion into the moyo, I would like to get a feedback if my interpretations were on the right way.

In advance, many thanks for the help and the time invested.

(;W[pc]C[Tim:

This is a rather strange opening for white... You 'd say it is a disadvantage for w.
He is too close to the upper side like this.

I haven't learned the tactical difference between the 4,4 and 3,4 opening yet.
By now, I usually play the 4,4.];B[ce]LB[de:A]C[Is this a recommendable attack?
Tim: it is good. There are some other points you can use...Like 'A']

(;W[de]C[
The answer is rather agressive, isn't it?

Tim: This is a normal answer for white.
Other possibilities are shown
I thought, the aim was to give a small live at the edge to black, building a strong wall of influence...]
;B[df]C[... so I tried not to be cut or pressed to the edge.]
;W[ee]C[the defence...]
(;B[ef]LB[cf:A]C[to prevent a cut at A and to get influence to the middle/to the lower side.

Tim: See variation];W[cd]C[threatens to cut.

Tim: you see c16 is an important point for both players. By playing e14 you gave a very large corner to white!]

LB[qe:A]C[the answer.

Tim: this wasn't really necessary for w
Moves like 'a' are bigger]
(;B[ch]C[extension.
Was the three fields move right?

It is ok to protect the cut; but there are bigger moves]
(;W[jq]C[Why not nearer to the corners?

Tim: This is in my opinion ok for white... White is certain he can live there... and he prevents you from making a hughe moyo]
;B[gq]LB[gq:A]C[trying to defend the lower left corner - to make white go for the lower right corner.
thus, only the lower right corner would need attention while the left one is protected by A and the group on the left side. (?)]
;W[mq]C[extension and attack for the right side
Tim: normal sequence];B[nq]C[too aggressive?
Tim:]
(;W[mp];B[np]C[Tim: white is much too gentle! He gives you a very big corner!!]
;W[qe]LB[qn:A]C[is this defensive move necessary?
(is it defensive anyway?)

wouldn't be A larger?];B[jd]C[chances to invade on the top become less

tim: K16 is ok

It is more difficult for white to go to r6 instead of r15 because with q17 these stones wouldn't work well together. Too far stretched out.]
;W[mo]
(;B[on]LB[no:A]C[
had A been better?

Tim: r6 had been better i think.]

;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr]LB[fq:B][gq:A]C[is it ok with A beside or should I have played the B move?]

(;W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn];W[dr];B[eo];W[ql]C[slight pressure on the lower right group

Tim: there isn't any pressure actually. White comes close to your strong group as close as he dares to.
You can play softly and 'defend your territory' or you can attack that white stone!

KILL!!!

(;B[pl]C[trying to press white to the edge.

I thought, space in the corner is still enough.

;W[rn];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[pk];B[ol];W[qj]C[Tim: boom! White gets a strong living group on the side!! Time to do something with your upper stone or with the white group on the bottom! Attacking while making a lot of territory yourself!]
;B[ok]
(;W[pi]
(;B[lk]C[he had got the edge; I thought I could go for the middle, living in the corner.

Tim: to be honest: This move doesn't do anything: you don't have sente (forehand), you don't make points, you don't attack white.... 
See some variations];W[lc]C[Tim: white is strong enough to make an extension like that... it gives him lot's of points, because he can attack the lone black stone now....]
;B[jc]C[reaction];W[mr]C[clearly sente, isn't it?

Tim: not really sente... you would lose points in the corner, but for the same thing you gain points somewhere else!
see variatons]
(;B[nr];W[gc]C[I would have liked to play this one myself...
Tim: yes big point!!!
White still has the upper territory... those k16 stones have become more or less useless now]
;B[hb]C[to get an eye on the edge.];W[le];B[kf]LB[jf:A]C[is it the right extension or would A have been better?

Tim: since white is strong, he should cut you and make you crawl for two eyes!

;B[hd]LB[kb:C][hc:A][he:B][hg:D]C[helping the upper group.

For that purpose, was it the right one?
What about A,B,C,D?

Tim: h16 is a bad move... it doesn't do anything....
And as you see... white has gotten a very strong wall very close to the bottom group... you can't attack that anymore... and when white would play p10.... or invade your left territory... you lose]

When leaving this one, it seemed worth it.

Tim: sometimes, you have to make sure you don't sacrifice cutting stones... sacrificing is ok, depending what you sacrifice :-)]
;B[ni]C[instead, would I better have covered other risks...?
Tim: this is , alas, a hopeless move to reduce white's hughe territory:(]
