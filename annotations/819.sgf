C[Héctor Lago,

 I am DS:  I am a strong 8k* on IGS. My comments will be preceded by "DS:" I understand you (Hector) played W in this game.]

(;W[cf]N[real progress]C[DS: W can tenuki like this, but a more standard, calm move would be to move G5.  But  I guess your move at C14 is ok too. PRLV (please review last variation)]
;B[fd];W[di];B[ip]C[DS: Seems slack to me. Approach moves such as R6 seem much bigger now.]
;W[qf]C[DS: Correct direction of play.  A move at O17 would be wrong direction.]
;B[nd];W[pj]C[DS: Calm opening so far, but it looks to me like W has the advantage.]
;B[pn]C[DS: Not so good.  O3 better as it is an extension as well as an approach move.  O6 is just an invasion that has little outside help.]
;W[np];B[qp];W[qq];B[qo]C[DS: submissive. Not appropriate with spirit of invading with Q6.  I think the fighting move would be S3, but then B would have preferred to have Q6 at R6.]
;W[rq];B[qk]C[DS: This just induces W to play R10 and have excellent shape.]
;W[qj];B[rk];W[rj]C[DS: As B's R5 group is open at the bottom, W has the initiative.]
;B[rp];W[rd];B[qc];W[bd];B[cc];W[pk];B[qm]C[DS: W is doing fine so far.  B seems to be just repsonding to W's play by play.]
;W[jc]C[DS: Big invasion.];B[hc];W[mc];B[nc]
(;W[md]C[DS: not so good.  Perhaps O18 hane would be better, I'm not sure. PRLV]
N[real progress.];B[rc];W[kq];B[jq]C[DS: Not so good.  Enemy helping,  Just strengthens W's corner.]
;W[kp];B[in];W[bc]C[DS: big move, but not the right timing.]
;B[dm]C[DS: Now W wishes he had played G5 before.]
(;W[fn]C[DS: Wrong direction.  D8 seems the only move to force B toward the right.  Also W now has to worry about the cut at C5. PRLV]
N[real progress];B[el];W[ho]C[DS: This peep has no meaning. Just strengthens B.  Peep like this to make your opponent heavy, not thick.]
;B[io]
(;W[em]C[DS: bad move. Wrong direction too.  W should play at D8 insead. Otherwise  W's C8 stone will be severely weakened when B plays D8.  PRLV

 If W is trying to capture and kill B he will be disappointed.]
N[real progress];B[dl];W[fl]C[DS: Bad move, B could have easily played E6, then C9.]
;B[ej];W[ck]C[DS: W lucky!];B[fk];W[dk];B[ek]C[DS: Bad move. Play E6 or better G8 before connecting]
;W[gl];B[fh]C[DS: B has easily escaped and has run right through W's potential moyo.]
;W[gk]C[DS:  Bad move.  W has to fix holes on the left now.  E13 or such.  W should be looking at P 14 too to expand his group on the right.]
;B[gj];W[hj];B[gi];W[jk];B[ie]C[DS: Good attacking move. B looking at nice profit if he can get to play  C15 then D14.]
;W[ne];B[mb];W[lb];B[nb];W[kc];B[oe];W[me];B[co]C[DS: Big cut, but too late now.  W should have connected earlier, but W can live ok in the center.]
;W[cm];B[en];W[fo];B[og]C[DS: Big move.  Has effect on both W's groups.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[qh]C[DS: W forced and loses many points.  Compare if W had played P14 first.]

(;B[dh]C[DS: Now all of B's groups are safe, he can attack W's thin postitions.  However, I think I would have considered C15 instead. PRLV]
N[real progress];W[ch];B[dg];W[cg];B[dj];W[cj];B[gq];W[ec]C[DS:  Why give B a prisoner?]
;B[dc];W[ee]C[W could have done the peep without E17.];B[ed]
;W[ei]C[DS: once you play E15, now you will have to save it, otherwise the peep had no meaning. W can easily be cut off with B at D15.]
;B[fi];W[eh];B[eg];W[ci];B[fg];W[ih];B[mg];W[kf];B[hi];W[ji]
;B[kn]C[DS: B should continue to attack W.  This move is inconsistent with that plan.]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[jp];B[iq];W[nh]C[DS: Bad peep, just helps B create bamboo connection.]

;B[ke]C[DS: attacking W's connection.];W[kd];B[je];W[lh];B[le]
C[DS: W let B cut him off. Now he has to make life at the top while B secures surrounding territory.]

;W[bb];B[cb];W[he];B[hd];W[hf];B[ja];W[ka];B[ib];W[jb];B[ia]
;W[ic];B[hb];W[ma]C[DS: Endgame, and not even sente.  B can ignore this.  Try to watch for sente plays, they are very important.]
;B[ge];W[ig];B[ce];W[be];B[re];W[rf];B[sd];W[eq];B[er];W[lf]
;B[id]C[DS: M14 and J16 are miai.  Playing either now does nothing for the game.  You should consider delaying these moves and use them as ko threats instead at a later time.]
;W[na];B[oa];W[la];B[ob];W[gf];B[ff];W[df];B[ef]C[DS: The game is still close, but B has been gaining significant profit and now is ahead by about 6 points. W has territory on the left and right bottom with little chance to reduce B or expand his own territory.]
;W[ol];B[sq]C[DS: This is a sente move by Black.  W's P8 was purely defensive.]
;W[sr];B[sp];W[qr];B[nn];W[on]C[DS: Bad move, just invites B to play atari at P5.  Try to avoid reflex moves like this. Think before you play that stone.]
;B[oo];W[op];B[om];W[po];B[on];W[lq];B[mm];C[DS: Bad move.  W has to connect at O8 or at least play N8. L7 is just nonsense.]

(;W[ln]N[real progress.];B[kr]C[DS: This endgame move is big, worth at least 8 points. maybe more. PRLV]

;W[sj];B[ba];W[ks];B[jr];W[kl]C[DS: the rest of the game is just minor endgame moves.  At this point W is too far behind to win without a blunder by B and capturing a large group.]
;B[ao];W[am];B[hn];W[gn];B[go]C[DS: Silly. just gives w another point. F4 at least threatens a snapback. G4 does nothing.]
;C[DS: Ditto.  E5 only.  there is no shortage of libs here to take advantage of.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[dn]C[DS: I guess if W now started the ko, he could connect at F7 since B would be forced to connect at F10 first.]
;W[gp];B[fp];W[go]

;W[lg];B[fm];W[ki];B[em]C[DS: B still should connect at P16, but is so far ahead that it doesn't matter.     DS:  W started out ok and was ahead early on, but lost the game by trying to capture B's group on the left and losing points to gote plays and careless reflex plays.
