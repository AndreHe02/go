C[   Hi, my name is hubert, playing black.

  Thank you for taking time reviewing my game!!
     Although i won the game by resign and white didn't give me a tough time, i felt that my pace is too slow, and sometimes i lost sente.
  Generally, I hope you could answer my question in the game, and also show how to speed up the pace of my stones, thank you!!
  One more thing: i have a strong group at the top left at the beginning, but in the end of the game, i felt that i didn't make any use of that group.
I hope you could show me touse my strong group correctly.

benni: Hi! My name is benni and i play often at kgs, too. Maybe we met sometime :-) I hope i can answer some of your questions but in some cases i am uncertain, too.
if you have any further questions, feel free to ask again per mail: benni@obda.de]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[dd]C[benni: This joseki is called "nadare" or "avalanche" and is sometimes complicated. If yoo want to avoid complications maybe c14 is better.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[cc];B[df];W[cg];B[eh]LB[fd:A][pd:B][kc:C]C[benni: maybe better at A to make a strong group towards your stone at B. or it is also possible to play around C.]
;W[jc];B[mc]LB[fd:A][lc:B]C[does white have to play at C12? (joseki?)

benni: c12 is one possible followup, but maybe to low here.

is N17 proper answer? should i be closer? (M17)?

benni: i had played at A or B. your wall is not so strong with the weakness.]
;W[fc];B[eb];W[gd]C[benni: you have to make an empty triangle now or in the next turn, so maybe it is better to make it now and leave more aji.]
;B[fd];W[fe];B[ed];W[gc];B[ge]LB[ke:A][hg:B]C[benni: to small to capture one stone. you strengthen whites group in the process. around  A is the direction of Attack if you feal your group is strong. and around B if you think your group is weak.]
;W[he];B[gf];W[hf];B[gg];W[ke];B[ch]LB[ci:A]C[i thought i can gain something here if white didn't play C12.
is C12 a proper way to attak?

benni: i would play at A to enclose white in the corner.];W[dg]
;B[cf];W[bf];B[be]C[benni: this is a mistake.];W[bd]C[benni: large mistake

if white plays B13, what can black do?

benni: nothing. maybe you can gain some points in the endgame iin the top left. thats all.]
;B[bg];W[ae];B[eg];W[jp]LB[cn:A][cm:B]C[just wondering, if white desperately need to catch up, which direction should white play?

benni: white sould play at A or B to counter your strength at the top left.]
;B[qj]LB[cn:A]C[benni: i would play directly at A to make full use of black strength.]
;W[qf];B[qd];W[pi];B[pj];W[oi];B[pf];W[oe];B[od];W[pe];B[rf]
;W[qg];B[cn]C[it seems that both weak white groups at top are settle, should i split them apart by playing something near N14?

benni: the withe groups are both not really weak and C6 is a very large move.]
;W[dl]C[benni: white should not pincer in the direction of your massive wall.]
;B[cq]LB[en:A][em:B]C[benni: you should use your strength to attack the single white stone at A or B]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co]LB[do:A][bn:B][dn:C]C[benni: mistake: should be at A, black has to answer at B, white C and black has gained some points but white has countered blacks strenght and build up one strength in the process -> big loss for black.]
;B[do];W[bo];B[bn];W[eo];B[dn];W[en];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]

(;B[mq]C[E7 hane seems bit risky, i chose N3 for corner territory or side territory. what do you think?

benni: the cut is good, i think. white cant catch the cutting stone at E7 and his D8 stone cant make life. see variation (one of may of course). but if you feal it is to risky, than it is also possible to let the cut for later.]
;W[dm]LB[nk:A]C[how should i  enlarge the territory at the lower left?
i was thinking to play R5, but it seems if white play P10, my stones will become lower to the side.

benni: corner is huge. there is not much to gain for white in the middle and i cant see a way to attack white p11-group profitable.  but localy A looks nicer for me.]
;B[oj];W[ni]LB[mk:A]C[benni: again better to play the keima.]
;B[nj];W[mi]LB[lk:A]C[benni: and again, keima is better shape in this kind of position.]

benni: not necessary, see variation.];W[ln];B[sp];W[sq]
(;B[rs];W[qs]C[i am totally stuck here, dont know how to properly push out the white stones.

should i give up and play P7, and then reduce by either playing at top (around H8), or slide under K3?

benni: white is alive now. see variations.]
(;B[ko]C[i tried to cut.];W[lo];B[lp];W[kp];B[jn];W[kl];B[ip]
;W[iq]C[now i am in big trouble....
although i got out in the end,  does white have better attack sequence?

benni: maybe the variation.];B[io]
