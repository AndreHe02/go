C[Hi,
this game is a terribile one.
I was white and I probably made lots of errors in the opening and I'd like to have your comments about it.]

(;W[cm]C[I fear this isn't the right answer... what should I have done?

I Think this is playable];B[ch]
(;W[ep]C[I don't think this is correct after you have played c7.

You should leave the area and defend at c14 or c15 instead. Later on, you may be able to capture e3 on a larger scale.]
;B[ce];W[ed]C[This is not very effective since it doesn't threaten anything on the left side. I think f16 is better]
;B[hc];W[cd];B[de];W[ee]C[Error?

Maybe not. You don't want to permit black to play e15. But your shape is not very good]
;B[mc];W[qn]C[Here start a bad sequence... I wonder what shoud I have done.

This move in itself can't be bad. Mabe o3 is better but it's hard to tell]
;B[ql];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[nq]
;B[mo]C[What to do now?

The standard move in this shape is n3, to protect against black n3. But white n3 is probably gote, so I can see why you didn't play it]
;W[qf];B[qh]
(;W[qj]C[This looks desperate. I think that you should play r17 instead. If you are not prepared to do that then you sholdn't have played r14]

;B[mq]C[I fear this is a bad result for white...

n3 was expected. Just answer at o2 and everything is OK, but the centre is perhaps more urgent]
;W[mj];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[ps];B[re];W[ng];B[dp]C[What to do now?]

(;W[dq]C[Only play below if black cannot capture e4 in a ladder!.
The ladder doesn't work here, but m10 is a good ladder-breaker

Play d5 instead if the ladder is no good.];B[do]

;W[jr];B[hr];W[jp];B[gs]C[I feel this is again a not so good result... Am I wrong?

You are absolutely right, but after c5 it is difficult to get a good result]
;W[kc];B[pf];W[pg];B[og];W[sg];B[nf];W[nh];B[of];W[ke];B[jd]
;W[kd];B[if]C[What to do now?

I think you should jump towards the centre and connect to the o12-stone
Later you can aim at a splitting attack on n9/j14]

I'd like to know what could I have done to save things or at least to avoid losing this badly.
Thanks for your attention,
