After I killed white central group I though I was winning, but I lost by 3.5 pts. I would like to know what was the loosing move and where and how I loss.

:: Hello, be prepared: Seldom is it one move that is the cause for defeat.]

:: I think this is too low in respect to the left stone.

RdRunner: The position is not as much of a concern here.  B needs to put more pressure to W's stone.  Therefore, M4 or N3 are usually used.  (In other words, if B is to extend, why stop at L3/L4?)  W invade between L3 and D3 will either: 1. Endanger P4, or 2. Make B's corner solid territory.  These are the reason that invasion is welcome.]

:: I am not sure whether L3 was good or bad - be it. I am quite sure that building up your position totally on the 3rd line is bad.
Actually it looks somewhat crammed.

RdRunner: Two points:

1. B should have finished the joseki at R6.  It givesB  a better shape; and raise the position up to the forth line.
2. Right, the position is a major concern at the lower side now.  However, either B J4 or H4 still leave space for W's invasion (and there's no single move to save the lower side); the correct move would be L5.  As stated before, W's invasion is welcome.]

(;B[kc]C[
:: I am not a fan of such moves. They don't put pressure on the opponent. She can just tenuki and choose the place to put pressure on you.

RdRunner: B needs to understand the nature of this move: You're letting W to choose side.  B could play either O17 or H17 directly, but instead L17.  The condition for the move is there should be enough room at either sides to expend.  And the thinking is: If B weights right side more, B would play O17; if weights left, go for H17 --- B couldn't decide, L17 is the move.  Thus, letting W makes the decision which side is bigger: if right, W will N17; if left, W will J17.]
;W[co]
(;B[cp]C[
:: Too much creeping. You are still improving a quite solid 3rd-line position. How about pincering from the other side?

RdRunner Pincer from the other side is an excellent choice.  B has enough stones (3) on the lower side for the fight, the lower side need not to be strengthed further.  Pincer is a better choice.]
;W[do]
(;B[fq]C[
:: That's what white wanted. Don't give way too often. Play from the other side. What could happen to the corner?

RdRunner: E4 is the move --- raise B's position and solid the corner.  Nothing will happened to the corner.]

:: I'd rather hollow white's position from below and chase him out.

RdRunner: Unfortunately, W is out (F5) already.  The upper (O17/H17) or the right side (R6) should be the focal point.]
;W[en];B[qf]C[
RdRunner: Take a look at this move.  On the upper and right side, due to this invasion, B has 3 weak group: L17, R14, and R4.   R14 is a move that creates weak group.  At the most, leave ONLY and ONLY ONE weak group on the board --- strength the weak group ALWAYS comes first.]
;W[qe]
(;B[qg]C[
:: Actually this is a strange reply. Replying the standard-way would put more pressure on white's top corner group. And there is still that black stone at the top edge that can be used.

RdRunner: Either way, B can't be expecting good result.  If use the standard: B Q14 instead of R13; W O16 B R11 W R10 or W O16 B S10 W S9.  In either secquence, when R14 group is safe, B has to deal with the safety of L17 and R4 at the same time --- again, don't create weak groups to become opponent's target.]
;W[nd];B[hc];W[gc]C[
RdRunner: W is very nice, responding to B's every move.  W R10 will double play B's weak groups at the right side.]

(;B[ic]LB[gc:B][fd:A][hd:C]C[
:: Again. Isn't there a proverbe about tiger's mouths (A, B and C) and playing into them? :-)

RdRunner: Excatly.  B should H16 instead of J16.];W[qh]
(;B[ph]C[
:: Well, I'd simply jump out and put pressure on afterwards. And then from the other side, perhaps.

RdRunner: More than one weak groups, B should try to live than to move toward to the center.  S12 is better.]
;W[qi];B[of]
(;W[oh]C[
:: Here white offers himself for attack. It would be better for white to not play contact-moves like this. Better stay away a bit!

RdRunner: It's the opposite around: B is the one and only target.  It's W's 7 stones against B's 4 stones.  P12 maybe agressive, but it's not an overplay.]

:: What are your plans?
What groups are weak? What groups are settled. Where could you attack? How should you attack?

Many questions to be answered. ;-)

RdRunner: The only weak group on board right now is W D5.  It's clearly that W's trying to use the potential to get a center territory (thanks for B who willingly stays at the lower position).  Let's do a counting here assuming W's next move is N8: B has 22 (lower left) + 7 (lower right) + 2 or possibly more (upper right) + 6 (upper) + 10 or so (upper left) = about 50 pts.  W has 20 (upper left) + 20 (upper right) + 8 (lower right side) + 20 (lower right center) = about 70 pts.  B's last hope is to attack D5 or to have moyo around center.  To attack D5, starting from H6.]

RdRunner: Let's count again:

B: 7~8 (right side) + 22 (lower left) + 20 (upper left and upper) = about 50 pts --- no increase from last time.  Also, may gain more from the left side.

W: 20 (upper right) + 20 (upper left) + 2 (lower left) + 20 (lower right) + 2 (center right) = 64 pts.

RdRunner: From the previous counting, getting the center stones only bring B back to the game.  W plays a better ending and was able to turning the table around.  It's very hard to say that if there's a winning or losing move.  But the ending game does determine the game.  While B thinks he is enjoying a comfortable lead, W's actually not far behind and catching up.

Do the counting several times in the game, it will make you realize how far ahead or behind in the game; and also determine how you will play the remain of the game (if ahead, conservative; behind, aggressive --- an example).

Do a counting --- a very rough one --- when opening stage is over, gives you an idea about leading, behind, or even.  Therefor, decide how agressive or conservative you would be in the fighting stage.  Do another counting after the fighting stage, to see if you are truely leading or just an illusion --- if leading, by how much?  And, keep up with counting during the ending game stage, see if anything has been changed drastically.  It maybe time consuming, but that's how to keep you away from a surprise like this.
