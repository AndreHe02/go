C[B: I played B. I was outplayed in the beginning, the opponent managed to get way ahead, and also around mid-game, I lost two stones, which I think were quite important.

Just need suggestions if can you make a come back once left with a huge gap?

And also I would appreciate if you can comment on my style of play in general (weakness, etc.).

jl: it is polite to resign if you are 30 points behind. Do not continue playing if there is really no hope of coming back.]
PL[B];B[qd];W[qp];B[dc];W[cp];B[qm]MA[ce][oc][eq][oq]C[R7 is not the best move, because the corners are more important at the very beginning. For example you could play at any of the marked points.]
;W[ce];B[fc]C[F17 is too low: all your stones are on the third line. It should be at F16.]
;W[oc]C[P17 is not very good for two reasons: the C15 stone needs to be reinforced after B played F17, and the upper side is not very interesting because of the low stone at F17, which prevents a large development.]

(;B[pf]C[B plays defensively. See variation for a more active line of play.]
;W[oq]C[White should defend his P17 stone instead.];B[fp]C[B should instead take advantage of the two weaknesses left by W, by attacking either C15 or P17. By attacking, B can take control of the game.]
;W[pe]C[W Q15 is not good, because B will cut and get a good position. If W wants to defend P17, it is better to play solidly at M17 to avoid a pincer by B at N17.]

(;B[qe]C[B is much too submissive! B must cut (see variation).]
;W[kc]C[L17 is too distant from P17 because B is strong enough in the area to play N17. W should play at M17 instead.]
;B[ic]C[B J17 helps white to defend the top. Again, B could play more agressively with N17 or C13.]
;W[kq]C[W should defend at N16 instead. After J17 B is too strong in the top area. If W absolutely wants to play at the bottom, a pincer against F4 (at J3 or J4) would be better]
;B[dq]C[The top area is more important since B has an advantage there: B should play N17 or C13. F4 is not under strong pressure since L3 is too far away. If B really wants to defend at the bottom, J3 is better than D3.]
;W[dp]
(;B[ep]C[B E4 gives W the forcing move at C3 so maybe B E3 is better (see variation).]

(;W[ci]C[Again C11 invites a black invasion at C13, so W should just play C12 instead. But W should first play a forcing move at C3 (see variation).]
;B[iq]C[B J3 makes a nice shape but preventing W C3 is more urgent. C3 is a very big point for both sides.]
;W[br]C[W is much too kind. Avoid moves on the second line early in the game. C3 would be much better, because it keeps the initiative by forcing B to answer. Here B does not have to answer B2.]
;B[dr]C[B: I think here I should have put a stone on the right side, because W group here look very strong.

jl: D2 is too submissive and too low (second line). B could keep the initiative by attacking W at either C13 or N17. Playing on the right side (at Q10) would be solid but slower.]
;W[cm]C[B: Now it's very hard to attack the W group.

jl: C7 is a bit too close to the C4-D4 group. The general rule is to play at a distance N+1 from an N stone group. W C8 would be a better balance with C11.]
;B[cd]C[This move is not urgent. B could also attack directly at N17, keeping the option of playing C13 later.]
;W[ef]C[The standard answer to a contact move like C16 is to extend at D15.]

(;B[no]C[B could instead take advantage of white's mistake immediately (see variations).]
;W[po]C[The exchange W Q5 - B P7 gives a better result for B (strengthening the right side). W could first defend at N4 then look for an opportunity to attack O5.]
;B[om];W[jr];B[ir];W[mq];B[ko]C[L5 doesn't achieve much. B could attack at N17 or C14, or defend the right side at Q11.]
;W[qb]C[Now it becomes more difficult for B to attack the top W group.]
;B[ro]C[S5 is not really sente at this point. B could play E7 or Q11.]
;W[fm]C[F7 is good. It works well with the left side and B L5 becomes a wasted move.]
;B[qf]C[R14 makes this group overconcentrated. If B wants to defend the right side, play Q11 instead. After R14, W can still reduce the right side at P10 or Q10. W could not cut at R14 anyway, because B R13 would capture it.]
;W[jb]C[Now W has significantly reduced the threat of B N17.]
;B[ib]C[B is a bit submissive. B could play C14 instead, leading to a potential exchange of territory.]
;W[li]C[W could go further than this to reduce the B right side, for example at P10.]

(;B[ni]C[B must be careful because the white moyo on the left is larger than the black moyo on the right. So B could play on the other side at K11 to threaten the W stone and destroy the W moyo (see variation).]
;W[hj];B[lk]C[B M9 invites W N10 later, so it doesn't achieve much. B will not be able to defend both on the right and below. B could instead play C14 and start eroding the W moyo on the left.]
;W[jk]C[W K9 is almost a dame (makes no points). W could play B15 (or S17) instead.]
;B[cq]C[C3 is small and not urgent. W would not play C3 just to gain one point in gote, so it is black's privilege to choose when to play there. C14 is much bigger.]
;W[lj]C[W B15 or S17 would be better.];B[mk]C[The M10-N9 exchange is more beneficial for B than for W, so W shouldn't initiate this exchange.]
;W[bq];B[lf]C[B C14 or S17 are bigger. M14 has a rather vague purpose.]
;W[ig]C[B: Here, W had quite an advantage already.

jl: The W moyo is still open at C14, L12 and G8, and W has weaknesses at the top.]

(;B[je]C[See variations for potential reductions of the W moyo. K15 is almost a dame (makes no points, does not remove any points from W). If B doesn't know how to erode the W moyo, make at least a useful move such as S17, which is very big.]
;W[km]C[L7 is small. B15 or S17 are much bigger.];B[gn];W[kl]
C[B should simply defend at G7.];B[ln]C[Again this is very small. C14 and S17 are much bigger.]
;W[he]C[B15, S17 or S4 would be bigger.]
(;B[jn]C[If B wants to play in this area, the correct move is G7 (see variation).]
;W[md];B[nf]C[C14 or S17 would be bigger.];W[rc]C[Good.];B[rd]
C[Answering submissively like this is painful for B. This is why S17 was important.]
;W[jg]C[W K13 still lets B play L12. If W wants to defend here, play L13. But B15 and S4 are bigger.]

(;B[kg]C[C14 is bigger. If B wants to play in the center, the correct point is L12 (see variation).]
;W[kk]C[L9 is very small. Since the center W "territory" is open at two points (L9 and L12) and is small anyway, it is not worth investing two moves in gote to defend it. Again, B15 and S4 are bigger.]
;B[il]C[B could simply push at G7 in sente instead.];W[jp]C[W K4 is not really sente. W must defend the center first at G8.]

(;B[ip]C[B should reduce the W center instead at G8 or G9 (see variation).]
;W[bd]C[Finally! But B15 would be more solid.]
(;B[bp]C[B should take advantage of the W weakness at D15 (see variation). B4 doesn't work anyway.]
;W[bo];B[co]C[This gives one more prisonner to W.]
(;W[ap]C[W should resist at D5 instead (see variation).];B[do]
;W[dm]C[Good. This also helps a little against the weakness at G8 but there is still a weakness at G9.]

(;B[gf]C[W should be able to resist here. B should erode at G9 instead (see variation).]
;W[gh]C[W should resist at G15 instead. The B stone should die. If W wants to defend, it should be at F13. W G12 gives B a good continuation move at F13 later.]
;B[fe]C[This should be at G15 to allow the continuation move at F13 later. But B G9 is bigger.]
;W[gk]C[Finally!];B[gl];W[bb]C[W B18 doesn't work because of the weakness at D15. W must defend at F8 or S4 (see variations).]

(;B[bc]C[B should capture B16 and B18 but can also play E8 (see variations).]
;W[be]C[B: I think I should place at H14 now, to capture W stone 56.

jl: B A17 is also big, because after W A17, white has a good continuation move at C17.]
;B[ac];W[cb]C[W should leave this as a potential ko threat for later. The exchange C18 - C17 only strengthens black.]
;B[cc];W[hf]
(;B[kh]C[B E8 is bigger.];W[ji]
(;B[ik]C[Too small. E8, S3 and F13 are bigger (see variations).]
;W[fg]C[Good, but blocking at F8 is bigger.];B[fl]C[E8 was bigger but this is still very good.]
;W[ej]C[W can defend at E9 instead.];B[em]
(;W[cn]C[W should defend at E8 instead (see variation).]
(;B[en]C[B should push first at D8 to make points in sente (see variation).]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[io]C[A gift for B.];B[jo];W[mh];B[nh];W[ek];B[ki]
C[Keep such moves in reserve as a potential ko threat. There was no urgency to play it. B could play S4 or S3 instead.]
;W[kj];B[mi]C[B doesn't gain much with this move.];W[lh];B[mg]
C[S3 is bigger.];W[jh]C[K12 is very small. S4 is much bigger.]
;B[lg]C[M13 is a dame (makes no points) and was not necessary.]
;W[bp]C[Again S4 is much bigger.];B[cs]C[Small because it is not sente.]
;W[el]C[S4 and J10 are much bigger.];B[hk]C[J10 is bigger.]
;W[ij]
(;B[fk]C[Q17 is bigger (see variation).];W[is];B[hs];W[ke]
(;B[jd]C[K16 was not necessary (see variation).];W[db];B[eb]
;W[de];B[gj]
(;W[ab]C[A18 is called "dying in gote".  The W group is still dead, so W has wasted a move and given one extra prisonner. W should play E16 instead (see variation).]

(;B[da]C[B should play E16 instead (see variation).];W[gd]
(;B[gc]C[B should connect the two stones instead (see variation). But S3 is big too.]
;W[fd]C[B: Here is where I lost the two stones (75 and 77).]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[hg]C[This just gives an extra prisonner.];W[fi]
;B[if]C[B J14 is a dame (wastes a move and makes no points). S3 instead.]
;W[gi]C[G11 is small. S4 is much bigger.];B[ie];W[gg];B[hh]
C[B should keep such moves as ko threats for later.];W[ih];B[ad]
;W[me]C[W must defend at A15 instead.]
(;B[le]C[B should take advantage of white's mistake (see variation). A15 is sente, M15 is not.]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[lc];B[ja]C[K19 is gote, so it is small at this point. B should play A15 sente then S3.]
;W[ka];B[ia]C[B need not defend K19 right now. Play the sente move at A15 first. And after this, S3 is bigger than defending K19.]
;W[lm]C[W A15 or S4 is bigger.];B[mm];W[pc];B[kf]C[L14 is a dame: makes no points and wastes a move. Almost any other move is better than this.]
;W[rp]C[Finally!];B[jc];W[rn]
(;B[qn]C[W can play L18 first because it is sente (see variation). If B wants to defend here, S7 is better than R6.]

(;W[qo]C[W can push at S7 (see variation).];B[rm]C[B could play L18 sente first.]
;W[kb];B[mc];W[mb];B[nc]C[Do not play shishos (ladders) which do not work. You are just giving more prisonners.]
;W[nb];B[nd];W[ne];B[od];W[pd];B[qc];W[sn]C[W S18 is bigger than T6, because B has a good continuation at Q18 after S18, so S18 is big and sente for B.]
;B[sm]C[B should play S18 or A15 instead.];W[so]C[W S18 is bigger than T5.]
;B[lp]

(;B[mo]C[B N4 would be bigger; it threatens B O2 later.];W[mp]
;B[op];W[nr];B[lo]C[M5 is worth half a point only. N10 is bigger (one point in reverse sente equals two points in gote). B can also play Q4 sente.]
;W[pp];B[jm];W[dn];B[eo];W[dd];B[ec];W[on];B[nm]C[B can play O6 instead.]
;W[nn];B[ar]C[This is just a gift of one stone.];W[cr];B[ds]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[mj];B[nj];W[mf];B[ng];W[fj];B[gk]C[Do you see a pattern here? B keeps answering passively to white's moves. B has lost many points in the endgame.]
;W[jf];B[id];W[hi];B[bn]C[Another gift of one stone.]
(;W[bl]C[W need not lose one point here. Just play elsewhere to win one point (the black prisonner). See variation.]
;B[an]C[Yet another gift of one point.]
(;W[bm]C[W need not answer (see variation).];B[as]C[A fourth point given! Not only this, but each time W does not answer, B has just wasted a move for nothing.]

jl: B missed many opportunities as shown previously. If you had to keep only two ideas from this game:
- avoid playing dames (moves which do not make any points). Always try to make moves which have a purpose.
- try to play sente moves instead of gote, to keep the initiative.]
