C[NNGS game  vs Viking (computer).  I'm rated at 16k, it's 18/19k or so it claims.

An ugly game in many ways.  Thought I got mugged strategically, but managed to win the fight in the middle, though I'm not very sure what was going on.]
;B[cp];W[qd];B[dd];W[pq];B[qi]C[This seems wrong - invading before securing any corners.  Is it?

No - this is one of many reasonable moves];W[eq];B[lc];W[oc]

 eek started observation.];W[eo];B[kq];W[qo];B[en];W[dp];B[fo]
;W[ep];B[cq];W[dn];B[co];W[fn];B[em];W[go]C[G6 better?  I wanted to disconnect the L3 stone which is looking weaker with every move.

I think this also if fine.];B[cl];W[ql]C[Now I push the R11 stone.

This is too early, I think.  The double wing formation in the upper left is dangerous.  A Move  along the top is probably better, perhaps F17.]
;B[ch];W[qg];B[ph]C[I don't like this move on black's part.  A one point jump would be better, or even something like D17 or E17.  But that's the computer's problem, not yours.]
;W[pg];B[hc]C[I've let Black big a very large moyo at the top left.

Yes.  It would have been better to play at F17 or G17 instead of at Q13.]
;W[cc]C[So I invade.  Probably a little too soon.

I think this is actually late rather than too soon, although earlier you wouldn't have had to invade at the 3-3 point.  This will give black a nice outer wall, but at this point I think this is your best option.]

[Magnus is Viking's author I believe\]];B[fm];W[hp];B[dm];W[oh]
C[I'm trying to put pressure on these black stones, but looking back I'm not sure that the wall I'm building is that useful.]
;B[oi];W[nh];B[ni];W[mi]C[This is too early to cap the stones; better to extend to N12 and then cap at M11.  This sets up the problem you have later.]
;B[mj];W[li];B[lj];W[gm]C[I don't want the weak black group to connect to the left side.

This move is locally a good move, but L11 would be better first.  L11 threatens L10, which would also prevent or at least make very difficult a connection.  The general principle is that 3 stones in a line is much stronger than 2 stones in a line.]
;B[ki];W[mh]C[
 sloanj 16k*: yuck :/ (52)

Protects the cut though, and allows me to cut in return.

I don't see a lot better move at this point; the ugly shape was set up earlier.  I might have fought by playing N10 instead, but your move is not unreasonable.]
;B[gl];W[nj];B[nk];W[oj];B[ok]C[At this point, you can safely play at Q10, which cuts off the R11 stone and makes a nice strong right hand side for you.]
;W[pi];B[pl];W[mq]C[Time to press the other weak stone I thought.

I would have played at Q9 instead, making sure of your very large right hand side and keeping the stones in the middle very weak.]

;W[mk];B[bf];W[ce];B[de];W[ac]C[
 sloanj 16k*: I need more practise at making the right shape in corners... (76)

I wasn't sure at the time but it appears that this worked.

This was already alive without a17.];B[ml];W[lk];B[ll];W[kj]
;B[rh];W[rg]C[If you move at Q10, you should be able to kill the edge; but this was a safe move.]
;B[ca];W[ba];B[gq];W[hq];B[iq];W[gr]C[Just trying to keep it simple so I don't have to worry abour that thick group of mine to hard.]
;B[pm];W[qj]C[Eating these black stones a little bit at a time, is the plan.]
;B[pn]C[Thought long and hard here and concluded that R6 was necessary.  S9 and Q5 were the other moves I considered.   I figured at the time that this probably meant this black group would live, and given the large moyo black has at the time, I was probably losing.

R6 is a good move because it puts heavy pressure on the black group at Q6.  If you win the entire area you have surrounded, you win, even if Black gets its entire moyo.]
;W[qn];B[kl];W[jk];B[lp];W[no]C[Well ok.  It may live, but lets keep it small and build territory on the bottom.

The key Eye stealing move is O7.  If you want to keep it small and build territory, N4 is the more severe move, threatening to kill the M4 group if black defends the Q6 group, and forcing M6 instead of the N6 you allowed black tor respond with.]
;B[mn];W[nn]C[Aiming at O8];B[rj]C[Odd loking move.   I don't think black can connect these two groups together...]
;W[pj];B[mo]C[Black should have played at Q9, connecting to the right hand side.  Once black missed this move, you should have made it.]
;W[nm];B[lm]C[That surprised me.

This was  a poor move on Black's part.  It's playing like a computer, without understanding the significance of what it is doing.  It should have played at Q9, connecting to the right hand edge and eyes.]
;W[nl]C[But never look a gift horse in the mouth...  Now I'm thinking that the group around M6 may still live.]
;B[ip];W[in];B[ho];W[fq];B[jm];W[im]C[This move is unneeded.  It does not hurt you for K7 and J7 to connect.  Instead, fight to steal eyes or, I think best, reduce with the move J2.]
;B[ii]C[Eh?  Has it given up on this central group?   Or is this tesuji.

The computer is dumb.  This is giving up.];W[jn];B[kp]C[Black shoud have played at L6 and lived.]
;W[ko]C[Divide and conquer...];B[jo];W[kn];B[ir];W[io]C[Don't want an eye to appear at K4]
;B[jp];W[jr]C[An only want one to appear at K2  I think this makes the group dead.

Yes it does.];B[po];W[np];B[pp];W[qp];B[qq];W[oq];B[qr];W[pk]
C[Connects the R4 group or wins the race to capture.];B[da]

 sloanj 16k*: those random jumps always throw me... (130)];B[nb]
;W[ob];B[mb];W[me]C[You can be bolder here.  A move like L13 threatens a nice snake into the black moyo.  If you exchange snakes, you wine a lot more.]
;B[ke];W[lf];B[kf];W[nc];B[dr]C[Drat.  Black beat me to that.  Probably I needed to play this instead of M14]
;W[er]C[You don't need to play this yet.  M13 is a bigger move, and you may be able to exploit the weakness of G8 with the move J10.  But you have anyway one at this point.]
;B[lg];W[mg];B[oa];W[pa];B[na];W[qb];B[md];W[mc]C[senta cut threat which black ignores.   Was it correct to do so?]
;B[nd];W[lb];B[kb];W[ma];B[ne];W[kc]C[And I can do it again...]
;B[ld];W[jb];B[jd];W[of]C[Not sure whether this or J18 is better.

I think this was better.];B[jc];W[ka];B[ib];W[oe];B[rp];W[rk]
;B[ro];W[rn];B[os];W[ns]C[I accept black living in the corner to make sure all the central groups die.

You don't have to; you can have it all in this case.  You are way ahead in liberties.]
;B[pr];W[or]C[I think you can kill with T6 instead, but I haven't worked it out.]

Oops.  Gote move.  Should play K12 first?

B13 is big, I think.  Not sure why K12?];B[ha];W[ja];B[nf];W[mf]

I don't see how, at this point.];B[rr];W[ij]C[I was half looking at the cutting points at H11, G9 and F8.  Can anything be made of these?  IT doesn't look like there is room to live, though.

I don't see anything that works now.  Earlier this would have had more potential.]
