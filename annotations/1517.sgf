C[artChimera [?\]: hi

Game reviewed by Allan Wickberg, rank uncertain (15k maybe), 2apr2003]
;B[qd]C[learner [26k\]: hi];W[pp];B[cp];W[dd];B[jd]C[al> So far, this gives the impression of strong players, playing far from the edge of the board, although black has been a little more cautious than white, up until this move..]
;W[eq];B[cn];W[iq];B[cj]C[al> I cannot really judge if this move (B C10) is bigger than, for instance, attacking one of white's corners. The game still looks reasonable to me.]
;W[ch]C[al> Now, this gives me the feeling of being to close to the black stones. White's corner is not settled yet, so this will give black a possibility to  split and attack two white groups at the same time. At least black can mess up the corner for white by playng C14, C17 or thereabouts.]
;B[fd]C[al> Since black is walking along the fourth line, no real territory is secured on the top of the board. Playing a little closer to the border would be more secure.]
;W[ec]C[al> Had black played closer to the edge of the board, W E17 would not be forcing, and black could consider playing elsewhere. Now black has too much to lose not to answer.]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[ed];W[dc];B[gb];W[eb];B[gd]C[al> and white got a big corner]
;W[qj];B[qg];W[qm];B[nd]C[al> I feel that O16 should have been at O17 to start securing territory. There is still a chance for white to disturb black here.]
;W[io]C[al> It is hard to tell why white did this - M3 or N3 would make better sense, since it walls in territory.]
;B[oh]C[al> this move also seems weird to me. White is open for a probe at N3 or N4, which would at least destroy some potential territory at the bottom.]
;W[dk];B[cf]C[I thought W's move at C12 was too far from his corner so I tried to pincer with this move.]
;W[df];B[dg]C[But I think this was a mistake on my part & I lost the pincer.

al> Black D12 instead would threaten to split white's groups and avoid the wall white subsequently managed to build.]
;W[cg];B[bi]C[al> d11 would be more of a threat to white - D9 is vulnerable.]
;W[ci];B[ck]C[al> D10 instead, to split white's wall.];W[dj]
;B[dl];W[el];B[dm];W[em];B[en];W[fn];B[eo];W[fo]C[P];B[ep]C[Pushing out with hane had worked pretty well until here but if I tried it again W's stone at E3 would have caused problems. At least that's how I read it. So I extended at E4.

al> Black built good territory, but white got a wall towards the center. White's has not cashed in yet, and I can not judge if if would have been better to avoid the white wall, but I think I would rather have tried that.]
;W[fp];B[dq];W[fq];B[do]C[This may have been overplay on my part. But I wasn't sure, so I wanted to make sure.

al> This is overplay - better to cut the wall, like at f7 or e9.]
;W[fk]C[al> black is too late now.];B[jg]C[al> it is hard to gain point in the middle, and white is still open at the bottom, so it would be worth more for black to play around N4.]
;W[fi]C[al> this seems small for white. I think it would be better to sprinkle stones in between black's stones in the top right corner to try to split them.]
;B[oj];W[om];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml];W[mm];B[ll];W[km]C[I didn't understand this move. It seemed to invite  a spike at M7. But I decided to extend since going for the spike would leave me open around L8

al> White is avoiding being pressed towards the bottom of the board by black. Even if black plays M7, white would still head almost straight to the left.]

C[al> From my last comment up until now, the moves have been extremely civil. Now, at last, white secures the lower right corner. although I would think that there is still room for a clever player to invade.

al> Black is still open in the upper right corner and along the top.]
;B[ri];W[rj];B[pk]C[W was open between R10 and R7. Not sure if my attack was strong enough. I thought if I went deeper, I would be in trouble.

al> It is too late to gain many points by attacking from the front. Black would be better off by securing the upper corner.]
;W[qk];B[pl];W[pm];B[ql];W[rl];B[sj];W[sk];B[si];W[pj];B[pi]
;W[ol];B[ok];W[rm];B[qi];W[sl];B[rk]C[W's move at T8 seemed unecessary & obviously left S9 open for the capture.]
;W[lm];B[nk];W[dr];B[cr];W[er];B[bg];W[bf];B[af]C[I think I could have handled this attack better. It obviously did nothing for me.]
;W[ce];B[ag];W[ae];B[bh];W[bj]C[T];B[bk];W[cl];B[cm];W[bd];B[ds]
;W[es];B[cs];W[ee];B[fa];W[ea];B[ga];W[mq]C[I probably should have invaded this space before W played here. But I'm not sure how big a space needs to be for me to make a base.

al> I am not sure I myself would have managed a successful invasion, but I would not dare leave open for one, like white did (and like black is doing at the top...).]

;B[ic];W[ja];B[jc];W[hb];B[gc];W[qc]C[This invasion I failed to block. I'm not sure what I could have done. I've played through this section of the game through many different ways & W always ends up with 2 eyes. Any suggestions?]

;B[oe];W[rc];B[sd];W[sb]C[al> S19 i the critical pint for both players now.]
;B[qa]C[al> so here is where black lost the corner.];W[ra];B[se]
;W[sc];B[oc];W[pa];B[oa];W[qa]C[artChimera [?\]: Nicely done, I screwed that up.]
