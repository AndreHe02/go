C[Hi,

I played here as white. I played very carelessly, because I've beaten black many times before, but he had improved some stones after last time. I managed to win, probably because of the yose and that my opponent didn't use the weaknesses i left.

Do not hesitate to tell your ideas even if you couldn't fully explain them, sometimes moves have to be made by feeling.

I've included questions only by me, but my opponent wished for comments of his playing too.

Thank you,

(;B[cn]LB[dj:A]C[Black should have played A to attack white.  He gave up top side territory in exchange of power.  He should use this power to attack white, seeking compensation.  Before he plays A, he needs to make some preparation.  Please see variation.]
;W[dk]C[L: First big question mark of this game. I have k3 so this  is reasonable, but the shape is really awkward now that black has stones at C15 and C6. No territory, at least.

Dont' worry about territory on the left side.  It's small.  Black gave up top side territory, but he didn't get anything in return.]

(;B[en]C[It's better to invade the 3-3 point.  Please see variation.]
;W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[bk]TR[jq]C[Now white's marked stone location is perfect.  It's important to play moves to make your opponent's stones inefficient.]

(;W[gn]LB[qf:A]TR[fp][jq]C[L: I thought this could  hurt my stones at the side but couldn't find a better move.

This is bad because it creates an over-concentrated shape.  See how the three marked stones are so close to one another.  Ideally, you would like the k3 stone to be around m4.

Don't worry about the two white stones.  You could play the variation to settle if needed.

I like A at this time.];B[jd];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe]
C[L: What about r17 instead of this? Black gets a big territory.

This move is fine.  It's too early to say that all top side territory is black.  Besides, playing R17 allows black to build thickness.]
;B[qd];W[qh]LB[od:D][rd:E][oe:C][pe:B][qi:A]C[A is better.  I assume you are aiming to push at B and cut at D.  A still allows you to do the same job.  Black's extension at E is no longer sente.]
;B[nd]LB[lc:A]C[A is still invadeable.];W[jf]LB[jb:A][qm:C]
[qp:D][nq:B]C[L: Maybe better left unplayed. What would have been the biggest point?

This only helps black to secure top side territory.  White can always slide to A, so the top side is not urgent.  I like B, with the intention that another move by white at C makes the invasion at D possible.]
;B[kf];W[jb];B[kc];W[mq];B[kb]C[This is small for black.];W[cd]
;B[de];W[gf]C[Feels like an overplay by white.  White is thin here.]

(;B[ff]LB[ge:A]C[Black can push at A.  Please see variation.]
;W[fg];B[gg];W[gh];B[hg]C[L: The following sequence was maybe the biggest mistake of the game.]

I scan through the rest of the game.  They are all yose moves and I don't have any comments beyond this move.]
