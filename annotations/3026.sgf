C[I am aware that this was probably a rather lame game, and according to the guidelines maybe too fast for me to request a review. However I've spent some time going through it, and then going through it again adding comments, so I thought I could at least try to post it...

If you are willing to take a look at the game and write something, I really appreciate it. There are several questions, but any kind of help would be great. After all, since I'm weak, what I want to know might not be what I should want to know, anyway, and vice versa...

Thanks!!];B[pc];W[do];B[cd];W[qp]C[It kinda feels like B could do alot worse things to W than K17... Like, use the weakness of the BL corner to put something between white's stones and... I don't know. Hm. Maybe I don't really have to worry about fuseki yet, though.

W has two un-enclosed corners here so a agressive move would be to approach at D3 or P3.

B could also enclose his corner at E16 or E17.

K17 is a very peaceful move that would usually not be reccomended here.]
;B[jc];W[dq]C[Is this too small for W? I thought it gave W nice potential, but maybe trying to connect left and right would be better? Playing somewhere around K4 now feels like bad shape though, as D5 is high and all...

This is a good enclosure move that will make it hard for B to play on the lower side, this moves looks like a good response to K17.

A move around K4 is wrong right now since you should usually enclose un balanced corners before extending.]
;B[nq]C[What does B want here, and what should W be prepared to give him?

Here B is looking to stop W from constructing a large scale moyo.

W should be prepared to give him either a little of the corner or the side.]
;W[oo]C[Is this reply strange? If B pincered, would it be difficult for W to separate and attack the two stones? I thought this gave W both the possibility of a big corner and a long extension towards the MR, but there's probably some weaknesses somewhere...

Here this move is wrong.  It would be difficult for W to attack if B pincered because W all the B stones are relatively out in the open.

The correct move to play here is L3 which is a severe pincer against the B stone and an ideal extention from the W enclosure in the lower left.]
;B[kq];W[qk]C[This move looks like a narrow extension after P5.  W could probably go as far as R12 or even approach B's upper side at Q15.]
;B[qg]C[I haven't practiced estimating the score alot yet, but looking at the board now I noticed how the black stones, being spread, covered alot more, uh, space than white's. Does this simply indicate that W is behind, or is there more to it? I think I can tell that W's territory is probably safer than B's, but maybe not by very much... What should I think, looking at this position?

At this point in the game there is really no point in estimating the score.  There are still too many invasions and reductions that could happen.  It is true that B is more spread out than W which gives B more potential territory, but there are no major problems for W yet.  W should take one of the last big opening spots along the side at C11 in this position.]
;W[cj]C[Is this an appropriate move? I reasoned that it would be too big for B to put the first stone on the left side, but what are the other (better?) possibilities?

This is about the best move for W right now.  W cannot allow B to get this point becuase it would give him big possibilities on the upper side. the only other possibilitie for W is an extension to H3.]
;B[bi]C[Wouldn't C13 or D13 be better for B?

Yes, this move is completely wrong in the opening.  Moves on the second line are too small to be played in the opening.  In this case B should have played H3 to expand his bottom territory and reduce W potential.  W should punish this move by taking H3 himself.]
;W[bj]C[Since the black stone is so low, maybe C11 would be better?
I thought the territory I closed with this stone looked pretty nice though, while B's gain at the top didn't. Is this something Kageyama would scold me for saying? :P

W's territory at the bottom isn't completely safe yet.  This is another 2nd line play in the opening which is fundamentally wrong.  A better W move would have been at E17 or H3. C11 is also possible to try and gain influence by trying to force B to save his stone for small profit, but if C11 B should ignore and take H3.]
;B[ci];W[di];B[ch]C[This move is the empty triangle.  This is bad shape and to be avoided if possible.  Here a better move is C13.]
;W[dh];B[dg];W[cg];B[bg];W[cf];B[bf];W[eg];B[df];W[ef];B[de]
C[Very unstable shape for W, should this have been avoided? How?
Now that I've made it, how urgent is protecting the cutting-points, and what would be the best way of doing so?

B has gotten nice shape and solid territory on the left with this exchange and W doesn't have good thickness because his wall is not facing any stones.  This bad shape was caused by the atari at E13 which created another cutting point and forced B into good shape.  Instead W could have turned at D14 instead of ataring and started a fight.  

It is urgent for W to protect these cutting points now, because either could cause him big trouble.  The best way to protect would be at E10 which protects both at once.]
;W[hq]C[I thought this would increase the value of newly gained influence, but maybe the timing isn't very good?

This is a good move here, but the influence won't help till the cutting points are fixed.  B should cut now before W fixes his wall and enlarges his moyo at H5.]
;B[ir];W[hr]C[I shouldn't have tenuki:ed, should I?

Yes, E10 or H5 here is correct.];B[jj]C[I'm not sure if this move gained B alot... I would probably have played E16 or something. Still, it does threathen W's stones at the left side in some way, I suppose.

This move gains B almost nothing, the only thing it does here is to prepare more for a cut at either E12 or D10. 

Instead of K10 B should've just gone ahead and cut.];W[id]C[Would an invasion have been more appropriate?

This is a good move, but W has some big problems.

If W spends a move to fix his wall on the left then B can enlarge his moyo at K15.

W here chose to reduce the B moyo.  Here this is better than an invasion because W's wall is not all that strong and B has alot of stones here.

B should ignore this reducing move and cut at either D10 or E12.]

(;W[hc]C[I guess the variation would be better?

The variation is better, after it W doesn't really have to worry about the cuts anymore, because all his groups should be able to live.]
;B[gb];W[hb];B[lc]C[Don't mind the variation here, just checking something.]

(;W[pr]C[Maybe this isn't as big as I thought, especially as W looks really, really vurnerable at the upper left / top, with all those cutting points.

This move is big, but you should take urgent moves such as protecting cutting points before big moves.]
;B[op];W[pp]
(;B[ed]C[Is this move really that urgent? Sure, the shape looked kind of scary for B, but I haven't found any moves that would kill black / live in the corner / anything.

No, I already checked earlier, this move is uneccesary, but it does set up for the cut at E12.]
;W[gg]C[An attempt to defend I guess, but probably not the right one. Would've chosen E10 now I think, for defending.

Hm, O5, P9 and such are also very big, aren't they?

This is a good move to defend, but W has a lot of cutting points and can't defend them all with one move.

This is better than O5 or P9 even though they are both big.]
;B[eh];W[fi]C[What *was* I thinking? This looks like a great chance to make influence towards the bottom, the upper part of the group could probably live on its own...]
;B[dj];W[dk]C[This move is bad W should connect at E11 instead.]
;B[ei];W[ek];B[ej];W[fj];B[fh];W[gh]C[Ugly shape again... :/]
;B[fg];W[ff]C[And heavy.];B[he]C[And...];W[gf];B[ie];W[hj]C[I guess I didn't want the same thing to happen again.
Maybe I could have done something with the H16 group instead?

H16 group seems like a lost cause right now, the move at H10 is fine for now though seems better at G9 since it also protect cutting point at F9.

If you did want to do something with H16 group I would reccomend the hane at K15 and then running for life.]
;B[jd];W[je];B[ha];W[if];B[ib];W[pi]TR[je][if]C[I thought I was threathening to connect to the marked stones, but I guess it wasn't such a good idea...? O5 is probably bigger.

Too far way to threaten to connect. O5 is bigger.];B[qi];W[pg]
C[Is this going to far?

This seems like an overplay Q12 or Q10 look better.];B[pf];W[qh]
;B[rh];W[ph];B[ri];W[qj];B[no];W[on];B[rj];W[rk]
(;B[jf]C[Why cut now? Something very large-scale?

This move is actually pretty big  see the variation for what could happen if W connects.]
;W[kf]C[And surely there are better moves than this one, even if I managed to create some kind of territory in the end.]
;B[jg];W[kg];B[jh];W[kh];B[ig];W[ji]
(;B[ii]C[B didn't really have to reply here, did he? He's got two atari and all. P14 looks bigger... Or maybe going to the center with the group at the bottom.

B could play at either of those two places, but this is a good move too, because if B connects at J10 or captures K11 then he saves his K10 stone.]
;W[ki];B[hi];W[gi];B[hf]C[No need for this, is there?

No need];W[qf];B[rg];W[rf]
(;B[sf]C[To answer your next question T14 here is a huge mistake for B the correct move is at R15.

See variation];W[pe];B[of];W[qd]C[It felt like B should've been able to stop this, but I'm not sure where / how. Or was it possible for W to kill the B group already?]

Maybe a little of both, but both will improve in time.  W is safe here if he ataris at R6 and then connects I think.]

Besides a few mistakes in the opening and middle game both sides played fairly well.

My advice to you would be to study a bit more fuseki and just keep practicing reading using life and death problems.  

A few fuseki tips to keep the play in the opening solid would be to:
1. Avoid 2nd line plays
2. Make moves that have two functions (Such as a pincer and an extension in one)
3. Enclose or approach un-balanced corners first

If you ever want a teaching game or something i'm on KGS as Mothman.  See ya around.]
