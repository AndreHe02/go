C[Hi. Thanks for reviewing our game. If you could please comment on both white and black, we'd appreciate it. I've promised to send this to my opponent. I will keep my questions to a minimum since you'll be commenting on both sides.

n - Glad to be able to help.  I am Ness (Hubris) 2k.];B[dp]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[fd];B[df]MA[cc][ch][ci][hc]C[This move seems a little small to me...the joseki options are labeled .

Take a look at the free joseki tutor at 
http://www.turbogo.com/text/jostutor.html.];W[ck]MA[dh]C[Rex: was this too early?

n - I would have been tempted to play X to exploit the compactness of the B shape.]
;B[ci];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[fp]C[Now W and B are about even on the L side, too bad for W.]
;W[ek]MA[pj][jc][qn]C[n - I think something like X would be bigger now.]
;B[kc]C[n - I don't like this one, it leaves W too many options.]
;W[ic];B[nc];W[oc];B[nd];W[qf]C[B now "stands on one and extends two" -- too small.]
;B[qk];W[np];B[pn]C[Rex: Should B have  pincered me here around L4?

n - Seems reasonable.];W[jq];B[hq];W[jo];B[pq]MA[nq]C[n - Why not X?]
;W[nq]C[n - Slow.];B[qh];W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[dh];W[bi];B[di]
;W[bj];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[cq];B[bo]MA[cp]C[n - This is an overplay.  B must play X instead.]
;W[bn]MA[er]C[I don't believe B can kill if you play X -- in fact, if you take a look, I believe you'll find X can easily find himself losing stones if he is not careful.]
;B[dq];W[pl];B[ql];W[pm];B[on]C[n - Ouch!  This kind of move is virtually never right.]
;W[qm];B[qn];W[rm];B[rn];W[sn];B[so];W[sm];B[rp];W[pk];B[pj]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[je]MA[ok]C[n - There is a weakness at X you need to cover first.]
;B[od];W[pc];B[mo];W[lp];B[mp];W[mq];B[nl]C[n - B is kind enough to make you fix it!  "Never peep when you can cut" says the proverb.]
;W[nk];B[ol];W[ok];B[mk];W[mj];B[ml]MA[lk]C[n - Why not X?]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[fg]MA[rh][qh][pi][pj][qk][ql]LB[rj:a]C[Rex: Was this extension too far?

n - I don't know about that, but I'm looking hard at the marked group and seeing very few eyes...how about a placement at A and then a splitting attack?  B's group on the top isn't completely safe either.  The least you'll get out of it is influence towards the center in sente -- then play your move :)]
;B[db];W[eb]C[Rex: I thought I had a good lead up to this point. From here, he seems to get the better of me. Is this correct?

n - Well, I do agree you're ahead by ten points or so, but I think the main question of the game is what happens to B's group on the right -- this should give you a good lead.]
;B[ff];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf];B[fh];W[fe];B[ef]C[n - The last two moves seem unnecessary to me.]
;W[mb];B[qg]C[n - W's move was sente, variation.]
