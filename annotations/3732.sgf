AB[pp][dp][jj][pd][dd]C[I felt like this game was going really well for me, until I started running out of time at around move 76.

My biggest problem is that my play got too fast and I wasn't reading into the play.

Thanks in advance for the review.

--

* OK, I just downloaded the game and looked at the end result, and boy...

You really need to work on your in-game insecurity. :)

You resigned when you had won... You were at least 10+ points ahead,
and white would still have to resort to some hard tesujis or trick
play to win. Even with extremely defensive endgame, you would have
won.

Losing just one smallish group is actually quite good for a five stone
handicap game. ;) Usually white will have to do better to make up for
the 50++ point lead black starts with.

Counting is probably too advanced for your level (for mine too), but
take a look:

You have five patches of roughly equal territories.. White has one
larger (the side), one to match either of yours (top), and then a very
tiny one at the bottom, plus various trifle points.

Even if the side gives enough points to match two of yours, then he is
about four "patches" of 12-18 points versus your five.

Almost every go player feels that he is losing if he isn't at least 20
points ahead -- this is normal, but you have to try and suppress it
and don't let it control you.];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[df]

(;B[ce];W[cf];B[fc];W[dj];B[cm]LB[lc:a]C[I was trying to play a few different types of openings. This one ended up being a mistake: As soon as my opponent pushed, the corner fell apart.

Because of the handicap, I started well ahead, and should've gone for more secure corners, but I was interested to see how different openings work. I thought that this would secure reasonably well, as wel as put pressure on W's group on the left side.

---

* The most important thing in handicap game is:
1. stay connected,
2. stay connected,
3. disconnect your opponent.

"stay connected" is mentioned twice because:

1. if you don't, chances are large groups are going to get captured since we can assume your opponent is better strategically. I.e. he can strengthen himself by attacking one group, only to go back and kill the other group when you've defended.

2. if you do, you'll live by the sheer magnitude of your influence, and you don't have to worry about small corners. This is consistent with having 2+ star point stones, which stress for influence, NOT territory.

Now, concerning this move, it doesn't post a threat to your opponent, nor does it make your corner very secure. Playing A is a lot better.]

You count visually in pairs like in the corner. 7, so that's about 14 points there. Prisoner squares count as a double by itself, as on the bottom... 10, so that's about 20 points. Subtract a little around the edges for endgame moves if you want the minimum etc.
