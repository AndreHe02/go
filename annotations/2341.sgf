C[
Artifact: Some big mistakes are two  wrong invasions made too late. You made few reduction and take too risk when it was too late. Some small move in the beginning of the middle game made a difficult game for you.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qj]C[r10 is seen in pro games but is more difficult than the sanrensei classical fuseki in q10. I  don't know  teorically nothing about this....sorry :)]
;W[nq];B[oq]C[This move is a little wrong because white secure a strong position. Usually Black play a stone like p3 when there is a black stone around k4]
;W[np];B[pn];W[jq];B[cj]C[good ? bad ? K17 better ?


I think that this is good, k17 is also a good choice but usually instead of move like k17 and r10 is better to develop influence with k16 or q10. 
When you play in a large scale, influence is more important then territory.]
;W[jd];B[cg]C[c13 and c7 are miai. I think that m17 was the biggest point for you.]
;W[nc]C[Your opponent find the big point];B[oc]C[In this way your opponent reinforce itself whit a beautiful shape. Better to play q14]
;W[nd];B[pf]TR[qc][oj][qq]C[your position have some weak points: A big reduction and two invasions]
;W[cn];B[be]C[too slow ? Better to invade

This is very slow...if you want play here you have to play b16

I think that there is a chance for an invasion in f3 before  your opponent reinforce itself]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ff]
(;B[bl]C[again too slow ?


Yes! this is useless. This is a endgame move];W[gq];B[cc]C[too small

I think that is time to risk something more with an invasion or tring to secure more territory with moves like p10]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[db];B[eg]C[too small. Now h16 is unplayable but a move like h15 is a good reduction]
;W[ef]
(;B[gg]C[also not the right move..


You've right];W[fg];B[fh];W[gh];B[gi];W[hh];B[hi];W[ih];B[fj]
;W[nf];B[oh];W[nn];B[ol]C[n13 is bigger];W[nl];B[lb]C[attemtp to invade

It's too late....You have to make something before];W[nb];B[ld]
;W[lg];B[kf];W[jg];B[jc];W[ic];B[ib]C[mistake ... K18 would have been the move

I think that here Black  is unconditionally death. For exercise try to find two eyes...there is no enogh room]
;W[jb];B[ja];W[kc];B[kb];W[jc];B[eb]C[completely wrong....in Italy this is called the "Jeko move"...you seem like a reptile that is creeping over a wall :)]
;W[ea];B[fa];W[da];B[kg];W[kh];B[mg]C[trying to get something out of it.

It's too late. Invade and Die like this  in your opponent moyo, is a big loss of stones, territory and influence]

In the middle game I lost the fight for the center as you can see here because my reduction play was too deep. All the attempts to diminish white's moyo's failed. Please advice.

Many thanks,
Lothar.

The big mistakes are due to some wrong invasions made too late. You made few reduction and take too risk when it was too late. Some small move in the beginning of the middle game made a difficult game for you.]
