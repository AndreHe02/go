C[I am black. I won by about 10 points however, I think that I was leading more than that after the fuseki. I builded a very huge black moyo and a big black thickness, but I was unable to use them correctly. I'd like to understand why.

First, thank you for letting me review your game. There wasn't ttoo much wrong with it, so the comments are a bit sparse, I thought you (mostly) played well.]

LB[gc:A][jj:C][jq:B][nq:D]C[I'm quite happy with my black formation. Now, I hesitate between A, B, C and D.

Your instincts are good. When in a position like this, there are a few things to remember:
1) Urgent moves come first
2) Then come big moves

The same applies to your opponent. Can you force him to make moves that strengthen you? Can you prevent him from making big moves? Given this, I would say somwhere in the vicinity of B is probably the best, followed by D, C then A. In fact, I would play L3. move B lets your opponent jump in at D which could cause trouble later. (you don't want to approach his position too closely).]

(;B[gc];W[ee];B[ge];W[nq]LB[pn:A][kp:D][lp:C][lq:B]C[Here again, I really don't know what is the best reply. I do not choose A because then, white would play D.
I played B.

As you seem to have realized, a move around L3 would have prevented this situation. Playing B allows W to pincer you at K3]

(;W[oq];B[np];W[mq];B[mp];W[kq]C[W is far too focused on making small territory. B's moyo building efforts are aided by this.]
;B[kp];W[lr];B[lp];W[jq]LB[fg:D][oj:B][io:C][cq:A]C[Now, I have a very big black moyo and a big thickness. The game is well engaged, but I was not able to keep that lead...
I played A, but the others were very appealing to me

you have to remember that moyo is not territory, W can still invade. B does the most to convert the moyo into territory. When you are ahead, you should play defensively, when behind, attack. B is ahead, so he should take it easy.]

;B[bq];W[cn];B[dr]C[I end the sequence gote...

Yes, and you still have a wide open moyo that can be attacked...]
;W[gn]C[I think that white is a bit overprotective here.

You are correct, W is behind in the moment, and needs to play much more aggressively.]
;B[ed]LB[oj:A][fl:B][il:D][io:C]C[I think that it's a big mistake. A was very big, isn't it ?

A is huge. Another possility is something like B C or D, strengthening your moyo while starting to threaten a rescue of the E4 stone or invading the opponent's territory. I still like A the most though.]
;W[dd];B[ec];W[pj]C[White attacks.

No matter what you do now, W will probably escape. So what you need to think about is where you want to make territory, and what you want to sacrifice.]
;B[pi]LB[qi:A][qk:B]C[But maybe A or B were better ?

The crosscut is dangerous for B, see the variation for why. Extending to A or B gives you very little territory. Your idea to attack the stone is not bad, the question is how best to do it.]

Absolutely. Though you can still try kill the O9 grop, or move into W's area with something like G8.]

[il][kl][jm][km][jn][aq][ar][br][cr][as][cs][ds]C[So, to summarize, you played well, but you tried turning your moyo into territory once invaded, which is a mistake. Instead, you should use a moyo to build territory elsewhere, for example, by pushing your opponent's weak groups into your area of strength. Had your opponent responded to your monkey jump correctly, the game would have possibly been his. Try playing different style games (and don't worry about winning or losing). What I mean by this is see what effect on the later game playing on the 3rd line has, as well as if you open on the 4th line. That should help teach you how to use a moyo and secure territory.

Good luck in your go!])
