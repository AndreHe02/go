C[briannowe[30k\](BLACK) vs Fenrir[23k\](WHITE)

Reviewer: Sub[8k\]


brian: um yes this a game with one of my friends he was observing my play and kinda predict the moves that i made how can i change that ? plus he is talking about joseki i do not no what joseki is please explain it the people i ask got a difficult way of saying it please make it simple it seems so big i always play on instinct is that good and my openings i wonder if there is anygood i'll play it out well am also looking for a teacher or tutor and i would like so help on that 2

sub: (about joseki, definition from http://senseis.xmp.net) A joseki is a sequence of moves which results in what is normally considered a fair outcome for both players.
Looks understandable :)]
(;B[dd]
(;W[qd]C[like i dont get white move why are people doing that]
;B[ep]C[so i copied like an idiot actually am good at mirror go but yeah i just didnt knoww what i was doing]
;W[pq]LB[dd:A][qd:B][pq:C]C[brian: that move either dont understand why q4 aint better

sub: Move "A" is for influence.  It doesn't secure the corner. Look at the variation -


moves "B" and "C" are for territory.]
(;B[ej]C[brian: i do not like what i have don there i feel vary open

sub: yes, very open. E10 goes for influence. Because the invasion underneath is possible]

(;W[pj]
(;B[fc]C[sub: This move is slow because in fuseki(opening stage) stones want to expand as fast as possible. You had played influence-oriented opening so it's good to continue with your strategy.

Look at the variation -]
(;W[jd]C[sub: wrong direction.

(;B[hd]C[sub: H16 looks too slow. Something like Q5 would be better.

Look at the variation -];W[jp]C[sub: White is expanding faster. Which is better for him.]
;B[fq]LB[od:A][po:B]C[sub: Too slow. If you want to enclose the corner at least use C4. But I would attack at "A" or "B".]
;W[oc]TR[jd][qd][pj]C[sub: Good. White is protecting and makes his moyo harder to invade.]

[en][eo][eq][fr][fs]SQ[ja][jb][jc][je][jf][jg][jh][ji][jj][jk]
[jl][jm][jn][jo][jq][jr][js]C[sub: Again, slow. Look at the borders.]
;W[cg]LB[ci:A]C[sub: And white chooses good point to invade.

ok. When you attack you try to remove base(space for making two eyes), or block stones' running direction. In this situation it's better to remove base first. So "A" would be better.

[dk][cl][cm][em][ep][fq]SQ[jd][jp]C[sub: Now you've got a fine thickness. But now it's hard to use it good because of W's stones.]
;B[am];W[ab];B[ba];W[cq]C[sub: attack W's stone. It will be very hard to live there now. To be able to kill it you need to solve Life and Death problems.]

[is]C[Sub: so you'd got thickness. But no territory. Question is how to use it to get territory? To fence area near thickness? Nope. You use thickness to attack.
