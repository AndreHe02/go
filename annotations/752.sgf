C[grommit 23kyu (w) vs.  mccc00 21 kyu (b)
Nov 11, 2001
===================================

Your comments are perceptive. You basicly played too conservatively at critical points in this game. The real damage occurred in the lower left.   Like everything else in Go, it is a question of balance and timing. I tend to play too aggressively and sometimes find my over extended positions collapsing on all sides. It seems that you can start aggressive and then shore up or sacrifice before it is too late. Or, you can start conservative and use your strong positions to boldly attack your opponent before he is as secure. What you can't do is play the same style consistantly.

Good luck in finding that perfect balance.

One more thought. I know that I find reviews helpful and I hope you find this one helpful. I have been experimenting lately with making my own written comments on all of my games. Hindsight is a couple of stones stronger so I get an instant "poor man's" review. I feel that this way I build up better insight into my own play and gradually adopt better ideas. The time I take to make written comments reinforces my better ideas more. I have commented on some additional points, but many of your own post-game comments are very accurate.]

[de:C][cf:D]C[Perhaps should have been at J16, J17 or K17 to reduce impact of black invasion?

It is a matter of taste. You are right that A in particular would be difficult to invade.
Another possibility is to start with B, which b is likely to reply at C or D and then play your game move. Your corner will now be more secure and you can look after the stone at K16 when b separates your group.]
;B[hd]C[Black invades, it seems like I should have been able to get a better result.

I don't think that what you get is that bad.]

[ci:D]TR[dh]MA[ce]C[Too cautious?

Would a play in one of the other corners have been better?

Yes, to both. If you are going to play here A is probably better. b may respond at B which leaves him wanting the triangle stone at C or D. If b responds, you get sente, if not, his square stone is weakened.]

;B[bm];W[gp];B[em];W[gn]TR[cm]LB[kp:A]C[I don't like this move at all. Ask yourself what it accomplishes. The corner is secure and does not need a defensive move.
You are not really using the triangle stone somehow. (Not that I think you could).
You would get more territory and more influence by extending to say A.
Perhaps best to make a corner approach against 1 of the 2 remaining corners.]
;B[eq]C[Again, another black invasion that causes damage.]
(;W[cr]LB[fq:A][gq:B]C[Probably too cautious again.  I think it would have been better to contain black to the corner and fight.

Yes! I agree. I was thinking A or B, but your variation appears to work too. If your opponent makes a too aggressive invasion you must punish him or suffer yourself.]
;B[gr]
(;W[fq]LB[ep:A]C[You know what b is going to do in response to this move and you know he is going to be able to escape, so maybe you should just connect at A and save this forcing move for a time when it will yield something. See variations for example.]
;B[fr];W[gq]C[This move makes the so-called empty triangle which is bad shape, but may be necessary at times.]
;B[hr]
(;W[hq]C[J3 would have been better. (Or perhaps even K3?)

Yes! This move adds to the bad shape of the empty triangle.]
;B[iq]TR[fq][gq][gp][hq]C[Now you can see one of the consequences of bad shape. Notice how many moves you have invested in the triangled stones and how few liberites you have.]
;W[ip];B[jq];W[dq]LB[ep:A]C[You should have just connected at A. Then you can either get sente or a stone. This way you end in gote.]
;B[er];W[ep];B[jp];W[io];B[gl];W[qj]C[Black now has a very strong position and good territory.    The right side seems to be a big play right now, but would others be worthwhile considering?

N5, O4, Q6, R6?

R14?

E14, F14?

R6 and R14 are worth considering but your move is OK given the circumstances.]
;B[ql]C[b is mapping out big territory here. Maybe you should invade while you still can.
See variation as an example.]
(;W[qf];B[nq];W[rd];B[qc];W[ph];B[md]TR[qj]C[This is a result that looks more and more against you. You guessed that you were behind when you played the triangle stone. The last sequence gave b 2 good positions while you got only one although it is the result of more or less standard play. You need to create complications and confusion to try to catch up. One way to do this is to make multiple invasions.]

(;W[pn]LB[qn:A]C[It is an interesting question as to whether or not A would be better here.
See variation.];B[qn];W[pm];B[qm];W[mn];B[qq];W[oo]LB[mf:A]
[ne:B][pl:C][kb:D]C[Too small.

K5, L5  would have been better.

I agree about too small, but K5 or L5 would not be much better.
There is not much territory being contested in this direction and b's position here is secure so he does not need to respond to threats. b's position at the top is less secure so he may respond to A or B in a way that lets you map out territory with C. Don't forget that you have D to rob him of territory at the top.]
;B[jo];W[jn];B[kn]
(;W[km]C[Cross cut would have been better.

It might create confusion but it is a double edged sword. See more variations.]
;B[ln];W[lm]C[Here I have a loose framework in the center right, but black is successful at tearing a large whole in it.

Where should I play to preserve this potential territory?

Part of the problem is that you playing weak stones right up against b's strength. You have to expect some losses.]
;B[mm];W[nm]C[Perhaps should play atari from above?

Yes! That is the way. Sacrifice to keep your influence.];B[ml]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[nk];B[lj];W[jl]C[Should have been at J7 to prevent the cut.

Yes.];B[in]C[Good cut for black.];W[jm];B[hm];W[hn];B[im];W[jj]
LB[ef:A][mf:B]TR[jd]MA[lj][mk][ml][mm]C[It seems like black has such a strong position that the end is a foregone conclusion.

I decided to try to save this group, but perhaps it would have been better to abandon those stones and see what other gains I could make.  (O11? P14? N4? D14?)

At first pass, I thought you should abandon these stones and made the following comments, but now I think you needed to play to game move to maintain whatever potential they might have.. The b square stones are not strong either.

Maybe E14 threatening to invade the left and as a long shot to rescue the stones. Neither will probably work, but you will be fighting.
Maybe N14, more aggressive than P14, looks at weakening b's square stones so you can capture and escape, chance to map out more territory or maybe rescue triangle. All this is long shot, but worth a try.]
;B[mo];W[nn];B[mp];W[kh];B[nj];W[oj];B[ni]C[Try to capture b's group. It is your only hope for the game I think.
See variation.]
(;W[oi];B[nh];W[mg];B[ng];W[mf];B[nf];W[hh];B[ne];W[ke]C[Saving all these stones works better than you had a right to expect, but on the other hand you are not making any territory.]

C[This is a move like an empty triangle. In this case I don't think it accomplishes anything. Better to play at A to save your stones or more urgently at B to get eyespace.]
