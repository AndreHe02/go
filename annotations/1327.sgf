C[
In this game I am white.  My biggest concerns are:
(1)  How should I have handled Black's successful invasion
      on the right?
(2)  Was there a way to invade Black's territory and take
      advantage of weak-points in his wall of stones?

Thank you for taking this request!!  :-)         -Dennis];B[dd]
;W[jj];B[dj];W[id];B[fc];W[ig]LB[dg:A]C[This stone and blacks next stone to an extent set the  mood of the game as defensive, since you both have  made an outline of your area.  The white right top is  weak and is vulnerable to an a stone around the 3 3.  Blacks stone at A gives him a good defense.]
;B[dg];W[gk]LB[fk:A][ek:B][dk:H][ck:xx][cc:E][hk:C][ik:D]C[This is a good defensive move, You could even move  to A but watch out for a black stone at C. Ignore the  other letters :)]
;B[fj];W[gj];B[fk];W[fl]C[This stone was not needed, and only made a wall,  which you might not want later on. Sometimes its  better not to do small finishing moves like that. A stone  above the 2 blacks would have been better.]

LB[kj:A][ih:B][ii:C]C[A stone at A would have been a lot better.  It cuts black  off from the bottom, reducing his possible space to  create eyes. I wouldn't worry about a black invasion at  B, a white response at C would put the invading stone  in the same situation as the other black stone. The  situation being, very unlikley for them to find eye  space.]

;B[mj];W[km];B[ml];W[mi];B[mh]LB[lh:A]C[A white stone here would save the day. Even if black  puts that stone in atari, you can get away.]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[kh];B[ii];W[ih]LB[hi:A]C[A white stone at A would have sufficed and would have  ended blakc expansion, it is not pivotal for your two  groups to be connected as long as they both have  eyespace. This could save you a few points.]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[hj];W[hk];B[mg];W[kf]LB[lf:A]C[A wouls have given you a point, any cut by black could  be stopped.]

C[This is another one of those places where it would be  better not to force black to connect his stones at D. An  invasion at A, B, or C is possible, try playing out each  possibility with your Go program.]

LB[ci:A][ch:B]C[This is not needed, this group is dead. A or B would  have been better.]

;B[bg]LB[cc:A][cd:B]C[A or B would have been a better invasion point.]

Shouldn't have done that, those stones were in seki, in  english that means that neither group could capture  the other, so no one gets the territory. This is better  then giving black 8 points.]
;B[fd];W[ak];B[mm];W[al]C[*Chevalier*: I think it is over...]
;C[*Chevalier*:  you remember the central group?
*Chevalier*:  I think if you do not attack it it would be a  seki ... more favorable for you...
*Chevalier*:  I think...

This was a good game. You could have captured the  invading black group if not for one wrong stone. Since  you played with a .5 komi, white isn't as free to play  defensivly since they don't have the large 5.5  advantage. You should play a few games more  aggresivly if you haven't already, and learn from them.]
