C[Thanks to the person that will look and coment my game.

This is a game played at IGS and i am posat playing with white.

I am rated as a 22kyu by IGS, although when i play in my Go club they say i am probably around 13 - 15kyu.

I only play Go for a couple of month.

So my knowledge about Go strategy is very limited.

would apreciate any and all coments on the following game.

would apreciate a special coment in the opening since its the harder part of the game for me to unbderstand.

Thanks

j: Hi, Hugo, I'll try to do my best, even not being a strong player in any sense.   I'll prepend my comments with "j:"]

LB[cl:a]C[I considered playing somewhere around 'a' but i thought it was bigger to challenge the conner.s

j: difficult to say, both moves are ok IMHO.];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]
;W[pm];B[nq];W[qi];B[qg];W[cm];B[cq]C[j: this is a very doubtful move, as earns some points at the expense of letting you build a big wall. I think it's too soon for a san-san invasion...]
;W[dq]LB[cp:a]C[Choosed to play at '20' instead of 'a' because i was thinking of building a moyo to the right

j: well, not bad, but strong walls should not be used to building moyos, but as strongholds to attack...

Anyway, I think this move is correct, playing at "a" would lead to overconcentration and render the wall more useless]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bn];W[jq]
LB[kq:a]C[could i have played at 'a'? i thought it probably was a bit too far.

j: I'd even say one point to the rigth of a; else, you're using thickness to make territory, not a good thing. You should use it to attack.

If you go to the point I said, after he invades, you can launch a *big* attack on the invasion, (from your rightmost stone) creating thickness (again) in the right side of the board and isolating his corner.

None of you will probably make a lot of points inside, but his stones will be surrounded by your very useful new wall.]
;B[lq]C[j: now you have too many stones there...];W[nc];B[jd]
;W[kc]LB[pb:a]C[j: I'd prefer stealing the corner first (to a) and, later, to this point. You'd get a solid base and your opponent less points.]
;B[ke];W[hc];B[jj]
(;W[jc]C[i thought all the territory on the upper side was worth the influence of black, since i can go and challenge that influence.

j: ok, but, then, why not... (see var from prev. move)

Anyway, it's very difficult to get a lot of points in the center, so you're ok]
;B[oc]C[j: what a pity...];W[nd];B[oe];W[ko];B[oi];W[pj];B[ne]

C[now that i look at it i think i should have keep crawling somewhere around 'a'.

j: yes, even my other "a" (sorry, my program won't write "b")]

;B[ki];W[mh];B[ng];W[mg];B[mf];W[ij];B[ii];W[bc]LB[rh:a]C['a' was mutch bigger ... :-(

j: sure? I think you played too conservative here; look at the vars (just playing around) after black's move.

I'm not commenting too much here as the game went (more or less) smooth; I'll add a few suggestions in the last move.

There are some comments anyway in a few moves];B[ri]
(;W[rj]C[j: this is the conservative move. The var gives you a far better result, but, yes, you can run into trouble.]
;B[rh];W[pi];B[ph];W[be]C[j: this move is gote, and worth only a few points... better wait]

;B[qb];W[kn];B[lm];W[lk]LB[kl:a]C[intended to cut at 'a'

j: why don't you do it? I'm not saying the cut is good, but irresolution is a vice, and if you have plans for the cut...]
;B[ee];W[ed]C[j: you don't need to answer, just 1 point, if you have better plans. Better search for a sente move.]
;B[is];W[hs];B[js];W[hr]C[j: no need; if he h2, you just g1]
;B[lo];W[no];B[hj]LB[hi:a]C[j: you should have played at a before this black's move]
;W[hk];B[gj];W[al]C[j: gote move...];B[ak]C[j: err, well, this time it was sente, thanks, black!]

C[
Since thought i was either even or a couple of points behing i went after some land.
here i make 5 points of territory around 'a'.];B[si];W[qh];B[rg]
;W[oh];B[pg];W[nh];B[og]C[j: very good sequence!];W[ql]C[Not really sure if this move was needed...

j: not yet, but It'll be if in a future black manages to play T7]
;B[nm];W[om];B[gl];W[gk];B[fj];W[fk]C[j: again, no need (at least, not urgency)]
;B[od];W[kq];B[lr];W[lp];B[lc];W[ld];B[md];W[mc];B[lb];W[me]
LB[lf:a]C[took the ko cause of the double atary i have at 'a', although i didnt wanted to loose the ko at any cost.]
;B[mp]C[j: he had better ko menaces (Q9, a17..)];W[md];B[kp]
;W[jp];B[lp];W[lf];B[kf];W[nf];B[of];W[mf];B[op];W[oo];B[ml]
;W[mk];B[kj];W[kh]LB[ji:a][jg:b]C[playing here removed the points 'a' and 'b' from black

j: I agree with you on b, but, a, depends on the cut you never made (L8)]
;B[jh];W[lh];B[lj];W[nl]LB[ol:a][kl:b]C[some territory around 'a' and the cut at 'b' will follow due to a bad play on black side.

I counted:

black - 80 pts.
lower left : 9
lower right: 24
center left: 24
upper right: 23

white - white 90 pts.
upper left  : 41
lower left  : 34
center right: 15

so i am now only worried to defend and reduce blacks territory.

j: I absolutely agree. With this approach you'll win a lot of games. Just don't forget the komi!]
;B[nn]C[ok i think black lost the game here.

although i only notice i will capture a group in the next move ...]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[ji];W[ln];B[mm];W[mo];B[np];W[pp];B[rq]
;W[sn];B[so];W[sm];B[an];W[lg];B[jg];W[jo]C[the last move was to preven black from wasting time and invading.

I dont really think black could invade and live .... but if he can, please tell me :-)


Tanks for all your help.

j: No, black cannot invade and live there unless you make a lot of errors...

Did you notice you won with the capture of the N7 group?

It's been a pleasure!

Just a few suggestions:

- avoid the automatic answer of your opponent's move; it's one of the easiest things to manage, and implies a very big difference in points.

- try to keep sente during the endgame.

- also, avoid using the simplest move and search for others, maybe more risky or complex but possibly more fruitfull.]
