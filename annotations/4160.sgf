AB[dd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][pp]C[Ben: Me and Greg have played a lot of handicap games together.  He knows the cap (o-10, q-13, q-6 etc.) too well so now I try do other stuff.  It's a miracle I ever win against him with this many stones.  Usually I don't try to do fancy things with high handicap games.  I play the game just like I would an even game and trust the handicap accounts for our difference in strength.]
PL[W];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp];B[cj]LB[jd:A]C[Ben: Greg is my student of sorts.  We frequently played on Friday afternoons together in addition to meeting for our weekly go club meetings.  When we played together there I recommended doing a move like this on numerous occasions.

The game move is not the biggest point on the board.  A is bigger.]
;W[fc];B[ec]LB[hc:B][jc:A][df:C]C[Ben: I think he was confused, I mentioned  e-18 as possible move in similar positions.  Anyway this is probably good enough.

The game move is appropriate when there is a black stone at A.  In that situation white can only extend to B.  Without the stone at A, it is better to play at C.]
;W[fd];B[df];W[jc]LB[cc:B][hc:A]TR[ec][fd]C[Now you can see the effect of the exchange with the marked stones.  Without the exchange, black can invade at A.  With this exchange, the invasion is gone.  Also, white can still live in the corner by playing B, although doing so will affect white's upper side territory.]
;B[nc]C[Ben: This is okay but I like h-4 better.  Black would be working up a nice framework.

I agree.  The game move has little effect to the three white stones at the top because they are quite solid.  On the other hand, with a move at H4, the two white stones at the bottom need reinforcement.]
;W[cc]
(;B[cd]TR[fc][jc][fd]C[This makes it too easy for white, as he invades the corner in sente.  Black needs to fight back.  Please see the variation.

From white's perspective, the invasion is premature.  There are many bigger points.  With the invasion, white weakens the marked stones.]
;W[eb];B[dc]C[Ben: We've gone over this sequence a lot and I wanted to test him and see if he still got it.  He plays infrequently enough I think he sometimes forgets.  My own preference is for d-18 but it is probably a matter of taste.  If there is a difference I am unaware of it.

The d18 version is also playable.  The game version is a bit greedy for black, however, he leaves a big yose move for white especially if white has good ko threats.]
;W[db];B[cb]LB[bb:A]C[Later white can play at A.  Please see variation.]

(;W[qf]
(;B[pf]LB[qe:A]TR[pj]C[With the marked stone, black should play at A.  Please see variation.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[qh]C[Comparing to the variation, white settles easily.]
;B[qj]LB[rg:C][nh:A][ni:B]C[Ben: He handled this joseki pretty well I felt.  I probably wouldn't have worried about r-10 so much but it is stable.

This is good.  At this time black can leave the white group alone.  Once black has stones around A or B and white can't run outside, black can aim at C to kill white's group.]
;W[fq];B[eq]LB[dn:A]C[Again, this helps white to strengthen his stones.  Simply play at A.]

(;B[or]C[Ben: r-4 here seems to fit with r-10 more.  He knows this variation I've showed it to him before.

This is fine.  Exchange the corner with side territory.];W[qr]
;B[oq];W[rn]LB[ro:A]C[This extension is too far.  A is standard.]

(;B[ql]TR[rn]C[Ben: I would have gone for something like m-3 or o-4.

The game move is slow.  m3 is good, but because of the long extension with the marked stone, black can take the corner later as shown in the variation.]
;W[no]LB[nr:A]C[A is more solid.  With the game move, black can play at A to reduce white's territory.]
;B[kd];W[jd];B[ke];W[lb];B[lc]LB[rg:B][nh:A]C[Ben: Locally I would have just went n-18.

I prefer A to expand the framework and aim at B to kill white's group.]
;W[mb];B[mc]C[Ben: Now just o-18];W[nr];B[os];W[qp]C[Ben: I had grown a little worried about this groups safety.  Nowadays I just slide to s-5.]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[qm]C[Ben: Hard to grasp the meaning of this. If you want to play a safety move here o-7 has more utility.

Just tenuki.];W[fl];B[fn];W[fj];B[hn]C[When black makes this move, he needs to know whether he can invade white's lower side.  If he can't, then this move becomes slow.]
;W[fh];B[ff]C[Ben: He managed to attack this grouping quite well.]
;W[hj];B[il];W[hh];B[kh];W[hf];B[ge]C[Ben: Here I think I had to come up with something riskier maybe.  I just couldn't figure out a way to make that group live on its own.]

(;W[jf]LB[he:A]C[A is better.  Please see variation.];B[je]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[id];B[hc];W[dh];B[cg]LB[ch:A][nh:B]C[A is standard locally, but B is bigger.]
;W[kf];B[lf];W[lg];B[mf]LB[kg:A]C[Black can cut at A.];W[kg]
;B[nh];W[oi];B[oh];W[pi];B[ph];W[qi];B[og];W[qg];B[ri];W[rh]
;B[si]LB[sh:B][rj:A]C[It's better to play at A.  That way B is not sente for white.]
;W[nj];B[li];W[rd]C[Ben: Im trying to keep things seperated in the middle.  Those kiema moves looked like potentialy cutable and p-1 was looking kind of low on eyes as well.  In the end I didn't manage to make anything of it though.]
;B[rc];W[se];B[ml];W[nl];B[nm];W[mm];B[nk]LB[om:A]C[It's better to simply extend at A.]
;W[mk];B[ol];W[ll];B[nl];W[lj];B[lm]C[Ben: Well this didn't turn out good for me.  Black simply isn't weak enough.]
;W[km]C[Ben: Anything else just looked too risky and blacks bottom group is well alive now.  And my bottom group is damaged.]
;B[mn];W[mi];B[ni];W[oj];B[kl];W[lk];B[mh];W[mj];B[lh];W[sh]
;B[rj];W[rf]
(;B[kn]C[Small.  Please see variation.];W[kp]C[Ben: This probably looks strange but I couldn't see anything better (locally).  This is anticipating something like h-3 or h-4 but if I play there myself black will undoubtedly play around m3.  So I know probably most people won't like this move but for my reasoning I can't see something appreciably better (again locally).

m3 is better.  k4 and l4 are too close together.  Not efficient.]
;B[jn]C[Ben: A little tame.

Right, not necessary.];W[hb];B[gb]LB[ib:A]C[Black can block at A.]
;W[ib];B[fb];W[ch];B[bg];W[bh];B[ei];W[eh];B[fi];W[gi];B[gg]
C[Ben: Here I realized I messed up but Greg ended up missing it.]
;W[gh];B[hg];W[ig]
(;B[gk]C[Ben: J12 looks like black probably wins the group.  Then I have to try to launch some kind of all out attack on d-10.  Hard to tell what would happen.

J12 won't kill white, but it is a good forcing move.  Please see variation.]
;W[ji];B[ik]C[Ben: Cut on f-9 is worth some decent points.

yes];W[gj];B[ii];W[jh];B[ih];W[ij];B[ki];W[hi];B[kj]C[Ben: This is small, there are still some very large moves on the board.]

;W[ip];B[gp];W[gq];B[ej]LB[dl:A]C[Ben: This move doesn't seem very valuable.

A is better.];W[bk]C[Ben: I realized I could get away with this for sure.]

;B[cq];W[gm];B[hm];W[pb]C[Ben: This was quite large for this point the game. End of my comments (Black wins by 12.5).

This doesn't work.  Please see variation.]
