RE[W+9.50]
TM[60]

C[aburry: This was a blitz game, but I am interested in having it reviewed because I want to know where my instincts need the most adjustment.

Xopods: Nothing wrong with that.  Instincts are very important, and you lucked out a bit to get me as your reviewer, because I'm a very instinct-oriented player. My reading skills are actually pretty weak.

When I comment, I'll be sure to tell you what my instincts would be in the position before going into any analysis... we can see where your instinct is right, where mine is right, and where we're both wrong and we should have read things out.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[nc]C[Xopods: This is probably okay... I'm sure you'd find some pro games with this move... the area in front of a shimari is always big, though, so you could also play around K3.  On the other hand, that gives Black the initiative.]
;B[lc];W[qc]LB[ne:A]C[aburry: Should this be "A"? Or something else? I jumped in to either settle quickly of turn the approach stone into profit.

Xopods: I think this is fine.  You have room to wedge on the right side if Black blocks at R16.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[fc];W[df]
LB[cf:A][hc:B]C[aburry: I played high because I have the stone in the bottom right. Should it be "A" instead? "B" seems too risky, but maybe there is another way to limit the moyo on the top side?

Xopods: B would be very bad.  This is fine, but you're going to need to find time to play around C10 soon.

Personally, I'd play at A, because then you don't need another move on the left side and can start reducing Black's moyo immediately.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[id]C[Xopods: Black took a territorial moyo instead of jumping to F15, so you don't need to do anything about his position right away.  You have aji around K17 and O18 to aim for later, but Black can't fix it now without becoming overconcentrated, so you should leave the top side alone for now... in other words, you have sente to play C10 so you're doing okay.]
;W[lp]C[aburry: This was random. The bottom side seems like the biggest area to me, but I have no idea what to do. I feel like I want to be high because of my left side potential, and I don't want to be too close because of black's strength in the corner.

Xopods: K3 and C10 are both very large.  This is too close to Black's powerful shimari.  Playing high is okay, but you still want to play further to the left, around K4.  Maybe L4 is alright if you want to be unorthodox... it only allows Black to extend to N3, instead of M3.]
;B[cn]
(;W[cl]LB[fq:A][dn:B][cj:C]C[aburry: This did not work out the way I hoped. I played the pincer rather than "A" because I was worried about the top left corner and I thought this might help those stones.



aburry: Maybe "B" or "C" is better?

Xopods: C is the right move, in my opinion, because you wanted to play there anyway.  You should thank Black for making this approach and giving you a chance to defend your open skirt in the top left while pincering.  See variation.]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[aburry: I chose this direction because of the high stone at M4.

Xopods: The problem with this idea is that M4 is undercut a bit by Q3, but as long as you're planning on building out into the centre, rather than taking the edge, this is probably okay.  I don't mind blocking the other way either... but when you don't know which way to block, it's often a sign that the one-space pincer was a bad idea in the first place.]
;B[cp];W[do];B[co]C[aburry: This move surprised me; I expected B6.

Xopods: This isn't joseki... it isn't completely terrible, but now Black doesn't undercut your left side, so you should be happy.]
;W[em]C[aburry: Is there a sharper move than this?

Xopods: I have a hunch that because Black played C5, you should play D6 instead of E7, but I can't justify it, it's just a feeling.]
;B[hq]
(;W[jq]LB[fe:A][ho:B][pf:C][gd:D]C[aburry: This move looks terrible. My thinking at the time was to push him towards my influence on the left, and to strengthen the isolated stone at M4.



aburry: Maybe in this situation I should tenuki to clarify some other part of the board to help me decide what to do here?



aburry: Maybe one of the marked alternatives?

Xopods: B is the only move, as far as I'm concerned.  When the opponent invades right in front of your wall like this, you absolutely must cap him and put the maximum pressure on.

Tenuki is not an option here, unless it's to make a kikashi to help you fight, e.g. at D.  See variation if Black responds in the way you'd be hoping for...

Whatever you do, you're looking to let Black live small while you establish control of the centre.]
;B[ho];W[jn]LB[hm:A]C[aburry: Trying to get ahead to pen him in. Maybe the cap at "A" is better?



aburry: When GNU Go 3.6 reviews this game, it keeps wanting to exploit aji in the upper right corner. Does that make sense to you?

Xopods: A is much better than this move.  What are your stones accomplishing here, other than to chase him out into the centre-left, which is where you were trying to make your moyo?

As for the aji in the top right, GNU Go is stupid.  Leave that aji for later.]
;B[hm]
(;W[qm]C[aburry: Another random move. Chasing black no longer seems helpful, so now maybe I can pen in the corner for some profit.

Xopods: Too close to his thick shimari again.  You could try to start a pushing war with G8, but I think G4 is an important kikashi first, to help protect your cutting point at E5.]
;B[mq];W[mp]LB[pj:A][om:B][qj:C]C[aburry: This is lame, but where instead? I'm very confused here. Perhaps one of the marked alternatives?

Xopods: I don't see anything wrong with this.];B[np];W[nq];B[nr]
;W[no];B[op]LB[gp:A][hp:B]
(;W[oo]C[Xopods: This is a mistake, though.  Here, I'd be trying to build up the right side...

You still need your kikashi at G4 though.];B[po];W[pn]C[aburry: This matches what I had in mind with R7, more-or-less.

Xopods: Yeah, but you lose sente and have cutting points.  Lighter shape was in order.]
;B[ch]C[Xopods: Another ridiculous move that you should be capping.  Black still has a weak group to worry about... one or the other should die.]

(;W[dh]C[aburry: My thinking here is to connect to bottom left corner. If I defend the top left corner, it will be small and bottom left will be in danger.

Xopods: ARGH!  Don't attach to weak stones!  Why are you thinking about defending when Black is the one with two weak groups?]
;B[cg];W[dg];B[be];W[ce];B[bd]
(;W[bc]LB[ci:A][hk:B][gn:C][gp:D]C[aburry: I forgot the plan to connect to the bottom corner. Should be "A"?

Xopods: No, it should be B, or possibly kikashi at C and/or D, then B.]
;B[bj];W[ci];B[bi];W[bf]C[aburry: I want to settle here, or saving the bottom left will be impossible.]
;B[cj];W[di];B[bl];W[bm]LB[dj:A]C[Xopods: Why not A?];B[cm]
;W[bk]C[aburry: This was dumb, and should not work, but black lets me get away with it.]

(;B[cr]C[Xopods: This is SO weak!  If Black was worried about his safety, why not seal the White stones in with sente?]

;B[nd];W[nf];B[qi]C[aburry: Third black invasion, and the first two have not gone well for white.

Xopods: Because you've defended when you should be attacking.]

LB[lj:A]C[aburry: GNU Go says "A" best move by far.

Xopods: I agree with the dummy computer for once.];B[kk];W[jl]
C[aburry: Intent here is to cut the two "weak" black groups.

Xopods: The "weak" group on the left is not weak, because your E6 group is practically dead.]
;B[lj];W[jk];B[li];W[mh];B[el]C[Xopods: Bad move.  You lucked out here, though you had a better means of escape than what you did in the game.  See variation.]

Xopods: Sure.  No need to take a chance in a blitz game.  Anyway, you really lucked out here.Black's centre group is still extremely weak.]
;B[ic]C[Xopods: WHAT?  Okay, Black is just begging you to kill the centre group.  See variation.]

(;W[lh];B[kh];W[kg];B[jh];W[ii]LB[lf:A][cb:B][lq:C]C[aburry: This looks silly. Where instead?

Xopods: See the variation a few moves back for a better way to attack.  At this point, I don't think you can stop Black from connecting to either the top or the left.]
;B[jg];W[jf];B[lg]C[Xopods: Terrible move.  Black didn't bother to read one move in advance.  Now J14 no longer works for him.]

There are times when the correct way to attack is to chase the opponent out into the centre, but usually it's better to seal him in against the edge and take control of the centre yourself, especially when you have moyos nearby.

Play more capping moves and peeps (when they aren't aji keshi) and you'll find your game improves.

Good luck, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions!]
