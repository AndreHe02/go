C[Commentary by wund 1d*, with some remarks from  WillemKoen Pomstra 5D.]
;B[pc];W[qp];B[cp];W[ep];B[iq]LB[gq:A]C[wund: This cannot be a bad move, but i would prefer  to either take the empty corner or to play a more  agressive pincer (at 'A' for instance).]
;W[dc];B[dn]C[wund: Because the original pincer, B 5, is so far  away it is easy for white to play tenuki again.]
;W[pe];B[op];W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[br];W[gq];B[io]C[wund: good move.]
;W[gn];B[dl]C[wund: A good, thick move again.];W[gl]C[wund: I think this is too slow.]

(;B[qo]C[wund: This is not a bad move, but why not play the  ordinary move? (variation 1)]

(;W[oq]C[wund: This is not a joseki move :-) (variation 2).]
;B[pp]C[wund: Very good.];W[pq];B[qq];W[rp]
(;B[rq]C[wund: This is a bad overplay. See variation 3];W[ro]
;B[nq];W[nr];B[mr]C[wund: This looks logical, but is not possible]

(;W[mq]C[wund: A blunder (variation 4)];B[np];W[lr];B[or];W[ms]
;B[pr]C[wund: This is a major succes for Black. Black is  leading by a wide margin now.]
;W[qn]
(;B[lo]LB[ql:A][kq:B]C[wund: A bit slack. I would prefer to either attack the  (very heavy) right white group with 'A' or play at the  vital point for the other group with 'B' (variation 5).]
;W[kp]LB[kq:A]C[wund: Better to play at the vital point, A.]
;B[ko];W[jp];B[hm];W[gm];B[ip];W[jo];B[jn];W[lp]
(;B[go]LB[mp:A]C[wund: First things first; Black can play at 'A' in  Sente (variation 6).]
;W[fo];B[gp];W[fq];B[en];W[fn];B[ce]C[wund: The forcing moves Black made gained him  nothing. Apart from that, the right side is much more  important. The four white stones in the lower right  are a major target; attack them!]
;W[cg];B[ee];W[cj]
(;B[bl]C[wund: This is a compromise move; if White  declines to defend his corner, you should play there  (variation 7).]
;W[fd];B[fe]LB[hd:A]C[wund: This move is 'forbidden', pushing along the  fourth line. Normally you play at 'A' to induce white  to push you over his own stones.]
;W[gd];B[eh];W[cd];B[dd];W[cc];B[cf];W[ei];B[dh];W[ek];B[dk]
;W[dj];B[ik];W[gi];B[ch]C[wund: This sequence is a succes for white. He has  taken a nice corner without suffering any damage,  and that in Sente.]
;W[mc]C[wund: The right side is still the most important!];B[od]
LB[mp:A]C[wund: This is your chance (again) to play at 'A' in  Sente, threatening to kill White.]
;W[ph];B[qd];W[qe];B[ne]C[wund: Good.];W[rd];B[rc];W[pd];B[qc]
;W[mo]
(;B[kn]C[wund: Oops! You can still cut (variation 8).];W[kd]
;B[pj]LB[mp:A][ql:B][qj:C]C[wund: Your last chance to make the cut at 'A'. Apart  from that, this is not the right point to invade. I  would play at B, or at least C.]
;W[qk];B[qj]C[wund: Good.];W[pk];B[oj];W[mp];B[mj]LB[nh:A][ok:B]
C[wund: This is too slow. You could play more  agressively by capping at 'A'. If you want too play  solid you should take a liberty by playing the bend  at 'B'.]
;W[nk];B[ok];W[pm];B[ol];W[nm];B[po];W[om];B[rm]C[wund: If u don't want to follow up on this move it is  no use playing here :-).]
;W[rn];B[nj]C[wund: Much too slow.];W[nh]C[wund: A pity to let white play there.]
;B[kj];W[lm]LB[id:A]C[wund: Let's make a rough count at this point:

Black: Lower left corner ~ 12 points
 Left side  ~ 10 points
 Upper right corner ~ 10 points
 Lower right corner ~ 10 points

 Total  ~ 42 points

White: Upper left corner ~ 15 points
 Upper right ~ 05 points   Lower left  ~ 05 points
 Lower right ~ 05 points

 Total  ~ 30 points

If white suceeds in making about 15 points with his  moyo on the upper side he will win, I think. Had he  played his last move at, for instance, 'A' he would  have been slightly ahead, i think.

Black should invade the upper side with his next  move, and considering the weakness of the white  side group, anything is possible still.

Black was way ahead after the White mistake in the  lower right corner, but White has caught up because  Black played a little bit too cautiously with moves  like 57, 93 and 103.]

(;W[ro];B[po];W[qn];B[rn]LB[qm:A]C[wund: Black cannot cut on the other side, because  the ladder at A doesn't work.]
;W[rm];B[rp];W[sn];B[qq];W[pn]C[wund: If you compare this with variation 1, although  Black has taken the corner, White's position on the  right side is much better and there is a lot of aji left  on the lower side.]

(;B[pn];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np]C[wund: In this position all the black stones are  working very efficiently.]
