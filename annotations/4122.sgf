AB[pd][dp]C[Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I've preceded all my comments with my name.

It seems to me that the most noticeable problem both players have is playing moves that are too "slow": the most common example of this is extending from one's own group simply by adding to a line of stones on the board, when it's possible instead to jump one or more points.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[fq];B[er]C[Ted: I think it's better just to develop naturally, by playing something like C6.]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[fr];B[eq];W[eo];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[hr];B[ir]

(;W[gp]C[Ted: I think I would have cut at J3 instead.  See the variations.

I should add that I would have had difficulty finding this with the clock running, however.]

;B[kq];W[jp];B[io];W[in];B[jo];W[kp];B[hn];W[jn];B[gn]C[Ted: I think Black got the better of the fighting]
;W[lq];B[hs];W[js];B[is]C[Ted: This is an unnecessary move; Black should take the opportunity to play somewhere else.  I'd probably do something to protect the stones in the bottom left, like D6]
;W[gs];B[dq];W[ko];B[ho]C[Ted: The wrong move.   If you're worried about White attacking with E6, it should be at G5 to make two eyes.

Of course, with the stones at E4 and E5, the ladder is still in Black's favor.]
;W[en]
(;B[fm]C[Ted: This is an excellent example of what I'm talking about when I mention "slow" moves.  At the very least, Black can jump out to G8, or better, try a more aggressive move like E7.]

(;W[do]SQ[en][eo]C[Ted: As the proverb goes, "The empty triangle is bad".  I might actually sacrifice that group by playing at D10.  If Black attacks from the top, extending toward the bottom threatens to save the stones.]
;B[co];W[qj]C[Ted: Not a bad idea to sacrifice the stones now and play a fairly big move.]
;B[em];W[qf];B[es]C[Ted: This is definitely too slow.  Play something along the top., like K16/17 or N17.]
;W[hm];B[fs]C[Ted: Another slow move, and one that gains almost nothing.]
;W[gm]C[Ted: Oh dear.  I assume White sees J2 now.];B[ir];W[is]

[lk][ll]C[Ted: I think it would have been better to play on one side of Black, by approaching at F17 or C14, instead of playing here.  Although you have one wall already and get a second here, Black can jump out from the marked stones to prevent you from getting much territory with the walls.]
;B[ed];W[fe];B[fd];W[gd];B[fc]SQ[ed][fd]C[Ted: This at the very least should be at G17.  Remember the proverb, "The empty triangle is bad".

D 15 might be even better than G17.];W[de];B[cd];W[ce];B[bd]

;W[jc];B[ib]C[Ted: Again, this should be at K18.];W[jb];B[ja]
;W[ka];B[ia];W[kb];B[me]C[Ted: I don't really like this move.  It's another one that's too slow]
;W[jf];B[lg];W[kh];B[kg];W[jg]
(;B[kf]TR[em][fm]C[Ted: Another terribly slow move.  White has two walls, but Black has some stones that can stop White from getting much territory.

Black should either jump out from the marked stones, or invade at R3.  The variations should give you an idea of what to expect.]

;W[nb];B[ob];W[ne];B[od];W[nf];B[mg]C[Ted: At the very least, O13 is better.]

;W[mp];B[mo];W[np]C[Ted: Now, the invasion at R3 would be much more difficult.]
;B[no];W[oo];B[on];W[pn];B[fl]C[Ted: Extending out from this group is a good idea, but this move doesn't do it quickly enough.]
;W[hk];B[fk];W[gj];B[fj];W[gi];B[fi];W[fh];B[ei]C[Ted: Again, this move could be at E12 with no worry of getting cut.]

;W[qc];B[nb];W[qe];B[qb];W[rb];B[qa];W[ra];B[pb]C[Ted: Q17 gets an extra point.]
;W[rc]C[Ted: Unnecessary; I'd look at gaining an extra point by playing G8.]
;B[bn]C[Ted: Unnecessary, as the stones are already dead.  Play a forcing move like Q8 instead.]
