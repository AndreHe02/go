RE[B+6.5]

C[[Calvin\]: Hello.  I hope you enjoy this review.  Remember that I am amateur and there is a lot I still do not understand about that game.  I can only tell you a few things that I am able to see at my level which may be useful to you.

Both players seem stronger than 22k, and can look forward to rapid improvement.  Black needs to focus on ignoring small, unimportant threats by his opponent.  All kyu players should spend as much time as possible on life and death problems to improve reading ability.  There are a couple of life and death problems in this game which almost determined the outcome of the game, and this is frequently the case, even up to the pro level.

The other important lesson is that the player who is ahead should avoid dangerous kos.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[qp];B[co]C[[Calvin\]: The first five moves are normal.  There are many professional games that start this way.]

(;W[fr]C[[Calvin\]: This move is incorrect.  The keima (knight's move) is a common response to an approach to the star point (D4) but white's D3 stone is already on the third line, so in this case we don't keima because playing on the second line in the early opening is too low unless there is some other strategic benefit.  See variations.]
;B[cl]C[[Calvin\]: Making a base at C8 is a solid strategy for black.]
;W[qf]LB[ec:A]C[[Calvin\]: It is bigger for white to approach at A.  Usually, making or destroying a shimari (enclosure from a 3-4 point surch as C16) is bigger than approarching a star point.]
;B[of]LB[jd:A]C[[Calvin\]: Usually this move is only played when there is a black stone near A already.]
;W[qh]LB[qc:A];B[op];W[pq]C[[Calvin\]: This move helps black.]

(;B[kp]LB[oq:A]C[[Calvin\]: This is a light way to play, but black can just block at A (P4).  See variation.]
;W[en];B[oi]C[[Calvin\]: It's a basic strategy to try to surround your opponent's weak groups.]
;W[fk]
(;B[ci]LB[dj:A]C[[Calvin\]: Locally, A is better balance because black's position is low on the left, with all stones on the third line.  However, I think black should follow up on with his attack on the right side.   See variation.]
;W[fi]C[[Calvin\]: This move accomplishes nothing.];B[fd]LB[cc:A]
[hc:B]C[[Calvin\]: A big move.  With this nikken-tobi shimari, black should be aware that there are weaknesses at A at B for white to exploit.]
;W[ie];B[ic]C[[Calvin\]: A good move, which helps black's corner.]
;W[ke]
(;B[lc]C[[Calvin\]: Black should make sure not to just follow white around.  White 22 is a small move and doesn't require a response.  Black should look around the board and find urgent moves and big moves according to the relative weakness/strength of groups.  See variation.]
;W[mg];B[og]C[[Calvin\]: A solid defense.];W[oh]C[[Calvin\]: An overplay.]

(;B[nh]C[[Calvin\]: Black can consider the atari from the other side.  See variation.]
;W[ph];B[mh]LB[ng:A]C[[Calvin\]: Connecting at A is usually better, even though it makes the empty triangle.]

(;B[ok]LB[pj:A]C[[Calvin\]: Locally, A is better shape because white can play there in sente.  This move is slow because black is actually connected already.  See variation.]

;W[jk]
(;B[im]LB[il:A]C[[Calvin\]: Black should just extend at A.  Jumping like this gives white forcing moves that can be used to help settle his group.  This can be seen later as white cuts through here.]

(;B[kj]LB[mi:A]C[[Calvin\]: It's tiny for black to connect here.  If white captures, black can always capture at A.   Don't just answer your opponent's moves.]

;W[ko];B[lp];W[nr]LB[rd:A][cc:B]C[[Calvin\]: White starts the endgame.  This is part of the reason white is able to catch up.  I think it is better for white to slide at A since that group is weak, but white has the right idea.  Actually, white is behind enough that maybe something more aggressive is in order, such is attaching at B.]
;B[mr]LB[lr:A]C[[Calvin\]: It may be better for black to hold back at A.  This move gives white forcing follow-ups.]

(;W[tt]C[[Calvin\]: This game is NOT finished.  In fact, it's possible white can win.  See variation.

In general, black was ahead for almost all of the game, because white played some early moves in the center that were not valuable.  However, white was able to close the gap some in the endgame and finally was able to save a group via ko which clearly should have remained dead.  When the possibility of ko arises it is important to take time to count the score and the ko threats. There is a proverb: "The rich man should not pick fights."  If one is far ahead on the board, one should not permit one's opponent to start a one-sided ko.]
