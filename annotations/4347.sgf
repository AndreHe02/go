;B[hd]C[<jfc> black 7 seems odd.    The two space jump on the 4th line is not good for making territory.  Since white occupies the Q17 corner black is not going to build a moyo here.  I think black would be better off playing at Q15 and treating E16 lightly.]
;W[fc]C[<jfc> The upper left corner is settled so white has the option of playing a big move elsewhere.  Starting a fight with F17 is OK but you must play carefully in the ensuing fight.]

(;W[ff]C[<jfc> F14 is your first major mistake.  White should play E15 (see variation).]
;B[ee];W[ef]C[<jfc> compared with white cutting at E15, white has more cutting points and black is stronger.]

(;W[ce]C[<jfc> white C15 at D17 is better (see variation).]
;B[cc];W[bd];B[dc]C[<jfc> black D17 does nothing useful.  Black should play  B14.]

(;W[lc]C[<josh> I'm not too sure about this move. Was it too far? Or instead should I have attacked black at one of the bottom corners? 

<jfc> the fight in upper left corner is not settled so playing at B14 is bigger  than white M17 (see variation).  

Because black's ponnuki at H17 is thick white's extension to M17 is probably too far.

<josh> How is my opening so far. Good or bad?

<jfc> Black's opening is better so far.  If white plays E15 instead of F14 then white has a much better opening than the current game position.]

;B[bn];W[dr];B[ap];W[aq];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[bs];B[bl]
(;W[bk]C[<jfc> Since white got to fill the liberty at E13 when black captured the ladder the black stones at C13 are probably dead.   Because of this, white F3 is bigger than B9.  The white stones at C8 are not important.   Of course if black can capture the white C16 stones that would be very bad.]
;B[fr];W[eq];B[fp];W[fq];B[gq];W[er];B[gr]
(;W[mq]C[<josh> Here, was this move my best choice?

<jfc> the upper right corner is unsettled so the right side is probably the biggest area.  I would play a ladder break like N12 and then a big move on the right side (see variation).]

(;W[lr];B[kr];W[pq];B[oq];W[op];B[np];W[oo];B[nq];W[qp];B[pr]

(;W[qq]C[<jfc> capturing at Q5 is better because it doesn't leave any ladder break aji like R6 (see variation).]
;B[mp]C[<jfc> black should play O5 instead.  This threatens to pull out the Q4 stone with Q5 atari.  It also surrounds N3 on a bigger scale.

NOTE: If white had captured Q4 with white Q5 instead of R3, then black O5 would be gote rather than sente.]

(;W[qr]TR[hf]C[<jfc> this move is gote.  Black should ignore the threat to capture Q2 and play a big move instead.  For example, black P9 fixes the ladder and gives black a presence on the right side.]

(;B[or];W[pm];B[if];W[oe]C[<jfc> P15 leaves the right side more open to invasion.  I prefer R14.]

;W[fi];B[gj];W[pj]C[<jfc> Q10 is the right area to play but R11 would be better as it makes it harder for black to invade.  If white already had a low stone (for example, at R14) then Q10 would be better.]
;B[qg];W[qe];B[rj];W[rh]C[<jfc> S12 is a trick move and it doesn't fool black.  If Q10 was at R10 or R11 then black would not be able to slide into white's bottom right side so easily.  White 106 at S8 seems reasonable.

It is important to have a mix of high (4th line) and low (3rd line) stones to secure a side.]
;B[qh];W[qi];B[ri];W[rg]C[<jfc> S13 is obviously bad];B[rf]
;W[qf];B[sg];W[pg]C[<jfc> better to seal the corner with S15.  Because of black's thickness at J14 there is little territory to be had in the middle so Q13 doesn't serve any purpose.]
;B[ph]
(;W[og]C[<jfc> With white Q13 played, P12 (atari) rather than P13 is the correct continuation.]
