AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Ryzours:Hello.
This game was played in august 2005 on the Dragon go server, using the automatic handicap. So the handicap given by the server was 5 stones with a komi of 6,5.
I played white and I couldn't overcome the handicap, feeling surrounded by black stones most of the time. I had to get involved in a ko to try to catch up, but it didn't work.
I'd like to know what went wrong, especialy in the begining of the game. Also, I'd like to know if there were better moves to do during the endgame.


You very often play too timidly. Alternate third and fourth line base moves, block the opponent decisively when you can't read out a failure, and don't save one or two stones in gote. Other than that, you should try to settle your groups before you invate, attack, or othervise start a new weak group. 


The common disclamer about me not being more than a few stones stronger than you apply; don't take anything I write as gospel.]

I don't think this is the best move here. As you see, you get in trouble later, when black splits you. Normally the R15-Q14 exchange is beneficial, because you become solid. But here you just become unnecesarilly heavy. I suggest R12 as a defensive move, and then ignore black if he attaches at Q14, playing light. The corner will still be available later.]
;B[nd];W[cf];B[ce];W[df];B[fd];W[cj]C[


You are playing consequently low, usually a bad idea. I would have played D10 here, to counteract some of the influence black has in the center; chances are it will not mean much for the security of your territory, and you might just get one row higher in the end.]
;B[rh];W[re]C[Ryzours : I didn't want to get invloved in a fight too soon, feeling that it would reinforce black. So I tried to get life in the corner.




Getting into a fight is what you want. Remember that black does not have superior influence because of better gameplay; to the contrary, you are the one with the upper hand tactically. But it is a dificult position, and I am not sure what works; black can easilly connect at S14 if you don't play on the second row. Perhaps just R13 then S12 to settle the situation once he withdraws? If he don't, and play S11 or something, you should be able to exploit the potential in the corner in the comming fight.]
;B[ph];W[qd];B[pe];W[qc]C[

You settle the situation, but give black excellent influence, and your R6 group needs help NOW.]
;B[of];W[fq]C[Ryzours : I tried to have living groups on all the sides.



Instead of trying for merely living groups, you should go for solid and settled groups. Spend an extra honte move to stabilize your group and grab a little more profit, then you will be in a position to attack decisively.]
;B[eq];W[fp]C[



Again you make yourself heavy when you should probably play lighter.  F5 seems doable, as does switching to C6 (Surely black won't C5 in response!)]
;B[kq];W[iq]C[



Again you should probably play high; you will not get enough base to live anyway, so go for influence and central access.]
;B[jp]C[

This is a severe attack on your bottom group, you should answer!]
;W[cn]C[

Black can now play D6 and threaten both sides.];B[cq]C[

This is too kind of black, he does not have to live immediately, with a center to run to.]
;W[jc]C[



You should secure your groups and fight black in the center by playing F6. You have one leg in at R17, so black will not want to play at the top immediately.]
;B[ke]C[


Black wisely don't try to fight you for the edge, and secures profit in the center. If you settle your top group here, you are perfectly suited to attack black upper left corner group.]
;W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[ob]C[


H17 seems perfect here];W[gb]C[Ryzours : After seeing what happened next, maybe tha mov was a mistake. Is J15 better?



J15 is not much better, because black can cut you with K16 then J17. H17 is the move.]

(;W[jb]C[



You don't need to defend here just yett, see variations.];B[eb]
C[Ryzours : So, I managed to get living groups on all sides, but the bottom group is small, and the top one flat, giving a lot of influence to black. So Black seems to be still quite ahead, and I need to take territory somewhere.
I considered F14, but I felt it was too slow, and G14 seemed dangerous.




Black does not yett have much consolidated territory. In a position like this, see how many flaws in your groups you can fix in sente, then start reducing. Reduce the top center by threatening to cut off his top left corner, then when he defends, threaten to invade deeply in that corner. Reduce the bottom left corner to almost nothing just by threatening to kill it, and then when you're out of sente reductions, invade the bottom right corner. The biggest problem is probably securing the right side group first, but start out with something like S11 and see if black makes any mistakes.]
;W[qq]C[Ryzours : This corner seems quite open, maybe I can live in it.

Even if you got the corner, you would end up gote, and lose a lot of the potential existing elsewhere on the board.]
;B[ro]C[Ryzours : Now R6 group seems in danger, as it has not a lot of room to escape or to make eyes. I decided to protect it.


About time.];W[rn]C[


Still not secure tho.];B[pq]C[Ryzours : No more easy living in the cormer now, and the R6 group still seems weak.]

C[


Black neglected S10];W[nn]C[



And you should have played S11.];B[ff]C[Ryzours : With this move, black makes a good moyo. Maybe I should have played around here before.



Yes, see previous comments. Keeping sente is vital. The move at R3 only strenghtened black, and caused you to end up in gote, even tho you saved a group.]
;W[fj];B[eh];W[eg]C[


This is a thank-you move. Black does not care so much about his single stone, as he cares about securing more center territory.]
;B[fg];W[fh];B[fi];W[ei];B[gh];W[dh];B[fh];W[ej];B[gj]C[Ryzours : Now, the black moyo is almost territory, so I'll probably won't get many points by attacking it. There don't seems to be many interresting moves to do.



If you mean reducing, you are probably right, but if there are sente moves to make (G9 stands out) or just large moves on the border between moyos (N9) to make, you should still consider them.]
;W[fm]C[


Good; saves F4, and expands moyo.];B[hl];W[gk];B[hk];W[gl]C[Ryzours : I lose sente for a few points...


Indeed. Sente is pretty important here.];B[rg]C[Ryzours : and black starts attacking my weaker group.]

;W[oe];B[od];W[nf];B[md];W[lf];B[mg];W[mf];B[le];W[oa];B[na]
;W[pa];B[nb];W[ra]C[Ryzours : I've got lucky during the fight, the R18 group is alive and I've got a break into the center. I thought that  I might still win this game and focused on getting the initiative and not losing it.



I am guessing you're behind by 5-10 points, which is certainly doable as white in a five stone handicap game.]
;B[mk]C[



A big move indeed.];W[nl];B[rj]C[



Double sente.];W[ql]C[

Don't be squeamish, you need every point you can get to win; play S9 unless you can read out that black can destroy you no matter what you do.]
;B[be];W[fb]C[Ryzours : I suddenly realised that this group is not secure, so I had to use a move helping it.]
;B[ea]C[


This is not a threat, the group is secure. Tenuki!];W[fa];B[fc]
LB[bf:C][kg:A][hm:B][ln:F][ip:E][jr:D]C[Ryzours : Now, I have the initiative. I considered moves A to F, but I find it hard to know which is the bigger. C seems quite big, but is not sente. I don't have any ideas how much F might be worth.




The saying is that a monkey jump is worth 12 points, so that's C, but sente points are worth double. Playing in the center (A as marked, or perhaps K12) seems fairly hot and are likely to get a response from black. D2 is sente, as it threatens a monkey jump, while E, B and F seems like almost dame (blacks lower center is open on two sides) since you are unlikely to get any territory here.


The idea is to play sente moves as long as you can, then take the largest gote. Center, then D, then C seems to work here.]
;W[kg]
(;B[kf];W[lg]
(;B[lm]C[Ryzours : Isn't K13 bigger?




Much bigger];W[hm]C[


So why didn't you play there?];B[bo];W[bn]C[


Double sente.];B[ah];W[bi];B[ai];W[aj];B[ag];W[ig]C[


This is bigger than B5, so black has lost some.];B[gc]C[


that's one point; keep pushing.];W[hj];B[qk];W[pk];B[rk];W[pl]
C[


Again too timit, S8! An atari doesn't automatically mean danger.]
;B[mo]C[

Perfect time to play K2, then you have K7 as a reduction combined with the threats of capturing H8.]
;W[ij]C[Ryzours : Black is still quite ahead, so I'll try to complicate things a little.



You mean make it easy for him? This is a thank-you move, black gets to remove any aji the two stones had.]
;B[il];W[im];B[jl];W[ip];B[jo];W[co];B[bp];W[af]C[


Just B13 straight saves a point.];B[bf];W[bg];B[ae];W[bh];B[af]

(;W[gf]C[


does not gain you anything, in fact, it is worse than a pass. Just connect at H14; one less ko threat, much less aji.]
;B[hg];W[hh];B[hi]C[Ryzours : I didn't think i could win if I lose any stones, so I tried the ko.]
;W[ii];B[jg];W[kh];B[ih];W[de];B[cd];W[hh];B[pg]C[Ryzours : I don't have many ko threats, so I don't want to lose one to respond to this.]
;W[ih];B[of]C[Ryzours : So there will be a decisive ko going on. But I end up losing it, and I resigned. Was there a way to stay in the game at this point?



Well, there was no reason to upgrade the ko. You have to find a ko threat anyway, and now you need a bigger one. You have reduced black well and are a few points ahead if you win the ko.]

Cgoban2's score estimator gives the score as W+0.5 here, but that does not take into account black's sente, nor the difference in strenght of the players. I think you're still in the game.]

You would welcome a ko here, give up the edge that looks bigger than it is for some double move elsewhere, say R12-R13 R3-R4 or similar. You also have several local threats and atleast one point-making threat (B4 or thereabouts).]
