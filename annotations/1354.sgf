C[Hi there :)
my name is Johan Meijerink, I am Blizzeh 9k* on IGS, 8k on KGS
This is a game I played vs a 11k*.. I had some major difficulties in this game.. and I would appreciate it if the reviewer would point out the biggest mistakes made here, thanks alot and enjoy reviewing :)

Blizzeh = white
yaoyu   = black

komi  = 0.5

Review by John Rae  4k IGS];B[pd];W[cp];B[ep];W[eq]C[I responded with E3.. I don't know if that's a good thing to do so

JR :
Black's immediate approach is a little unusual. I've never seen it this early in a game before.  I'm not sure its bad. I would prefer a more normal move taking another corner

White 4 is perfectly solid. It is also possible to tenuki, pincer at G3 and so on.

Black seems to be feeling aggressive and looking for a fight so playing solid seems OK]
;B[cq]C[I thought he would play F3 or D4.. but C3.. came as a big suprise :)

JR: Another black move I've never seen.

I'm not aware of it being joseki so the trick is to discover how to punish it :)]

(;W[dp];B[dq];W[er];B[bp]
(;W[cn]C[

JR:   Generally my thinking is that white will be happy to let black live small  in the corner so long as either

a) white captures the E4 cutting stone, or

b) white establishes safe groups both on the side and bottom leaving the cutting stone running away between them.

I *think* B5 could turn out better but I confess I'm not sure]
;B[br];W[bo];B[aq];W[cs];B[cr]
(;W[dc]C[

JR   The cutting stone splits white into two groups which can both be attacked. It becomes dangerous when  black strengthens this stone

Its quite important for white to make sure both the groups in the corner are solid.

White does not have time to play elsewhere at the moment. The variation looks to work out much better than the game.]
;B[eo];W[dn];B[gq]
(;W[gr]C[

JR White should tenuki here I think. A play in the bottom right would be good.

After all if you sacrifice these 3 stones its not that many points. And as the game develops the threat to escape with them should be helpful to you.]
;B[hr];W[fp];B[fr];W[fo];B[en];W[fq];B[gs]
(;W[fn]C[JR  This forces black to extend and attack white's group on the side.   It hurts white more on the side than it help the escaping group]
;B[em];W[cl]C[JR White 28 forced black 29 which forced this defence. Handing over sente like this is not helpful.]
;B[fm];W[ho];B[do];W[co];B[jp]
(;W[dk]C[JR Again I think you're playing from the wrong direction

36 will push black towards the centre - which gains more liberties and also an attack on the lower white group and so will be sente.]
;B[hm];W[in]
(;B[bk]C[kinda wasted move it seems B9..

JR I think I agree this is not the time for black to play here.
The priorities for black are to make his running group secure while at the same time making territory by attacking the white running group.]
;W[kn]C[I was thankfull to him/her for this move :)];B[jm];W[jn]

(;B[im]C[JR again this does not help black much. K7 will aid black in the future, even if only as a sacrifice.

M4 seems the move to me. It keeps up the attack, stabalises the bottom making territory]
;W[lq];B[kq];W[lp];B[oq]
(;W[iq]C[JR:

See variation on black's next move. Black is alive, although I think you missed a chance to kill in the actual game.

Therefore white might be better playing in the corner.]
(;B[ir];W[kr];B[jr];W[mr];B[po]
(;W[jq]C[JR   capturing the L3 stone is thinking about living

H3 makes the eye at g2 false. Black cant get out and cant live]
;B[hq];W[ip];B[hp]
(;W[io];B[pl];W[ds];B[bs];W[fs]C[tried to make a ko here

JR: The decision is whether your ko threats are big enough and whether you have enough.

If you do not - simply wait and play to develop more big threats The ko will always be there, unless black uses a move to defend - in which case white gets two moves in a row. Good for white either way.

It turned out well for white so this sequence was good.];B[es]
;W[gn];B[dr]C[but the ko ended quickly :)

JR  black did not think he had enough threats to fight the ko and did not accurately assess the danger.]
;W[gm];B[gl];W[fl]
(;B[el]C[JR:   black does not look like getting away here.

Black should sacrifice the stones and play elsewhere. Struggling and dying usually gives your opponent even more strength.]

;W[cf];B[dg];W[bh];B[eg]
(;W[dl]C[JR:

 white could keep moving with the 3 E12 stones.

So long as you keep enough liberties this capture will always be there - so your stones are safe.

I'm not sure it would be better though.];B[ee];W[de];B[df];W[cd]
;B[ed]
(;W[cj]C[JR:

Capturing the B9 stone is small. White is alive above and below so connecting is not necessary.

Equally it is not important for black to connect to B9 - much more important to make eyes along the top

The biggest issue at the moment is that Black has all the stones in the top right. Now is the time to do something about that.]
;B[dd];W[ce];B[ec];W[ff];B[ef];W[db]
(;B[bi];W[ci]C[JR: Again I'm feeling white is squashed against the left side, i would want to play a more expansive move.]
;B[ch];W[bj];B[bg];W[ai];B[cg];W[ic]C[JR:  Good attacking];B[hb]

(;W[fb]C[JR: This move will turn out  badly I suspect];B[eb]
;W[ea]C[JR: Having played F18 you feel the need to defend it, but this is black pushing white around - the position should have black struggling.]
;B[fc];W[gb];B[gc]C[JR and now black threatens an eye with F19]

(;W[bf]C[JR:

Were you thinking white needed this to live in the corner? Black is not going to get eyes over there.

If you think you can trap the black group you should connect at F19, even though it is gote.

If you are not sure if black can run away play a blocking move first.


Over all I think the best is to ignore this fight for the moment and approach the top corner. The objective would be to develop a stronger position at the top and *then* turn back to attack this group.

Its a matter of timing, White is not quite strong enough to kill at the moment so play moves which prepare for a possible kill later. Black will always have two things to worry about so there are good opportunities for White]
;B[af]
(;W[ad];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[bd];B[bb];W[ba];B[da];W[ca];B[ga]

(;W[qh]C[JR:

The past few moves were a disaster for White.

Black was under severe attack but somehow black attacked white!

This invasion is OK in itself but one result is likely to be black developing along the top. Any remaining attack will vanish. Meanwhile black will be attacking the white invasion on the side.]
;B[qf];W[qk];B[ql];W[qp]C[JR: your 2 invading stones are not safe. Nor do they give any sort of support for this second invasion.

White looks like ending up with two weak groups under attack.

If you wanted to invade here I think you should have started here first.

Having invaded up the side the priority is to make the invasion safe, Black has a right to gain some territory while resiting the invasion, this side is clearly Black's area of influence, you canot expect to deny black any territory at all :)]
