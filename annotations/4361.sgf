C[Thanks in advance for reviewing this game.

I was playing Black.  I'm a beginner trying to get better.  28kyu when I started this game, now I'm about 23-25kyu.  The oppoent was 23kyu.

Generally thought I did pretty good at the beginning, but lost horribly at the end because I could not find ways to make the center live.  I seem to lack skills in tactics, especially when it comes to the center fighting.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks again.

alaric: Hello, I'm alaric, and I'll be doing your review.  I'm ~16k KGS.  All my comments will be prepended with "alaric:".  The first time I use a particular go term i'll define it, if you already know go terminology all the better.]
;B[qp];W[cp];B[pd];W[dd];B[oq];W[eq];B[pj];W[id];B[jp]TR[cj]
C[alaric: C10 would usually be considered worth more, but a double wing is never bad position.]
;W[md];B[nc]C[alaric: N16 is not a dire assault, you could still have tenuki'd (played away from the current tactical situation) here at C10.  N16 is also not a very common attack, but the standard response would be Q14 here.]
;W[mc];B[qf]C[alaric: Your off joseki (standard corner plays) at this point, but Q14 feels more correct here to me.]
;W[dl];B[cf]C[alaric: Good.  Whites move pretty much invites you to play here.]
;W[di];B[cc]C[alaric: Given the play so far this looks like a heavy influence game, so I think a move towards the center (E14) is appropriate here.]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[df];B[be];W[de];B[bf];W[oe];B[hq]C[alaric: Good time to tenuki.  There is no immediate threat from P15, so playing elsewhere is appropriate.  I'd be tempted to play to the center at this point, you own 3 of the corners, if you split the middle you should win.]
;W[nh]TR[ec][nj]C[alaric: White is mapping out a big moyo (potential territory) on the top and center.  So extending at O10 helps protect you corner and reaches towards the center.  Alternatively E17 slips under white's open flank and destroys some of his moyo.]
;B[pg];W[jn]C[alaric: Well played cap by white.  It's out on it's own right now, but it's got support in every direction so it's not really in danger.]
;B[nj]C[alaric: I think this is the wrong response.  It was appropriate a few moves ago, but white is pushing into what could have been your moyo in the bottom right, so it now has less value.  Usually when a stone is that far from protection you would cut it (such as H6), but I think he would just invade at N6 and come out pretty good.  Because of this i would likely play L6 here.]
;W[jj]TR[ng][mh][li][hn][go]C[alaric: If it hasn't already at this point your danger sense should be going off.  White has carved out a big chunk of the middle.  If white holds his middle mostly intact you lose, therefore it's urgent to find a way to break into the middle.  The marked spaces seem to have potential, but it's important to act now.]
;B[jl]C[alaric: An attack, but the wrong location I think.]
;W[il];B[ll]C[alaric: I think you need to play L6 here, otherwise you are inviting him to slip into your moyo.  Sacrificing the K8 stone is perfectly exactable tactically.  The really problem is that this is bad strategically.  Any exchange in this area will likely give white a wall and wreck your chances to get into the center.]
;W[ln];B[lp];W[nn];B[pn];W[om];B[pm];W[ok];B[pk];W[oj];B[ol]
C[alaric: Not good, you are forcing him to fix a gap in his line.]
;W[nl];B[pl];W[ni];B[dc]C[alaric: Big, but H6 may be more urgent.  Of course at this point the white center is fairly secure and it will be quite hard to push into it.  Also, you can push to E17 here without worry.  If white D17, black D18 and you are still connected.]
;W[fd]C[alaric: That seemed overly cautious by white, E17 would be appropriate.]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[ch]C[alaric: I think you can safely play C11 instead here.]
;W[ci];B[bh]C[alaric: Not enough for sente (sente is the initiative, in this case your threat isn't enough to retain sente), D13 would have been better (white can't ignore it without putting the center in peril).]
;W[ho]C[alaric: Good tenuki by white, he blocks the last big gap in his lines.  White is now up by a very large margin and there isn't alot left for black to do about it.]
;B[mm];W[mj]C[alaric: Mistake by white, he needs to respond to your move, the cut at O10 is not vital at this moment.]
;B[oi]TR[jl][ll][mm]C[alaric: What was the purpose of N7?  If there was some value in that move, and your opponent ignores it, then there should be a way to punish him for not responding, right?  In this case O7 saves the marked stones and wipes out a dozen or so of whites territory.  By my count that move is worth over 20 points.  Your move destroys the aji (potential to make trouble) of O10, and gains little territory.]
;W[nk];B[oh];W[of];B[nm]C[alaric: Good, both you and white didn't see the value of this move for the last couple of play.s]
;W[mn];B[on];W[lm];B[np]C[alaric: No, connecting at N8 is worth more.]
;W[ml];B[om]TR[gb][nb][ak][fr]C[alaric: Again, no.  I know it's often hard to leave stones stranded, but this move is gote (a move that does not need a response, opposite of sente).  What if you don't protect here?  White can play P7 and capture 2 stones for 4 points.  But then he's left with a ko, so really he needs a second stone that takes away one of his territory to make the position secure.  2 moves in gote for 3 points.  That's not significant until the very late end game.  Any of the marked location is worth much more at this point.]
;W[gq];B[hr];W[od];B[oc];W[pe];B[qd];W[gc];B[fe]C[alaric: Bad, that just throws away F17 and leaves you surrounded by a sea of white.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[db];W[hp];B[gr]C[alaric: Monkey jump at E1 bigger.  (If you don't know what a monkey jump is go to sensei's library and study it, it's a very useful move that shows of quite often, and is worth 10 points.)]
;W[fq];B[bi]C[alaric: Again, monkey jump (A9) better.];W[bj]
;B[gf]C[alaric: You are down about 60 points here, so you'll need something really big to pull off a win at this point.  In actuallity you'll need a massive mistake by white, if he plays well the game is over.  Go Proverb: Lose your first 100 games quickly.  Instead of tilting and windmills you may learn faster by simply resigning and starting your next game.]
;W[dh];B[gh];W[cg]TR[if][gj]C[alaric: Silly move by white, he's safely connected and has support everywhere, while black is eyeless and in a sea of white.  All white needs to do is cut of blacks breathing room.  Either J14 or G10 do that.]
;B[bg];W[dg];B[ig];W[hg]C[alaric: Bad by white.  You there isn't alot of eye space here, white just needs to squeeze so black can't get 2 eyes.  When white attacks like this he's actually creating eye space for black if black can capture the white stone.]
;B[hh];W[hf];B[he];W[if];B[ie];W[jg];B[ih];W[jf];B[hj];W[gj]
C[alaric: Bad again by white.  Don't touch what you want to kill.  F10 takes away the same eye space without contact.]
;B[ij];W[gi];B[hl];W[im];B[ik];W[jk];B[je];W[ke];B[jh];W[kh]
;B[jd];W[jc];B[kd];W[kc];B[lk]C[alaric: At this point you are just chasing bad stones with good ones.  Unless you see a way to capture a big section of white there just isn't any eye space in the center now.]

alaric: You mentioned at the start that you thought you did well in the opening but lost when you couldn't stay alive in the center.  In actuallity the game was mostly over before you started your center invasion.  In total you played a pretty good game, I didn't see much wrong there.  What you did wrong (and what cost you the game) was not recognizing early enough that this game was an influence game.  Go back and look at moves 24-29, this is where the game turned on you.  White makes 3 big influence plays in a row.  Two of these you responded with smallish defensive territory moves.  The final one you played influence, but I think because of white's position you couldn't take full effect of it.  

If you replay the first 20 moves you'll see that they are mostly big moyo moves.  You each allow the other to map out large stretches of territory broadly.  Also notice how many stones are played on the 4th line.  The 4th line is for influence the 3rd line is for territory.  Big moyo, and lots of 4th line action are both indicators of a heavy influence game.

Now go back to move 31.  At this point in the game white had a large center moyo.  The results of your move 31 were not good at all.  It let white seal off the center, and let white dig into your bottom right moyo.  In hindsight this was a very costly move and you needed a different way to punch a hole through into the center.

One last point about the center invasion.  It came way way too late in the game.  If you wanted a center invasion you have to have some threat of connecting, or cutting white.  Otherwise there simply isn't enough room.  You needed to use white weakness to play successive sente moves to map out enough territory to build eyes.  Because white had almost no weakness at this point you couldn't do that.  White actually played quite poorly in response to the invasion.  As is often the case with newer players, when they are invaded they look and all they see is their own weakness.  A gap in the line here, a cut location there, and some bad aji waiting over there.  What they should really be looking at is the invader.  He's one or two lone stones surrounded by your forces with little chance to live or escape.  Whites moves should be light, playing from a distance to cut black off from breathing room and letting him die because of lack of eye space.  Since your goal at this point should be to learn the game, not to win, it's better for you to simply resign, than to start a late invasion.  You can't learn very much with high risk attacks in every direction.  As you increase your rank the likelyhood of a big white mistake decreases and there's no use in this invasion at all.  Better to spend your time studying the game than playing out the final moves of a lost cause.

Other than that though I think you played tactically quite well.]
