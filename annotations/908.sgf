C[Hello. I am 30 kyu, and playing  black. I have been plaiyng for
about  a  week.  I have read Korschelt's  book, and quickly looked for
another.  I got  Learn to Play go Volume 2 (the  only book around, period) and
understand it  pretty well, although
application is another thing...

 I want to know how (if) I could  have killed this group...

Welcome to the world of Go.];B[dd];W[pp];B[pd];W[dp];B[dj]SQ[pn]
[np][fp][dn][qn][nq][fq][cn]C[This move is OK, but I would prefer an approach move on one of
white's corners.  Any of the spaces marked with squares would
work.];W[pj];B[oi]TR[jp][pm][qm][qn][nq][fq]SQ[oj][pl][ol][qj]
[pi]C[Hoping to make some kind of   reduction with a "shoulder  hit" move, and wanting to gain  influence
in the  middle...  Is this a  worthwhile move?

I don't think this is the best choice.  At this early stage,
this move doesn't put much pressure on White.  Any of the marked
squares is a reasonable response for white.  White could even
ignore this move and respond only if black plays here again.

I think that any of the triangles would be better for Black to
play.];W[jd];B[hd]TR[jq][jp]SQ[md]C[I thought I could trap him in with 7  helping if he ran.

A White play at the square should give enough room to make life
on the side.  Thus, White is not really in danger and doesn't
need to run.   Another good idea for Black would be to play at
one of the triangles instead of here.];W[jq];B[ld]C[Couldn't pass it up!

Now White will have to run.  But, the stone at k3 is worth a
lot, so this was probably a good trade-off for White.];W[ke]

(;B[kd]SQ[le]C[Not paying attention to  tiger's mouth.
Should I have?

The square is a better choice.  It keeps White away from your
upper right side.  The current stone just forces White to make
a strong connection between his stones.  White would like to
strongly connect his stones, but normally would not have time
while running.  With this move, Black forces White to do exactly
what he wants to anyway.

See the variation for an example of black gaining by chasing
white into the center.  Black doesn't have to kill to gain.  In fact, trying to kill this early in the game is generally a
bad idea.  It is possible to play a good quality, winning game
and never capture an opponent's stone.  The thrill of the hunt
can distract you from the big picture.];W[ie]C[And there it is.]
;B[jf]C[So I peeked.];W[jc];B[jb]SQ[lc][hc]C[I didn't want him going that way, and  that was the best I could
come up  with. What do you think?

First, don't Peep if you don't plan to cut.  If your opponent
doesn't connect and then you play elsewhere, your peep becomes
a wasted move.

Second, this is not the best way to block White.  Contact plays
are not the best way to enclose your opponent.  The best enclosures
are played a short distance away from your opponent's stones.
Here, either of the squares would serve to keep white from extending
along the top in that direction.  Unfortunatly, there is no way
to block white in both directions with one play.];W[je];B[lf]
SQ[le]C[Now I had him, on that side at least,  right?

Not really,  White can still push through here.  See the variation
starting next move for an example.  Playing at the square is
better for Black.]
(;W[hf]SQ[ff]C[Hmm, now what?

I would play at the square.  It would keep White out of the upper
left side and strengthen Black's hold on that area.  A move like
the square that does two jobs is usually better than a move that
does just one job.];B[gg]C[I don't know what I should have done  here. Not  this, apparently. I was at a  complete loss for response.

This is too close to block White well.  A diagonal move like
this still counts as a contact play.  As mentioned before, contact
plays are not the best way to block your opponent.

Contact plays tend to strengthen both sides.  Here, white is
weak and black is strong.  Thus, a contact fight will tend to
make White go from weak to strong while black just remains strong.
So, white benefits more from the contact play than black does.]
;W[gf]
(;B[if]SQ[hd]C[Trying to get more stones out  through threats.

Again, this just forces White to make a strong connection.  This
move also makes black's marked stone weaker.

see variation];W[he];B[ff]SQ[fd][df][le]C[Trying to stop his expansion. Should  I have prevented the tiger's
mouth  instead?

This is still a contact play.  Decide what you wish to defend
and play a move to block white from going there.  The squares
are all good defense moves for black.];W[gd]SQ[hd]C[There it is...

More importantly, white is taking advantage of the recently created
weakness in black's marked stone]
(;B[gc]SQ[hd]C[Here I was at a loss...

I think that the marked black stone is a lost cause now.  Black
can try to make some use of it by forcing white to completely
enclose it while black gets some territory near by.  See the
variation.];W[hc]C[But now I see what I missed. I knew I  had lost...]
;B[hb]C[Trying to control the top, gaining a  move by forcing a capture.

The capture gives white an eye at the captured stone's space.]
;W[id];B[hg]SQ[hb][gc]C[I realize he is going to have way too  many eyes, so I try containment.
I  didn't need this, did I?

The marked black stones are weak and need help.  White has more
than one way to move into the center, so blocking one doesn't
accomplish much.

Also, if you do decide to contain white, you need to prioritize.
Keeping white out of the center doesn't affect the score much.
Keeping white out of black's areas in the upper corners is much
more important.];W[gb]C[Ow];B[fc];W[ib]C[Even Worse!];B[ha]
SQ[hb]C[The marked stone can't be saved.  This move is a wasted effort.]
;W[ia]SQ[cn][qn][qm][fq][nq]C[I resigned, so I could try  and figure  this one out. I can see where several  decisive moves
where, but I  am  missing what I should be doing...
Could I have killed this group with  better playing?

No, you could not.  The original stone was placed during the
opening when there was still a lot of room for both sides to
expand.  Black started trying to play middle game "attack and
kill" too soon.  Black's goal should have been to drive white
into the center while strengthening black's hold of the upper
left and right sides at the same time.

This is a loss due more to poor strategy than to poor play.  Black got too caught up in trying to kill one group and lost
sight of the overall game.  All of the squares are moves worth
a lot of points for black.  Any one of them is worth more than
most of the moves black played trying to kill the top white group.
So, at many points along the way, Black would have been better
off ignoring white's group at the top and playing elsewhere.
Always look at the whole board for the best move, not just a
few spaces around you opponent's last play.])

[ea][eb][ec][dc][db][da]C[White gained four points, two for the stones captured and two
for the resulting space.  Black, meanwhile, has secured the upper
left corner and side.  This is a gain of around 7 points, since
the marked spaces are now black territory and they were not secure
before this exchange.

Black has turned a loss into a sacrifice that gained points.]

square would create a ladder for the Black stone just about the
square.  The ladder is bad for White, however, because of the
black stone at d10.]))

;B[lf];W[kf];B[jf];W[jg];B[he];W[kk];B[pi]C[White can probably make eyes in the center or connect with the
stones at the bottom.  There is very little white territory here,
however.  White can perhaps get 7 points in the center and 1
or 2 on the top.  Black has around 90 points of almost secure
territory between the two huge top corners.  Even if White does
two successful 3-3 point invasions, black will still have gained
a lot more than white.];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[cf]
