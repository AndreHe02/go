truesaint: Hi...:)

This is the second game I'm submitting to the GTL. As before, I'm going to try writing down my thoughts as I remembered it, please do not hesitate to criticize or correct my line of thinking.

Thank you very much in advance.];B[pd]C[Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game for the GTL.

It took me quite some time to figure out where you're going wrong, since you yourself spotted a number of your tactical mistakes in the fights after the fact.  But then it hit me -- I think your biggest mistake is *strategic*.  You seem to be looking to fight in situations where fighting is not particularly necessary.

The attacks in the top right corner (R17), the H17 attack, and worrying too much about what White could get in the lower right, are I believe good examples of this.

Having said that, I should add that *all* of us amateurs have similar conceptual errors in our games.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cn]C[truesaint: The same position happened during my first GTL-reviewed game, with me playing white. The reviewer said that this is a very common move, so I'm trying it out...:)]
;W[co];B[dk]C[truesaint:
to be honest, i don't really know how to proceed. I was thinking of doing C14 (an 'approach' move?), and THEN D9 or D10, but I guess I'm too scared to have my opponent play a pincer. (for example, Black C14, White D10).

Ted: Stronger players have told me here that the standard move here is at D6.  After that, the idea is to extend out to something like C9 or C10.]
;W[gp];B[cf]C[truesaint: continuing with the plan, although that G4 looks like problem... I'm expecting white to respond in the A19 corner, so I'll play H3 next.

Ted: I think this move is extending too far from D9.  If White wants to fight, White could attack at C12 or D12, with the intention of playing under the D9 stone.]
;W[fd]C[truesaint: unexpected move. I was really tempted to go with C16 or C17, but it might be too early to start a fight, so i decided to ignore it for a while.

Ted: White's move looks perfectly good to me.  What were you expecting White to do here that this was a surprise to you?

The point I'm trying to make is that it's a good idea to think of how your opponent will respond to your moves -- although I'll admit I face a lot of unexpected moves myself.]
;B[iq];W[hq];B[lp]C[truesaint: i was quite happy with this, since IF white chose to defend A19 now, I can concentrate on the upper right corner.

Ted: You're also opening yourself up to weakness if you let White play at J2.]
;W[nc]C[truesaint: EEEK...:)

Ted: You weren't surprised by this, were you?  Remember the adage, "Your opponent's best move is your best move".]
;B[lc]C[truesaint: a pincer? I don't know which is better: M17, or somewhere around R13.

Ted: I think it's a matter of personal preference here.  A move like R13 or R14 would be good for getting some territory in the top right, as well as making it a bit more difficult for White to attack on the right side.  M17 attacks the O17 stone directly, while making it more difficult for White to get as much territory at the top.]
;W[jc]C[truesaint:
Black seems to be in trouble because suddenly white looks very strong on the upper side.

Ted: For some reason, I don't like White's last move.];B[me]
;W[pc];B[qc]C[truesaint: black is starting a fight ? :p

Ted: I don't think you need to fight here.  Play a safe move like R16, and let White get a small amount of territory in the corner.  At the same time, you'll be setting yourself up to be much stronger on the right side.]
;W[qb];B[oc]C[truesaint: looking back, this move looks bad... I suppose the idea was White Q18, Black P18, trying to separate the two white groups.]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[pa]C[truesaint:];B[pc]C[truesaint:

I spent some time thinking about this, and it does look good for black before this move. BUT I don't like ko (yet...:), so i'm closing it off.]
;W[mb]
(;B[pg]C[truesaint:
should black attacked white instead at this point? Please see variant.

Ted: I think Black should have attacked with M18 instead of your suggested atari at S18.  You were expecting White to defend the R18 stone, which White should have sacrificed.  If White can play M18, White will connect to the K17 stone.]
;W[lb]C[truesaint:
Apparently white sees the threat. Should have played there first...:)]
;B[nd];W[mc];B[ld];W[qq]LB[qp:A][pq:B]C[truesaint:
I really really hate it when people pull a 3-3 on me...:)
 point I don't really want to go into memorizing joseki yet. Please advise.

Ted: The obvious answer is at one of the 4-3 points (marked A and B).  In this case, I think playing at R4 is better, since the resulting wall would work better with your group at the top.  Playing at Q3 leaves you with a wall that is facing the wrong way from the upper group.]
;B[pq]C[truesaint: The other alternative was blocking at R4. I probably got confused here... Looking back, it seems that R4 is a lot better than Q3.]
;W[qp]
(;B[qr]C[truesaint: should have played R5 first here, i suppose...:(

Ted: Again, don't be afraid to let White get a small life in the corner while you get good thickness on the outside.]
;W[rr]
(;B[pr]C[truesaint:

i know that i should have played R5 again at this point, but i was afraid of the cut at Q2. See variant.]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[ro];B[po]C[truesaint: I was feeling very bad during the last several moves because i can't see where i'm going.... This one, although i like the wall, gives white a lot of opening on the side.]
;W[qk];B[qi]C[truesaint: I'm wondering if this is the right response on my part. This is basically just trying to block white from expanding to the upper right corner.

Ted: I don't like having to play moves like this myself, but I think this time it's necessary.  Note that all this happened because you played the wrong hane at R2 instead of R5.]
;W[rj];B[ri]C[truesaint: have no other choice, but i really don't like the territory white has now.]
;W[si];B[sh];W[sj];B[rh]C[truesaint: white managed to bite off a big chunk of territory due to my sloppy handling of that one 3-3 move.

At this point, it seems that I'm having psychological problem with 3-3 invasion, so maybe I should take 3-3 first instead of 4-4 on my fuseki? Please advise.

Ted: 4-4 is fine, although I disproportionately see fusekis with one 4-4 stone and one 4-3 stone.  Starting with 3-3 is too small.]
;W[ce]
(;B[hc]C[truesaint: last chance before white solidifies....

Ted: I think you could have played R10 first; White has to respond to avoid losing the three stones.]
;W[gc];B[hd];W[je];B[kg];W[he]C[truesaint: did not see this coming...]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[ie]C[truesaint: the whole point of this move is to try to save the two stones at H17. But]
;W[hf];B[if];W[ff]C[truesaint: textbook net...]
(;B[gf]C[truesaint: for the life of me i cannot remember why i made this move. Should have just connected at J16, and sacrifice the G15 stone.]
;W[hg];B[gg];W[hh];B[gh]C[truesaint: i don't know whether this is good or bad, just playing along, now that i have practically thrown away the H17 group.]
;W[id];B[ib]C[truesaint: the only move i can see that could save the two stones at H17. The plan was to buy enough time (and possibly threatening atari at J17 if white ignores this) to do a hane at H11.

I think H11 could kill the white group, but the two stones at H17 need more liberty first.]
;W[ic];B[hb]C[truesaint:

4 liberties, should be enough...];W[jb]C[truesaint: ok, three...:)]
;B[hi]C[truesaint : three versus two, capturing race?

The truth is that i completely forgot that the J14 stones ONLY HAVE TWO liberties, somehow i thought that it was safe due to L13...:(]
;W[ih]
(;B[jf];W[ii];B[hj];W[gb];B[ga]C[truesaint: stupid move, trying to buy some time for the H18 group.]

I was thinking that I can kill this 'open triangle' group at N10.]
;B[ml];W[nk];B[ok];W[nl];B[pk];W[pl]
(;B[ll]C[truesaint: hehe... didn't work...:)

What do you think of R8 ?

Ted: I think both of your proposed variations have mistakes in them that you didn't notice.]
;W[nn]C[truesaint: : too late for R8 now...:)];B[no];W[ir];B[jr]
C[truesaint: stupid move, in retrospect.

The instinct was to defend the territory. But this K2 stones is very weak. Costs me around 5 points...:(

Ted: It's better to play K3 first.];W[jq];B[ip];W[kr];B[in]

;B[do];W[cp];B[bn];W[bo];B[ao];W[ap];B[an]C[truesaint: somehow the E7 stones are dead...:)

I was quite happy about this since i thought it's a fair trade between black's left side and white's lower left corner.]

This is not much different from my last GTL-reviewed game, in the sense that i'm still having trouble to secure territory in the corners. Most of the left side territory is plain luck because white is trying to save the four stones at H6.

GTL reviewer, thank you for taking the time to review my game.]
