Prodigious [24k?\]: Handicap is teh funniness. :P

Krinid:
With ranks so high (in the 20's), I'm not sure such a large handicap is appropriate.

Krinid:
Hi there - I'm about a 14 kyu player, and I've review your game, adding "Krinid:" for all my comments.  If you have any questions, send me an email krinid@yahoo.com

This game was primarily decided by white's mistakes.

I wrote this tips at the end as well:
Some tips for better GO playing:
1) study some common joseki
2) always play where the biggest points are to be made; in general, this is where there is open space; sometimes you do need to answer a move that was just made, but only when the penalty (in number of points - although this is sometimes hard to evaluate) of not answering it is greater than the gain of playing somewhere else
3) continually evaluate whether your groups are alive or not - with each move, the life and death status of groups changes]
;W[qc]C[zepherin [29k?\]: you could have changed it
Prodigious [24k?\]: Probably.
zepherin [29k?\]: I wouldn't have objected];B[pc]C[Prodigious [24k?\]: Thought that there wasn't a handicap, oh well. :P]

(;W[pb]C[zepherin [29k?\]: it defaults in a handicap
zepherin [29k?\]: when you join

Krinid:
The standard response is to play in the open direction, not the direction he blocked you in.  By playing Q18, he follows with P18, and you have to follow with R18, giving away the sente  (initiative) you now hold, with which he could play R16 and really reduce your territory in the corner.  Try not to make moves which give away sente.  Especially in the beginning, there are a lot of big point moves open, and giving away sente means you're giving away the option to take those big points.]
;B[ob];W[qb]C[Krinid:
As mentioned already, you have to defend at R18, giving away sente.]

(;B[qf];W[qd];B[pj];W[jp];B[ip];W[iq]C[Krinid:
This is kind of a strange move.  Black didn't respond properly to take advantage of it, so you got the bottom side here, but could have made better moves to take a lot of territory on either the left or the right, depending on which side you attack.  See the variations.]

;B[fq];W[gr];B[fr];W[fs]SQ[dr]C[Krinid:
This is a big mistake.  D2 is vulnerable.  I assume you're trying to stop black from reaching the side, but you've left a huge vulnerability open, although black never exploited it.]

[ck][pm][jo][ko][qq]C[Sparx:
This is a small play.  It only gets you about 4 points, so you should leave this for later in the game.  In general, you want to play BIG moves in the beginning.  For example, the 3-3 moves are BIG - they gain a corner, about 20-30+ points.  R3 is still open, you in essence, you've played the 4 points B4 move where you could have played a much higher value R3 move.  The marked squares show some other bigger point moves.  You should always play the biggest point moves.]

Don't bother blocking - you're group is safe.  Instead, play some bigger point moves like C14.  See variation.]
;B[cf];W[bf];B[qp]C[Krinid:
This is questionable whether black should play tenuki here with the top left corner in mid-fight.  On the other hand, he has reasonably secured the bottom right corner now.  However, if he waited a few moves, the top left wouldn't be so defenseless.]
;W[ce]C[Krinid:
White takes advantage of black's inappropriate tenuki here.]

(;W[np];B[no];W[op]C[Krinid:
O4 and P4 are not good plays - the group is already alive, and these plays get you little territory (1 point) and allow black to seal off the door to the center and give away sente allowing black to play H17, a much bigger move.  Play wherever the most points are available; play where there is empty space - H17 is a good candidate for that right now.]

C[Krinid:
The very silly and unnecessary T14 group mistake and the T3 group mistake cost white about 25+ points alone.  With those outright mistakes gone and a couple better plays, this could have been a win for white.

Some tips for better GO playing:
1) study some common joseki
2) always play where the biggest points are to be made; in general, this is where there is open space; sometimes you do need to answer a move that was just made, but only when the penalty (in number of points - although this is sometimes hard to evaluate) of not answering it is greater than the gain of playing somewhere else
