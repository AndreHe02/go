C[Tuomas: Hello, I am Tuomas, 6 kyu from Finland. I am not a book learner and some people say that my style is agressive. I think I am at my best at running fights. In KGS I use account 'opt'. I play by Japanese rules so my end game rules are pretty messed up in this game. You need to take some of my comments with grain of salt.]
;B[dc];W[qd];B[dp];W[pq];B[cf];W[fq];B[cn];W[cj]LB[cg:1][cm:2]
[jp:A][dr:B]TR[cf][cn]C[Tuomas: I don't like this. Usually this kind of stones are played only when white can settle it easily. Usually that mean that white can make two scape extensions to '1' or '2' so that if black blocks one, white can play the other. 

With one of the marked stones this would look like invasion and now with both this looks most like too deep reduction. You don't want that your stones look like invasions or reductions at move 10. Future of this stone is that it will be weak group that will bring lot of grief for white.

And to add to the insult, black should not even respond to this. If he lets it lie there and get weaker and weaker while game proceeds he will get a good result.

Instead of playing this white should complete joseki at bottom left corner either by playing somewhere near 'A' or 'B'. Playing at 'A' would complete Kobayashi fuseki that is one of my regular tactics.]
;B[hp];W[hq]LB[fo:1]TR[cj][hp]C[Tuomas: Here the worst thing that can happen for white is that black strength towards the weak stone. If white would jump here to '1' white would build connection towards the weak stone, and he would cut the single black stone from the corner.]
;B[iq];W[gr]LB[ip:2][hr:1]C[Tuomas: This is too clever, just play simple. Playing at '1' would make white quite strong and the cut at '2' would become great move. When black fixes that white can jup towards center and cut black from corner.]

(;B[ir]LB[fo:2][ip:1][dr:3]C[Tuomas: This is agressive, it destroys white shape but leaves terrible cut. It would be ok for black to connect the cut at '1' first. After that white should jump towards center with '2' and then black can close the corner with '3'. 

See variation for this black.];W[qj]LB[qk:A][ql:4][qo:2][mq:3]
[dr:1]TR[cj][fq][hq][pq][gr]C[Tuomas: White cant afford to play away from bottom left corner. If black closes the corner with '1' white will be in terrible situation because he has two weak groups close to each other.

The stone white played is also too far from the marked stone at corner. When black approaches at '2' white will likely play somewhere around '3'. Because white has stone too far from corner, black can play two space extension at '4'. That is why this white should be at 'A', to prevent two space extension.]
;B[po];W[qo]LB[np:2][mq:1]C[Tuomas: When you touch opponent stone, it becomes stronger. White should play '1' or '2' to attack two black groups with single stone. Black would have to decide which one to defend, and white can then attack the other.]
;B[qn];W[qp];B[nq]LB[pn:2][ip:1][op:3]C[Tuomas: Black plays lightly. He leaves lot of cutting points but makes nice and flexible shape. Playing like this is difficult but can give good results sometimes. Outcome of this game will depend lot on these three cuts.

I don't think white should continue in bottom right corner. He should make something for the bottom left corner, or play big moves at upper side.]

(;W[nc]LB[ic:1][kc:2]C[Tuomas: Playing here allows black to make huge extensions around '1'. To prevent that white should propably play at '2'. See from variation one possible sequence.]
;B[jd]LB[dc:1][qd:2][cj:A][pn:B][fq:3]C[Tuomas: Now lets look at the overall situation. First black and white have almost symmetrical frameworks at '1' and '2'. The weak white stone at 'A'  makes black framework difficult to invade, but the cut at 'B' makes also white framework a hard target. 

The upper left is quite normal situation, but the right side is very interesting and challenging because the light shape black has around 'B'. Those three black stones have weak but extremely flexible shape that would be challenging to every kuy player.

This all would promice a great game, but the beautifull setup is broken by the terrible white group around '3'. Don't ever make that kind a group again! 

Before continuing from here go back and read this review from start to see how we got into this position.]
;W[kc];B[jc]C[Tuomas: This is bad exchange for white. Black framework just got a lot stronger.]
;W[ee]TR[cj][fq][hq][gr]C[Tuomas: White is suicidal. Now white has three weak groups close to each other and losing one is close to losing the game. Black should keep white split, play calm and then kill one of these groups.]
;B[de];W[ef];B[ch];W[dh]
(;B[dg]C[Tuomas: Pushing C11 would give white hard time. Black would be then stronger when he starts to cut. White would be in serious trouble. See variation for this stone.]
;W[eh];B[eg];W[fg];B[fh];W[fi];B[gh];W[df];B[cg];W[di]C[Tuomas: White shapes are terrible, but he was so weak when this fight started that it is almost impossible for him to make good shapes. This is terrible fight for white but losing it is losing the game.]
;B[ff]LB[ed:1][gg:2]C[Tuomas: This black has a fundamental flaw. It is split from other black groups. Black should try '1' or '2' for example. Now black has to defend this stone sooner or later.]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[ed];B[bc];W[ce];B[ad]
;W[ec];B[eb]LB[db:1]C[Tuomas: This is bad mistake that can allow white to live. Black should play '1'. See a ko-variation that can turn the game upside down if it gets out of hands (I only put the simpe and safe variation there).]

(;W[fb];B[ea];W[fa];B[cb];W[gc];B[fd]C[Tuomas: Another black mistake. After this white is almost alive.]
;W[fe];B[gg];W[gd];B[ge]LB[hb:1][he:2]C[Tuomas: White lives with '1' but if black takes it white can run out by playing somewhere around '2'. Black has lost this fight and now he has to defend the two weak stones. This will take a lot of steam away from his attack to other two weak groups.

White didn't make mistakes here and was he able to punish black from twice.]
;W[he];B[gf];W[hb]TR[jc][jd]C[Tuomas: Ok, white lives with one group. Two more to go. And black got his first weak group.]
;B[de];W[fc]C[Tuomas: Pointless exchange for black, he lost one ko-threat.]
;B[jf]C[Tuomas: Black has to defend these stones.];W[lf]TR[jc]
[jd][jf]C[Tuomas: White tries to make his framework larger, but building frameworks like this is too slow. Walls around frameworks should always be made as byproducts of something other. White could try to cut the marked stones. If he can pull that off then the game gets completely new turn.]
;B[ii]C[Tuomas: Great move, black helps his weak group and sets up an attack against two weak white groups.]
;W[gi];B[hi]LB[ig:1]C[Tuomas: Black should fix the connection for good with '1'. After playing this he wouldn't have to defend any more and white would be in serious trouble.]
;W[ej]LB[em:3][fo:1][dr:2]C[Tuomas: This makes eye for white but I think it might be too slow. Black '1' would be nasty. White would have to live first in the corner and then in the center. If black thinks he cant kill the center, then he could play first '2' and then somewhere around '3'. This way he will get some territory while going for the kill.]
;B[cl];W[gk];B[ik];W[dl];B[ck];W[dk];B[ci];W[ek]LB[gm:1]C[Tuomas: Extending the group towards the bottom group would be better. White could play at '' for example. After that white bottom group can either connect to center or invade the corner.

Anyway, second white group lives. Only one to go and that is the easy one.]
;B[dm];W[dq];B[cq];W[dr];B[cr];W[ep];B[eo];W[fp]LB[do:1]C[Tuomas: Make the shape with F5. Playing atari with '1' is aji-keshi but can help in living.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[en];W[fn]LB[pf:A][fm:1][gn:2][lp:B]C[Tuomas: Watch what you are doing! You are killing your group at center!

How about little life and death problem: white to live at bottom left. And no, I wont give you the answer. And if you really want to push out then this gives black too nice shape when he plays at '1'. Try '2' instead.

Anyway, after solving the LD problem white has been able to live with every one of those weak groups. Impressive. Here white was clearly stronger than black.

Black has more territory, and both have nice frameworks remaining (A and B). To win  the game from this point, white has to hold his framework and reduce the black one.]
;B[fm];W[gm];B[fl];W[gl]C[Tuomas: Well here is nice little life and death problem. Lets make some variations... I think white bottom group is likely to die. It can run to center but have so bad shape that it is unlikely to get eyes.

White mistake was to push black towards his center group. When black cuts white has to live with two groups. Classical splitter attack. Just playing the vital point and living with the bottom group would have been ok.]

(;B[im];W[fk]C[Tuomas: White lives.];B[qm]LB[on:1][rn:2]TR[po]
[nq]C[Tuomas: This corner is getting big, and it is the key for black for reducing the white framework in upper right corner. But black should play '1' to connect the marked stones and block white from pushing between those.

If white starts to crawl on second line with '2' black will be happy to make the wall towards center.]
;W[nh]LB[qg:2][oj:1]C[Tuomas: My first idea would be to play at '1'. One possibility would even be to play at '2' to remove a bad fight from there.]
;B[rk];W[em]LB[ri:3][bp:2][cp:1]C[Tuomas: This is tiny, black should ignore it and push to white upper side. If white continues with '1' for example black will just defend with '2'.  Black '3' is big.]
;B[el];W[em];B[dn]LB[cp:1]C[Tuomas: Fix for good with '1'.]
;W[kl]LB[rj:3][nk:1][op:2]C[Tuomas: This goes too deep. This servers only one purpose: destroying black territory. White should try to find a move that destroys black territory and makes white. Perhaps '1'. White should also aim to play '2' and '3' as soon as possible. They are huge.]
;B[jl];W[kh];B[jh];W[nl];B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[lh]LB[rj:1][nn:3]
[op:2]C[Tuomas: This is small, '1', '2' or '3' or something like that.]
;B[li];W[mj];B[mi];W[ni];B[mh];W[mg];B[rj];W[qh]C[Tuomas: Black forces white to defent the corner.]

C[Tuomas: This negates the white attack at '1'.];W[ln]LB[kl:1]
C[Tuomas: This is ok as long as white is willing to sacrifice '1'.]
;B[km];W[ll]LB[mm:1]C[Tuomas: Just play '1' and connect the more valuable stone.]
;B[lm];W[mm];B[mn]LB[kl:1][ln:2]C[Tuomas: Black got way too good result, white should have given up stone at '1' and connect the '2' to his group. This was huge loss for white, losing moves.]
;W[ko]LB[op:1]C[Tuomas: Nothing left here unless you can find some aji around '1'.]

;B[kq];W[ls];B[ns]LB[qr:1]C[Tuomas: This white attack was pointless and it has placed his corner in fatal position. How to defend against black '1' for example?]
;W[oo];B[on];W[pp];B[op]LB[pn:1]C[Tuomas: Connect with '1'.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[po];B[jo];W[no]C[Tuomas: Getting cut like this is never good. Now white corner should be alive again.]

;W[ha]C[Tuomas: It is soon time for end game. Black has the lead in points and advantage in end game. Score estimation is currently about 16.5 for black.

I put one end-game sequence for black as variation. First play moves that are sente, then when you have to give up the initiative, play reverse sente or biggest gote. Afther the sequence in the variation score estimation is 24.5 for black.]

(;B[id]C[Tuomas: Bad move that allows white to start his end game.]
;W[hd];B[hf]C[Tuomas: White end game sequence starts here, white starts with some good moves.]

;B[ig];W[bj]C[Tuomas: Huge.];B[bk];W[bi];B[bh]C[Tuomas: Here I think white makes wrong choise. White should try to attack the black bottom left corner. Check the variation for white. Game will be almost even after the variation (black leads with 0.5 points in score estimation).]

;B[ps];W[kk];B[jk];W[ml]LB[bm:3][cp:2][cs:1]C[Tuomas: The black bottom left group has three weak points. You should throw stone at '2', if nothing else it will make '1' a lot larger end game move.]

Game became close when white was able to live with his groups. After that it was just competition between white corner and black side frameworks.]
