C[Hello reviwer, and thank you so much for reviewing my game.
I would like a quick review of this game.
I played a few times on 9*9 and decided that i didn't like to play at the center. I feel safer having a (false?) feeling of safety.

If you could comment on mistakes from both black and white. What moves could have i taken advantage of?
I added one or two variation. Are they correct? Or did i not see better moves?]

Thank you for your review!!!
And one day hopefully, i will review one of your game!!! (in my dreams...)

Both palyers made may mistakes - 
I recommend reading a good book on life and death (like "Life and Death" from the elementary Go series )]
)
(;B[ed]LB[hh:A]C[Could i have played this and try to kill the lower right group like i did in the variation?

Clearly white's group is weak and he should just defend it at A]
;W[ei];B[di];W[fi];B[dg];W[tt]LB[ab:B][ig:A]C[I made white pass, but if he doesn't play in his territory (lower right)
      *Can i kill  the lower right group like in the variation?
      * Can i kill the upper left group?

Upper left group cannot ne killed - but you could make a seki in sente and take away white's territory - see variation]

(;B[ab]C[I tried to kill the upper left group in this variation but all i could do was a seki.

You played the wrong move  see variations white could have lived with territory

But he played the wrong move too and in the end should have died!]

(;W[ba];B[bb]C[But then Can white kill my lower left group?
(i could do a seki)

not relevant - you can kill the white upper left group first]
