LoP: I think both of you played a reasonable fuseki there are no really strange moves in the beginning. The exchange on the top was totally uncalled for and leads to a bad result for white. 
I think that in the course of the game both players should have paid more attention to the weak white group in the right resulting from that exchange. There were 1 point gote endgame moves played before white made life with that group.
In the middle game white played the empty triangle 2 times this was the main reason for his loss.
In the endgame both played a few small moves too early. You should try to gain more in the endgame by playing sente moves first.]

(;W[op]LB[pj:C][pm:B][cn:A]C[LoP: I don't think that it is a good idea to approach here without any support on the right side. In my pro game database (~15000 games) there is not a single game where white played that approach so early. The reason for this is that this move is exactly what black wants. Black can put pressure on that stone and in the course of the attack establish a moyo extending from D4 and at the same time build territory on the right side. The usual moves for white in this situation are A, B or C.]

at the beginning, it seems that black has a good shape and very strong influence. but at the end, most of the potential territories are lost. i read the game again but cannot find out why.

thank you for your comments.
