C[Hello,

I will try to give some insight to this game, though I'm not so far away (as far as rating is concerned) from the 2 players.

Hope this will help anyway.];B[pe];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[see comment next move]
;W[pc]TR[qk]MA[pn][qn][qo]C[I'm not familiar with the fuseki, but so far, I would have played this way with White.

One reason why I'm have never seen this fuseki is : it does not exist !

I was curious about this posittion, so i searched Gobase. And it does not appear in pro play.

The point is : the marked black stone seem to be misplaced.
It is usually played at the marked places (including Q17).

My interpretation of this is that if they needed to cope with the side, after the White invasion at Q17, R9 would feel overconcentrated with the resulting strength around Q15.]

You are bumping your head into opponent stone. This cannot be good.]
;B[od];W[ob];B[nb];W[pb]
(;B[mc]C[black could have been more consistent with its side strategy ...]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[pf];B[oe];W[qg]C[I would have played from under. (S14)

This does not seem to be consistent with the Q14 stone !

you have now 2 stones in black territorry. If you want to save them, it may reveal costly ...]
;B[rf];W[re];B[rg];W[pg]MA[rc][rd]C[I'm not sure I like the weakness at S17/S16.]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[ri];W[ph];B[qi];W[po]MA[dj][fc]C[Hmmm

You are creating a second week group within B sphere of influence.

I call this jealousy.

It is often a cause of doom ...


You have big plays at D10 and F17 (counter B influence)];B[pm]
C[of course];W[mp]MA[no]C[too far, I think.
Joseki is at O5];B[nq]C[Black is helping you here.
He may have cut at O5.];W[np]C[good];B[op];W[oo];B[mq];W[lp]
;B[kq];W[dj]C[Of course, this is big, but not urgent anymore.

The white bottom goup needs some shape fixing.]
(;B[fc]C[Black is very kind.];W[df];B[fe];W[db]C[good (locally), but the bottom weakness remains]
;B[nm];W[mn]C[good sape, but B was kind enough not to play O6]
;B[mm];W[lm];B[kp]C[wrong side - should be M8];W[ko];B[jo]
(;W[kn]C[The moyo fontier is an important concept.
compare W playing M8 (var) with Black playing there.];B[fq]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[cn];B[mi]C[wrong gain. N13 is the spot];W[mg]
;B[kf];W[lh];B[eg]C[B is playing fairly nicely here.
By trying to defend his stones, W will bring opportunities to Black.]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[fg]C[positive and courageaous.
But the fight will be hard, since the White support is faint in the middle]
;B[eh];W[gg];B[ej];W[di];B[dk];W[ei];B[fj];W[gi]C[good. Now you have almost linked your stones by "capturing the cutting stone" (go proverb).

Again, B helped you a lot in letting link your stones. He was not consistent when cutting and not saving the cutting stone.]

;W[qq]C[kester: not as good a ko threat as I thought

Much bigger than the ko - the ko is 12 point ...

Compare with a situation when B plays at R4];B[ih];W[kg]C[too small !
4 point gote.];B[qr];W[qp];B[qn];W[pr]
(;B[or]C[again, black is nice]
(;W[pp]C[no, you are missing the point here.
We are in the yose.

(;W[pa];B[rc]C[kester: if there is a way for white to save this corner I cannot see it - seems I should have played this move myself some time ago (next few moves not great either)

I have just left behind the variations I explored]

C[kester: I resigned

Yes, even if you survive here, the game being equal (67 points each +- 3), you will lose on a remaining ko threat



What I can say is :

Be carefull wth your weak groups.

While black was farly soft on them, it may have revealed much more harmful with a player who plays more aggressively.

Overall, you did not make big blunders, but you need to be a little bit more consistent with your ideas.

The point is : when you start a pattern or an attack, play it until the shapes are stabilised, so that there is no relevant attack on them.
This is worth for the 2 right groups in the beginning.

Also, n the yose, you could have been more efficient. i pointed the main ideas.

Hope this helped.
