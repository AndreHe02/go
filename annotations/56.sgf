C[Keep in mind that I am only 20K* IGS, so the go advice here is only 20K* advice.]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[pq];W[pd]C[

Good   some opening guide lines

"corners first, sides next, middle last."



I FIRST CLASS MOVES
the first four moves should be in each empty corner.

II 2ND CLASS MOVES
after the corners are filled

play approach moves against 3-4,3-5, or 4-5 stones
(not against 3-3 or 4-4 point -
3-3 stones have sealed the corner in 1 move, 4-4 stones require 2 moves to close the corner)

or play a big point on the side
if it is good for both competing corners

or play a standard pattern/joseki move you are sure of.

or play a 2-3 space extension if it gives you a base and creates a weakness in your opponent

III THIRD CLASS MOVES
then play
Approach and or enclose a 3-3 or 4-4 point
or a 2nd move to approach or enclose a corner.

IV. FOURTH CLASS MOVES
A regualr 2-3 space extension on the side.


"Try to keep a balance between 3rd and 4th line stones."]
(;B[ck]C[
Not bad,
maybe
enclosing the corner at R5 or approaching at C14 would be better]
;W[jd]C[good   "make a san-ren-sei (3 starpoints in a row) at the first opportunity"]
;B[qk]
(;W[pg]C[not bad

a move around K4 looks bigger, or an apprach move in the lower right corner looks big.]
;B[ce]C[bad,this is an attacking move...It makes white stronger... C14 is a much better approach move, white can respond at c16 or d15 and be ahead in liberties

NEVER PLAY CONTACT MOVES, or moves that are 1 space away unless you are tring to start a fight.

The stone that is contacted gets stronger.

It is ok to play contact moves against stones that are already strong in order to settle your weak stones.]

(;W[og]C[White should have responded to c15];B[hp]C[Again, black should have played another stone near c15

In any case, black looks ahead here.];W[fd]C[Ok, but D15 probably should have been played first, then G17...]
;B[cc]C[strange looking but not bad]
(;W[dc]C[play C16 first then D17];B[db];W[de]
(;B[oj]C[not too bad, but e18 would give black life and gut whites upper left hand territory,]
;W[mh];B[rf]C[A little risky, plus a move on the 2nd line before the end game is usually not so good.]
;W[rg]C[a contact move makes black stronger]
(;B[qd]C[Risky, but better invading stones often,  make lots of contact moves to settle the situation. but the 3-3 point looks better.


Try to visualize your first two moves of your invasion before playing inside your opponents territory.

"play away from thickness"

don't play where your opponent is strong when you have big east/safe points on the board.

Q:Why is black invading when he/she has a huge moyo mapped out.
Black should strengthen the moyo (framework of potential territory) and force white to invade.]
;W[qc];B[nd]C[Too  easy on white


this looks like black chikening out. Black should cross cut or try to do something with the first two stones in the invasion.]
;W[qe]C[Now all the invading stones look separated and weak.]
;B[kc]C[good.];W[rd];B[jc]C[good];W[cg];B[be];W[ci];B[ej]C[Black is a still little weak in the upper left corner

31 is not bad but, close the corner  at R5 is still huge, and playing m3 is also large.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[mj]C[white should cut black, white is allowing black to walk into their territory]
;B[nl];W[mp]C[Huge move! this should have been played back int the opening]
;B[ll]C[Black MUST respond to the invasion, giving white two moves in a row in the invasion is disaterous.]

(;W[ml];B[mm];W[mk];B[ln];W[jk]C[Again white should be playing a 2nd move in the invasion, He is only hurting his invading stone with this sequence]
;B[eh];W[di]C[This is large also, white must respond here];B[fj]
;W[hj];B[gl];W[hg];B[kp]C[Good, Look how big it would have been if white played near K3 before this move.]

(;W[mq]C[White is really heavy and ready to be attacked white should maybe attached to stronger stones]
;B[nm];W[po]C[
Good!
Now white has surronded the corner 3 to 1,  If white can take the corner,this makes all of blacks stones- on the righ side looked squeezed]
;B[no]C[P4 looks better];W[op]C[Now white looks very strong, the corner stone must defend itself]
;B[oo];W[oq]C[now the black stone and the corner look almost captured]

(;B[pp]C[poor move,R5 looks better];W[qo];B[or];W[qq];B[im]
C[Maybe R1 is better.  White definitely has the advatage in the fight, but
Black is just giving up the corner.
Even if black can make a Ko this is really big];W[eg];B[fg]

(;W[ff]C[not so great, white should block a little fartherback]
;B[ef];W[dg];B[gf];W[fe];B[gg]C[Again black should strenthen his framework C6 looks huge. E18 is still very large. If black wants to reduce white's territory then  almost any move on the top side looks huge.]

C[notice how as white is getting settled black is getting weaker]
;W[lb];B[fb]C[White's territory is gutted, E18 looks alot safer for black.
The following life and death problem is pretty difficult.];W[cd]

(;B[bd]C[but black still must live-this is really tricky, #93 looks like a terrible move]
;W[cb];B[bb]C[Now it would be very difficut for black to live]

white should invade the lower left
---

look what happens if white invades at the 3-3 point];W[ni];B[cp]
C[Another late opening move played late in the game! This is worth 20-30 points

White can no longer easily invade at the 3-3 point, living with about 10 points of territory]
