AB[pd][pp][dp]C[Llywelyn: Thank you for reviewing my game. I lost this game by 30.5 points, and while there were some things I know I could have done differently, I only got that many points because he failed to stop me from penetrating into a large moyo, but still gave him far too much on the left side.]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[ch];B[ef]C[REV: According to Kogo's joseki dictionary, this is not recommended.
Black should actually jump into the corner at the 3-3 point.]
;W[fd];B[cj]C[REV: Apparently, this move should have been at D11.]
;W[eh]LB[ce:A]C[REV: This move might have been better at C15 (A).]
;B[gf];W[he]LB[ce:A][nc:B]C[REV: You don't have much of a threat against the three black stones, so this
move seems a bit high.  Maybe still C15 (A), or possibly O17 (B).]
;B[gh];W[cn]LB[cj:A][dk:B]C[REV:  With this move, you're making it easy for black to pincer you, with
support.  Maybe you should rather attack the black stone at C10 (A) first,
maybe by playing D9 (B) to build up some thickness before you approach the
corner.];B[cl];W[cq]C[REV: This is the correct response.];B[cp]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fq];B[eq]C[REV: It isn't a good idea for black to cut immediately, as he is
reducing his options.];W[er];B[dn]LB[fp:A]C[REV: This move seems a bit paranoid for black.  Maybe better to
push along at F4 (A)];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[fj];W[nq]
;B[lq];W[no]C[Llywelyn: Would the attachment at M4 have been preferable?
REV: Yes, according to Kogo, seeing as you have some support on the left.]
;B[iq]C[REV: Probably not the best response];W[po]LB[qq:A]C[REV: This seems a bit too aggressive to me, but I'm not quite sure what one should do here, maybe R3 (A) instead?]
;B[qo];W[pn]LB[iq:A][lq:B]C[REV: Now you start building thickness, but with black's stones at J3 and M3 (A, B), the influence of the wall is not so great.]
;B[qn];W[pm];B[qm];W[op];B[pq];W[ql];B[cc]
(;W[cd]TR[ch][eh]C[REV:  I think this is the wrong direction.  You're probably not going to save the two marked stones at C12 and E12, so you won't get that much from cutting his invasion off.  I would rather try to keep as much territory as possible by playing at D17 (see variation).]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[bf]
(;W[df]LB[ae:A]C[REV: Here I would rather descend to A15 (A) to force the corner group to make eyes.  I included some possible variations.  Don't take them as gospel; I'm not a dan player!]
;B[dg];W[de];B[ee];W[ed];B[eg]
(;W[cg]C[If you played the cut because you thought you could kill the corner group, OK, you were just being somewhat overambitious.  I wouldn't have thought it would work, though.  Better just to play A15.  Then you get the two black stones anyway, or else kill black's corner.  Or at least, that's what I read, just check my variations and see what you think.]

C[Llywelyn: Any way I could have improved my odds in this capture race, or was it pretty much a lost cause?
REV:  I had a look at it, and I think I see a way for white to win the exchange.]
;B[ad];W[ci];B[di]
(;W[bj]LB[ab:A]C[REV: If you had played A18 (A) now or even a few moves later, I think black dies.]
