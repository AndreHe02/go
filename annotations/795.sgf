;B[dd];W[pp];B[qd];W[cp];B[pj]C[this looks a little unusual and certainly makes a kakari
urgent.];W[od]C[a kakari is certainly correct, but this doesn't look like a
good one.  With the Q10 stone lying in wait it is harder to settle this
high approach.  O17 would be my choice, and I'm sure P17 is fine
too...];B[kd];W[of];B[qg]C[this is a little thin for black, trying to link
up to Q10 ... R14 is stronger, I think, though with the peep of Q15 I guess
black's shape is good enough.];W[id]C[this looks like an overplay.  White is weaker on this side so
attacking seems unreasonable.];B[kf];W[oh];B[ph];W[fc]C[when the stones are
in contact, tenuki is unusual.  Looking at the upper right as a whole,
black has 6 stones to white's 3 ... white should be thinking about
defending here.  Still, letting black play G17 would be bad, so white's
move here looks OK.  Still, white feels busy with two groups needing
attention.  J16 was an overplay.];B[oi]C[this looks like the wrong
direction for black.  force at Q17 first to prevent white from settling;
then after white P17 the move at L17 has attacking effects in both
directions.];W[nh];B[cf]C[this is too passive for black.];W[kh]
C[a good
move.  Now the fight is turning in white's favor here.  Perhaps attaching
at R17 first would be even better.];B[ie];W[he];B[if];W[db]
;B[hf];W[hd]C[now white has a strong group here, so
black's L16 group is weaker, and so white's worries are almost over.  The
game looks good for white at this point.];B[ep];W[gq]C[the lower side is
big because of Q4 but the left side might be big for black too with the
outward facing stones above ... I would consider D6 or C6 as well as this
pincer, but I don't know which is best.];B[fo];W[dn];B[cq];W[bq]
;B[dq];W[bo]C[this seems to give white the best of both worlds, a
position on the left and a stone in the way on the right ... this joseki
must be good for white here.];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip]C[this looks like a mistake
for black, aji keshi];W[jq];B[ko];W[lq];B[mo];W[oq]C[black just gave white a lot of territory.  how is he going to use
this wall?  white's groups are not weak so there are no targets for attack
at the moment.];B[dl]C[here black attacks a strong group, why?]
;W[gf]C[It's
important to prevent black from completely enclosing you and surrounding
the center on a big scale, but maybe coming out with the L12 stone (to
J12?) would be better.  Maybe attaching at R17 is good, too, making that
group strong.];B[gg];W[fg];B[fh];W[gh];B[hg];W[eh];B[fi];W[eg]
;B[ff];W[ge];B[ei];W[cg]C[the proper move would have been E14.  This
looks a little greedy, but then black's corner is pretty
weak...];B[bg];W[ch];B[bh];W[df];B[ce];W[ci];B[ck];W[bi];B[cc]
;W[ee]C[since you had to come back here anyway,
better to play E14 in the first place I think, then attack strongly (or
get sente...)];B[qn]C[this is the last big point of the opening, perhaps,
but both sides are ignoring the upper right corner!  Shouldn't black play
Q17 or P17?];W[cb]C[this is also a huge move for both sides.]
;B[bb]C[black
is still not all that alive here (the peep at B16 looks quite
nasty!)];W[qc]C[finally someone takes the huge point here.]
;B[rc];W[pc];B[li]C[this is small compared to s18.  It may be sente, but white
gains more than black.];W[lh];B[mi];W[lf]C[again, why get fancy?  The solid
move at N12 looks fine to me.];B[ji];W[on]C[coming out around E7 looks
bigger because there may be some threat of using the G12 stone
later.];B[rp]C[locally this exchange looks OK for black; compared to white
playing S5 and black answering at P6, what black lost in the center he has
gained back on the side and corner.];W[ln];B[lo];W[nm];B[lm]
;W[qm];B[rm];W[ql];B[rl];W[fn]C[now that you've come in from
the other side, S18 is probably bigger than this.  Consider how weak your
upper right group could become if black plays S18... plus look at how much
territory it's worth.];B[en];W[em];B[eo];W[dm];B[fm];W[fl];B[gm]
;W[el];B[dj];W[gl];B[hl];W[hm];B[gn];W[hk];B[il];W[gj];B[gi]
;W[ik];B[jl]C[all of these moves by black to take
such a little territory in the center ... this can't be good.  black needed
to find a target for attack.  White can just defend with S18 and then C2
and the game is pretty much over.];W[jk];B[kl];W[ki]C[this cut looked like
an overplay, but really white's group here is stronger than black's, so I
guess it's a good idea.];B[jd]C[this is a tiny move for black!  S18 is much
bigger.  Or take the eye at H11.];W[hi];B[hh];W[qk];B[pn]C[a good threat by
black];W[nk];B[oo];W[ni];B[ol]C[looks like black gains with this exchange,
though white's weak group does become stronger.];W[le];B[mc]
;W[ke];B[je];W[jb];B[ii]C[can't black find eyes with B8
instead?];W[hj];B[cm]C[I think B8 was better to make an eye here.  But this
move takes away white's shape more.];W[bl];B[jg];W[kg];B[cl]
;W[ej];B[di];W[bk];B[kb];W[jc];B[nb];W[kc];B[ld];W[lb];B[oc]
C[what a
difference s18 would have made (for either side) ...];W[nd]
;B[nc];W[pd];B[pb];W[qb];B[oa];W[jh];B[ih];W[jf];B[kj];W[jj]
;B[kf];W[qa];B[jf];W[pa];B[mh]C[why waste this ko threat?  white is
not going to die here.  I guess force first, then  ... what?  where is
black's second eye?];W[lg];B[me];W[lj];B[mg];W[kk];B[mf];W[kj]
;B[og];W[md]C[that cut seems to end the
game.];B[lc];W[ng]C[isn't this a tiny move?  N19 captures black's whole big
group?];B[nj];W[nf];B[mj];W[ob];B[fj];W[ek];B[pb]C[can't white just play N19 now to take away the
eye?  Hm, it keeps coming back to S18 ...let's see (see variations) ...
OK, white needs to live.]
(;W[ok]C[threaten from the outside, then defend your group,
OK.];B[oj];W[ob]C[winning this ko will defend your group, and kill black
... losing this ko would be very bad!  white would have to defend.  So
black can almost connect in sente.];B[dh];W[dg];B[pb];W[pg]
C[white looks
like living now so black has to make a second eye.];B[ma];W[ka]
;B[mb];W[ob]C[now the ko may be a life and death matter for black, and white is
not worried any more.];B[cn];W[do];B[pb];W[qh];B[ob]
(;W[pi];B[mk];W[qj];B[nl];W[cr];B[dr];W[br]C[living here is certainly
big!];B[mq]C[Way back when you played P3 I wondered if O3 would make better
shape ... I guess there's a tradeoff of corner vs side either way you
choose that move.];W[mr];B[lr];W[nq];B[kq];W[mp];B[kr];W[kp]
;B[lp];W[jp];B[mq]C[this ko hurts white a
lot!   If black wins it the corner is in bad shape.];W[bd];B[bc]

;W[eb];B[ah];W[af];B[ab];W[ad]C[making gote seki here (0 points) as
opposed to letting black live (with 11 points) ... are you really far
enough into the endgame to play an 11 point gote move?];B[qo]
C[no, because
playing here (or R4) would have been about 9 points in reverse sente ...
much bigger for white.];W[pr];B[sq];W[sr];B[sp];W[qp];B[so]
;W[rs];B[sj];W[ri];B[bn];W[ds]C[a good time to take this
sente.];B[es];W[cs];B[er];W[pk]C[another good move, at just the right
time.];B[ml];W[pm];B[om];W[si];B[ed];W[fd];B[ao];W[ap];B[an]
;W[ar];B[ai];W[cj];B[dk];W[aj];B[la];W[am]C[isn't T9 bigger?  this is only
two gote points.  T9 looks like 2.5 points?];B[kb];W[ja];B[lk]

point.];B[rk];W[rj];B[ne];W[oe];B[os];W[ps];B[ns];W[sl];B[sm]

big!)?];B[mk];W[ml];B[rj];W[qj];B[qi]C[hmm, it gets complicated, perhaps
another ko?  OK, keep it simple is better.]))
