C[wild : Hi there. It's great to see your enthusiasm in improving your game. I must admit I don't know the lingo (at least for english or romanised version - it's the chinese versions that I'm more familiar with) for the game very well. So I'll try to be as simple as I can in my explanations.

Dear reviewer,
I've been playing go for about four months now, receiving a handicap most of the time which resulted in some serious defects in my even-game-fuseki.
After I felt that I had lost two of my recent games right after the opening I decided to put some additional work in it - that's why I play an opponent 5 stones stronger than me evenly.
The game hasn't been played to the end and in fact only covers fuseki and some middle game, but this are the aspects of my game on which I'd appreciate your comments the most.
I summarized my main questions at the end of the game, but please feel free to comment on everything else you notice.
I played black in this game, but I'm sure white (who thinks that his fuseki is worse than 3k and needs improvement, too) would like comments on his moves as well.

Thanks in advance!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc];B[fq]C[Pretty standart, I think. I thought it'd combine nicely with my lower right hoshi stone, expecting this approach to be pincered right away though.

wild : It is interesting that white chooses a high and low combination for his start. It is not common because the objectives of the hoshi stone and the 3-3 stone are almost entirely opposite.]
;W[iq]SQ[hq][jq][ip][hp]C[wild : This pincer is not a common joseki, mainly because it puts white at a slight disadvantage as compared to the other possibilities as highlighted (see var for e.g.). Of course it may work well in some special setup but I certinly don't think this scenario is such.]

(;B[fo];W[dn];B[io]SQ[lq]C[wild : I would have pincered straightaway at around M3. Black J5 seems to be inviting white to extend to M3 and settle down somewhat.]
;W[lq]C[wild : Which whit gladly did.];B[mq]SQ[nq]C[Reviewing the game, I don't feel comfortable with this move. Originally it was designed to somehow strenghten my corner while making him a bit overconcentrated.

wild : I would say your intention on this move is a bit off, plus the move used to achieve that intention is also not ery optimal. A better position would be O3, one step back. It protects your corner better and at the same time places some presure on white. As a general rule of thumb, it is not good to 'touch' the stones you are attacking because it tends to make them stronger as your opponent responses to your moves.]
;W[lp];B[jc]SQ[pj]C[Wasn't quite sure about this tenuki, but thought it would be better to leave the lower edge being for now.

wild : Well, N3 was not a good move to start with. Now it is weaker than the white stones and will probably have to be sacrificed later. The urgency to extend this way (K17) is not very high because white's C17 is at a low position. I would prefer to extend at Q10 as it links the two black hoshi stones on the right.]
;W[pj];B[ed];W[ce]C[I felt relieved when he played C15, I feel there would have been more severe continuations, but perhaps he played on the third line in order to keep my top moyo open to invasions, as a closer play would have induced me to make it safer.

wild : I would probably have responded the same way. Not sure what combinations you are referring to.]
;B[ef]C[This aimed at playing something around Q13/R13 in sente, expanding my moyo.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[on];B[oq]SQ[np]C[wild : It is better to play O3. For one thing it keeps the two groups of white stones separated. It also has the potential to secure more ground.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rg];B[qc]
SQ[jc]C[The tsuke-nobi joseki would work nicely with my stones on the top, I thought, though it makes white's territory on the left secure.

wild : I feel the K17 stone is a bit too far and low in position.]
;W[je]SQ[jg]C[Here I really couldn't decide how to deal with that stone.

wild : This invasion seems a bit too deep. You could consider more aggressive moves like K13.]

(;B[og];W[ph];B[id];W[ld];B[lf]C[Threatening to cut him, while trying to build some center influence to chase him around a bit later.

wild : You could already cut him without this.];W[kf];B[kd]
;W[le];B[lc];W[nd]C[wild : A bit of an overplay by white. I cut in at L15 now.]

(;B[nc];W[oc];B[md];W[me];B[mc];W[ne];B[od]C[wild : This is not urgent. Can consider the cut at L15.]
;W[lg];B[mf];W[ji];B[ig];W[lh];B[mg]C[I don't remember his next move exactly, suppose he played another connecting move.]
;W[ni]C[maybe];B[cj]TR[lp][lq][iq]C[Originally J13 was played to give some additional backup to this invasion of C10.

We quit the game here.


***

wild : Your thinking is more mature than what I would expect from an 8k player, though the execution doesn't quite match your strategy.

I'd be grateful for comments concerning

- the direction of play and my overall strategy in the game, especially in the fuseki: did I succeed in making my stones work together etc.?

wild : There were not many directional mistakes that I spotted. In fact, only one at move number 13.

- my F3/F5/J5 group: should I have added a  move there earlier, looking at the board now it looks rather weak, though it has D2 for at least one eye

wild : Yes, this group is still weak. But no need to worry too much about it now because it has plenty of room in the centre.

- the way I handled his reduction at K16 - were there better alternatives do deal with it, on which side to defend should I have placed priority or could I also have capped earlier, for example with K13?

wild : Yes, you could have considered K13 because the invasion is a bit too deep.

- my move at C10 - is the invasion resonable, considering my weak group below, or would a play on the fourth line have been better?

wild : I don't think this invasion will bring black too much trouble but I do doubt the value of the invasion. On the top, white is really low and strong, so there's not much to reduce. At the bottom, white has two big gaps, one below and one on top. So it's not urgent. I would consider separating the white marked group from the rest and attacking it. The purpose of the attack is not really to completely destroy it, though it would be nice if you succeed. The other possible motivation for attacking white's marked group is to reduce white's huge moyo in the process. See example.

- the overboard situation: whom do you count ahead now?

wild : I'm not good at this but I'll hazard a guess anyway. It looks pretty even (which is really good for an even game against someone 5 stones stronger).

Again, thanks a lot for reviewing my game, hope it was enjoyable for you as well.

wild : Yes, I do. It helps me to improve my game as well.];W[cl]

;B[nm];W[ml]C[wild : This is just an example. Of course there are many possible variations to this but by keeping our aim in mind (which is to reduce white's huge moyo), your moves will be more coherent and you increases your chance of achieving your goal.]
