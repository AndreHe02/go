C[A very close game from the recent Iwamoto tournament on KGS. Both players are 6k (KGS), I am white. I felt I made some overplays (that weren't always punished sufficiently), so some guidance on more suitable moves would be great. Also, I felt I made some errors in judgement on the right direction of play. Obviously any gross tactical blunders would be good to know about too.

thanks

To me  the black move of K5  looks more liek an overplay or an attemt to trick the opponent

your group is alive now and  its ok since this move works for now as long as you keep it in mind. The group is already surunded so you re not wasting any potential  due to bad shape or anything]

Yes abitious indeed but that dosent make it  neccesary bad

to be honest i personaly have no clue what isbetter to play here.
personnaly i would  invade the corner at upper right  but i not sure it is better  than  the move you choose.]
