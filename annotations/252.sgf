;B[dd];W[pd];B[pp];W[dp]C[Fast beginning looking to have fighting game]
;B[hc]C[H17 seems a bit loose to me

jmf : agree. not a common move.
O17, K17 or even F17 are more usual.
This move doesn't attack, nor defend the corner, strange.];W[pj]
C[q10 seems good to me .. is consistent with the opening

jmf : D10 better than q10, but q10 is also a good point];B[hq]
C[jmf : again not usual. (see comments on move 5)]
(;W[jp]C[(npf) I played this move expecting black to settle his lonely
H3 stone
by playing something like E3. With my stone at D4 I was hoping
to play
for influence along the bottom left. Would this play have been
better
at K3? Or should I have perhaps played something like O4?


Yes I think that your move is too loose.It doesnt seem to do
very much as h3 itself is such a loose move.

jmf : i should have played at R6
i agree with the comment];B[kq]C[(npf) No surprise that he didn't follow as I expected :-)

This is not a very good move as it does help h3 or q4.

jmf : i do not understand the comment.];W[jq]C[(npf) This play was intended to start a bit of a fight with me
hoping
to get some influence along the bottom and possibly gain terrirtory
in
the bottom left corner. Was there a better way to attack H3 &
L3?
Should I have tried to play a bigger point such as extending
along the
left?

I think this is very good. You separate the two stones causing
problems for black.
jmf : ok];B[jr]C[But now you need to follow up your move

jmf : the only move is J2 for W. It's consistent with K3 (cut)]

(;W[ho]C[Black must connect
jmf : agree]
(;B[eq]
(;W[ir]C[Great move - capitalise on blacks mistake

jmf : disagree. Answer with D3. Black would have to connect,, resulting in a very low and bad position (see var 2)]
;B[kr];W[hr]C[h2 is good as well];B[cq]
(;W[ep]C[The problem with e4 is that it strengthens e3.
jmf : D3 better];B[fq];W[gp];B[gq]C[(jkb) I'd be interested in comments on this battle. I was trying
to live in the corner so as to reduce white's territory.

(npf) I had already assumed that black could live on the bottom
and in the corner in particular due to bC3. I was trying here
to
threaten to kill his stones whilst getting influence towards
the  center. Was this wise? Or again should I have tried to play
somewhere bigger?

In may ways I think this is ok. White gains much more than black
with the influence. Although white has many weak places in his
wall.
jmf : agree : good for W];W[iq];B[fp];W[fo];B[cp];W[fr];B[er]

(;B[gr];W[dn]C[d6 is good .. black should have played oout here g2 is nothing
jmf : agree];B[gs]C[again g1 is nothing .. white can capitalise
jmf : agree (too soon to play the dame points)]
(;W[dj]C[(npf) Although I'd built my planned wall I can't help but
feel that I should have kept black in check below line 5.
Is the influence I gained here a reasonable exchange?

Yes I think so .. but there is a proverb about not playing close
to thickness .. either yours or your opponents
jmf : right. Play at D13 with such a wall
With this "exchange", W has already won the game.];B[mp]C[(jkb) White then did the same to me in the other corner, i.e.
invaded and lived.];W[qp]C[Because of d16 (ladder breaker) black can cut here.

jmf : Jealous move. Just play R6]
(;B[op]C[q3 too loose .. play thick here because of corner.

;W[pf];B[cg]
(;W[eg]C[(npf) I was getting nervous about black's large moyo at
the top and wanted to put pressure on him to defend. In  hindsight
this looks like a bad move since it doesn't  directly threaten
black's corner and leaves the left
side open to attack. Is there a better way to invade
black's territory here?

I think e13 is ok
jmf : e13 ok, although ambitious.
Now C17 is a very good point for both];B[df]
(;W[lp]C[Not sure why you play m4
jmf : dame point];B[kp];W[ko]C[H1 is way to slow .. look for the biggest move .. h1 threatens
a connection but black doesnt need a connection .. marked places
are all bigger for black]
(;B[hs]TR[ki][bi][fc][oh]C[Again j1 is too slow .. marked moves are all better for white
jmf agree];W[is]TR[oh][fc][ki][bi]
(;B[hp];W[go];B[jo];W[io];B[jn];W[ip];B[kn]C[(jkb) White has a strong wall on the 5-line ending in a ponnuki.
Black has an open-ended territory in the lower-right. Are these
about even?

(npf) This was definitely not the result I was looking for here!
:-)
M4 and L5 were originally intended to threaten to reduce black's
territory on the bottom whilst extending my wall towards the
center.
Instead black increased his territory and is solidly out into
the  middle. How could I have started to build a moyo around
the wall
on line 5 whilst confining white to the bottom? Was this unrealistic,
or perhaps too early in the game to consider?

i think there are much better moves for black to consider as
I have outlined. At this stage I would put black ahead.
jmf : agree. now B ahead. W influence has been reduced by 75 and 77. W has to reduce B upper territory]
;W[ch];B[bh];W[ci];B[gf]C[(npf) Ouch!

g14 is very good
jmf : I'm not sure the B shape is the better one. I prefer e17. An invasion at C 17 could be successful...]

(;W[dg];B[bf];W[fd]TR[gf]C[(jkb) Is this invasion likely to live on its own or does it need
to link up with the top-right corner? Is there an alternative
invasion?

(npf) Signs of desperation from me here. Would E15 have been
better? Or should I have jumped straight in with C17? Other  alternatives?


It is too far .. I am not sure what white can do here because
of marked stone
jmf : 82-83 exchange strenghten B's corner. It seems too late to invade,
or perhaps at L17];B[ef]
(;W[dc];B[cc];W[ed]C[jmf : simply connect at C16];B[ge]C[jmf : bad move.]

(;W[cd]
(;B[bd];W[de];B[ce]C[(npf) I realised that I was in trouble but didn't want
to give up such a large area of territory. Any  suggestions from
here?

(;W[ob]
(;B[nc];W[pb]C[N 14 is well seen
jmf : N14 small. G12 or B10 better];B[mf]
(;W[lh]C[(npf) Here I was resigned to sacrificing my 3 stones  at L14
if necessary, in an attempt to block an extension
from N14 whilst increasing my moyo on the right.

jmf : 128 bad. B just plays n12];B[lg];W[mg];B[kg];W[nh]C[(npf) OK, so I gained on the right but because I finished  this
sequence in gote I seem to have given black too much in  exchange.
His stones at the top and bottom appear to be able
to connect which is again making me nervous about how to
gain from my line 5 wall. Have you any suggestions as to what
alternatives I should/could have tried?


You saw that you have to sacrifice the stones and build territory
from that so it is good!
jmf : B has gained 6 points, W more, but both players should have played elsewhere]
;B[ki];W[ih];B[gh];W[hi]C[Black does not need to play h13
jmf : agree]
(;B[hg]
(;W[gj]C[(jkb) I felt afterwards that I should have played at 140. Looking
at it now, it seems to me that this was perhaps an opportunity
to invade one of white's large areas?

jmf : W has made plenty of points around F8, and B never countered it]
;B[fg]C[Now sente is important .. endgame moves for white]
(;W[jl]C[(npf) My attempt at splitting the top and bottom groups.


No purpose in splitting them .. only do that if you can attack
or kill a group.

Black does not need to respond
jmf : agree. Why separate 2 living groups ?]
(;B[kl]C[(npf) After black's defence on the right I decided from here
to finally try and gain something from my line 5 wall. Was  this
too soon, with the area centered around N9 still up
for grabs?

It's ok to do this]
(;W[jk]C[(npf) Continuing from my comment on move 141, should I maybe
have played M8 here instead?


I think endgame double sente moves first.];B[kk];W[kh];B[jh]

(;W[ii]C[(npf) I know the proverb about empty triangles but wanted
to threaten to split his stones at K11 whilst reinforcing
my moyo. In retrospect I probably should have listened to
the proverb since I don't think cutting here really  threatens
black so I suppose he could have ignored this.
Any suggestions for alternatives?

C[(npf) Looking at the exchange of territories I think my
disasterous invasion in the top left and failure to prevent  black from getting the territory he did around N7 lost me the
game. Any general advice / comments would be most appreciated!


Well you could have won the game by playing c2!!

But I think you had moments of good play. Some of your moves
are too slow and sometimes you dont recognise when black is slow.
Generally your timing was good. I thought the way you started
by getting influence in the left hand corner while giving black
the corner was excellant. So I suggest it is the middle game
to concentrate on. Ask yourself in the middle game which groups
are weak and which strong. If they are strong dont be concerned
if that strong group connects to another strong group. Also you
can consider playing traditional endgame moves where they are
either double sente or reverse sente earlier.

Hope these comments are useful. Look out for me on igs as Robin
9k !!

jmf : Some good moves, and some bad ones... :-)
Try to concentrate on the main ideas and leave the details for later.
Strange moves in the beginning that are easy to avoid (play simple in the beginning).
Try to find the bigggest moves and leave endgame moves for the end of the game.  The Robin comment seems good except for some details. The variations he showed are not always wise, but are  better than the game.  jm Fray 2K to 4k, depending on how i'm tired.]
