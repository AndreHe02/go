C[I feel that ignoring white here was ok because i felt if i did R5 he would ignore and do something like G3. I would not know what to follow up with. Probably c10

Comment:
I might've played around Q9; if he tenukis, he tenukis; the move is large in itself and he still owes a move.]

[pq:3]C[This is equivalent to the labelled sequence. When white played at 8, you definitely would not have played at 9.]
;W[qj];B[qh]C[I feel that though this is big it was not so good. Maybe i should do j17 first but if he follows up with r13. It seems to me i am behind.

This move wasn't very big of itself, and the white shape is too light to be attacked effectively. Maybe R5 would be better: strengthen your corner and then R12 would be a large point]
;W[jc];B[ci];W[ck];B[fc]C[I originally thought of doing c14, but thought he would do either c15 or b15. With c15 after i extend up to d14 and he closses of the corner, what would be a good follow up. Also If white does b15 then, i would ignore and maybe do something like f16.

C14 would be a better move. In the actual game, black had 2 weak groups, which is difficult to manage.]

(;W[fd]C[At this point, white made the serious mistake of pressing a weak group.

;B[hc];W[cg]C[Maybe K15 would be better; but the situation looks pretty difficult for black right now.]
;B[ie]
(;W[mc];B[kd]C[As of now i think the result is not so bad for black though white is veyr solid, my plan with that move was pres him down sente and then something like q18, to get moyo.

I still don't like black too much. It feels as though the wall is weak.]

;B[hd]C[this kind of moves tend to create liberty issues. Even though it is harmless right now, it may be better just to play something like K18.]

(;B[ff]C[i felt i just had to do the cut, though i did not read it out much. as of now the top group should be dead. So solid teritory we are even. But his center is huge. Any help up to here would be appreciated.

You may try the variation; the cut is still there, so whie has to spend yet another move.]
