C[These are the first moves of a game I played yesterday.
I'll comment the moves, but of course I'm looking for a review of my own suggestions.
thanks for that.
Both black or white are around 11k];B[pd]C[bene: you played very well for an 11k player]
;W[dq];B[cd];W[qp];B[id]C[Is it a correct white position agains that chines fuseki ?
bene: no problem];W[do]
(;B[nq]C[I guess black _has_ to approch there. But isn't it to far ?
see variation for a suggestion.
bene: this is ok];W[pm]C[what about white answer ?
bene: a bit loose. Q3 or pincers (M3?), or shoulder (P4) are joseki]
;B[iq]C[perhaps blacks extends to far ?
dunno
bene: a bit wide. K 3 seems better
see my variations for next move. 3 ways are possible here. one is indirect tactic for chinese position. another is direct move into chinese position. third is invasion into bottom side]

(;W[ec]LB[cj:A]C[I would prefer to play 'a' here,
though attacking black's lower position.
In fact,
I don't know what is chinese fuseki ...  what better learning but approching the komoku ? ;)
bene: your two variations are not an correct answwer. chinese position is an trap for attack and it should be used as an attacking tool. see my new variation]

(;B[ee]C[bad move, I would say contact is better, isn't it ?
see variation
bene: this is not a good move];W[fd]C[bene: slow move. G16 is my first impression, or C17]
;B[ef]LB[fe:A]C[very bad I guess: pressing white stone down should be better: 'a'
another move here for black ?
bene: of course A. this move is unthinkable];W[fe]C[bene: white is helping black. this is leaning toward balck's stength. H15 is my first impression and at least G15 is better]
;B[dj]LB[dc:A][cc:B]C[what about 'a' instead ?
bene: A is good but F14 seems better];W[cc];B[dd]LB[ce:A]C[I don't like this either: is 'a' better ?
bene: A is unthinkable. this move is better but B17 is much better]
;W[dc];B[gc]LB[pj:A]C[neither this one:
blacks loses sente, which is very much in that part of game.
I would have taken the last border hoshi (or around)
bene: now white is safe and this is unecessary. Q10(A) or C7 is better alternative]
;W[qf]C[bene: good]
(;B[qe]C[this, of course, is not as nice as a pincer.
what do you think of it close far low high? (-> variation)
bene: pince may be low or high, but this is time for pince anyway. this move is helping white. this style is for an attack, but now it is allowing white's territory]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[pj]C[ok, I'm really not sure about that move:
it is pretty slow, isn't it ?
but wher to play else ?
bene: no. this is excelent move. making big territory and stabilzing the Q14 group! no other move thinkable!]
;B[cm]C[bene: good];W[jp]C[bene: this shoulder move is playable when black
's space is two(because when space is two, invasion is impossible). now it is 4! and you should absolutely invade there. L3 or L4 is my first impression]
;B[jq]C[what about that white move ?
I didn't know what to do whith this large space between the 2 black stones ...
-> i decided to minimize there influence .
bene: you should invade. you did not mention that it is too far? there influence was tiny but you are making them much more strong]

(;W[ch]LB[em:A]C[wich then allows me to attack.
But what about a move on 'a' before ?
bene: this move is unthinkable now. First, you should continue bottom move (L4 or M4) (although it was bad move you should save their face)
Secondly this invasion is too deep. and very hard for escape or life

A(E7) is not a good move. you must contine bottom];B[eh];W[cf]
;B[bd]C[bene: this move is hurting upper group's safety];W[bj]
C[This sequence is not very nice.
Could you show me one better, nicer ?

Ok, anyhow, there ends the fuseki which I wanted to dicuss about.
Thankyou for your review :)

bene: because the invasion was too deep, an excellent moves seems not to exist.
invasion was necessary for bottom side, not left side. at least upper side are better place for an invastion (L16)
anyway, you should live there absolutely now])

(;B[ed];W[fd];B[ee];W[dc];B[cc];W[gc];B[cg];W[ge]C[what about that ?
bene: this is good for white because it is now safe. black's mistake]
)
(;B[dc];W[ed];B[cf];W[gd]C[bene: black is making territory, and white is not still safe]
))
(;W[dg]C[bene: entering into chinese position inevitably brings battle. when you dislike it, you play like this. in fact, many pros play this]
;B[ed];W[dj])
(;W[ed]C[bene: when you invade, this move is better than the move you played (E17). because this is easier for an escape]
;B[df];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[bb];W[gc])
(;W[kq]C[bene: or you may decide to invade the bottom side. because black played too wide here]

C[bene: your variations are still playable, but both are not joseki. Josekis are various, but for example... A to I.]

(;W[op];B[np];W[oo];B[pq];W[qq];B[lq];W[qm]C[are there other josekis to play ?
arghhh, black ends sente here :(
How to avoid it ?])
(;W[ql];B[kq]C[white gets sente now ?
(variation not very far from real moves in fact)])))
