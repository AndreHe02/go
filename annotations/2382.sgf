RE[W+R]

C[Dear reviewer,

usually, I ask for a review of games that I lost. I won this one, and am quite happy about it, because this is one of the rare games, where I planned things that actually worked. But of course, I also was often unsure and I have a couple of questions.

R:
Hello,
I'm ziggystar and 7k on KGS. I'll try my best to comment on your moves. Sometimes I'll also note what black could have done better so that you can see what could have happened.
I'll try to add variations where I find it reasonable. I'll also mark my comments with a leading  'R:' to distinguish them from yours.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj]C[San-ren-sei. At this point, I took some time to think about my next move - I thought of making my own san-ren-sei with d10, but found it a bit too defensive. So I decided to approach his corner...

R:
Both is playable.];W[pn]C[... but I am confused about where to attack the san-ren-sei. I chose the direction from above, not from my side, because I wanted to break his moyo. I think if he responded better, that approach could have gotten me into trouble, right?

I chose the high approach, because I didn't want the stone to be closed in.

R:
I would have played a break-up move, too.
But I would have played R6. Though there seems to be nothing wrong with your move.]
;B[jd]C[R:
I think answering the kakari is bigger than taking the upper side for black because allowing W to play another stone in the lower right would result in a strong white position there.]
;W[jp]LB[nq:A]C[This exchange of extensions raised the likelihood of success for my corner attack, I guess.

R:
This stone should be somewhere around O3 to support Q6 and put some preassure on blacks corner stone.]
;B[dj]C[R:
Black should help the corner.];W[np]C[It's getting better still. Maybe, I should have played one point higher at o5, because from here he could have played a sequence to cut off my stone at q6?

R:
Either that or one point lower at O3.
The two point diagonal jump invites a cut.];B[oo];W[no];B[on]
;W[pl];B[fc];W[cf];B[cn]C[After this move I contemplated if I should defend my corner or play another move to support my stone q6...

R:
I think it would be better to answer the approach. The two stones around Q6 can either escape or live. So the corner is bigger.]
;W[om]C[Quite a few stones to make q6 work, but I thought it was important.]
;B[nn]
(;W[nm]C[R:
See variation for better move.];B[mn];W[lo];B[bp];W[cq];B[fp]
;W[en]LB[eo:A]C[With this move, I aim at d8 an g6.

R:
I would have made only a one point diagonal jump to A (E5) here. This leaves a weakness at A which may pose problems later.]
;B[iq];W[jq];B[jr];W[kr];B[ir];W[lq]C[Now I think, I didn't have to play this move. The joint is safe, because of m5, is that right?

R:
You're right that it would protect this cut. But this stone settles your group and you don't have to care about it when doing something with your lower left corner or attacking blacks lower right corner.]
;B[ip];W[io];B[er];W[dr];B[eq];W[do];B[dq];W[cp];B[bo];W[dl]
C[I didn't dare to play at c8.
I think that my opponent was gentle with me during the following sequence and I am very unsure about my way of attacking.
If possible, could you point out to me what would be the proper way of attacking his position?

R:
Your group is too weak to start a fight. You should think about escaping first.
I tried some variations of a black attack. Black gained much most of the time. (See example variation)]

(;B[cl];W[ck];B[dk];W[cj];B[dm];W[el];B[ci];W[bl];B[cm];W[bi]
;B[em];W[fl]
(;B[di]C[If he had played atari at b10, I connect at b9, he atari at b12, I capture at a10, he connects at c12. That would have sealed my group in.
I got lucky - or am I missing something?

R:
W could break out. But I guess that in your game it would have ended like you say.

(See variation)];W[bh];B[fm];W[fn];B[gl]
(;W[fj]C[I was really thinking that thist move saved those 3 stones in a row. What a mistake. But I was able to make use of them later.

R:
F9 can save the group. (See some variations)];B[fk];W[go];B[gn]
;W[hn];B[gm];W[fo];B[hp];W[ho];B[gp];W[qf]C[See if I can isolate his stone a q10.

R:
A good plan. But maybe you sacrify too much to achieve it. Black will go out with a nice corner and still options to extract Q10.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[og]C[Looks good.

R:
Black's corner, too. You should have gotten more out of the corner approach.]

(;B[qg];W[qh];B[rg];W[rh];B[rf];W[nf]C[A little unsafe maybe. Do you think, I should have protected the joint at q12 right away?

R:
Maybe just extend to O13 instead of playing hane. B's corner is huge though.]
;B[qe]C[R:
Black should answer the hane.];W[nh]C[This is to protect 2 joints: q12 and o13.

R:
That's ok if you want to give black the huge corner and upper side for the territory on the right.]
;B[ph]C[R:
B should secure his nice corner. This move brings nothing.]
;W[pi];B[qn];W[qm];B[po];W[rn];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[pq]C[The following sequence was a great joy for me, since I actually elaborated about this move and tried my best to read it out. It was great to see it work.

R:
I'm afraid but this won't work. See variation.];B[oq];W[op]

(;B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[mp];B[mr];W[ms]
;B[mm];W[nk];B[md]LB[rq:A]C[Here is the next point, where I used some thinking-time. After this move, his top right corner looked very big to me and I didn't want him to have that.
I was also thinking about attacking his stone at f17 and playing at n8 to make shape (at least it looks like good shape to me) and widen the reach of my group there.

So I thought that I would try to use my attack on this corner to get a good position for the attack on f17.

R:
H17 is the point to attack this structure. But B should have cared for it's lower right which is now very urgent. On the other side, W should attack B's lower right corner and try to kill or at least get some profits from the resulting fight. Both players will want to play A (S3) and keep missing playing in this reagion for some time.]
;W[nd]MA[fc][jd]C[I think he could have cut this stone off, but he didn't.

R:
Hard to judge. I think it would have resulted in a fight. And that might have hurt B's upper left stones. (marked)]

(;B[nc];W[me];B[od];W[mc]C[R:
Better M16. This looks like bad shape to me.]
(;B[ne]C[R:
See variation for a better black response.];W[ld];B[nd];W[lf]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[lb];W[ic]C[R:
Better prevent a cut with L16.];B[kd]C[R:
That's not good.];W[id]C[I was willing to make sacrifices to get his stone at f17 and the territory that goes along with it.]

(;B[le]C[R:
B should save F17.];W[mf];B[kf];W[if]C[So now he got his corner anyway, but I think I was able to get good compensation. Do you agree, or should I have gotten more out of it?

R:

I think the outcome is a bit better for W than it should be, considering the starting position.]
;B[jc];W[db];B[ib];W[hb];B[kb];W[gc]C[Looks, like my plan worked.

R:
I think F17 can still be saved by B.];B[fh];W[ff];B[ha];W[ga]
;B[ia];W[ml]C[R:
Play S3 first.];B[hd]C[I read a couple of times, that good shape helps a lot in a fight. Is the following sequence an example for that?
Do you think it would have been more dangerous to me, if he played at h15 instead?

R:
Forget this move and kill B's corner. See variation.]

Now it's too late.];W[kn]C[I was safety-oriented here, since I absolutely didn't want to be cut in this area.]

;B[so];W[sm];B[sp];W[kh]C[I probably should have captured at p3 right away, to prevent him from making 2 sure eyes there. But I only later got the idea that I could try to kill his group there.

R:
Now B is alive there.];B[jg];W[ik]C[With this move, I push out my borders and also plan to make use of my 3 good-as-dead stones at e8.]
;B[jh];W[ji];B[ig];W[eg];B[dg];W[df];B[eh];W[gk]C[Here is the move making use of j9 earlier.]
;B[ek];W[hj];B[hl];W[il];B[fg];W[ef]C[Probably a bit too defensive?

R:
It's ok. There aren't any big moves left. Endgame has begun.]
;B[hg]C[R:
A worthless black move connecting two living groups.];W[gg]
;B[gh];W[qc]C[I really didn't know, if this made any sense. So I tried it.

R:White should gain nothing here.];B[pb];W[qb];B[rd];W[rc];B[sc]

B better answer this move.];B[cr]C[R:
W can kill with T2.];W[br];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds];W[bq];B[aq];W[ar]
;B[ap];W[co];B[bn];W[ps]C[R:
Black can still save with T2.

T2 is the vital point of this shape.];B[qs];W[sr];B[rr];W[ss]
C[It actually worked.];B[sn]C[R:
With this move B starts a desperate fight during which W could have tenukied several times.]

Tenuki.];W[mj];B[ok]C[No 2 eyes.

R:
Right. Play tenuki as you did.];W[pa]C[Here I thought that I could make something work, which was wrong. I should have left the corner alone, since he would have to make grave mistakes to allow my success there.]
;B[rb];W[qa];B[oa];W[ob];B[pc];W[nb];B[mb]C[He resigned. I hope, I didn't get on his nerves with my being so stubborn in this corner.

So, aside from the fact that I won, I think there are many strategical and tactical improvements to make in my play. Could you please give me a hint and point out the most important area(s) where I should direct me efforts?

Thank you in advance.

Christian

R:
I couldn't see any major problems you're having. I think you should just keep on playing many games to improve your feeling for good and bad shape.

Maybe some Life and Death problems would help you judge about the status of groups like (B's lower right corner which could have been killed/saved several times) and chances of invasions as in the upper right.]
