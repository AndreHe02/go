P - Hi, My name is Peter, and I play on KGS, where I am now 6-7k.  I hope the review helps, feel free to contact me if you have further questions.

You asked about the fuseki.  I would encourage you to find some pro games on gobase.org and see how they handle the low Chinese fuseki.  You do not need to memorize moves, but just try to get a sense of timing and when/how to invade.  For white, the big problem was getting overconcentrated on a single side.  Look at move 12 and consider how much better black looks. Black suffered when he started a weak group on the lower side. Black was lucky when his group lived, and afterwards he dominated the board, even though white did a good job reducing.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dq];B[ic];W[co];B[qn]
(;W[np]C[P - There are examples of professional games on Gobase beginning in this way--until this move.  The variation is how the pro's continued (Zheng Hong,Zhang Wendong,1995-02-13,CN,W+R,Tian-Yuan tournament).  Perhaps o4 is not good because it makes w overconcentrated (the first four stones are all on the same side), and that it gives black a good point at q10.]
;B[rp];W[qq];B[qk]
(;W[jq]C[P - This is a fairly large point, but I would strongly desire to establish a presence somewhere else on the board.  All six white stones are in the same area!]

(;B[pg]C[P - This is a somewhat lukewarm move.  This move has no effect on the corner and only builds up a position where four black stones already sit.  Black still has the advantage with this move, though.]
;W[cf]C[P - Why not take e17 or e16? the top side might get too big.]
;B[ed]C[P - Good. This point takes a large corner, has an impact on the center, works with the J17 stone, and attacks C14.]

(;W[dh]
(;B[fp]C[P - This move precipitates black's coming troubles. I really don't know what black is trying to do here.  What if white plays e5 or e6? It will be hard to settle this stone, and white should make nice profit attacking it. I show some alternatives.]

(;W[fr]C[P - Very passive. White is not in danger.];B[ip]C[P - This move induces K4, which is painful for black (the lower right becomes much safer for white and difficult to invade for black.  What is a better point? I cannot say. This is another reason I do not like f4.]
;W[jp]
(;B[jo];W[io]C[P - Good! White is very strong here and should not fear the ensuing fight.]
;B[ho];W[in];B[fn]C[P - Good move!];W[hn];B[go]C[P - This makes the black stones heavy and easy to attack.  I would just continue running.]

(;W[iq]C[P - Small.]
(;B[dm];W[cl];B[cm];W[bm];B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[cj]
(;B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[ei];B[gh]C[P - Building the center is a great idea, but be careful about the lower group's safety.]

(;W[fj]C[P - This is the right idea, but there's a slightly better move available.]
;B[gl]C[P - Good, this group is in danger.]
(;W[il]C[P - Doh, wrong direction. This helps black.];B[hk]
C[P - Black says "thank you."];W[ik]
(;B[jh]C[P - A little ambitious; better to run out with the weak stones.]
;W[hj]C[P - Good!  White smells blood... [cue Jaws music\]]
;B[fk]
(;W[hl]C[P This is somewhat odd.  black still has a fwe];B[gk]
;W[gj];B[eo];W[ep];B[do];W[dp]
(;B[cn]C[P - Good job living in such a tight space! Now K12 looks great.]
;W[bn];B[fq];W[gq]C[aitkensam [9k\]: 14k! nice!];B[er];W[gr]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr]C[P - Tenuki! There are at most fifteen points total at stake here (black cannot kill the four stones right now) so it is time to run amok on the upper side.]

(;W[br];B[eq]
(;W[hp]C[P - Oops. There is no need to worry about the j5 stones.]
;B[bq];W[bo];B[cp];W[nc]C[P Good. Black's capture netted him 14 points or so, but this move is worth MUCH more. Imagine a black stone at p17 already in place.]
;B[md];W[qc]
(;B[qd];W[pc];B[mc];W[nb]
(;B[mh]C[P - Very slack.  This move is only territorial and simply ropes off a chunk of territory.  This is strictly an endgame move.  This move says "You have no chance of invading the upper side, so I will seal this up as the final move in the area." Hardly true!]
;W[gc]C[P - White is desperate. This should die.]
(;B[hc];W[gd];B[ef];W[hh];B[hg];W[gg]
(;B[gf]C[P - Oops.];W[ig]
(;B[fg];W[hf];B[he];W[gg];B[if];W[hg]
(;B[ge];W[jg]C[P - Now n12 looks like a silly move.];B[jf];W[kg]

(;B[mk]C[P This move may look like n12, but it is substantially better.
1) It takes away white's chances to make territory.
2) It increases black's territory at the same time.

The best move is still p6, if you ask me, but this move doesn't make me cringe.]
;W[om]C[P - Now you see how big p6 would have been!];B[ok]
(;W[pn];B[qm];W[qo];B[ro];W[rq];B[mm]C[P - Very good. White should have played here.]
