C[Greetings,

this game was played on KGS with me (Angalot) being Black. Any comments will be welcome, especially when you think that I have played aji keshi or reduced my own options to control the gameflow. Generally I have no clear idea how this works, so if you could clarify it a bit I would be very grateful.

Thanks,  Zoran Rilak

NM: Comments added by Niall 2k*, preceded
y "NM"];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[jq]C[NM: necessary]
;B[lp]C[[Ang\] With the idea of creating a double-wing formation with the placement of  Q10 (marked).

NM: The drawback with this move is that it
only becomes worthwhile if you then get to
make a play somewhere round Q10. Otherwise
you'd rather be on the third line for
territory. And it's gote.];W[lr];B[pj]C[NM; Excellent! Now M4 comes into its own.]
;W[nq];B[mq]C[NM: Good];W[mr];B[np];W[qf];B[qh]C[NM: I don't like this. With the corner
open, it's not a strong attack on R14,
and the territory it makes is modest.
I would play O16.];W[of];B[nh]C[NM: And here's the problem. If you don't
play this, R12 becomes a small move, and if
you do the corner stone is quite weak.];W[nc]C[[Ang\] The following sequence helped White more than Black, so how should Black play here?

NM: There's nothing wrong with O16 as a
reply. P15 is also possible. Because of
the possibility of O16, I think W's
move should have been there.];B[rf]C[NM: This cut only works when you have
a stone at R16, not Q16; and even then
it should be used with caution.];W[re];B[qe];W[pe];B[qg]C[NM: disastrous! At least if you play R16
you can live in the corner.];W[qd];B[nf];W[od];B[jo]C[[Ang\] Should I have protected this area first (around A is my guess)?

NM: Sorry I can't read your "A'. I think
this is a very big move. On grounds of
pure "size" , it's probably not as big  as something like D10; but it also protects
your moyo as well as expanding it - making
it even more difficult for W to play  something like P7 - and it threatens to push
the W stones at the bottom very flat.
It is clearly better than a move like Q7.
Whether to play this or D10 is largely
a matter of personal taste.];W[oq];B[op];W[mo];B[mp];W[pm]C[M : Looks too deep to me, though how to  attack it isn't entirely obvious.]
;B[nm]C[NM: Very tricky here. I think I would
play O8.];W[ok];B[nj]C[NM: This works out well for B, though
I think I would have played P10.];W[oj];B[oi];W[pk];B[qj];W[nk]
;B[mj];W[mk];B[lk];W[ll];B[ml];W[mm];B[nl];W[lj];B[kk];W[nn]
;B[lm];W[mn];B[kl];W[pp];B[qp]C[NM: A very nice response! Now the W stones
should die.];W[po];B[pn];W[qn];B[oo];W[on];B[qm];W[rn];B[pl]
;W[po];B[qk];W[rm];B[ol]C[[Ang\] My opponent missed that atari, and I captured mostly to try and get him emotionally off-balance (his move timings suggested that he could lose his temper if properly taunted).

NM: Those stones should die anyway, even
if he sees the sequence perfectly.];W[dj]C[NM: Good! W seems to me to be slightly in
the lead (he would be well in the lead if
he hadn't made the unsuccessful attack
on the R side).];B[fq]C[NM: I would have played H4.];W[hq];B[ho]
;W[fo];B[cn]C[NM: I don't like this. It makes the
W move at F5 a good move , which up to
now it wasn't.];W[cl];B[cq];W[cp]C[NM: Now F5 is perfectly placed.]
;B[dq];W[dn]C[NM: SHould be one higher, at D7.];B[dm];W[cm]
;B[bn];W[bp];B[en];W[do];B[fm];W[dl];B[em];W[fk]C[NM: B was lucky! W should have played G6, pushing himself into B's moyo, or else
G9 making one himself.];B[jd]C[NM: Falls between two stools. I would play
either N16 to expand the moyo or
J17, which has a two-space extension on
either side as miai.];W[ld]C[NM: Terrible! The proper move for W is
H16];B[ke]C[NM: ... but that's a poor reply. Should be
M14, which makes another 10 points of
territory in sente.];W[le];B[fc]C[[Ang\] One line closer? Or would be a three-space high approach be valid here?

NM: I would have played M14. If you want  to make a base on the side this is OK: but
you have to be ready for a W attack at H17.];W[hc];B[he]C[NM: No! Should be H16, D17, or C17.
The other classic reply here, K17, is not  appropriate in this case.]
;W[gd]C[NM: Good. Gives B a problem.];B[dc]C[NM: An excellent way to resolve the problem.]
;W[cc];B[cb]C[NM: This is joseki. However in this position
I would play E16 to attack the W stones
at the top.];W[bc]C[NM: Poor.];B[db]C[NM: Same remark applies. Yes, you can live
in the corner: but I would attack first,
with E17 or possibly even E16.];W[ed];B[bb];W[ec];B[eb];W[fd]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[df]C[NM: Chancy! Your corner group isn't yet
alive - see variation.]
(;W[ff];B[ci];W[cj];B[di];W[ei];B[eh];W[dh];B[ch];W[fh];B[dg]
C[NM: I think that if you play E13 here
your group is alive.];W[eg];B[bj];W[bk];B[ai];W[bg]C[[Ang\] I am pretty bad at life & death; could this group have lived?

NM: Doesn't look like it to me - see the variation a couple of moves further on.]
;B[bf];W[bh]
(;B[cg];W[bi];B[be];W[de];B[gg];W[fg];B[hi];W[kf]C[NM: W should play M14.]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[lg];W[ng];B[mg];W[ne]C[NM: A good result for B.]
;B[jc];W[lc];B[jb];W[lb];B[ga];W[gb];B[ha];W[fb];B[fa];W[gp]
;B[bq];W[er]C[NM: This sequence is clumsily played on both
sides.];B[fr];W[eq];B[ep];W[fp]C[NM: B must play E5 now! The 2 W stones
certainly die. See variation.]
(;B[dr];W[eo];B[es];W[ep];B[bs];W[ar];B[aq];W[br];B[cr]C[NM: If W plays D1 now the B corner dies.]
;W[ap];B[as];W[gr];B[ds];W[rl]C[NM: W struggling in vain: these stones
should die.];B[ql];W[ro];B[rp];W[rk];B[rj];W[je];B[jf];W[hf]
;B[gf];W[ge];B[ie];W[gh];B[hg];W[hh];B[ih]C[[Ang\] An obvious mistake

NM: I'm not so sure - it could enable
you to keep your centre area. But to do
that you must play K12 later, not K13.];W[ig];B[jg];W[ii];B[jh]
;W[hj]C[NM: Now THERE's a mistake! Should be J10.];B[ak];W[aj]
;B[ek];W[ej];B[bj];W[al];B[gl];W[gk];B[hl];W[gn];B[go]C[NM: A mistake. B makes W link and leave
him strong, so that later he can either take the E7 stones or push out. B should just
have played H6.];W[fn];B[hn];W[ko];B[lo];W[ln];B[kn];W[kp];B[kq]
;W[jp];B[kr];W[jn];B[km];W[jr];B[or]C[NM: Bad. Should be M3, forcing W to link
underneath with lots of delicious
damezumari.];W[nr];B[os];W[lq];B[ns];W[ks];B[og];W[no];B[pp]
;W[pn];B[qr];W[gm];B[fl];W[hm];B[im];W[io]C[NM: Should be J8, which takes the 4
stones below.];B[in];W[hp];B[jm];W[el];B[ik];W[hk];B[il];W[ji]
;B[ki];W[rg];B[rh];W[sf];B[nf];W[me];B[ij];W[gi];B[jj];W[hi]
;B[jo];W[ip];B[hb];W[gc];B[ad]C[NM: Absurd! Should be A17.
