C[Dear reviewer, I was black in this game which was played at the Kiseido Go Server (KGS). I lost by over 20 points, but I still don´t see where I made my biggest mistakes. Should I have defended my moyo in a better way? Or was there a way to reduce or invade the white moyo in the lower left part of the board? Probably all of this and some other things too :) So I am looking forward to the review,    
kind regards, Thomas];B[qd]C[Ok, my net-name is kokorini, I will make this review. so... luck for both of you! (joke) (bad one).]

(;B[cd]C[and this answer isn't better, the cut in D15 is interesting, adn probably leaves black in very bad situacion. I think a better answer is d15]

(;B[lo]C[You need p3 group stronger to reduce/invade the white lands. (see var)]
;W[jn]C[What do you think of this position? I thought it was quite ok for black. The upper side of the board looked good for black, the group around P3 wasn't in danger, and I hoped to connect it somehow to my other stones.

Kokorini: Mmmhh.. the p3 group is not VERY secure, a white stone placed on N1 is unconfortable; and finally the white moyo on the left-down can be hard to invade in the future, so... if you do this, I think that is a rasonable move to invade it soon. and for that, as I told you in the last move, you need p3 group stronger.]
;B[jj]C[I played this after a long thought. I don't know if this is a good move, but during the game it "feeled" right. Now I wonder if it was too ambitious ...    
    
Kokorini: Well... i think is fine, maybe a little ambitious... better on K15  But you kwon now that reduce was the correct choice.]
;W[lm]C[l];B[oj];W[mj];B[nl]C[trying to connect my stones, maybe later attack the white R4 group.          kokorini: You ARE attacking R4 group.]
;W[nn];B[ml];W[ll];B[lk];W[kd]C[Now I did't know what to do. Try to kill the invading stones? Just let them "live small"?    
    
Kokorini: The problem is that you can lose the game here if he take too much, and thats becouse you didn't reduce the moyo when you can. the situacion now is the next:    
-your p3 group is weaker.    
-the white moyo can end close after this persecution if you dont take care.    
    
so, probably you have to make him live small but leave you a "door" to white lands (becouse p3 group is too weak to use it).]

;B[fi];W[ii];B[hk];W[gn];B[gl]C[Now I realized how big the white moyo in the lower left side was and made some attempts to reduce its size.

kokorini: yes, but now is too strong there,    your first and better oportunity was when you played M5, and the last persecution of the white group wasn't end good for you.]

;W[ih];B[fh];W[ij];B[ik];B[nq]C[Well, I think that the problem was the huge white moyo, we can see that the invasion of white have introduce too much in the black territory, becouse was allowed to do it.

And try to look for the bigger end moves. but even with this white group, and the M5 stones, if we image the black group in the white moyo when he was posible.... I think that black should win.

Well, that's all I think.
