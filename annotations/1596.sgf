C[Note for the reviewer :

I lost this game because of a bad misread at move 253.
I think the game was in my favour by 5 to ten points before this.

What I'd like to know is :

1) I attempted a 25 kyu invasion (# 129) which was nonsens (but I'm not sure it cost me a lot, because W played in his territorry.
What other options did I have to secure the game ?


2) At which moment in the early middle game did I miss important moves (sente , territory or reduction ?)

KS: the 25kyu invasion will always cost you in a way, even if opponent responds, because you lose ko threats. but beyond that, there is often a chance you play gote dead in such an invasion, that will cost you a game easily.
I have tried to outline the problems where I could though of course nothing I say here is absolute, and stronger players may call me crazy. I think as a major thing though, you must watch your cut points more carefully, you have a habit of generating them and eventually they will always come back and haunt you. Other than that I think black played very well overall.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[oq];W[qp];B[pn]C[you can just ignore r4 and play in the open corner, that is usually considered bigger, but to not do so is hardly a disaster]
;W[po];B[oo];W[qn];B[pp];W[qo];B[qq];W[rq];B[fq]C[I'm not sure if I like tenuki here, mabye P6 or R2 is more urgent]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[qr];B[dd]C[good, playing at q3 is probably slow and bad shape]

;W[rd];B[qc];W[pi];B[ck];W[cj];B[dk];W[dr];B[bj]C[this one is bad, black should be thinking about running, not making a base here. Also if you do run then the c12 weakness may hurt white alot here]
;W[bi];B[bl];W[aj];B[cq]C[this is a neat idea, unfortunate it dosen't work. probably this would be good combined with a monkey jump at a5 right now, but that is endgame play. but I feel this aji should not be spent yet, its just too soon]

(;B[dn]LB[dn:A][cr:B]C[not very good.
this allows me to sabaki D9 stones, but is probably expensive.

Does C2 make the group alive ?

see variation about C2
as for the sabaki you make with the group, I will explain in a few moves...]
;W[cp];B[an];W[am];B[bm];W[ao];B[cm];W[bp];B[en]C[the empty triangle here is harldy good shape, mabye if black wants to get some eyeshape though, you are better off to put b5 at b6]
;W[or];B[nr];W[on];B[nn];W[om];B[os]C[hmm..mabye this is too small, I would ignore this as white]
;W[pr];B[fj]C[this one is kind of odd, the group here is essentially fine, and this cannot really become something large, mabye E14 is better, or P13. also black has a big gap at F4]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[go];W[fn];B[fm]C[I don't think pushing white this direction is productive, if you do not want to push him onto your C7 group though, just jump out to H10 or so]
;W[gn];B[hn];W[gm];B[fl];W[hm];B[in];W[im];B[jm];W[rc];B[qb]
C[s17 is very big move, but don't respond to it unless you feel you have to due to local group saftey.]
;W[bc];B[og];W[pg];B[ef]C[good, this works well with p13];W[fi]
;B[ch]C[I don't think that you can do this with b10 in atari]

;W[bk];B[if]C[this one is strange to me, I guess theres no respon you can't keima here, just looks odd :-)
but I do think that mabye o12 is better, since it hurts the white territory and halps yours]

C[this seems like overdoing it, white may atari at n13 then o14 to capture, and you will still have to cut in gote]
;W[ni];B[lh];W[li];B[ki]C[hane like this is risky, white may cut, since you have many cutting points]

F2 is proably the biggest move on the board at this time, I count black ahead by about 8 if you get that, but it will be hard keeping the black territory in tact, since it is not as solid as whites, and there are many cut points.]
