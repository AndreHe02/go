;B[pp]C[Hi, I'm Mike Malveaux, a 7k in the American Go Association.  I see no specific questions from the players, and I am asked to review for both sides, so I'll just do my best to see something useful and point it out, and to rein in the variations so they don't overwhelm.  If there are follow-up questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.  -MM]
;W[dq];B[cd];W[pc];B[ec];W[nq]TR[pe][qe][qf][pf][co][do][dn]
[cn][cj][ci]C[MM: Good up to now, but normal opening strategy says that an unbalanced corner is more urgent than a symmetrical corner.  A 3-4 point like Q17 or D3 is unbalanced; a 3-3 or 4-4 point like Q4 is symmetrical.  So this move should probably be in the upper right or lower left, rather than approaching the balanced 4-4 stone.  Also, the points in front of a corner enclosure are valuable.  So a play around C10 or C11, robbing Black of the extension, would be a good idea.]
;B[pn];W[pr];B[cj]TR[qq]C[MM: Normally the joseki continues with R3, but this looks good too.]
;W[qf]TR[jq][pr][qq]C[MM: I agree with the desire to make the enclosure, however, if I read Ishida's Dictionary of Basic Joseki correctly, this is a normal move when White plays 6 at K3 instead of Q2.  In this case, since White did Q2 and Black did not answer, I believe White should go ahead and claim the corner with R3.]
;B[kc]C[MM: Nice large double-wing formation. But the lower right is a bit neglected.  White should go ahead and hit it hard.]
;W[ip];B[co];W[eo]C[MM: I don't find this in Ishida's joseki dictionary, and I'm having trouble getting Kogo's to work, for some reason. Also Sensei's Library doesn't list this. Which does not mean it's bad, but I'm not really strong enough to evaluate it.  Having said that disclaimer, it seems a bit too loose to me, and does not really seem to keep sente.]
;B[dm];W[ql]C[MM: Good area, maybe R3 or R5 would be better... but this move should work well with the upper right corner.]
;B[nc]C[MM: Defending the lower right seems natural, unless you plan to run to the center.]
;W[pi];B[fm]TR[eo][gp][ee]C[MM: Big framework - White needs to invade, I think around E15. But this exposes some weakness in White's frame, around the G4 area -- which is probably why I could not find W14, at E5, in the joseki references.  Therefore, white probably must take time to defend, which will allow black to solidify the left and top.]
;W[nl];B[mn]TR[mo][no]MA[oo]C[MM: This shape is not bad, it often shows up rotated 90 degrees on the third and fifth lines -- so the two-space jump works with the side of the board to form a base.  That's not the case here, with the stones floating toward the center.  Even on the side of the board, there's a standard attack against this shape at P5.  Here in the center of the board, away from the support given by the edge, the P5 attack may be devastating.  For that reason, I think the "dog's head" at O5 or the "horse head" at N5 would be better shape.]
;W[lp]C[MM: Good patient move, building strength for the fighting to come, also claiming some territory.]
;B[go];W[gp];B[ll]C[MM: The proverb says "chase with the knight's move, run with the one-space jump". Here white is chasing you, and this knight's move can be cut and is weak.]
;W[df]TR[mm]C[MM: I have mixed feelings about this move.  N7 looks like the natural way to pressure the drifting blacks in the lower right.  On the other hand, an invasion in this area is good.  I think best would be to pressure the black stones for a few moves, then switch to the invasion. I guess this is a missed opportunity for White.]
;B[hd]C[MM: Makes some territory, probably, but does not really threaten the white invader.]
;W[ff];B[hf];W[hg]TR[ei]C[MM: The horse head shape at E11 would be beautiful here.]
;B[ig];W[hh];B[ih];W[hj]C[MM:  Looking over the board now, black seems generally more settled, and seems to be claiming a slightly larger area, though each player has a large weak group on the board.. It will probably depend on who gets the lower right, and how large the weak groups end up living.]
;B[jj]C[MM: Maybe too ambitious, the weakness at L9 is serious. But since the whites in the upper left are so weak, you will probably be ok.]
;W[lj];B[lh]C[MM: Wow, bold move.  My reflex would be to connect with L9.]
;W[ni];B[oe];W[pe];B[ng];W[of];B[nf];W[ne]C[MM: Too greedy, this ends up hurting White and strengthening Black.]
;B[od];W[oc];B[me]C[MM: I think I would play the O16 connection instead, so white's Q16 is not sente.  It gives white a handful of ko threats, but I think Black is safe enough, and keeping sente is worth the risk.]
;W[pd];B[nd];W[di]C[MM: Good, about time!];B[dj]C[MM:  Excellent.  Strengthens black and threatens white.  Superb.]
;W[ej];B[ci];W[dh];B[ko];W[kp];B[jo];W[jp]TR[qq][qr][qm]C[MM: Black does need to help the drifting stones, but all in all, I think the last two black moves did a favor for white.  Now white's lower side is very strong, and large. Black would probably do better with R3 or R2, or perhaps first R7, which looks like sente.  On the other hand, this tend to isolate the whites in the upper left, so that's good for black.]
;B[ho];W[hl]C[MM: Excellent!  Make sure to have room for eyes, at the same time threaten to cut black to shreds.]
;B[qq]C[MM:  Finally.];W[rn];B[ro];W[qn];B[qo];W[jl];B[bq]TR[kk]
[ik]C[MM:  ?  Why not L9 or J9?];W[cq];B[cp];W[bg];B[cr];W[dr]
;B[br];W[aj]C[MM: This looks risky to me, the black triangle is strong and white is thin, black can reduce white in sente - var.]

(;B[bj];W[ai]
(;B[bl]C[MM: Black does not have to lose so many points on the west side - var.]
;W[ak];B[al];W[bk];B[ck]C[MM: Go back to variations at move 76 - a11 - and compare Black's territory.]
;W[bh];B[og];W[pf];B[pm];W[pl];B[rm]C[MM: Nice reduction.];W[qm]
;B[sn];W[rl];B[mj];W[mi];B[mk];W[nk]TR[li]C[MM:  ?? Why not M11?]
;B[nj];W[oj];B[li];W[lk];B[ml];W[kk]TR[ik]C[MM: Black at J9 now would hurt, I think.]
;B[kl];W[jk];B[nm];W[km];B[gk]TR[jm]C[MM: It's worth defending against the sqeeze, maybe even K7 works. Since Black didn't defend, White should play the squeeze, var.]

(;W[hk];B[gi]C[MM:  Good];W[hi];B[ek]
(;W[fj]C[MM: White's weak group is shrinking a lot. Maybe G10 instead - var.]
;B[gj];W[gh]
(;B[fk]TR[ei][eh]C[MM: Black can pressure White more forcefully by sacrificing a stone at E11and E12 - var.]
;W[fh]C[MM: Good];B[qr]C[MM: Huge!]
(;W[dd]C[MM: If my rough count is correct, the two sides are about even now.  I think White could get ahead with a corner invasion - var.]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[fd];W[ce];B[bd];W[be]C[MM: Black ends up with a nice corner. I think White could have reduced, and probably gone on to win.]
;B[fe]TR[or][nb]C[MM: Better to play the E15 atari, I think. For now the White group has two eyes, but there are a lot of cutting points. Depending on how things progress, Black may be able to capture part of the group. However, if Black plays the E15 atari, it is gote. So probably it would be best to leave this area alone for the moment, and come back later.  Instead take a big point like P2 or O18.]
;W[ee]C[MM: Now White has an eye at E15 and fewer cutting points, prompted by F15. But Black has sente, so it's probably an fair trade.]
;B[gf]C[MM: Seems too small.];W[gg];B[ii];W[pg]
(;B[oq]C[MM: Close, but P2 is better.  O2 might even work, though it looks unorthodox.]
;W[or];B[np];W[mq];B[lo];W[mp]TR[ob][sm]C[MM: Too small, try P18 instead, or the T7 capture.]

;B[ep];W[dp];B[do];W[eq];B[fq];W[fr];B[fo];W[ds];B[nb]C[MM: Excellent!]
;W[ob];B[hm];W[io];B[in];W[jn];B[ln]C[MM: Good defense against the snapback]
;W[im];B[hn];W[bi];B[gl];W[ij];B[ki];W[ch];B[dl]TR[cl]C[MM: Good.  Playing C8 instead would eliminate a big white ko threat there, but this is ok for now.]

;W[os]C[MM: Oops.];B[es]C[MM: Good!  That's about a 14-point swing in the score, or about 66% of the 21.5 pts. that White lost by.]
;W[fs];B[er];W[hr];B[qs];W[cm];B[cl];W[rp];B[po]C[MM: Good defense]
;W[qp];B[rq];W[sp];B[nn]TR[kn][sq]C[MM: Better to go ahead and capture with T3, Black will have to capture anyway when White plays L6.  Just capture now, save a point, and deprive White of a sente endgame move or a huge ko threat.]

Result: B+21.5

MM: Though there are tactical and strategic things both players could have done better, I feel it was a well matched game that either player could have won.  I would advise both players to keep playing of course, but also to focus on life and death problems.  In addition to the obvious benefits, it will help refine the sense of strong and appropriate shape.  Both players already are developing this, we know because they mostly avoided empty triangles and snapbacks... but it's something both players need to improve.  Second, I recommend both players make a conscious effort to keep sente, especially in the endgame.  Black did a little better keeping sente, maybe that's why Black won?
Thanks for the chance to review this game, it was a lot of fun!
