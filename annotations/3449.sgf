AB[pd][dp]C[Hello,
my name is Arnold and I´m looking forward for the review.
Right away, I´d say the game was good, but I made some mistakes that I afterwards thought about. I found some alternatives that I would appreciate to be rated.
(Maybe you (reviewer) could spot my weak points during the game, if that´s not too much effort)

So thanks in advance.

Hi, I've tried my best to answer questions, and point out mistakes in the various stages of the game. I've also added a lot of variations. Please turn off "Show next move" option (or similar option).

My replies will be shown with "GY:"];W[dd];B[qp];W[fq];B[cn]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[jp]LB[iq:a][hp:b]C[GY: Unusual. Normally, White plays at 'a' or 'b'. I've shown a few variations that can be bad for White here.

See variation at point 'a'.]
(;B[op]
(;W[nq]TR[op][qp]LB[mq:a]C[GY: Too close to the marked stones. White can play at 'a' to retain initiative. (See variation)
 (Second variation showshow Black can take advantage of this move)]

(;B[oq];W[np];B[pj];W[po]LB[nc:a][om:b]C[GY: An overplay. See variation to see how Black can take advantage of this move. A better choice for White would be to approach at 'a' or 'b'.]

(;W[bd]C[Beside the whole opening what isn´t bad at all (I think) this is the first mistake of me. I added a variation.

GY: In the actual game, you could have still killed Black at Move 52.  Also look at the variation you provided, there is a flaw in it.]

;B[fa];W[ga];B[da]LB[ba:a]C[GY: Black is not alive yet...If White plays at 'a', White can kill Black.]

(;W[ef];B[fd];W[fe];B[gd];W[hd]C[There´s another point that repeated itself during the game:
I started several ladder that B would definitely win.

GY: There's no need to worry about this group just yet. White can live easily enough, and can resume attacking later.]

;W[fl];B[eq];W[er];B[cr];W[en];B[jq]C[This is always something I´m afraid of: how handle such an invasion? And how to kill B in a way that is good for W?

GY: Well, large, loose areas are often easily invaded, but in this case, I believe White has a method of killing Black, utilising the White thickness nearby.]

C[Here I had some territory in the middle but B had an enormous right side I think. So I decided to invade.
( How to count or estimate territory ( own and that of opponent?) Are there any methods or books?)

GY: I think reduction would work better here, an invasion would just help Black strengthen . (For books, try visiting http://gobooks.info It's a bibliography of Go books, read the descriptions, as for counting on your own, it can be done...Simply count :) )]

(;W[qc]C[GY: I wouldn't recommend this...I'm not that good at counting, but I think the outcome of the variation is very bad for White. See variation for Black's method of getting a good result, and the oher variation on how to reduce.]

So are there any good points left on the board for W?
I didn´t see any and so I resigned

GY: I didn't see any either.];B[bl]C[I hope you (reviewer) help me with my questions.
Thanks in advance.

GY: In my opinion, the main reason behind White's loss is misjudgement and misreading. That can happen to anyone, really. 

I have tried my best to answer all questions, and show variations (sorry if the variations are too excessive). 

Please contact me if you have further questions.])
