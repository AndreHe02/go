C[Dear reviewer:

  In this game, we had a lot of heavy fighting,
 I would like your opinion on some positions.
 Also, if either side could have played strategically better?

 please see questions in SGF file.

Thanks!

Hi!

I am Peter from Germany. My nick on KGS is go4fun. Feel free to contact me either way.
I am a local 1 dan, so don't ake my comments too serious. 
It was fun to review the game. Thank's a lot.
It was really a fighting game.
I think after the white attack for the big black group white was a little ahead. 
The game was decided by some blunder mover in the endgame. That was a pity.

Have fun with the review.

;B[jp];W[qn];B[qp];W[qk];B[np];W[qf]C[g4: Too far.];B[nc]C[g4: What about R11?
This creates 2 weak white groups.];W[rd];B[qc]C[g4: Probably OK now. White has to come back to defend the weakness at R11, so black gets sente.]
;W[pi]C[good for W?
g4: This position is very low and white looses sente.
Instead of R14 I would have played R12 or tenuki.];B[rc]C[premature? if yes how to punish?
g4: This is far to small now. White should ignore this and take another big point on the board.]
;W[jd]C[is shimari better?
g4: This is a matter of taste. 
From the theoretical point of view a shimari is better than the extension. 
In this situation I would play the shiimari at C15 because black has no good invasion point on the left.]
;B[de];W[fd]C[g4: This could be expected. Now black can settle himself easily and white has to add a move to cover the weakness of H16.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[ch]C[g4: This is understandable but leaves too many weaknesses. There is one at H16, now at C9 and because white stopped playing the joseki there is another weak point at E17.]

(;B[bb]C[g4: This plays into white's hands. What about E17? (see var)]
;W[eb]C[g4: Better to connect at D18. C19 is too good for black.]
;B[dg]C[g4: C19 is a must. This settles the group immediately.]
;W[bf]C[is this too radical for W?
g4: I don't think so. But it is threatening not much.C15 isn't a threat. So black can ignore this move and continue with C19 and D12 or even C9 or D10 instead of D12.]
;B[be]C[g4: Not necessary.];W[cf];B[df]C[g4: Now blacke looses sente for let's say 4 points.]
;W[ce];B[bd]C[g4: This is bad. Sacifice one stone at B15 and connect at D16!]
;W[dd]C[g4: Now black has a floating group.];B[cg]C[g4: This looses one liberty. Better to avoid this move. Play these moves only if you want to cut.]
;W[bg];B[dh];W[ci];B[di];W[ba]C[g4: Now black looses the corner. White could have also played D10 to create territory on the left side and attack black's center group. This could be more fun.]
;B[ac];W[ae];B[cj]
(;W[bi]C[g4: Better to leave this unplayed. B12 is better as it gets virtually the corner.]
;B[bj];W[ah]C[g4: A14 is necessary.];B[af];W[ag]C[w C19 is better here?]
;B[aj];W[ai];B[ad];W[dj]C[g4: This is worth nothing. White should leave the situation and try to create a really big ko threat or create several ko threats. Or use this as a threat to play some cutting moves.]
;B[af]C[LPDavid [4k\]: butter have a real good threath for that one :)]
;W[oc]C[any bigger threats?
g4: Nothing! This is not bad but far too small.]
(;B[bh]C[g4: This is not necessary now. White can't win the fight now. P16 is far better. (see var)]
;W[od];B[pe]C[g4: Better at S15 to be sure of life.];W[oe];B[pf]

C[you can stop here, the game is clearly lost for W

g4: This seems to be right but if you count you will notice that the game is close. White gained a lot during the fight. All his group are safe. There is a wall in the center neutralizing black's thickness on the left.
Let's count.
Black:
left: 12, top right 11, bottom left 3, bottom right 3 + 13 prisoners = 42 points for sure.
White:
top 8, bottom left10, bottom 5, right side 5 + 6 prisoners = 33 points for sure. 
And white's center is very thick. So I think the game is in white's favour now!

Try to understand what happened during the fight. White creates a wall (the marked stones) and black just manages to live with his big group gainig nothing but 3 points.
Compare this to the situation on the board at move 113 and you will see the difference.]
