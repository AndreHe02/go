Arcin Bozkurt:
I will appreciate if you can explain the moves of the 1k player. He had 6 stones disadvantage and managed the make it even. Definitely  there were ways I could play better and punish him for the risks he  has taken during the play. Where are those points?


Review by Jadoube 3kyu UK

Arcin, the first thing to remember is that 1kyu is expected to recover a 6 stone handicap against a 7kyu.

White will take some risks to catch up. Genertally white will try to separate black into many groups and attack them.

I think you should be less eager to kill and be happy making territory or strength while chasing a running group.

In fights I suggest working to avoid wasted moves. Focus on cutting and surrounding. 

You seem to be too worried about dangers from a strong opponent. As a result you make safety moves which are not needed. This gives white the time to escape.]

(;B[on]C[J:

I think the black group on the right is safe enough so P6 must be intending to attack.

But white can either live with S3 or has room to run away so this is not a strong attack. As you found white ignored this and took sente.]
