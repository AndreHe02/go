C[I play w in this game.  Thanks for your time for reviewing this game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc]LB[nc:B][de:A][dp:1]C[This move is a bit aggressive.  I was thinking of retracting a bit at A instead so that it aligns with 1 better.  However, I was thinking of probing at B later; then, the stone at B would align better with this move.  What do you think?

[patrickb\] This is a perfectly reasonable move. It invites a black approach at A or C15, which you can then make a good pincer on.]
;B[ce]C[bakaneko [?\]: thanks];W[fd]LB[gc:B][fd:C][dh:A]C[I was thinking of A for a moment, but I was afraid of b's B or C, if I go at A.  So, I played this safe move.

[patrickb\]: Neither B nor C are concerns (see the variations). A white play at A here is good, but playing as you did is reasonable as well.]
;B[dg];W[nc]LB[pd:1][cj:A]C[I thought about A to put the pressure on b while at the same time making use of my lower stone.  But I thought I should take away b's options of developing his 1 stone toward both the upper side or right side.  So, I played this stone to limit his options.

[patrickb\] Something like K17 would be very reasonable as well, expanding and reinforcing your upper side, limiting his options there, and preparing for a later move at C10 or C11.]
;B[ld];W[ne]LB[ld:2][pd:1]C[I was hoping this move would kill either 1 or 2.  I was mistaken.

[patrickb\] It's a big mistake to think of *killing* one of the two stones. Simply making one of them weak would be very reasonable, since you could get profit from that. This move is, however, a good move, since it keeps the two stones separated.]
;B[pf];W[jc]LB[jd:A]C[maybe I should have gone at A instead?

[patrickb\] Yes, A would have been more severe. Here, black can attach at A to make better shape if he needs to.]
;B[lc];W[qc]C[Ok, I was just thinking of floating b's Q16 group while taking away some easy points.  But I think I was neglecting my O17 group, which will fall soon.

[patrickb\] You're being too aggresive thinking like that, and are going to make your own group weaker in the process, yes. Simply jumping atain to O13 is simple here. It threatens both black's heavy two-stone tower at M16 and a play around R12 later. See the variations.]
;B[pc]
(;W[qd]C[At this point, I had to protect my investment at the corner at the risk of losing my O17 stones.]
;B[qe];W[re]
(;B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]LB[rb:A]C[I've always wonder, is it better with this move or with playing at A instead?]
;B[nb];W[mb]C[This move is a desperate attempt at salvaging something out of a disaster.]
;B[mc];W[lb]C[I probably should have saved this move for a ko treat later.]

(;B[nd]C[So, this b's move doomed my effort here.];W[oq];B[pq]

(;W[oo]C[this is a greedy move?  I was thinking of creating a huge moyo on the bottom while capping his corner group.

[patrickb\]: Standing up at P4 is generally better if you have space on the bottom for a three-point extension, because now black can play P2 to undercut your "moyo".]
;B[or]C[patrickb: Which he correctly does.];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr]
;B[qn];W[pp]
(;B[qq]LB[po:A]C[I was surprised that b didn't go at A first.  Is this b's correct move?]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[pn];B[po];W[pm]
(;B[pi]
(;W[cj]C[This is a daring move, at least I sweated when I played it.  I was attempting him to attack this move!

[patrickb\] Black can slide into the corner for eyes to easily for this to be a useful attack. Make black a little overconcentrated and heavy by playing something like C16 first. This is also pretty  standard, and not really that daring.]
;B[bc]C[But he played it safe.];W[bg]C[So, I push an extra inch forward.]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[cl]C[Now he attacks it.  But I think it's a bit late since he already let me somewhat established myself.]
;W[ej]C[With this move, I prompted him the question: do you want the bottom or the top?]
;B[el]C[I think he chose correctly.];W[fg]C[I really wasn't so sure if this move will kill his top group, but at least it will connect by top and left group somewhat while giving me some center influence.

[patrickb\] There's no way you're going to kill him at the top when he can play C18, but you can box him in tightly and look to attack the two stones at the bottom for profit along the bottom.]
;B[cb];W[cc]LB[db:A][bd:B]C[I could've gone at A instead, but I decided to be agressive.  If he responds with B, then I could go at A and keep sente.]

(;B[db];W[ec]LB[eb:A]C[I think this is the only move.  A may not work for me.]
;B[eb]C[patrickb: And black makes a big mistake. :)];W[bd];B[cd]
;W[bb];B[eh]
(;W[di]LB[fh:A][dj:B]C[I was thinking of "killing it all" with A.  But I was afraid of the cut at B.  So I played this move to protect the cut.  His b group is still floating anyway even if I let him escape.  So I can continue to attack it while building up influences to attack his C8 group later on.

[patrickb\] How about connecitng solidly at C11, peeping at D7 and then setting up a double attack on the two black groups? Why settle for attacking one group when you can attack two? (See the variation)]
;B[fh];W[dh]
(;B[eg];W[cg]LB[ce:1][cf:A]C[I was thinking of A instead.  But I think I would come out in gote with that move.  And catching such the two stones at 1 is not incentive enough.

patrickb: This is just fine. All of your groups are now pretty strong, and black is heavy and weak. A wonderful situation for white.]
;B[df];W[gj]LB[df:1]C[This was the sente move I was looking for, when I allowed b to connect with 1.

patrickb: Again, peeping at D7 before jumping out here would have made this an even better move.]
;B[gg];W[ff];B[gi]C[patrickb: Don't ignore contact moves like this. See the variation.]

(;W[fp]LB[el:1]C[Now, I'm aiming for b's 1 group while grapping precious points below.

patrickb: Peep first to make him heavier.];B[jp]LB[el:1][jp:2]
C[I think this was b's mistake.  Now, he's giving me the next play to attack both 1 and 2.

patrickb: Yes, this is a tragically bad move by b.];W[gm]C[This play should be painful for b.]
;B[gl];W[hl]
(;B[hj];W[gk];B[fl];W[hn];B[jn]
(;W[kl]C[With this move, I'm putting a lot pressure on b's 1 group while building some center influence which I lack much.]
;B[mm];W[ln];B[lm];W[km];B[kn];W[mn]LB[lo:A]C[Should this move be at A instead?  I wasn't sure if this move or the A move would give me larger eyespace for my group there.

patrickb: A is generally better shape, yes. You also need consider the weakness at P4 here, as well as the cut at N3. those weaknesses mean killing black are going to be hard.]
;B[nm]C[patrickb: Letting white play O6 here and reinforce the cut is a really bad idea for b. he has too many irons in the fire.]
;W[nn];B[op];W[np];B[pp]
(;W[pk]LB[ok:A][nm:1][om:B][on:C]C[I think A would be the more agressive move, aiming to kill b's 1 group.  But I was afraid of b's probe at B to threaten the C cut.  I also wanted to invade b's right side, which is the majority of his points.

[patrickb\] There's still a weakness at N3 that can be a big problem.]
;B[nk];W[oj]C[This was almost an automatic response, not that it means it is the right response.]
;B[nj];W[oi];B[og];W[mh]C[At first I though this move was my declaration of victory, but he got one trick coming up.

patrickb: Weaken the heavy left side group by playing something like H12 before this. Look for opportunities for double attacks!]
;B[ni];W[nh];B[oh];W[li]LB[ok:A]C[I wasn't sure if I needed to worry about b's A.  I think I have enough space on the right side to escape and trap whatever he throws at me there.  So, I played this move to put the game on the line there.]
;B[pj];W[ok];B[om];W[on]
(;B[qm]LB[pl:A]C[Do you think b should've gone at A instead?

patrickb: I don't think he has enough liberties to pull it off.]
;W[pl]LB[ql:A]C[Do you think I should've gone at A instead?]
;B[lk];W[kk];B[lo]C[This is the beginning of his trick that I mentioned before at move 100.  I was surprised how quickly he was filling up my liberties!]
;W[lp];B[mo];W[mp];B[ko];W[no];B[kq];W[qj]LB[qj:1][lq:A]C[A probably was better?  It is sente at least.  But I was a bit greedy.  I was thinking this move at 1 would extend my liberties at the same time erasing his territory.

patrick: A is simple and good.];B[lq];W[mq];B[qi];W[rj];B[ql]
;W[qk]C[I started to get worry at this point.  My entire group has only 7 liberties left.

patrickb: How many does his have?];B[ri]
(;W[rl];B[lj];W[kj];B[ms]C[From this point on, I found a way to escape, although I wasn't sure if it was because of his mistake.]
;W[ls];B[lr];W[ns];B[os];W[ms];B[pr]C[patrickb: You still have enough liberties to kill him. He has no more than 4, and you have at least four, and its your move.]

(;W[jr]C[My escape move.];B[iq];W[hr]LB[ir:A]C[Could A worked too?]
;B[ir];W[is];B[jq];W[ks]LB[eb:3][qb:4][dg:2][cl:1]C[He resigned here.

I have a few question about the status of other groups on board:
1) b could easily take lower left corner with the 3-3 move there, correct?

Yes.

2) could b's 1 group live?

If white gets the first move, he would probably play at C4 to try and either take a big corner or live on the side.

3) could I kill b's 2 group?

Perhaps, but not easily.

4) could I kill b's 3 group?  Do I need sente to do so?

Yes. I'm not sure whether its alive even if b moves first. His best bet is G17, but even that is difficult.

5) is my 4 group unconditionally alive?

Yes.

And any additional comment on how I can make the next step in improving my game would be appreciated.

You seem to focus on one enemy group at a time as opposed to *creating* opportunities to attack two at once. When your opponent gives you a double attack, you take it, but there were plenty of chances here to set one up yourself.]
