;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj];W[gc]C[RM: White G17 does not feel correct. One of the points about
playing 3,3 or 4,4 openings is that the corner stones do not
need re-inforcing hastily. So whilst G17 certainly works well
with D16, it is not urgent. Playing elsewhere is better at this
time. O17 is common, D10 is also.];B[jd]
(;W[lc]C[This appears to have been a bad move.   Is this so?

RM: This stone has been placed into a dangerous place. There
is not enough room to make life here if black closes in. Also
the stone looks to low (close to the edge). M16 would attack
K16 better whilst allowing white to escape more easily. O17 might
prove better for this type of play (see variations). O3, K3,
K4 look simple and good.];B[nc];W[jc];B[ic];W[jb];B[ib];W[kd]
;B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[hd]C[RM: This move is pointless. It forces black to connect and become
stronger whilst reinfrocing white already strong G17 stone. Leaving
the possibility of J16 for later is a much better technique.
This is the sin of "aji keshi" which means to destroy a future
possibility.];B[id];W[he]C[RM: Removing the possible eye shape from black seems reasonable,
but I think the timing is wrong. Better to solidify the L16 group
first.];B[cc]C[RM: This time black's timing seems wrong. Black should strengthen
the K14 group whilst attacking white's K15 group. Taking a small
enclosed terratory in the corner is likely to strengthen white,
which in turn will make blacks J14 group difficult.];W[cd];B[dc]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[ed];W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[de];B[db]
;W[cg];B[cn];W[cl]C[RM: Good, works well with the upper group.]
;B[fq]C[Where should white play now?

RM: E5, D6 and F4 are all possible. Often it is said "attach
to the strong stone to attack the weak one". In this case this
might mean that white F4 will result in black F3 resisting, forcing
white's corner stones to get stronger also. Alter a few moves
we would then expect C6 to look weak in comparison to it neighbours.]

(;W[eq]C[RM: See variation];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq]
(;W[er]C[RM: I think this move is the wrong orientation. White should
be trying to make his upper area larger, whilst pushing black
flat to the lower side. F4 looks better ...];B[ep];W[bq];B[cr]
;W[br];B[eo]C[This seems to have worked out well for  me, as I have kept the
corner.  But black's  influence is large.  Who came out better
off here?

RM: If black gets to play F2 soon (it will be a sente move) then
black will have an excellent position. A wall for black facing
Q4 and Q10 makes for a serious potential terratory.];W[lh];B[kf]
;W[lf];B[me]C[RM: Aji keshi. Black should not strengthen white without good
reason.];W[le];B[jh];W[hh];B[bp];W[bo];B[co];W[ap];B[bn];W[do]
C[RM: Not good. Loss of sente. No point to play here. Note that
if white played elsewhere, black D5 IS NOT SENTE. If white ignores
b D5, black captures 2 stones and white retakes one to give a
stable position.];B[dn];W[bp];B[fr];W[cs];B[fn]C[RM: A good sequence for black. The wall from F2 to F6 is very
promising with Q4 and Q10. The wall B6 to F6 threatens C8 and
rapid reduction of white's terratory above C8.];W[ij];B[jj]
;W[em]C[RM: Good. J10 and E7 work well to protect whites moyo.]
;B[en];W[dl]C[RM: Wrong , leave E7 as "light" (allow it to be captured), and
play elsewhere such as O3.];B[ik];W[hj];B[hk];W[gk];B[gl];W[fk]

C[Is this a bad invasion?  I guess the timing  is bad, as it strengthens
black against my  weak group.

RM: You are right, bad timing. This move allows black to almost
certainly kill the M14 group.];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re]

position gives little hope for the M14 group.]
(;B[kb]C[RM: Black needs to be careful here due to the weakness at N17.
Playing the eye steal tesuji of M18 avoids white long sequence
to connect underneath at J19...];W[ja];B[lb];W[mc]

I was rather desparate.   You can ignore all the rest of the
moves.   I realize that they could not work.

At which point should I have changed my  direction of attack
too keep from getting  into this mess?

RM: Actualy white can link out with J19.
If J19 were not available then black must give up the L11 group
and play N10.];B[mh];W[lg];B[nj];W[nl];B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[kl]
