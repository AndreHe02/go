C[Note to reviewer:

I think I know why I lost, but I'm not sure of my own judgement. Plus, I'd really appreciate
some comments on the opening and have one or two other questions.

Olawi 6k*:

Hello Manuel,

I am not totally confident at reviewing fighting games such as this one, so my comments can be
misleading or plain erroneous at times. Try ty bear it :)   However, in this game there were some mistakes and oversights by both players, and I will focus my comments on those and try to elaborate on what I think could (and should) have been
played differently. I will also try and answer the spesific questions that you asked for.

[qk:C][pk:D]C[Immediately after playing this, I thought it looked odd? Would A have been better
with regard to my stone B?

Olawi 6k*: No, this is actually a very normal and common opening for black. Having a stone both at the star-point and the 3-4 -point (komoku) balances between territory and influence, security and power. The normal continuations are to either develop along the sides, or, make the so-called 'chinese opening', low or high, by playing at C or D, respectively.

Playing at A is also an option, the thinking being (in my opininon) that rather than approach the corner right away, white is likely to take the last vacant corner, after which black can either make a shimari in the LR corner or take the initiative and approach either one of white's corner stones.]
;W[cp]LB[qk:A][pk:B]C[Olawi 6k*:  Now, white is initially putting his money on security & territory. At this point, I would most likely make either of the chinese openings with A or B, but this is a matter of style. An approach move is definitely an option.

The main difference between these two approaches is that in making the chinese formation, black is holding back patiently, seeing how the opening will develop after this, and is not very badly off, since he played the first move. Making an approach move is the more active option here.]
;B[eq]C[Olawi 6k*: I feel that this is the right approach. I could be wrong :)]
;W[po]LB[qo:A][np:B]TR[qm][pl][cn][dn]C[Olawi 6k*: White is trying to take control of the opening. This is also a good move.   Now black has to choose from several options, and the choise is not easy, not for me anyway. A or B seem reasonable. Of course it is possible to start fighting immediately with any of the triangled moves, but I am not sure if this is wise. Fun though.]
;B[np]C[Olawi 6k*: This is a very good move, it makes white slightly uncomfortable and works well with the stone at E3. Bravo.]
;W[qq]C[Olawi 6k*: This is normal but..]
(;B[pp]C[Olawi 6k*: ...this is not. See variation for a dose of normality. This move only strengthens white unecessarily and makes black feel overconcentrated.]
;W[qp];B[pk]MA[pp]C[Olawi 6k*: This seems like an attempt to develop fast. However, why did you play Q4 (marked) if you were not going to  play P5 after that?]
;W[qm]LB[oo:A]C[Olawi 6k*: White is not punishing you enough. It seems possible (and reasonable) to play A at this point.]
;B[de]C[Olawi 6k*: This is also fast. P5 is still crying to be played.]
;W[ce]LB[cf:A]C[Olawi 6k*: Here, a reasonable development would be A. (See variation)]

(;B[dd];W[cd]C[Olawi 6k*: This begins the so-called 'avalanche' variations. I will not go through all of them, and I am definitely not encouraging you to rote-learn them, but I have included some in the variations, just as food for thought.]
;B[ec]LB[eb:A][cc:B][df:C][cf:D]C[Olawi 6k*: After this, white has 4 basic options (A,B, C and D). A and B are peaceful, C and D lead into complications, eventually. I will not go into D, since I'm only 6k* after all :)]

(;W[df]C[Olawi 6k*: This is the so-called 'small avalanche' see variations.]

(;B[fe]LB[dd:A][cc:B]C[The sequence seemed natural to me, but the resulting form doesn't feel good.

Where should A have been played instead? Or do you disagree?

Olawi 6k*: Yes, this is a mistake. See the previous variations for 'normal' continuations. This move makes you overconsentrated and gives white a large corner. You should have taken advantage of white's cutting points by playing at B.]
;W[cc]C[Olawi 6k*: White is happy.];B[gc]LB[eb:A]C[Ok?

Olawi 6k*: Not so. Your stones are overconcentrated. Playing at A is better.]
;W[kq];B[hq]LB[iq:A]C[Olawi 6k*: This is good. It makes your group safe and attacks the lone white stone. Not too severely though. A would lead into more complicated fighting.]
;W[dq]LB[eq:A][hq:B][ep:C]C[Does this and the following make my three stones too close? Should I have anticipated the move
and played B somewehere else? Where?

Olawi 6k*: Yes, your stones are slightly overconcentrated, but they are also strong, which is important. Of course white gets the corner, but I do not see anything alarming in this alone.]
;B[ep]C[Olawi 6k*: This of course is the only move.];W[ko]LB[cn:A]
[co:B]MA[np][pp][pq]C[Olawi 6k*: Basically white should have continued at A, so playing B might be appropriate. Of course the marked stones are getting weaker and weaker all the time, so your continuation is OK as well.]
;B[nn]C[Olawi 6k*: This move makes them strong again.];W[cn]
MA[ko][kq]LB[km:A]C[Olawi 6k*: No chance to play C5 anymore. Should attack the marked stones. I would possibly play A to try and make a HUGE moyo at the top, but this is not recommended if you are not a moyo-freak.]
;B[en]C[Olawi 6k*: A mistake in direction. What are you trying to do? Force white into making territory at the left side while leaving his weak stones unattacked?]
;W[mq]C[Olawi 6k*: White of course makes a base while stealing yours, and is quite happy.]
;B[nq];W[ir];B[hr];W[iq];B[km]C[Olawi 6k*: Finally it comes, but much too late. Since white now has some sort of a base, the attack is not so severe.]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[ho];B[gn];W[nc];B[lc]C[Olawi 6k*: Good, this is correct. White is almost forced to enter the corner and give you a wall.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[The following sequence is horrible.

Where did it go wrong? I wanted to separate the White stones. Is this at all possible?

Olawi 6k*: Yes, this is the correct way to separate white's stones and should give you a good result. The mistake came later.]
;W[qd]
(;B[qe]LB[pe:A]C[Should this have been A? How would the sequence have gone?

I can only think of the variation given, which doesn't look good to me.

Olawi 6k*: This move should definitely have been at A. This mistake seems to be quite common, so don's worry. See variation for a comment.]

(;W[pe]C[Olawi 6k*: This might be too prudent, given black's thickness. See variation for a more suitable punishment.]
;B[oe];W[pf];B[of];W[pg]LB[od:A]C[Olawi 6k*: At this point black should connect at A. It is not pretty, but hey, it was a mistake to play R15 in the first place.]
;B[og];W[pb]C[Olawi 6k*: White ruins a lot of territory at the top with this move.]
;B[oc]LB[nd:A]C[Awful. What else?

Olawi 6k*: Just play A. Black can not hold white back more than that anyway.]
;W[ob];B[od];W[rb];B[ph]C[Olawi 6k*: This, of course is a necessary point.]
;W[rf];B[mb];W[kd]LB[gi:A]C[Olawi 6k*: Overplay. "Only an idiot neglects to connect against a peep.", goes the proverb.
However, white has to reduce black's moyo. Reducing around A is possible, but an invasion like this might be necessary. If only it lives.]
;B[ld]C[Olawi 6k*: White does not connect but black does not cut?]
;W[kf]C[Olawi 6k*: White is trying to escape lightly into the center. This is risky business, but if he lives or escapes, he will win this game.]
;B[kh];W[ig]LB[if:A][ih:B]C[Olawi 6k*: White is trying to play lightly. The entire game depends on the fight for these stones from now on. As white, I would rather play A or B.]
;B[gg];W[ie]C[Olawi 6k*: not very good really, white should keep on running.]
;B[jc]C[Olawi 6k*: Taking away his base, good.];W[ii];B[kj]

C[I am quite pleased I chose the Ko here, because I seldom dare to play
Ko moves. Am I rightly pleased?

Olawi 6k*: Since white chose not to fight the ko, the result was very good for you.]
;W[lh];B[kj];W[ji];B[lg];W[mh];B[kg]C[Olawi 6k*: Yes, this is a good result (locally) for black.]

(;B[kn]LB[hj:A][in:B]C[I guess that should have been A instead.

I think this is where I lost, right?

What I actually played seems completely unnecessary now,  I cannot recall my reason for this move. Can you think of a possible
one so that I might recognize similar situations in the future?

Olawi 6k*: Perhaps you were afraid that white will cut at where you played or at B? The only way to be sure is to count all the variations, which is not easy. Trust your instinct.]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[gh];B[fh];W[hg];B[gj];W[hj];B[ch]TR[fj][fi][fh]
[gj][el][gg]LB[cg:A][cl:B][qh:C]C[I wanted to do something based on the marked stones.

This move seems not so good though.

Should I have played elsewhere? Or maybe there but on a  different point? Where?

Olawi 6k*: You cannot expect to make a lot of territory at the bottom, but this move neverthless makes some. Since white is now alive at the center, he is leading the game. The only thing left to try here is to try to kill the white group at the bottom, but since it cannot be killed, the game seems lost. I cannot guarantee the result, however :)

A, B and C seem like good points.];W[cl]C[I really do not have any more direct questions from now on.   But a general remark on my playing style would be most welcome.

I think I made a lot of tactical and endgame errors in the following, but
really can not categorize them.

If you had some suggestions as to how I might improve in these fields or  could point out some common features about my errors, I would be most grateful.

Thank you very much in advance for taking the time to review my game.

  Manuel Reiter];B[bf];W[cf];B[cg]LB[bg:A]C[Olawi 6k*: A is better.]
;W[be];B[ag];W[eb]C[Olawi 6k*: At this point, white is leading the game by at least 20 points, so the only thing to do is to try to kill something, which at this point is impossible. End of comments.]
