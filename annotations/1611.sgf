C[Reviewed by Tom Obenchain (RazorBrain) 13k. Reviewed for black.

As requested I will try to focus mostly on the following three
questions:

1. Were you "conned" because of unorthodox opening play?

2. How could you have extricated yourself from the early fighting
to focus on the whole board?

3. What strategic priorities were ignored during the fights you
participated in?

I'll also add what other comments I can as I see opportunities.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a sort of game that I'd like to get a handle on.

In a way, I feel like I was "conned" out of this game. Clearly,
my opponent was better at close fighting than I am, and once
an early fight got started he stayed way ahead of me.

The reason I say I felt "conned" out of the game, however, is
that I don't sense that his play was really in accord with sound
principles. He didn't follow the sort of opening development
that I see in the books.

This makes me feel like I should have somehow been able to extricate
myself from the immediate fighting and return to developing territory.
But even when I tried to cut my losses and do so, I found myself
back in the fighting. By submitting this game, I guess I'm asking
more about my short-sightedness in a strategic sense than my
tactical mistakes (though I'll certainly take suggestions there,
as well.)

My rating on IGS is currently 24k, but I've only played a few
games there and it hasn't settled down yet. I've played more
on KGS, where I'm 23k. I'm 25k in AGA play after my first tournament.

(Actually, the sort of opponent I was playing in this game on
IGS puzzles me. They can have well over 1000 games logged - just
on that one server - yet they're playing at the 24k level. They're
usually able to take advantage of my inexperience, if nothing
else.)];B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[qi];W[dk];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd]
;W[hd]TR[fc]C[Q1: The opening to this point is very normal. Move 10 at H16
is also a standard reduction move. Had White played one line
higher at H17, it would have been more of an invasion aiming
at taking territory at the top or perhaps severing the marked
stone.]
(;B[ge]LB[fe:B][hc:A]C[Q1: Your response at G15 is very aggressive, aiming to cut off
the marked H16 stone and build territory. However, I think the
knight's move here is not a strong enough connection with the
marked Black stone. I believe this is the beginning of your troubles.
I do think a response is appropriate here. Perhaps at (A). I
think this would give you a favourable result. You would make
territory at the top and White would gain power or thickness
to the outside. This is very fair, especially if you get the
first big move at the bottom. 

Or better yet, if you're looking for adventure, (B) still attacks
the white stone but is much
stronger should White try to cut through as he did in the actual
game. (See variation.)];W[he]LB[hf:B][gd:A]TR[ge]C[Q2: White's move at H15 sets up the coming attack on the marked
black stone. However, you could have easily avoided the problem
by playing at (A) instead of the Hane at (B). This would have
left you in a situation similar to the one after the last variation.
(See Variation.)

Q3: My thought at this point is that like many high kyu players
you want it all. You want to attack and kill the enemy stones
and make territory at the same time. But Go is all about give
and take. Eventually, we all have to learn this, but for most
it does not come naturally and must be worked at. Try to focus
on pressuring your opponent's weak groups to build a favourable
position for yourself. Always going for the throat often yields
only trouble. I believe you over play, meaning get too aggressive
in much of your close fighting in this game. I will comment again
when I se another example]
(;B[hf];W[gd]TR[ge]C[Q2: Now the marked black stone is attacked on two sides. Black
must play at F15 to prevent even worse trouble. But in so doing
Black has left some of his army behind at F17. Black has allowed
White to split his force!];B[fe];W[fd];B[hc];W[ec];B[gc]C[Q2: Now White is in the driver's seat. So let's watch for an
opportunity to cut Black's losses and recover some of the loss
by getting in a big strategic move.];W[eb];B[ee];W[ed]C[)];B[jf]
C[Q2: Now that Black's groups are split, White can attack both.
Here Black chooses to work to connect to the marked stones. But
when White attacks the three stones at the top, Black wants to
save those too. Again, Black cannot have it all.];W[ic]
(;B[ib]LB[jc:A]C[Q2: a play at (A) would have solidified Black's hold on the upper
right and given him Sente to make that big move else where. (See
Variation.)];W[id];B[jc];W[hb];B[gb];W[jb];B[ha];W[kb];B[lb]
C[Q2: Black is playing too close. Contact play is better left for
defensive play. White forces a positive result here by consistently
pressuring weak black stones.];W[lc];B[mb];W[kc];B[kd];W[md]
C[Again, White has managed to split black. This nearly always leads
to trouble. Black can avoid this by backing off, surrendering
a bit of territory and solidifying his position. Then he can
attempt to regain some of the loss in a later.];B[mc];W[ld]

[hc][ib][ja][ha]MA[jc][jd][kd]C[White finishes his splitting attack by capturing the three black
stones marked with (x). Now his stones are definately alive and
the marked stones (triangles) are dead for sure.];B[kf];W[ke]

(;B[ph]LB[oh:A]C[Close Fighting: I believe your goal here was to  solidify the
upper right. Try play firmer moves likP12 at (A). It will do
what you want without leaving the weakness that this move does.

C[The entire series of moves starting with #56 are not good for
White, except for the fact that Black played in such a way that
White was able to cut him apart to his advantage. This is not
strong play on White's part. It is opportunistic play, however
capitalising on Black's reactive play.

Here's a summary on the three questions:

Q1: I think White's opeing play was fairly normal. THe early
fighting brought the game into an early start on the middle game.
But Black had as much to do with the first fight starting as
did White.

Q2: I commented onthis several times throughout the game. In
summary then, Black must learn to play in a way that still accomplishes
the goals of containing whites advances but does not leave a
string of weakness, such as cutting points and stranded groups.
Then, at appropriate times, Black must take profit from larger
strategic playes in other ares of the board. Essentially, black
plays a very reactive game. This makes it too easy for White
to anticipate Black's moves. And as Napoleon once said, "Never
interrupt your opponent when he is making a mistake." :-)

Q3: While I've hinted at some possible answers to this question
I have not really put it to bed yet. Essentially, early fighting
can be risky, especially if you are drug into fights without
considering the whole-board consequences. Once started players
can become so focused on saving or killing the immeadiate groups
involved in the fight that that are oblivious to the strategic
consequences. It this game however, I think that Black's early
problems yielded a compensating power in the middle. But before
Black could do somethign with this he was drawn into another
fight that ended up giving White a foothold on the right. But
even so, the game was not completely over, as white did not gain
much territory from this invasion. Had Black established himself
at the bottom, he may still have gotten a reasonable result,
though he would have been coming from behind. Just remember
that at this level, keep playing so as to give your opponent
the opportunity to make a mistake and return the favour to you.
:-)

Most of all remember that it's not just about winning or losing.
Often overly aggressive play and early fighting comes from an
intense desire to win. So, when an opponent invades, the feeling
arises that the invasion must be crushed. However, if a player
focuses on simply playing the best Go he or she can, the pressure
of having to win subsides, somewhat anyway, and that player can
then focus on making the right strategic move rather than reacting
out of fear of losing. This attitude still does not come easily
for me, but when I focus on it, I play better and enjoy the game
more, won or lose. (Don't get me wrong. I like to win!)
