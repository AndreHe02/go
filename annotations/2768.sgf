REQUEST FOR REVIEW
White (me): Raine [16k KGS\]
Black: lcninja [19k KGS\]

I (White) ended up winning this game by 17.5 moku, but I should have lost by a huge margin.  I'm submitting this game for several reasons.

First of all, I'd like some comments on my fuseki and direction of play.  I'm beginning to get a feel for it, but I still feel like I'm lacking.

Second of all, I tried a new strategy that involves me ignoring many plays to make a larger moyo elsewhere.  It didn't really work because I needed more stones to defend the territory I created in the center and sides than my opponent needed in the corners.

Third of all, we reviewed this game ourselves, and I'd like to know if our insight is correct or if we aren't necessarily thinking of the proper things to improve.  The comments preceded by our name and rank were made during the in game review.  I've cleaned them up a bit to preserve readability.

Thank you for taking the time to review this game.

--

Rich: Interesting to see your comments, thanks. There are three key points to take from this:

1 - don't attack an opponent by playing next to his stones. Contact plays are defensive, and help both sides settle their groups. attack from a distance, hem your opponent in, take away his space for eyes. Or, if you're weak, attach on to your opponent's stones and stabilise yourself

2- when fighting in close, cut your opponent's stones apart when you can, join yours up when you can. 

3- don't worry about estimating the score too closely... the guesses I saw in-game seemed quite different to my estimates.

If you haven't already read it, I'd really suggest Kageyama's book, Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go. I think you've got to a level where it would be useful, and it's a great read!

Thanks for submitting the game, if you have any further questions, please ask!]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq]
(;W[dq]C[Raine [16k\]: I made a few too; you weren't the only one.
lcninja [19k\]: I dunno if this is true, but at go club a guy said you should attack the other player immediately if they play 3x4 3x4

Rich: It's a good guideline, but only if you know why. It's like Joseki - it's no good knowing a move's not joseki, if you can't punish it! :)

However, don't get too hung up on fuseki. Even at much higher levels than we amateurs play at, it's fairly theoretical, and somewhat down to personal taste. As a double-digit kyu, as long as you play reasonably, you can make up for any early mistakes later by playing well.]

(;B[pk]C[Rich: see variation];W[cn]C[lcninja [19k\]: I thought this move was so so
Raine [16k\]: I see pros do a lot of corner enclosures right at the beginning.
lcninja [19k\]: The corner was already your strong corner
Raine [16k\]: I wanted to try it.
lcninja [19k\]: Okay

=====

I'm thinking that pros do this because they know how to neutralize large scale moyos such as black has right now and the small enclosure is the only way to get territory and strength.  At my strength D9 might have been a better play.

Rich: At any strength, D9 or C9 could be better; a large shimari seems a bit of a compromise play, not quite securing the corner tightly, not quite influencing the left side. 

However, I wouldn't play a shimari here because it encourages black to play K4 (to counteract the direction of your shimari) and build up a real moyo.]
;B[cf];W[fc]C[Rich: I'd have pincered here. You're strong on the left, make him work for it! :)]
;B[bd];W[ci]LB[bd:B][fc:A]C[Rich: Now you've pincered, but swapped A for B... try reordering the moves - if you'd pincered and he'd played B, you wouldn't have played A, would you? This is quite a subtle point, but important.

Having said that, there is a joseki here, if 10 were played at C12. This is a bit tighter for black, and it's a good joseki for white to develop thickness.]
;B[cc]C[Raine [16k\]: After K3 I had a lot of power down there.
lcninja [19k\]: Thanks for that whole corner..
Raine [16k\]: You can have it.
lcninja [19k\]: I guess you were going for influence
Raine [16k\]: My side is worth more.
Raine [16k\]: Plus I have better center.
lcninja [19k\]: I get a lot of whites side later
Raine [16k\]: Yes, you do.  {smile}
lcninja [19k\]: Having a corner to work from gives you points
lcninja [19k\]: or at min takes the other persons
Raine [16k\]: Continue attacking your weak group.
lcninja [19k\]: name a spot
Raine [16k\]: D14 or some such.

Rich: Stop right there! Contact plays are very bad for attacking groups like this. Contact plays should be used to defend groups; attacking is better done at a slight distance. However, black's group is fairly stable here.]

(;W[jq]C[lcninja [19k\]: I expected you to move here]
(;B[mp]C[Raine [16k\]: Maybe a seal would have been better here.
lcninja [19k\]: This enclosure I like personally
Raine [16k\]: It's nice...  Gives a lot of central power.
lcninja [19k\]: I use it to attack the center and gain territory
lcninja [19k\]: I dunno how good it is, but right now its a staple
lcninja [19k\]: yes
lcninja [19k\]: you can also attack in the direction you want territory

Rich: This is an OK play, but see var. for options - you don't need to respond here.]

(;W[jc]C[lcninja [19k\]: This was goodish
Raine [16k\]: D14 is much better.

Rich: Either is good; D14 stabilises your group, but makes your stone at C11 weaker, while this is safer but doesn't pressure black.]

Raine [16k\]: Obviously, or you wouldn't have pushed so much. {smile}
lcninja [19k\]: yup :)
lcninja [19k\]: I just wanted to eat as much of your side as I could
lcninja [19k\]: which I did];W[cj]C[I'm aiming at B9 here, but I really need to strike at R12 or R13.

Rich: You don't need to invade, necessarily... you could reduce his moyo by playing around O13 and building your centre. However, black has the advantage then... and if you're stronger, you want to be fighting more.]
;B[ng]C[Raine [16k\]: Great timing.
lcninja [19k\]: Had ot make sure I had lots of territory first ;)]
;W[jg]C[This fits with my overall strategy, but it's too defensive.  Black has half of the board, and I have less than half.  Also, my territory is central, and I'm going to have to spend a lot of time defending it.  Perhaps this would be better at R6 or R12.

Rich: There are still good invasion points in the moyo to the right. When you invade, you have to attach to the opponent's stones, and be willing to throw some of your stones away to make life. 

Remember, if you want to make territory (like in the center top here), don't invade in the top right - even if you live, he'll be much stronger in the centre because of it!]
;B[fp];W[fn];B[dp];W[cp]C[My weaknesses are really starting to become apparent.  I simply don't have enough stones to defend every front at once.

Rich: This early in the game, you don't need it. Apart from the top left corner, neither side has much solid territory. Go's about give and take... let black live, as long as you get something out of it!]

lcninja [19k\]: but this move was better for you

Rich: ? This weakens your bottom stones... not necessarily a bad move, but strengthening your opponent makes your nearby stones comparatively weaker.]

(;B[jr]C[Raine [16k\]: F3 is better, I think.
lcninja [19k\]: well
lcninja [19k\]: I'm not sure
lcninja [19k\]: I had a plan and I executed it
Raine [16k\]: Though I could be wrong...  If that lives, your move would be better.
lcninja [19k\]: This plan was that I didn't hope to take your stones (its hard to do
lcninja [19k\]: I wanted to just give you no territory
Raine [16k\]: {nod}
lcninja [19k\]: which is what I did
lcninja [19k\]: maybe I should have fought more

Rich: This white group probably shouldn't survive... but a very important rule in fighting is to cut where you can cut, and connect where you can connect. In this case, black should separate the G3 group from the corner, as white can connect up any time with E2. See var.]
;W[fq];B[ep]C[Rich: this is possibly the worst move of the game... firstly because it doesn't need to be made (there's no danger of white playing here or cutting you off) and secondly, because E2 would capture the group!]
;W[fr];B[er];W[es]C[lcninja [19k\]: J 2 is necessary
lcninja [19k\]: otherwise you play it and get 6 points
Raine [16k\]: Why?
lcninja [19k\]: it is not necessary however NOW
Raine [16k\]: Yes...
lcninja [19k\]: It was a dumb move :)
Raine [16k\]: Instead I play K9 for 50.
lcninja [19k\]: yup

Rich: K9 for 50 points is optimistic... :P but yes, J2 is a small move at this time.]

(;B[ir];W[jk];B[mk]C[Black has a good answer for K9.  I don't think I could play anything deeper though without being cut to ribbons.  Even now that area is a bit weak.

Rich: Don't get too intimidated... there's still plenty of fighting to be done.]
;W[qp]C[Too close to the corner...  Actually, breaking through here is going to be tough anyways.  Is there a better invasion here?

As you can see, I'm no good at score estimation and counting. It gets even worse when I have to count even three or four moves in advance, and if an area is settled, I have trouble estimating it at all.  Any tips on how to do this?  How do you count unsettled areas?  Should I even be worrying about this at this stage in my game?

Rich: No, not to that degree of accuracy. Compare areas - this bit's about the same as his corner, that group about the same as his centre, and so on. It only needs to be rough; until you are confident of making more or less the right plays in the endgame there's not much point counting to within 5 - just look at the lower right! :)

=====

This is what I decided on for an ideal move here, followed up by O17 or P17.  Also, the board looks like it's clearly in black's favor even now.  Black has an uncontested side while white does not.  Black could probably even ignore this attack and play K3, since I need to place several more stones in the corner to kill / reduce it, and it would make me overconcentrated.  Perhaps I should have tried to force black out of the corner?]

Does this variation make sense?  What if black ignores it and plays D4?]
