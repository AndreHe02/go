RE[B+56.50]
RU[Japanese]

C[Thank you for giving me the opportunity of reviewing your game. I am currently about 9k and I can occassionaly be found on KGS under the nickname 'Danyboy'.

I hope my review will be of some help. I have marked my comments with 'D:' so you will know which are mine and which are yours.

My advice can be summarized as follows:
1) Consider the whole board position.
2) Invade early in the game
3) Fight!];B[qd];W[dq];B[co]
(;W[eo]LB[cm:B][jo:E][jp:D][gq:A][jq:C]TR[cn][dn][co][do]C[My first instinct with White 4 was to extend to someplace like A, but I thought a bit and decided that E5 was better here both in terms of pressing the black stone (threatening to enclose him at, say, B) and getting the two white stones connected to the center.  (Moreover, a black stone at A would be easily pressed, if not completely enclosed.)

D: My first instinct would have been to play in either of the two remainig corners. A double approach to your 34 opening is possible, though it can get difficult very quicly. (Look up the 'taisha' joseki, it is said to be the most difficult one) If you want to avoid complicated fights in the beginning you can of course choose to respond to Black's approach.

Ideally you would have played at one of the triangles. This would have been a good corner enclosure that threatens a play at C, D or E.
Since black played there first however I can see some merit in your play. It seems to accomplish the same as the triangles though you do leave the corner open a bit further.
With this in mind, however, your next play seems awkward.];B[dm]

(;W[hq]TR[ip]C[Now I play one point farther than A (in the White 4 diagram), more secure with the slightly larger extension.  (Moreover, with two black stones now coming from the left, the second of which eliminates the enclosure at B I contemplated earlier, I felt the need to secure the area for a base.)

D: The extension here seems right by itself (though you might have played it one line higher and perhaps one point further), It gives you some territory and it strenghtens your stones.It is not a very big play however. You could consider extending further, as when extending from a normal shimari. Alternatively you can tenuki and take another corner. You should aks yourself the question if this is an urgent move or if it is a big move. If it is not urgent and there is a bigger move on the board you should leave this position for what it is. you can always come back later to complete your shape and/or get territory here.

By themselves your stones look strong enough, though if you had played E5 differently I think it would have been a bit better (playing E5 at F4 especially. If you want to secure your position after blacks kakari then play at F4)]
;B[ce];W[qg]TR[nc][oc][nd][od]C[D: It is usual to play in the corners first. However, alternative openings can be good too. This move however is in my eyes not so good. The approach to the 34 point should come from the other side. If black chooses to play here now he makes a very nice corner enclosure.]
;B[pf]TR[nc][oc][nd][od]C[D: I was thinking of one of the triangles myself]
;W[qj];B[qp];W[nq]TR[oq]C[Threatening the black stone and extending my area simultaneously, though the extension is a bit tenuous at this point.

D: Let's quickly compare the score now. White has certain territory at the bottom and the center right.
Black has a claim on three corners and the left side. 
I'd prefer black's position now. His stones are working more effectively than yours. I think H3 especially could have been better played elsewhere.
However, black will have to turn his influence into solid territory. This is where white will now have to get some points.
My suggestion for your first few moves would be to play a bit 'bigger'. If you look at the board after a couple of moves you should see a somewhat even spread of black and white stones. Right now your stones are crowded together while black has spread them out across the board nicely. This gives him more potential.

I like the idea behind this move, you could consider playing it one line further.]
;B[qn];W[no];B[jp];W[ho]LB[fp:A][gp:B]C[I felt that if Black got this point not only would his stone at K4 be in a much better position to connect to the two on the left, but that he would then be poised for an invasion at A or B, and it would be a struggle to connect the stones.  (Especially as the E5 and D3 stones could be connected easily, but the H3 stone might be lost entirely.)

And finally, if Black took H5 I expected to be cut off from the center.  In the time it took me to connect the stones to where I felt secure in their eye shape Black probably would have cut off the group's connection to the two stones on the left as well.

D: Your reasoning is good. Black's stone is also weakened now. However, you should be aware of the situation your two stones on the bottomright are in. Black should try to take advantage of their weakness.
By attacking a weak group you can often get influence or territory. This is often a very good way of playing.]
;B[ko];W[kq]C[I wanted to reinforce the connection between the two sides and at the same time ensure eye space for the two stones on line O.]
;B[jq]
(;W[kr]TR[qn][qp]SQ[ko][jp][jq]C[I thought about playing this one point over, at K2 (which would keep the "connection" motif going), but felt that this would make both stones alone too weak and ultimately provide Black with more profit and influence than if I simply solidified each area alone.

(At this point I am relatively confident of the ability of the group on the left to make eyes, but less sure about the one on the right.  I felt L2 also allowed for more eye space.)

D: K2 wouldn't connect if Black sets his mind to it. See the variation.
I think you are right about the lefthand group. They can either move into the corner or else out into the center. You have to be careful though that black can't profit too much from attacking your weak groups. Being able to get two eyes is worthless if your opponent can get more profit.
That works two ways of course. Black currently has two weak groups. You might try attacking them with your relatively strong groups. You should be able to get profit from doing so. (Even if you can't kill them)]
;B[jr];W[ic]C[Not feeling particular pressure from the situation on the bottom for now, I decided to move to the top and try to interrupt the connection between Black's left and right sides.

Obviously a space as large as the one Black has outlined along the top and left sides of the board rarely survives intact into the middle game, but I thought that if he got to play w22, or even an area near it, invading the area would be considerably harder.  From 22, I knew that I could extend two spaces in either direction when he pinced me, leaving me fairly confident in my abiity to get eyes here.

D: Your groups at the bottom look fairly safe. Black can make a good attempt at attacking them and might be able to get a good result from it though.
However, playing at the top seems like a very sound idea. You could also consider the left side since black doesn't really have a good extension at the top. His stones are very high so he doesn't look like aiming at a lot of direct territory. His play seems more based on influence.

Looking back on this play it seems Black has nicely profited from it in the top right corner. Perhaps you should have played closer to the corner, risking more of a fight but keeping your opponent more confined. If you let your opponent get a nice framework, you have to be prepared to invade it and engage in possibly difficult fights.]

(;B[lc];W[fc];B[ke]C[D: A big move by Black. He is aiming for a very big corner (somewhere around 35 points).]

(;W[he]LB[fe:B][ie:A]C[I also considered A, but felt that it left me too open on the left side of the group.  If I played A, I feared an invasion (or at least a major threat) at B or even as deep as 26 (less likely as this becomes a tsuke).  In addition, 26 seemed to provide better eye shape than A.

D: This move seems very small. I considered some alternatives.
You are not mapping out a lot of territory with this, nor does black have to reply. I think your fear of an invasion is unjust. Playing on the left side or trying an invasion in the topright corner seems a lot bigger to me.
Your stones are again unnecessarily crowded. Try to play more loose but big moves.]
;B[ch];W[fm]C[Now I begin to focus on getting out into the center.  I don't really expect to connect all my groups, but I don't want to passively sacrifice the center, especially given how little territory I have even prospectively along the sides.

D: You are very right in saying you have little territory at the sides. However, you aren't likely to find a lot of territory in the center either. Black is strong at the left and the topright. His weaknesses are at the bottomright. You should try attacking those and with that gain some influence and territory in the center.
Merely running into the center is not going to help a lot.
Moreover, I think you should try to invade black either at the left or at the topright. This will be difficult and might prove impossible, but I think you are quite a bit behind.]
;B[lm]TR[ko][jp][jq][jr]C[D: now black gets to run away with his heavy stones.This will also weaken your position at the bottom. You still have to get two eyes there and make some territory as well.]
;W[om];B[en];W[fn];B[in]
(;W[io]C[I considered simply playing upwards at H6, but to me this seemed more threatening.  Although the hope of actually isolating Black's J6 is slim to nil, it seemed more of a menace this way than if I simply played H6 and allowed him both J5 and K6 as prospective connections back to his group.

D: I don't like your reasoning here. You are saying black isn't very much threatend by your move which is correct. Black might even consider ignoring this move.

I think you might also have played at the right side first. Black's two stones are looking quite weak and there is at least one sente move there.]
;B[jn];W[gp]LB[ip:A][iq:B]C[I knew at this point that Black might well attempt to invade the group itself now and destroy its eye shape.  It was perhaps a baseless fear, but to me the space between those original four stones was looking awfully open.

It was in this mindset that I sought out the best spot for White 36.  I thought for some time about playing at A, but realized that Black might simply play at B, forcing me to connect the eye somewhere else.

Moreover, he could play at 36, which would not only ruin the prospective eye, but allow him to make troublesome plays in other directions.  So I decided to take that point first, even without the eye I was creating in my imagination, and with 36 in place felt much safer against invasion.]
;B[hl];W[fk]C[Seeking not to be completely contained.];B[el]
;W[fl];B[ek];W[cc]C[This is a move I have had my eye on for some time, both because it takes away a piece (granted, a fairly small one) of Black's potential territory, and more to the point gives me a bit more space to work with when making eyes for the upper group.  (And possibly more territory.)  Although I had been confident before that the group could make eyes, I was now certain.]
;B[dd];W[dc];B[ed];W[fd]C[I chose this instead of E17 both because it keeps my group larger and better-connected, and because if I played E17 I suspected Black would continue on his course with 46, not only walling off my group (and gaining himself more territory) but badly threatening my group and necessitating a move like G16.  (And even at that I felt G16 would be prone to assault.)

D: This is a good move. E17 would indeed be bad. Black can not cut at E17 anyway, nor is the peep at E18 of any good.]
;B[hj]C[D: This is very sound play by Black. He is mapping out a humongous territory in the center and your primary job is to counter that. You can try attacking the group at the bottom, though you would need some good cuttingpoints and take very good care of your own stones as well. An attempt at an invasion at the topright might still be a good idea, though it would be very difficult and perhaps impossible.
However, you will at least have to threaten to invade somewhere or to cut some stones in order to reduce black's framework.]

(;W[hg]C[Now it was a choice between once again extending my wall on line F, and helping the top group out into the center.  The wall on F was feeling enough pressure from the surrounding stones that I didn't feel altogether safe jumping from it (or rather, I feared any maneuver like that would end with me in gote), and the top group was clearly in danger of being contained, so I elected to move it outwards.

D: Extending from your wall seems a bad idea to me (See the variation). This move is better, but it is not as threatening as you would like it to be. Simply getting out into the center is not enough. You have to press black back while doing it, in order to reduce his framework and to make territory for yourself.]

(;B[fj]C[Black chooses to contain the lower group at any rate.

D: This is probably not really a good idea. Your white group will be able to live as it is (you still have the option of going into the corner if things get really nasty). Instead, black should consolidate his territory in the center for which there are better moves.]
;W[gk]C[I had considered this play back with 48, but felt a simple push through at J9 wouldn't be compelling enough to merit the move just yet.  But now with a group to develop and two possible threats, I wanted to make the move before he did and completely contained me.]
;B[gj]C[Lothe [19k?\]: Truth to tell, I haven't been officially ranked anywhere, the closest I come is here on KGS.
Trex [?\]: hehe =)];W[hk];B[ik];W[hm]C[Now I focused on linking up everything in my group once and for all, and gathering up as much territory as I could in the process.

D: Your stones are already linked and you are only helping black this way. Your gains are minimal, while black gets a lot of thickness in the center. She you are behind like this it doesn't help to play passively. You have to go all out against black in order to get something back.]
;B[im];W[hn]SQ[jf][kf][lf][mf][nf][of][jg][kg][lg][mg][ng][og]

[kj][lj][mj][nj][oj][jk][kk][lk][mk][nk][ok][jl][kl][ll][ml]
[nl]C[I considered playing G9 in an attempt to force J8 before playing 56, but I figured that if Black played 56 instead of J8, it would be much more damaging to me than to him, and he would probably end up getting to fill J8 anyway.  (Or at least fight a ko for it.)

D: You are talking on a very small scale her. You should try to think bigger. What is happening on the board as a whole?
Black has connected his weak group at the bottom and gotten a lot of thickness with it. This only strengthens his claims on the marked area while your stones are as strong as they were before (apart from the group at the bottom)
Your stones are also very overcrowded. I hope you can see that you could have done with several moves less (try it),

Just to make my point a bit more clear I have reversed the position of some of the black and white stones in the variation.]

(;B[ff];W[ge]C[D: Again, too slow. There isn't much of  a threat to that group and you have to take points away from black instead of just securing your own groups further.]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[fh];W[ql]LB[oj:A][ok:B]TR[ge][he][hf][hg]C[This is a move I have been contemplating for a long, long time and simply never found the opportunity to make.  I considered a number of different points for my play.

Earlier on I had considered A to extend from the upper-right group, not at first associating it with the lower-right group.  As I thought about it, I realized I could very probably connect the two and considered playing at B.

When the chance came to finally make the move, however, I realized that if I played B, Black would probably take 62, getting more space.  So I said to myself, "Why not take that spot first?"  Of course Black could still make the same extension in the other direction, but it would put considerably less pressure on the stones at R10 and R13.  (And if he didn't, I intended to take R2 and possibly make the area so claustrophobic as to kill the Black group.)

D: Very sound thinking. I like this move a lot. Black has to reply in order to save his stones in the corner and you can aim for a grand invasion in the center. The marked stones are also helping (thanks to some less-than-good plays by black)
It is vital that you start attacking fiercly now.];B[pq]C[Black didn't take quite the spot I expected, but I like this move.

D: Me too. It not only secures his corner but it also puts pressure on your stones there. If you don't play there now black can come back to get some points.]
;W[or]C[I considered simply coming down at O2, but thought that 64 both pushed harder at the Black area and gave me slightly more space.  (And better eye shape.)

D: A very good move. O2 would be possible, but there is no reason why you wouldn't play here.
Black will have to respond after which you have to go into the center as soon as possible.]
;B[pr];W[oq]C[D: This looks like a wasted move to me. Black can safely ignore this. Losing sente here is not what you want.]
;B[mp];W[np]C[I figured it would be easier to defend against a descent at N3 than to repel a push through at 68.

D: Good thinking.];B[mn];W[nn];B[ml];W[ok]C[This is about where I expected Black to go next to contained me, and so I again pre-empted him.

D: being contained should not be your primary worry. You are taking only a few points with this while black can make territory on a larger scale.
Every move you wait with invading the center mean it will only become more difficult as black strenghtens his position. Try to find the walls and the thickness on the board and extrapolate the potential territory from that. If you see your opponent is building up a strong position you should counter that. If your opponent has already built up a strong position you should push, invade and cut. Everything to get back some much needed points. Hopefully you see that currently you are already behind quite some.]
;B[oh]C[He takes another good point, though.];W[ph]C[I wondered about a hane at Q11 on Black's next move, but felt I could repel it easily enough.]
;B[og];W[qf];B[qe];W[pg];B[oe];W[oi]C[Taking the chance to come out a line and still have a nice, connected group.]
;B[ni];W[oj];B[nj];W[nl];B[rm]C[This was an area I had considered coming into, but my opponent found the opportunity first.]
;W[rl];B[jh]C[This is an excellent move by Black, and when he played it I sorely wished I had thought of it first (*laugh...*).

It was about now that it sunk in that I had next to no chance of actually winning, but since this was a Free (unranked) game and the situation wasn't all that dire, I wanted to see how it would play all out all the same.

D: realizing this earlier will move you up a few ranks quickly :)]
;W[jd];B[je];W[ie];B[jb];W[ib];B[kc];W[jc];B[kb];W[bq]C[This is another point I'd been looking at for awhile, but had considered too small to play until now.]
;B[cp];W[cq];B[do];W[ep];B[hh];W[jo];B[kp]C[I force Black to fill exactly where I had intended.  What I'm aiming at is a watari (under-the-stones connection) at K1, but it requires enough setup that I don't expect to get it.  So the backup plan is simply to isolate as much territory here as I can before Black takes it away.

D: connecting is not worth anything. Only when your groups are weak should it be a concern. There are much larger points on the board and this move gives away sente.]
;W[hr];B[lq];W[lr];B[mq];W[mr];B[mo];W[qm]C[Now I start nettling Black and trying to make my claim here a bit bigger.]
;B[rn];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[bp]C[An undo here leads to a new branch.]

(;W[gn]C[D: Please beware of asking for undos often. A good client has functionality to prevent misclicks, maybe you should turn these on. You don't learn from mistakes if you can undo them and many players are uncomfortable with giving undos.

You shouldn't rely on being able to get an undo.])
(;W[bd]C[I had actually been expecting Black to play a point like this for some time, but apparently he never considered it large enough.

D: It only takes a few points. Black has mostly been making territory on a larger scale.]
;B[be];W[ad]C[D: This is probably too small. Black doesn't really have to reply here.]
;B[ae];W[cd];B[ec];W[eb];B[fe];W[hd]LB[gd:A]C[I fancy that I might be able to defend against a cut at A without this stone, but given the cap at E18, the situation is tenuous enough that I decide to play a "safety stone" anyway.

D: At this point there is not much Black can do. But it is wise to be a bit cautious because you can quickly lose a lot with such seemingly small moves. If you aren't confident about a position and don't want to risk it connecting is very good.
You probably had to connect here eventually as black starts to fill up your liberties. Currently however you could have played elsewhere first.]
;B[ig];W[gg];B[fg];W[gh];B[gi]C[Just an extra couple points I wanted to squeeze out before Black could contain me completely.]
;W[pp]TR[rf]C[This was where I had expected Black to play back when we played out this sequence.  Now I decide to take it for myself, expanding my area.]

(;B[rq]LB[qq:A]C[Black also seems to see it as a threat of a cut at A, something I had considered but dismissed as I felt that if I played A he would play R2, killing the invaders.]
;W[nk];B[mk]C[Another undo leads to another branch.]

I think about using N7, combined with the cut at L6, to cut off and destroy the Black group, but it still doesn't seem to work out.]
;B[mm]C[All the same, Black protects himself at the other point.]
;W[gb]C[I played this because I had feared a nozoki here.  Of course, I hadn't counted on simply playing F18 and didn't really need to play this move.

(Result B+56.5)

D: I think the biggest problem has been the overview. You didn't take the whole board into account while playing. This allowed black to map out a lot of territory while you secured your much smaller groups.
Your main point of improvement would be your strategy. Try to see the big moves and try to see the big framworks of your opponent.
In the opening you should also make sure you don't overcrowd your position. You should try to map out some potential territory for yourself. It is inevitable that your opponent attempts to invade your position, that is a part of the game. However, what your opponent gains by invading is easily compensated either by the influence you get in return, or the fact that the invasion only takes away a small part of the the large framwork you laid out.

As an example look at the current position at the top. After both playing four moves there you had mapped out the 20 points you have now. Black however got 35 points with his four plays. This difference illustrates that your opponent was able to play much bigger moves than you.

In your request for this review you state that you realize you defend too much and attack too little and would like comments as to how you could improve on this. However, it is not so much a question of where you could push into black's territory. Rather it is more a question of when. And this you should do early on, as I have indicated in the game and you yourself stated when you saw black's great territory come to completion.
This ties in nicely with your small-scale opening. You could try to keep black from mapping out a good framework there. This could leave you both with several weak groups that will lead to interesting fights later.
You should not refrain from invading because it seems very difficult. Your opponent is of the same strength as you are, so 'impossible' is just a relative term. Simply try every somewhat reasonable invasion (especially when behind) and if it doesn't work you can try something else in the next game.
So to answer your question; have more faith in your abilities and the strenght of your groups and keep black from building up strength early on. Also, keep the small scale pushing you did at G9 for the endgame.

However, I enjoyed seeing this game. You played very solid moves and have shown good go-reasoning in your comments. I am confident that you will be able to improve quickly. Simply noticing your opponent is building up strength and responding to that, in combination with your solid game should get you up to shodan in no time!

Do not fear a good fight, enjoy it!])

Your stones at the bottom still look good. You might have to add a stone here but they have got potential. Let's assume they are alive.

Currently the game looks a lot better for white, and a lot more exciting. If white can solidify the territory in the center, he has quite some territory.

Hopefully you can see the value of a strong line of stones in the center.]

(;W[fj];B[ej];W[fi];B[ei];W[fg];B[mk]C[D: Black happily reinforces the left only to come back to expand and strengthen the center. This wouldn't accomplish a lot.]

(;W[qr];B[ql];W[rk];B[pk]C[D: You are pushing black around a bit while solidifying your own groups. you can now return to the left.
You might want to safe this for later, though. Black can now aim for a large territory in the center. In this way your two groups are also cut.]

(;W[cc];B[dg]C[D: You could think about going into the corner, though that would make an invasion on the left more difficult]

(;W[dg];B[dc];W[cj]TR[dm][co]C[D: Going into the left side. Black two stones at the bottom will have to get some eyespace. You can take advantage of black's struggling.]

(;W[rl]C[D: what happens if black gets to play near your top group?
Keep in mind that you should already have taken advantage of the fact you have sente. You might be able to come back to the top later.]

(;W[cc];B[fe]C[D: You are capped her and only have some third line territory. Indeed not a very good result for white.]

(;W[fe]C[D: You might consider getting out into the center with this.]

(;AB[od]AE[pf]C[D: As a comparison. What if black had played at P16 instead of Q14.]
;B[lc];W[fc];B[dc]C[D: I prefer this for black. His territory is more solid. Invading now is very difficult. Black has tow large corners and has set his eyes on the left side. If he can get some profit at the bottom he looks to be ahead by a fair bit.]
))
(;W[jr];B[ir];W[kr];B[iq]C[D: Not a very good result for white. This weakens the bottomleft while doing nothing for the group on the right either.
trying to connect with K2 wouldn't have been a good idea.]))
(;W[kq]TR[cn][dn][co][do]C[D: In line with what you would have done if you could have made the corner enclosure with one of the triangles, a play here or at K should be considered.]
)
(;W[pp]C[You can also consider taking another corner, though your group at the left might be a bit too weak for it now.]
))
(;W[fp];B[dm]C[D: This is rather slow, but it doesn't lead to complicated fighting. White should be happy with this result for he has now sente and can take another corner first.
You still have the option to extend along the side. Black will have a very hard time keeping you from making some good territory there.]
)
(;W[pp];B[fp]C[D: This is the beginning of the taisha joseki. Note that black wouldn't play here immediately, but this just goes to show another possible continuation.

You can choose to play this way, but you have to be confident you can save your stone. If you feel insecure, the best thing to do would be to add a stone. However, do try to take some risks, your game will improve from it, even if it means losing some corners in the process.]
