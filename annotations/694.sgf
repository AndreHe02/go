C[Be sure to look at the variations I have added.  Overall, black made a lot of small, endgame moves early on and missed many bigger moves.  You kill by playing near but not in contact with a weak group.  Practice invasions, both to do them and to attack them.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[oj]C[This is too high.  Stick with either the third or fourth line during the opening.]
;W[co];B[jc]SQ[fc][cf]C[This would bv a good time for an approach move in the upper left.  Both squares are good choices.]
;W[fc]C[White has now established the UL and LL  corners.

Not really.  Black can still invade the upper left corner.  See the variation starting next move.]

(;B[mp]SQ[ci][fp]C[B: Q5 or P5 might have been better here.

Both the actual move and the variations you added are too passive for the opening.  The spaces marked with squares are better.]
;W[qj]SQ[oj]C[We can see now how Black's stone doesn't do much to prevent White's invasion]

(;B[pk]C[See the variation for one response to White's invasion.  This is a contact play even though it doesn't quite touch White.  In general, contact firghting strengthens both sides.  So, a contact fight is not the way to contain and kill White.]
;W[ql]C[This is where White begins dominating the R  side.  As you will see later on in the game, he  pretty well locks down the entire right side of  the board.  What would have been the best  move to stop that?]
;B[qk]SQ[qn][qg]C[This is too close to White.  The squares are better choices to contain White.]
;W[rk]
(;B[qm]CR[rj][rl]SQ[qk]C[A move like the one marked by the square should be followed by a cut.  Black could cut at either of the circles here.  See variation.]
;W[rm];B[pl];W[rl]
(;B[om]C[Protecting the cutting point is not as important as keeping the pressure up on White.  See variation]
;W[qn];B[pm]SQ[om]C[I can't help but think that this was an  unneccesary fight.

Since White forced you to make a solid connection here, the marked stone is now a wasted move.]
;W[rp];B[qf]SQ[rq][qh][ri]C[Rather than being too close to White, this is too far away.  The squares are all better choices.]
;W[rh];B[ph]SQ[rf]C[The marked space would keep White out of the corner]
;W[qi];B[qh];W[rg];B[oo]SQ[rf]C[The square is a better choice here]
;W[qq]
(;B[pr]SQ[qr]C[This move implies that Black is surrendering the corner.  Black should hope to get territory on the lower side in exchange.  Playing at the square means Black wants to fight for the corner.  See variation.]
;W[qr];B[ps]SQ[rf][gq][cj][je][cf][cc]C[This is an endgame move worth very little.  Don't play small moves this early in the game.  Remember the "two inch" rule.  Many beginning players feel compelled to play near (within 2 inches of) their opponent's last stone.  This is not always the best choice.  Always look at the whole board and see if another move elsewhere is worth more.  The squares are all worth more.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[po];B[pn];W[qo];B[qs]C[This is another endgame move.  The points I marked before are all still available.]
;W[rr];B[rs];W[rf];B[re];W[qe]
(;B[pe]C[See variation.];W[se]C[I missed something here.  This was my last  chance to save the UR corner.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[qe]SQ[rc]C[Black could play at the square and make a ko for the corner rather then just losing it outright.]
;W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[ra]SQ[qc]C[Connecting is better here.]
;W[sb];B[qa];W[sd]C[Now White has a huge live group.

True, hopefully Black will be able to use the huge wall facing the center.]
;B[pc]SQ[qc]C[You should connect at the square instead.  Black will have to play on the square eventually in the end game, so don't waste a move now.]
;W[jq]C[This is a big move for white.  This neutralizes a lot of Black's lower wall]
;B[mc]SQ[cj][ci][cf][gq]C[Now I try to save the upper center.

This is still rather small.  The left side should be invaded now.]
;W[gq];B[hd]C[Still small compared to invading the left side.]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[gd];B[ic];W[gb];B[hb]C[Let the ko fight begin!]
;W[he]
(;B[gc]C[Don't be afraid to sacrifice stones to make bigger gains.  See variation.]
;W[id];B[hc]C[I think I did okay here, but not great.];W[fe]
;B[jd]CR[jd][je][ke][kf][lf][lg][mg][mh][nh][ni][oi]SQ[ie]C[Play on the square and set up a ladder that White will lose.]
;W[je];B[ie];W[if];B[id];W[hg]C[Black now has a very thick clump of stones that don't do much.  They don't surround territory or attack White.  Black should have given up one stone and played a more valuable move elsewhere.  The "two inch" rule again.]
;B[lc]C[This isn't worth much.];W[ga]C[White has played an endgame move.  Black should ignore it and play elsewhere.]

(;B[ha]C[See variation.];W[fb]
(;B[oc]C[See variation for a sample invasion of left side.]
;W[ke];B[le];W[lf];B[ld];W[lh];B[nf]C[Now I have a little hope for the upper center.]
;W[lq];B[mn];W[mq];B[nq];W[nr];B[or];W[ns];B[no]C[This doesn't do much.]
;W[jo]C[This is a fairly big move for White.];B[lo]C[Black is placing too many stones too close together here.]
;W[kp];B[ml];W[jl];B[km];W[jm];B[kn];W[jn];B[jj]C[Trying to develop territory from the lower center to link up with my group in the upper  center.]
;W[kk];B[lk];W[kj];B[ki];W[li];B[lj];W[ji]C[So much for linking with the upper center.   Notice White's development from this point.]
;B[dj]C[The third line is better.  The fourth line is good if Black plans to run out into the center.  Now that White has a wall, Black should plan to make eyes quickly against the side instead of running out.]
;W[cl];B[ch]SQ[cg]C[Reach a little more here.];W[cf];B[bj];W[ij]
;B[kl]SQ[eh][dm][bl]C[Black should not play here.  The side invasion needs to be the focus until it is completely alive.]
;W[jk]C[Now it looks like White controls the center.];B[el]
;W[bh];B[dh];W[bk];B[bi]C[Here I'm trying to break up the left side so it  doesn't go the way of the right.]
;W[bg];B[cj]CR[bl]SQ[ck]C[Play on the square and White will probably connect at the circle.]
