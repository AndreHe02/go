C[Quite simply: I should have lost this game.  I won due to my opponent's endgame oversight, but I should have resigned long before and was only continuing to play out of stubbornness.

I was not sure how to deal with my opponent's large central moyo, and by the time I finally gave up my enormous, heavy invasion group, I was clearly behind.  I would like as many comments as possible regarding the way I was handling territory vs. influence in the opening, where specifically my strategic blunders occurred, and whether I missed anything in the fighting or whether I was trying to get something totally unreasonable in the first place.

I am not so much looking for comments on my endgame, as I was in a very bad mood through most of the endgame, and know that I played some very poor moves.

Thanks in advance for the review!

-Hi, I hope you enjoy this review and find it helpful. Please remember that there are many flaws in my judgment of Go moves though :-/]

-Yes, it doesn't seal W in, and adds a stone to an already strong group.]

-The result in the bottom right is quite good, but this last move is too slow. The Q10 group is fine, so you should look to the big open areas.]

C[-I don't think this move accompishes much. Ask yourself what White was intending with the previous move. It looks like he was trying to build the center, but the gap between this stone and O17 is wide, and you are very strong in the area. So resist! I like O16.]
