C[Dear reviewer,
In this game i somehow lost the initiative and got pushed around, thus becoming no chance to reduce my opponents teritorry nor to secure my own.]

[ep:A]TR[gq]C[I heard that it is possible to push through at A, when the marked cut is covered.
Then w-B, b-C, w-D, b-E but what is the continuation?

For this you should really look at a joseki book -- 12 is something of an overplay here.  If Black pushes at A, white should defend at c and let black "force" white to make 4th line territory and give up the two stones  (6&8) and use them for aji later.

The basic of the cut isthe descent at E by Black.  If W C6, b at B4 is usually enough, though it can still get tricky.  What you need to try to see is how to either capture the corner if w plays outside or make a mess of the left side if w plays in the corner.  There are soooo many variations after the cut that it is hard to explain in a commentary like this.  Again, study a joseki book for the variations here.  The very worst that should happen is b loses the two stones and gets a number of forcing moves on in the corner and on the side.]
;B[ep];W[do]C[This is the correct play by W -- because of the mess created by the B cut.  You want to save 13 until much later.  If you get a stone between 2 and 12, as part of a reduction, then the cut becomes severe.  Until then, it is easy to give up the two stones.]
;B[go]C[ok, but small right now.  a w turn here doesn't do much to you or for w. bigger would be K16 or even an approach on the upper left or even an enclosure in the lower right or complete the chinese opening.]
;W[eo]C[very small for w.  now Q 10 is big, but the top side is too.

You want to be taking big points now, to try to get the center point first.

Since neither side is yet weak anywhere, you are still in the opening with big points to play -- and it is looking to be a moyo game at this point, so get the big moves.]
;B[gm]C[This is not one of them, yet.  it could be, but is really more of a reduction or limiting move.  W has no incentive to play anywhere around here -- no weak groups to attack, no weak w groups to defend, lots of open space elsewhere.]
;W[po]C[this is again probably wrong -- just asking for a pincer attack and helping B build the moyo.]
;B[pl]C[good];W[mp];B[oo]C[probably an overplay here.  Connect underneath -- leaving w rootless and with few prospects while you take points.

But disconnecting W like this isn't a bad thing to do so it should work out ok.]
;W[on];B[no]C[draw back to p4 is proper here -- then cutting at q6  becomes big.  now your stones can be counter-cut and this makes w strong here.]
;W[pp]C[right move by w];B[nq];W[qq];B[oq]C[ok, but you've lost the corner and 19 is now too close to b strength -- you created strength on the side where you were already strong (the bottom), and on the narrower side -- the right goes all the way to the edge of the board -- the bottom just goes to the 5th line from the left.]
;W[nn];B[mo]C[probably too conservative -- cut at q6 or hane at n6 makes a better fight -- you are now just taking points and being forced to eat a stone too many times (move 20) while allowing w to easily stabilize AND take points in your area of influence.]
;W[rp]C[bad move. q 6 if anything or maybe r2 -- or o16];B[pi]
C[i like the cut at q6 as a sacrifice.  if you are going to reinforce 19, it should be at q10 because you are so near to w strength here.  just a bit loose.]
;W[nc]C[good w move -- hard to see what is best for b here --]
;B[nd]C[this is not best -- giving w exactly what w wants -- another settled group and another strong formation off the upper left star point corner stone.  This game is now almost over.]
;W[od]C[Is this hamete? What's the correct answer?

This is a bad move by W.  It should be just the old standby -- n16 and take the wall and give the corner and win the game.

Since B is so far behind, B is almost forced to fight with p17 here.  The move at p15 just gives w too much, though in some circumstances it would be right.]
;B[oe];W[oc];B[pe];W[md]C[this is why 35 is wrong -- w not only gets the upper side and splits the corner, but gets the wall too.  37 had to be a o15, giving up a big corner, in favor of strength to create a big attack.  But it is hard for b now.]
;B[ne];W[pc]LB[rd:A]C[When is A best played, Fuseki, Middle Game or Yose?

late middle -- when looking for points.  but here, you would probably do better to hane.

it can be played in the early  middle if needed to settle a group or to set up to attack a group -- but there are no weak groups on the board.]
;B[fc]C[the 33 invasion is probably best here and then look to invade and reduce the sides.  This allows w to make a huge side on the left side -- and the top right w group is solid, so nothing to attack there.]
;W[hc]LB[cc:A][fe:B]C[I jumped into the corner, because I thought a wall here would be of no use for me. Was that a good idea or did White get too much thickness?

w should simply play d18 instead of the pincer.  now b should take the corner and use 41  for aji.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[ge]C[Where to play now? I didn't find a point that looked good enough for me.

W turned you the wrong way, I think.  So you have a bit of a gift.  Do you  go for points or for fighting now?  Count the points -- this gives you the answer.  W has about 60+ points on the left; 25-30 on the top; 12 on the lower right -- about 100 points.  B has about 35-40 on the bottom, about 30 on the right, about 8 in the upper left corner.  That is about 80 points.  So B is about 20 points behind.  Where can black play to take points and reduce W?  Or must B play more agressively?

My sense is that in a race to surround points, B loses.  So maybe L14, G10, 08, and then invade whereever you can on the left side.  Save the monkey jump on the top for yose.  Sente for the upper corner yose matters.]
;B[dh]C[ok, but some prep moves as noted last comment maybe wiser.  This will make w strong and consolidated and will subject b to an attack that could reduce b's potential development. 

nonetheless, if done with sufficient flexiblity and with creating enough complexity, b has a chance and this is not so bad.  I would have attached to the left of or on top of the w stone, however.]
;W[fi]C[this is why the attachment is better -- white can seal b in better now and bigger]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[di];W[dk];B[el];W[dl];B[em];W[dm]C[here again i didnt know where to play]
;B[hh]C[I played H12 but it lacks a continuation];W[fg];B[if]
C[so far -- ok -- w is playin defensively -- but it will be hard for b to really get enough.  55 should have been a bit more agressive -- at 56 perhaps. hard to  say -- b must play a bit unreasonablly to make up the points]
;W[qg]C[serious overplay by w.  the center point would be enough or something around r10

but the b  response is not easy, here.  I like r7, threatening the cut and strengthening the two black stones.]
;B[ri];W[rd];B[qd];W[re];B[qc];W[og];B[kc]C[cut at n17 -- the ladder favors b, I think.]
;W[lc];B[le];W[me];B[nf];W[mf];B[ng];W[oh]C[71 was misplaced, -- it should have ben at m14 because that stops the 72-74 combination.  now w is almost alive in your territory -- or threatens to connect out too easily.]
;B[mg];W[lf];B[mi]C[79, even if it kills w, is not enough, but is best here nonetheless -- hoping for a w mistake]
;W[oi];B[oj];W[nj];B[ni];W[pj];B[ok];W[qj];B[qm]C[now w is alive on the right side -- you must connect at r11 and fight.  game over.]
;W[rj];B[pn];W[qn];B[pm];W[mk]C[the rest of the game was fighting about the life of his shinogi]
;B[mm];W[kk]C[the center cannot become large eonug because of the stones on m14 and f11]
;B[hj]C[w can now sacrifice those stones and still win easily on points on the top,, right, and left and just reduce the center -- but w need not sacrifice those stones -- they can live or connect out or be used as aji to great effect.]

;W[hl];B[gj];W[ko];B[jo];W[ip];B[kn];W[iq];B[er];W[hr];B[dr]
C[b is letting w do too much here -- now w has almost lived on the bottom center and is threatening the b group.]
;W[gr];B[bq];W[gq]C[game totally over now that w is connected out -- no b points.  b must devend at 118 and stake the game on a life or race to capture in the center]
;B[kd];W[je]C[Thanks for reviewing.

B needs to recognize the opening moves a bit better, a bit bigger.  B needs to work on fighting tesujis -- the books getting strong at tesugi and getting strong at invasions (or something like that) are what would seem to be next in line for b to improve.  B played too simply, too solidly given w's superior positional judgment.

this should have been about a 3 stone game given the differences in fighting techniques and positional judgment

good luck])
