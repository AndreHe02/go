;W[cn];B[fq];W[dk];B[cp]C[Sometimes, copying your opponent's move may not be the best way to go.  This move only nets you the corner with no potential to expand. You could have done better at L3 or L4.]

Reduce in any way possible. Attack or build depends on the progress of the game. Both options still open.]

(;B[he]C[NOT a good move here. Being surrounded by so many stones and giving W the opportunity to cut is suicidial. Also, even if W doesn't try to cut, this move is very small.

You could try to cause problems for W at C14, C15 or C16. Or else, escape with F13 or F14]
;W[df];B[fg];W[dc]C[Poor exchange for black. W got a corner with 4 stones, B still in danger with 4 stones.]

[aq][bq][ar][br][sr][as][bs][ss]C[Not a bad game, technique-wise. There were not many mistakes in technique that I could see. However, the main problem with B was that the focus was off. Concentrating too much on local battles and lost focus for the rest of the board. 

Also, B was much too aggressive in the early stages. It resulted in a number of wasted moves in the top left in which W made use of to gain territory. 

Try going for territory in the beginning and defending when the opponent attacks, instead of initiating the attack so early in the game. Look for the biggest point on the board and go for it.

Also, bear in mind that W is a 5k in this game and  stronger than me. That means that the variations I put in the review may not be the best way to play. However, its probably better than the moves in the actual game.
