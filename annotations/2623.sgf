C[[Malweth\] I think I played a fairly good game, and I won by 5.5, but my opponent did make a fairly large mistake that we understand.

What could I have done to make the win more definite? It was a free game, so I did take some minor liberties in the opening, but I can't say it was my worst opening ever!

Hi!  I`m a 4k on kgs using the handle "Ixiah".  I will use "Ix" when commenting on the game.   Just glancing through it white`s mistake was not what cost him the game.  Actually it was the yose that followed where he just reacted almost the whole time.]

;W[od];B[oc]LB[mc:3][oc:1][ld:2]C[Ix:  Your choice is one is the most popular moves  by pro`s according to my database.  Two and three have also played.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[oe]C[[Malweth\] This is a breach in joseki. I wanted to see the outcome of this, though it seemed even in the end.  

Ix:  I think the reason why this move is not played is because there are bigger moves.  It appears you want influence down the side--if that was intended better would have been to attach at  p15.  See the joseki comparison at the start of the game.]
;W[jc]LB[hc:A][lc:B]C[Ix:  Temporarily settling his group.  " A" now becomes a big move for black at some point (extension and threatening the stability of white`s group).]

;W[pj]
(;B[ne]TR[hc][cj][nq]C[Ix:  Small at this point of the game and you need another move just to get the white stone!  I think the triangle points are bigger.]

;W[cn]TR[hc][cj]C[Ix:  Here black has two extensions.  C10 just grabs points.  H17 grabs points -and- makes a threat so it is the better move.]
;B[cj]LB[af:1][bf:2][ag:4][bg:3][ah:5][bh:6][ai:8][bi:7]C[Ix:  If white`s stone was at d6 rather then c6 then this would have been fine.  A good rule of thumb is that extensions toward enemy stones on the 3rd line like this generally are not as big as they appear. Its only worth 8 in gote and that is if he lets you have it all.]

;W[pq]
(;B[em]C[Ix:  This goes for the muyo not a bad idea--the problem is your a bit too loose.  Remember muyos are best made in a box like shape.   E15 would not be a bad move for black.]

(;B[gm]C[[Malweth\] Perhaps this stone isn't very important anyway? It separates two strong groups.

(;B[dg];W[eg];B[dh];W[mg]TR[dg][dh]SQ[ef][eg]C[[Malweth\] I didn't see any good way of stopping this moyo.

;B[hn];W[nf]

[nm]C[[Malweth\] I need to make a move into this moyo... is this too shallow? Should I instead attack on the right side where my influence is more active?

Ix:  Actually it is a bit deep.   In this case you can pick up points via your wall if you dont go deep and have him chase you.   However black is trailing so it is necessary to take risks.  Normally "safe" is the border of the muyo (in this case the square stones).]

Ix:  Final Comments

Looking through the game to me the main thing you need to work on is  middlegame (specifically finding the biggest point and muyos).   If you noticed that was where you got into trouble.  

Your yose was pretty good and you totally dominated your opponent.  

Good luck in your future games,
