C[This is a game i played on the TOM website, i lost on the white side by 4.5. Can
 you point out any moves that i have stupidly made and maybe point out a much bett
er move?
thanks.

xxc : hi
i'll do the review
i try to stay as simple as possible, maybe it is the answer to many of your questi
ons ... simple, try to stay simple :)
go is already awfully difficult to handle, so no reason to make it harder

i'll follow the flow of the game, just pointing out "better" moves in my point of
view

bink: I am commenting the review remarks xxc gave. My comments are not
so much about Go but more about how to write a review. All variations in this
file should be considered as comments by xxc.

bink: Your review is good and helpful if Michael looks 
at the right places. But it is overloaded. The sgf-file
contains far to many variations. I am sure: with less 
work on your side your review would be more help 
to Michael.

Let me first give some general remarks about
your review in more detail:

1) You put a lot of effort into your review.
A lot of your remarks are worthwhile to be given
and you do find a lot of places were you 
show the white player a better option.

2) But: you comment on to many moves! Look first: 
what are the main types of mistakes White is doing 
over all (like: empty triangle or "forhand" moves 
which in reality only make the position worse). 
Then comment only on the moves which belong to those 
main types of mistakes (and in addition on moves
which are really big mistakes). 
You should comment on at most 20-30 moves. This way
Michael has a better chance to work on his main 
mistakes. The way you did it: You give him to much 
material. He has hardly
any chance to find out, which of your comments are
really important and which are not so important.
Tell Michael his main mistakes at the beginning of the
sgf file.

3) A mere technicality: Sometimes you make variations 
which only consist of one (alternative) move. Avoid this.
It makes the sgf-file difficult to handle. You can give 
the same information by 
a) either typing the words "a better move would be at F6"
   (F6 just being an example)
b) or by marking the point and saying "a better move 
   would be to the marked point"
I found it awfully difficult just to handle that sgf-file 
with its more then 100 varitions.

4) Sometimes you just show the better move with no 
explanation. I would recommend: If you consider it
an important thing: Give an explanation why your move is 
better (or why Michael's move is bad). If it is not so 
important, just dont mention your move. It helps 
reducing that enormous amount of information.

5) If you find a move of Michael good, tell him so
at that move.
It is better for Michael, if he sees he has also
done good moves.]

white stones are sealed in at the corner. Black
has excellent thickness. Getting sealed like 
that in the

bink: The opening is horrible for white.
He is ahead in secure territory but blacks thickness
is overwhelming. Black should have an easy game
after this. To get a small life in the corner 
in exchange for so much thickness on the black side
is a very bad result indeed. (Especially given the situation
in the lower right corner)]
(;B[oq]C[xxc : wrong side i think

thickness.]

bink: Of course you are right in critizising whites move.
It is very bad indeed. The exchange white N3 Black M3
worsens whites position by the reason you have given
and it strengthens blacks! The "knight move" connection
Black L3,M5 gets solid! If white really understands
how wrong this move is, he will become 2 stones 
stronger. If I would have written the review I would
have put a lot of effort into just explaining all the
things which are bad with this move. You also put
effort into this. But I am not sure, if Michael can
filter the importance of this out of the many many
places where you are giving comments. 
Do I make myself clear?
I would recommend for the future: Pick only a few 
wrong moves explain why they are wrong, and I am
sure the reviewed player will have more from your 
review.]

sente exchange is good!). before the exchange E15/D16
white had one cut (C14) to worry about, after the exchange
white has two cuts (C14,C16) and can not defend both!

Were there any better ways for me to end the game? Like the procedure of my ending
s, please give me some useful tips, thanks!

xxc :ok :)
i hope comments will be usefull

my studie path (as it's clear you allready understand basics of the game)
1 opening paterns
2 corner paterns
3 end games
4 fight
and loop on that grabing just 1-2 things each part
each one may help you in other parts

about end game : just have a look at first var

found when end game might start is perhaps the key
from my point of view, end game have 2-3 stages
i'll try to show you on your game (sorry, but it is not really suitable for endgam
e studie)
move 35, 68 and 141all circles are endgame moves (the first to get there may gain
something)

overall comment
nice game, not so much "stupid" moves as you say in your first comment :)
mistakes in fight reading (but it's a really hard part to master), and some slow m
oves
try to give an easy line to your game, make strong goup before fighting, extend be
fore invade ...
play solid (not small), take care of your stone, first think about your own stones
, are they all ok ? ... yes ... so can i attack something ? ... and it will be fin
e in your coming games

thank u])
