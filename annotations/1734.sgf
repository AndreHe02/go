C[AlaokRm: This was a game I played on KGS recently. I was black and I lost by 4.5 moku, because of a ko I could have avoided. I put my after game thoughts in the SGF files. My opponent didn't have the opportunity to put his, I din't see him again since the game. Thanks in advance.]
;B[pd]C[dede: Hi, I'm 5k in my country. I hope my comments will be useful.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[nc];B[jd]C[AlaokRm : Here I spaced out. Thought I was on a san-ren-sei, but Q10 is desperately empty. The wall I'll be building will be useless.

dede: This move is OK];W[qf];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc]
(;B[od]C[dede: This is mistake. Black makes empty triangle and has heavy shape.
Look variant];W[qi]
(;B[me]C[dede: This is bad. Black asks opponent to take upper side. Look variant]
;W[ld];B[le];W[pc];B[qd];W[kc]C[dede: This group can develop on both directions, so this move is not ugrent. C10 or q6  looks much better for me.]

(;B[ci]C[MrK : Was it more urgent to play on the east side ?

dede: This move is OK. R9 is another, aggresive (and in my opinion better) option, which allow to use r16 wall for an attack. Look variant.]
;W[cl]C[dede:This is passive response. C9 or c13 is better, White makes  moves that doesn't affect to opponent's play.]
;B[df]C[AlaokRm : Trying to build some influence and maybe use in conjunction with my NE wall.

dede: playing on third line - c14 - is safer]
(;W[fc]C[dede: Again passive move. Look variant];B[jc];W[kb]
;B[jb]C[AlaokRm : Then, I realized that I lost sente for no point at all. Playing around R8 was bigger. A lot bigger, I think.

dede: Definitely, yes. Anyway, k16 stones can be cut from m15 allies, and there's a big hole between d14 and k16 stones. White can push with c15 to take corner and attack with f15, aiming to cut off k16 stones. This would also maintain balance of  influence for White.]
;W[be];B[bf];W[ce];B[cf];W[ql]C[dede: again, passive move. I'd play r6 or q6. So far White has some profit, but his stones are low. Black has some influence, so game is even]
;B[qn]C[AlaokRm : Getting what's left.];W[dq]C[dede: This is big, but in my opinion again passive. F15 and l15 is more important.]
;B[kd]C[AlaokRm : Closing my wall. I also had F15 in sight.

dede: good move, for many reasons. Repairs bad aji, threatens n18 and takes initiative.]
;W[mb];B[fe]C[AlaokRm : OK, let's get some influence.

dede: Important move.];W[go];B[hp];W[dj];B[di];W[ej];B[ei];W[fi]
;B[fh];W[gi];B[gh];W[ho];B[io];W[gp];B[gq];W[hi]C[dede: h12 is better It looks like White tries to avoid any possible fight in the game.]
;B[in]C[AlaokRm : Let's turn before it's too late, building on the SE.

dede: Good. Now g5 stones look pretty useless.];W[gm];B[om]
C[AlaokRm : Continue moyoing on the SE.];W[ok];B[ml]C[AlaokRm : I'll try to see tonight at home if my double keima was cuttable or not. During the game, I calculated that it was not. Wonder...]

;W[hk];B[jk];W[hn];B[ng];W[nh];B[mh];W[ni];B[mi]C[dede:Due to passive White's play, Black leads.]
;W[qq];B[rp];W[pr];B[nr];W[rq]C[dede: White can't make directly 2 eyes like in game, but there are many possibilities in this position, so fight is possible. But need for such uncomfortable fight is painful - White should play more actively earlier in the game.]
;B[pq];W[rs];B[sr];W[sq];B[ps];W[os];B[or];W[qs];B[rr];W[ro]
;B[qp];W[sp];B[rn];W[sn];B[sm]C[AlaokRm : S7 was better. Killing without ko. That cost me the game.]
;W[rm];B[so];W[hq];B[ip]C[dede: Without ko, h2 would be better.]
;W[sn];B[sl];W[sk];B[so];W[hr];B[qr];W[gr];B[jr]C[dede: White group on the left side is now seriously damaged.  Black should push with s9.]
;W[fr];B[qm]C[dede: This move helpes White to repair shape.

(;B[pc]C[dede: This move threatens n17 and builds some corner base for q16 group. Now, k16 works nicely, limiting space for o17 stones.]
