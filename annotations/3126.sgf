C[ M:  Thank you very much for taking a look at this game.  Black plays a very interesting fuseki, and I was caught off-guard.  In retrospect, I think I should have played more solidly to deny black chances to attack.  As it was, the first few fights proved nasty, as black always had support.

M:  I have added comments (preceded by "M:") about my motivations and concerns during the game.  I am especially interested in your opinion of my reasoning at those points.  Again, thanks in advance for all of your comments!

 This is an interesting game, and a fun one to play, I imagine, but because it's unusual, it's hard for me to provide real definite answers to where the right plays are. Perhaps I can make a few comments though. 

Because Black spends his first three moves in the centre, he is looking to invade wherever possible and attack your weak groups. As a result, your aim should be to avoid making weak groups where possible. If you make sure that your groups are safe, then black should struggle to get enough territory.

On the whole you played pretty well - a great invasion on the left, and the sequence which won the game was very good too. I would try to concentrate on giving your groups a base where you can though.

You left one very weak group on the board for most of the game, and allowed another invasion which split off some stones. At my level, a stone or two below dan level in Europe, a large proportion of the games get decided by the player who gets caught with a weak group at the wrong time, so it's important to think about safety for your groups, and if you are going to leave a group weak, to have a good reason why

Thanks for the chance to review the game. I've left a lot of variations in the sgf - don't take them as gospel, but maybe they can give you some ideas.]
;B[jj];W[dp]C[M:  At this point, I am guessing that black wants an aggressive, attack-based game, so I play hoshi to develop quickly and get some support.]
;B[hj];W[pd];B[lj];W[pp]C[The weakness of the star point stone, is of course the 3-3 point. Therefore, black is likely to look to reduce the potential area on the sides, then invade the 3-3 to leave you without any territory.]
;B[de]C[This move wants to develop the left hand side, and will work together well with the middle stones if it can do so, so maybe it's best not to approach the corner straight away]

(;W[dc]C[M:  I worry that this will give black too much influence on top, but with 3 hoshi stones, I decide to take territory when offered.

Well - you don't make any territory in the top left - perhaps entering the corner (which allows black to build on the outside) is giving black what he wants. Hard to tell.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd]
(;W[fd]LB[eb:A]C[This isn't joseki, as far as I know, joseki is at A. See variation. You will need to find time to play A sooner rather than later, or this will become a weak group that black can attack.]
;B[dn]C[Interesting. Already black's centre stones look quite well placed...]

(;W[cn]C[M:  At the time, I was still operating on the "take cash when it is offered" philosophy.  Since black did not complete the joseki, however, perhaps a pincer would be better?

I don't think so - see the variation. This looks ok to me];B[co]
;W[do];B[cm];W[bn];B[dm];W[bo]C[M:  Should have been B7.

No. How you play is best. Now either black plays B7 (gote) or you have the ability to play the invasion you play later. Leave the aji.]

(;W[np];B[qo];W[oo];B[ql];W[qk];B[pl];W[qp];B[ro];W[jp]C[M:  I am worried about Q12, but I am still happy about this result.  My first thought was to play K3, but I was afraid that would give black too much of the center.

Q12 is urgent, K4 is big, but not as important. e18 is still vital]
;B[gp]
(;W[fq]C[M:  In retrospect, this was too territorial.  Perhaps K6, instead?]

;W[hq];B[iq];W[gr]C[M:  I like the large corner, but I'm sure black is thrilled with the result.

I like white's side of this bargain];B[in]
(;W[lq]C[M:  I paused at this point to look at the board.  Black's left side scares me a bit but is still open underneath.  The hole at Q12 is still open.  My top left group is still not settled, and it is running out of places to flee if attacked.

M:  I made this attack hoping to secure a bit more territory by threatening to connect with the stones on K.  I should have looked further ahead:  as I ended in gote, I was not pleased with the result.

because the corner is open on the side, there's not much territory there. See the variation for a better way of playing the bottom, if you are going to play there, 

other wise urgent moves are at e18, q12/r12, and your invasion of the left looks like good timing.]
;B[mq];W[mp];B[kp];W[kq];B[jq];W[mr];B[gc]C[ouch!];W[fc]C[M:  This group is in trouble, but I don't think I have time to deal with it yet.

black MUST continue his attack]
(;B[pb];W[qc];B[qb]C[M:  I wanted to thank black for this move.  It made my Q16 stones more secure.]
;W[rb]C[it's not so bad, white was pretty strong anyway, and you answer, so it looks like a cheeky bit of early endgame play by black to me.]
;B[ph]C[M:  Unfortunately, that meant I was overconfident and messed up here...

good move by black, white's going to get punished here, so you have to decide, can you link the stones up, or do you have to sacrifice them. if so how is the best way?]

(;W[oh];B[oi];W[pi];B[qh];W[oj];B[ni];W[og]C[this is a very aggressive way for white to play- usually only recommended if you are very strong in the region. Remember - black wants to start fights, that's his strategy]
;B[ri]
(;W[rg];B[rk]C[M:  Ouch.];W[cj]C[M:  The top left group group is still in danger, but I fear that strengthening it will give black the entire left side.  I decided to try to reduce the value of the left side first and then strengthen the group.

great move. Perfect timing - another move by black would make a lot of territory on the left. 

I would naturally have looked to play C9, but this looks even better]

[qr][fs][gs][ms][qs]C[M:  That ended far better than I could have expected.

I make you about 45 points on the left, 10 on the bottom right, plus a couple maybe on the top right, plus five prisoners = 62 odd points. 

I make black about 44 in the middle - depending on who goes first. 

So i think you have a bit more territory now, but black has the potential to attack you on the top, i think it's still close...]
;W[me]C[M:  This gives black territory on top, but I wanted to decrease black's potential territory in the center.]
;B[ld];W[mn]C[M:  Sente if black considers the bottom center territory his; also prepares for a rescue attempt on the P10 stones.]
;B[lm];W[gd]C[M:  Getting more access to black's center and strengthening the top group.  I figured this would solidify black's territory on the top, but I thought it was worth the trade.]

(;B[ff];W[hc];B[ic];W[hb];B[le];W[mf];B[kg]C[M:  I am thrilled to get to play N14.  I don't feel that black has much center territory (what with G16), and N14 makes a rescue attempt for the P10 stones possible.

if you realised that N14 helps the P10 stones when you played it, then it's bloody good reading. But why then play the H15 sequence?]
;W[he]C[M:  I didn't see that this would make J18 sente for black.]

Yes probably it's worth carrying on a bit...black will still get some territory in the middle, but he's a long way behind, maybe he can attack the top right group thou - it looks quite loose. Something like S15 or 16 might shake things up a bit.

Still, a great sequence from you in the centree- it probably deserves to win the game]
