AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[I find that I prefer to play a strong territory game with this many stones. I realize that my opponent will likely try to fight me. So shape is important for me. The great thing about go is you can get different answerers for what is best from each person you ask. Moves that work for you now at your current level, may no longer work for you when you are a 14k.

My teacher taught me this: Before each move ask yourself the following three questions.

1) Are any of my groups weak, if so I must help them.

2) Are any of my opponent's groups weak, if so, put pressure on them.

3) If there is no weakness. Take the biggest point move for yourself.]

Adam - I hope that this helps you a bit. Keep good and strong shape  Ask yourself the questions I typed at the begining. Make every stone have a purpose and have a way to support that purpose. The stones you place in the first 40 moves are very important. They setup the structure for what you will be working with for the remainder of the game. Before you make a move, be sure it has been at least ten seconds since your opponent has played and have at least two moves in mind, and then pick the best one. Count your liberties often, if you have a group that has three or less liberties, you need to find a way to increase liberties, and if there is not a way, then you need to let it go. Try to read ahead moves. Before you make your move look at what your opponent's best response is, and see how you will feel when he does that. It will help your game. Feel free to email questions if I missed anytying. I will give you all I know.  Keep up the great work, study life and death, and shape. Tesuji is always nice to study. Make every stone count!
