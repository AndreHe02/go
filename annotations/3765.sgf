C[Hi. Thanks for reviewing my game. A few things that I want to point out are that I was pretty satisfied with the way I played. However, even so, I lost the game by 9.5 with 0.5 komi. So, I was wondering exactly which points I should focus on in my play. Also, please correct any mistakes that I might've made during the game. Thanks!

C[And that's the game. I was pretty satisfied with my play, so I was disappointed that I lost the game. Please give me any closing comments that could help me improve. Thanks again for reviewing my game! I really appreciate it.

L: Generally, The game started out okay, until the attack on the S4 group, which let white to make influence, and the mistake at R12, and N15. Other than that, the game was well played. Perhaps the strategy was lacking a bit, so I suggest you look into that a bit. I hope these comments will help you improve your game play.]
