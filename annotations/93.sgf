C[Hi Ronald,
I'm commenting on ths game for the Go Teaching Ladder.  In general, when you're submitting a game for comments it's a good idea to specify any particular parts of the game you're especially interested in or any particular questions you have, so the reviewer has an idea where to start.  I've done my best to make suggestions here, but feel free to ask me if you have further questions.

You and your opponent both played a good game.  In general, you were both guilty of the fault which is the bane of kyu players  :)  which is to play small moves while ignoring huge areas of the board lying open elsewhere.  *Always* before playing a move in a local area ask yourself "What is the point difference if I play here or if my opponent plays in this area first?"  You'll soon see that some spots are crying out for attention and others are not.
Sometimes it's hard to estimate where to play.  Certainly I often make bigger errors than either you or your opponent did in this game.  But you'll surely get better with practise.

Other specific weaknesses -- you need to watch out for making big jumps which can be easily cut.  Your opponent often made diagonal connections -- simply a solid connection may be better.  Or if feeling secure, try a knight's move jump.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[qf];W[cn]C[Okay, white ignored the black approach.  When you ignore to a joseki, you better be confident that you'll get sente to come back and play another move in that corner.  Or that gains to be had are bigger elsewhere.]
;B[bq]C[I'm not familiar with this joseki (this response to the 3-6 move).  Unless you're fairly sure about what you're doing, try the more common pincer (around c9) or jump away to around g4.  Sometimes a shimari is good, but maybe not so early in the game.
Note that your move secures the corner fairly well, but puts almost no pressure on the white stone.]
;W[dj]C[White moves in gote here, giving black the chance to play another move in the upper right corner.  This is why the c6 move may not have been so good...]
;B[pj]TR[nd][nc][md]C[... but black instead plays a very tame move, jumping away from the corner!  Standard practise in this situation is to try to enclose the corner by playing around o16.  You don't hope to kill white, but by threatening to kill you can build walls across both the upper and the right edge.  These walls can be used to secure territory along the top and right, and extend into the middle

Triangles are all good options for black.];W[jc];B[jq]C[Risky because...]
;W[of]C[... this joseki works quite well for white in combination with the k17 stone.  Of course black has a similar option at e6.
Invasions around m17 will probably still work, though.];B[ph]
;W[qc]C[Not sure why white plays this move.  If he's trying to protect the corner q16 is equally good.  Perhaps he thought this move protects better against an invasion near n17.]
;B[rd]C[This is now a small move.  It's time to look elsewhere.]
;W[en]C[White promptly seizes the chance to tenuki.  e6 is a big point.
Notice how white's moyo is extending further toward the centre than black's at this point.]
;B[go]C[Slightly loose.  Of course you're looking for centre influence but now you have to worry about white cutting this stone off from the corner.]
;W[pm]C[Around n4 might be better  (because of the weakness of the k3-g5 connection)...]
;B[qn]C[Excellent.  You push from your weak group towards your strong one, and also might be able to push along the sixth line.]
;W[qm];B[ql]C[This is not so good.  You're pushing from your strong side, making a contact move (which will help him grow stronger) and you still leave the 2nd row open for him.]
;W[pl];B[qk];W[rm];B[qo]C[Very passive!  How about q6 instead?]
;W[nl];B[nj];W[ll];B[mn]C[Correct direction, but the stone at n6 is a long way from its friends.  See how close white comes to isolating it in the next few moves.  Maybe o6 better.]
;W[lj];B[lh];W[ln];B[ko]C[Bad, because splitting your stones apart here with m5 would be very good for white.  m5 better.]
;W[kn]C[White takes the more passive route, allowing you to block at m5.]
;B[lo];W[jo];B[jp];W[io];B[ho]C[Again, you are providing white with an "open door" which he can enter to cut up your bottom territory.  Once he plays j4, it is very difficult for you to connect your bottom side groups.  White is secure enough that he does not really have to worry about the cut point at k6.]
;W[im]C[Again, white takes the safe defensive route.];B[ip]
C[So you're able to seal off your bottom, but it cost you an extra move to do this...]
;W[in]C[... however white gives up the initiative with an unnecessary gote move.

Sit back and look at the position.  White's right side group now has strong shape, and can probably either live or move out to the right.  If white can secure his moyo in the 2nd quadrant, he will surely win.  By contrast, black's potential territory is fairly well etched out, with all strong groups.  So black's strategy must be to reduce white in the centre and the upper left, by some large margin (as soon as possible), and white should try to defend his moyo as soon as possible.  Instead, both of you start playing small peripheral moves.]
;B[ng];W[ne]TR[nf][me][mf]C[The diagonal connection again.  Any of the three triangle moves would work better.  Probably the knight's jump to n15 is best for white locally.]
;B[nf];W[jk]C[Unnecessary!  This group is already strong -- think about how black would try to kill it.  As I said, the 2nd quadrant is much more urgent.]
;B[lf];W[me];B[mf];W[og]C[Pointless, since the black answer at p12 is too obvious.  This move gains nothing.]
;B[oh];W[ke];B[pe]C[Again, this move gains nothing.  You gain essentially no territory, and white is happy to connect.

The next ~12 moves are all much too small for this part of the game.  Try and estimate what a difference it would have made if white tenuki'd at some stage and played, say, around g16 instead.]
;W[oe];B[mi];W[rc];B[qd]C[ok this is sente but still, small]
;W[oc];B[pf];W[bo];B[bp];W[co];B[cp];W[eo];B[ep];W[el]C[Wrong place to protect, white must play in 2nd quadrant.  Locally g7 is better to keep black out.]
;B[cf]C[Finally   ;)];W[bd];B[fc];W[ee];B[gf]C[Very light plays, good.]
;W[ef];B[le];W[ld];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[jd];B[hd];W[kf];B[kg]
;W[ch]MA[fi][gi][hl][fk][gl][ij][hj]TR[fh][gg]C[This is very passive by white.  At least f12/g13 and try to keep black out of the marked area.]
;B[if];W[eh]C[Still too passive];B[gi]C[The last 20 moves have swung the score by 50+ points in black's favour.  Compare with the 20 moves before that, or the next 20 moves, which barely affect by a fraction of that.]
