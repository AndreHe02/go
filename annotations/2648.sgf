C[Hi. This is jraitsev2[8k\] on KGS

This is a very exciting game - and i really enjoyed reviewing it. I can only imagine how exciting it has been for you :)
I hope you will find my comments useful and if you have any questions - email me at jraitsev@cme.com

here is my general impression of a game:
===================================
*) opening needs to be rethought
*) your fighting skills need to be improved.
*) your end game is much better than 15k (may be 11-12k) - good job there!

*) you have a tendency to leave weak groups behind - bad idea - avoid it
*) you seem to have right ideas many times, but execution suffers sometimes (this is typical of most players on all levels)
*) you must practice life and death problems - many times you would have won this game by W's resigning.]

in one word - yes :)

for 2 reasons:
