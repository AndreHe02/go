C[>>Dear reviewer, thank you very much for review.
>>In this game I was black and I lost by 9,5 points

Hi,

I am KGS 5d, and I'll review this game. I hope you'll enjoy it !]

(;B[df]C[This move is okay (that probably shouldn't be a surprise !) But it's not 100% consistent with what is coming hence the need for a comment here...

Look at the variation to see the other choice, which you also know for sure, and keep it in mind to understand my next comments.]
;W[fc]
(;B[cj]C[This move is joseki, but it has a slightly strange feeling. I am not sure wether you are aware of some of the subtelity of this fuseki, so I am going to show you one of the most basic variation.

Once you have looked at the variation, I think you can now see why I think D14 isn't very consistent with C10. D14 is saying "I want influence and thickness !", which is very normal because you have already played 2 hoshis, which also scream for influence / thickness. So it'd be normal to follow it up with D10. 

By playing C10, you say "I want territory !", in that case, the previous variation, the one with D14 at D13 is more consistent, because it gives you a bit more territory !

Overall, if you play D14 , then you are expected to play D10 to be consistent with the "hoshi + influence" thing
If you play D13, then you are aiming at territory, and then C9 becomes normal. 

You may think I am already cutting hairs in 4 right from the beginning, and you may be right, but you have to be very aware of your strategical choices even at move 11.]
;W[qj];B[fq];W[cn]
(;B[qh]C[This is strange. You are treating F3 as a kikashi, but it's a very valuable stone, making a nice extension from Q4, also, it puts pressure on the corner (the white corner is surrounded by 2 black groups), so you can't just let it alone here. 

If your idea was that you could play R12 in sente, do something around the corner, then come back to take care of F3, then you are taking risks. It'd be better to do the R12 thing first, then IF you end in sente, play F3.]
;W[qm]
(;B[np]C[This is slack];W[ip];B[kq];W[eq]C[How I had to answer here?

Here, the most simple answer is probably the best, look at the variation. The thinking here is that F3 is now an even more important stone than before : 1) it means a lot territorialy wise (you can't let white have everything up to J4) 2) it cuts J4 from the corner, so it's an important stone for attack ... So you have to save it. How to save a threatened stone ? Get out ! So here, nobi up or any other move that goes up is good : ikken tobi would be interesting for exemple. By getting out, you also put more pressure on J4, so this is nice. Finally, by making a nobi up, you threaten once again the corner invasion, so all in all, the nobi up makes perfect sense, even if it's an obvious move.]

(;B[er]C[This is very weird, you are making white much stronger for no reason.]
;W[dr]
(;B[ep]C[Ouch ! In this shape, never make atari ! You could use the peep at C3 to invade the corner. Look at the variation.]
;W[dq]
(;B[ir]C[You can't get all submissive like this ! Look at the variation, which is just a random exemple of things you could do.

Also, this isn't such a great shape, there is some aji at H2 and G2, I think you can figure it out yourself.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[gq]LB[pc:A]C[Here, you can tenuki for now. A is huge !]
;B[fp];W[fr]C[White messes up, G2 would be very severe, and that's why you could tenuki, there is nothing to save around here...]
;B[gr];W[es];B[hp]C[this is a very very very good result for you.]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[This is WAY too submissive. But Q14 isn't much better. Take a look at the vars.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[ld]

(;W[lb];B[le];W[kc];B[kg]C[This could have been a smart move, but here, it doesn't work too well. Just connecting is better in my opinion.]

;B[gg];W[ff];B[fg];W[nf];B[ql]C[This doesn't work very well in this position. It works really good when R7 is at R6 but your corner is just one spot too far.]

;W[on];B[nn];W[qi];B[sp]C[Okay, there is nothing special to say about the endgame.

Overall, you could have lost by more because of how the middle game developped. You gave too much thickness to white in the center : look at how many points she made ! It happened because you invaded a 2 point extension (the only reasont to do that is when you want to kill ! or else, it's just not worth the trouble, it's better to just enclose it and give 4 points to the opponent), then you gave a ponnuki in the center, and finally, you waited too long to reduce. This is obvious once it's all said and done, I guess. 

I hope you learned some things or that you got new ideas for your next games !

See you.])

Obviously, if white gets stronger in the area, then you may consider adding a move to protect your weaknesses. However, in this case, A Isn't a weakness. It's nothing special : the corner is pretty open, this weakness doesn't make it "more open", just "as open as if it wasn't here".]

This is the meaning behind making a move on the fourth line (A) to begin with.

Obviously, white has already cashed in quite a bit, but this is definitly not going to be easy for her.]
