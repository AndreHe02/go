AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[buckyyowza: comments by Mark Fyffe (3k on kgs).  i comment for both players, but i have been teaching black for a while, so i am more familiar with his play and concentrate a little heavier on black's game.

i hope you enjoy my review, please contact me if you have any questions.]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[kd:A][lc:B][dj:C][jp:D]C[buckyyowza: to me, this is poor choice of joseki with this handicap.  white wants to settle quickly with a thick position on the upper side, and you are helping.  Since you start with a large center influence, the corners are not so big as the upper sides and center of the board (until later). why not try a pincer joseki at A (l16) or B  (m17) to stay thick in the upper left, or take a big point on a remaining start point like C (d10) or D (k4).]
;W[nd];B[ob]LB[pf:A]C[buckyyowza: A (q14) is joeski to follow up p17.  even though this isn't the joeski i'd choose given 5 stones, it is always best to finish what you start.  p18 is heavy play, as it puts no specific threat on white's stones, nor does it offer any added security in the corner.]
;W[nb]LB[ng:A][gd:B]C[buckyyowza: in a large handicap game, white needs to play for fast development to break down black's thick opening position.  a large center jump at A (o13), or a high approach to the upper right like B (g16) appeal to me as punishment for black's heavy gote play.  o18 just passively allows black to control the flow of the opening.]

(;B[qg]LB[kc:A]C[buckyyowza: you are becoming overconcentrated on the upper right now.  a better follow-up to the previous few plays is to prevent white from settling so easy.  try A (l17), see var on w5.]
;W[fc]LB[gd:A]C[buckyowza: i prefer a high approach here to prevent a pincer (see w5)]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[hd]LB[df:A]TR[fc][fd]C[buckyyowza: again, A (d14) is important joseki. h16 is too close to white's marked stones (f16 group) to attack.  in fact, if this situation is seen in tewari (as if white had just played f16 or f17), h16 would be under attack.  only now it white's turn.]
;W[jd]LB[hb:A][ff:B]C[buckyyowza: this is too easy on black. A (h18) floats black's weak stone and keeps your walls connected. B (f14) improves your thickness and puts significant pressure on the upper left.]
;B[ld]LB[jb:A][jc:B]C[buckyyowza: you are walking right into a strong pincer.  again, this position would be bad enough if it was still your turn, but now it is white's. a white stone at A (k18) now secures a connection to both walls for white, but a black stone a B (k17) instead of m16 makes good use of your previous play at h16.]
;W[le];B[ke];W[kd];B[me];W[lf];B[md]
(;W[ne]LB[lc:A][mf:B]TR[ke]C[buckyyowza: this starts a sequences that is destructive to white by forcing black to play B (n14), which gives strength to black's aji at j15. your best bet here is to play A (m17) to stay connected. see var on b18.]
;B[mf];W[lb]LB[lc:A]C[buckyyowza: A (m17) is better because you would stay connected.  see var for how black may punish this play.]

(;B[jf]C[buckyyowza: this would normally be ok, but you need to consider what you are forcing... see w23]
;W[lg]TR[ld][md][me][mf][ke][jf]C[buckyyowza: now these stones (n16 and l15 groups) are becoming weak.  it is difficult to protect two groups at once, but easy not to force them to come under attack.  instead of thinking about fighting, black might consider letting white live small on the upper side and taking big points elsewhere.  fights are difficult to win for black in high handicap games.]

;W[lh];B[mi];W[pm];B[qn]LB[np:A][ii:B][kk:C][cn:D][fq:E]C[buckyyowza: consider instead, the joseki play a A (o4). right now, white has a small amount of territory on the upper side, and is making significant gains in the center battle with big points at B (j11), D (c6), and E (f3).  the largest area on the board is the lower left quadrant, so extension at C (l9) is also a good choice for black.]
;W[qm]LB[kk:A][nq:B]C[buckyyowza: white is again responding to a slow gote play.  if you are concerned about settling your group, it is easier to get sabaki on the lower side and connect to it. try an approach at B (o3) to get shape down there.  since you are giving 5 stones, however, you can always count on being able to settle later and work on getting more liberties.  i prefer an extension at A (l9).]
;B[qj];W[qi]C[buckyyowza: white misreads here.  this game is decided more by white's mistakes than by black's brilliant play, and this area is the source of most of those blunders.  i think the biggest mistake both players make, however, is a little less obvious than these tactical blunders... in battle so far the results are fairly even, but there is a large black influence growing on the left side that neither player seems to take much notice of.  that is, white is unconcerned with the influence while black is failing to take advantage of it.]
;B[ri];W[rj];B[qh];W[pi];B[rk];W[rf];B[qf];W[pn];B[qo];W[op]
;B[np]LB[oq:A]C[buckyyowza: this is the wrong direction. A (p3) is much more efficient at protecting your corner.]
;W[oq];B[pq];W[pr];B[qr];W[or];B[rq];W[po]LB[oo:A]C[buckyyowza: it is simpler to connect with A (p5).  black's corner is solid, so q5 accomplishes nothing.]
;B[no];W[oo];B[nn];W[rn];B[ro];W[rm]LB[kk:A]C[buckyyowza: this is unimportant if you consider black's oppressive thickness in the lower left quadrant of the board. it is best to begin to erase some of that moyo by extending at A (l9).]
;B[kk]C[buckyyowza: excellent play ;-)];W[qp]LB[lj:A]C[buckyyowza: A (m10) is urgent. even if black ignores your play and takes A, the corner is very small compared with center at this point, so the trade would not be even.]

;B[be]LB[bc:A]C[buckyyowza: this play gives up the corner. consider pushing from the other instead; A (b17) would kill the white stones.]
;W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[fb]LB[gk:A][nl:B][ie:C]C[buckyyowza: black's upper left corner is already dead, and cannot be saved.  consider sealing a large kill in exchage for the corner.  A (g19), B (o8), and C (j15) are all effective for getting compensation for the loss.]

;B[mm];W[mo]LB[nk:A]C[buckyyowza: oh no! A (o9) is urgent.  you can only kill black if all of your attacking stones are alive. this is the mistake that lost white the game, although black's mistake a few moves later is nearly large enough to get it back ;-)]
;B[nk];W[kh];B[ol]LB[ms:A]C[buckyyowza: think a little bigger.  A (n1) kills a much larger group.]
;W[ns];B[dk]LB[gr:A][gl:B][dj:C]C[buckyyowza: you could still be considering larger play. A (g2) would get the endgame off to a good start with a large sente play, and B (g8) would continue the battle by keeping white cut apart. you have a decent lead, as white has made a few large mistakes, but you still need to play consistent if you expect to win.  after this play, white can use C (d10) as a stepping stone to take some profit on the left side, so it is best to keep the heat on instead of playing defensively.]
;W[kf];B[je];W[gg];B[gh];W[hh]C[buckyyowza: here is a prime example of why you shouldn't let your guard down in a handicap game... even if you are winning. Although this isn't a game losing mistake, it certainly could be since it closes the gap, making the endgame matter quite a bit.  even though white made some large mistakes earlier, he is still a stronger player so the game is now difficult for black because of the close gap in score.

this is also a reason why white should never resign a handicap game too early ;-)

my review ends here.  i've enjoyed looking over this game quite a bit.  the handicap adds an interesting aspect to go that many overlook.  white has to walk a fine line between playing too small in an effort to be sensible, and playing too large and leaving gaping holes for black to take advantage of.  all in all, both players in this game did their share of underestimating the other leading to some interesting situations.

in fact, i think the fight in this game got too large for either player to manage.  in closing, i'd recommend to both players (but especially black!):

- don't be so eager to fight!  the fight will eventually come, and it is better if you are prepared for it. see b10, w43, w83
- always consider which part of the board is largest before playing.  in this game, the lower left was ignored far too long, and was difficult for white to get into.  there were many points where a small endgame move was played in lieu of a large scale reduction, invasion, or opening sequence.  see b4, w89, b184
- before you push, think about the direction in which you are pushing.  black especially has a nasty habit of pushing his opponent into desirable situations. see w19, b22, w65, and of course b234 ;-)

thanks again for playing a nice game to review :-). if you have any questions, feel free to contact me at mark@accessidaho.org, or look for me as aheimlich on kgs and igs.]
