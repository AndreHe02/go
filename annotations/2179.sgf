C[Xris: Hi my name is chris (xris on igs) and i would generally like to know how to improve my game. I just about won with 5.5 points and cant find any major mistakes i made although i found some minor ones worth mabe 10 points total. Hence I would like to know on which part of my play I should try to improve next.


rhi: Hi, I'm Richard, and I wil try to review your game as you which.

AFAIK: as far as I know];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[jc]LB[po:A]
[qo:B][jp:C]C[Xris: Is this the most efficient way to play here? I thought that since I am black I should play to save terretory and not so aggresively.

rhi:
I guess that the urgent move is the shimari (corner enclosure) at 'A' or 'b',unless you have a clear strategy waiting for white's approach.
(in which case 'c' extension would be better, AFAIK)];W[qn]
;B[qo]LB[qk:A][jp:B]MA[mp][mq][nq]C[Xris:  Again is this efficient? Would it be better to extend to the left (on one of the X's maybe)?

rhi: it is _not_.

because that strenghtens white.
The exents you talk about ('x) are the only moves to play.

don't think about any pincer ('a') since U don't have any stone around 'b']
;W[pn];B[kp];W[np];B[nq];W[op];B[oq];W[pj];B[qh];W[ri];B[rh]
;W[qi];B[eq]TR[kp]C[Xris:  Is it too early to invade or should I have played black 19 at white 20?

rhi: this is not an invasion, but an 'approach'.

It is the good time (even late) to play it.
It is the right place.
Last but not least: it is a good extensions for marked stone.

It is a _good_ move !];W[gq]C[rhi: because of what we said white's answer isn't good.
We'll see ...];B[eo];W[go];B[em];W[dl];B[cn]C[rhi: YES !
(one move before was even better: white should have played it)]
;W[dn];B[co];W[do];B[dp];W[dm];B[en];W[cm];B[bp];W[bn];B[bo]
;W[jq]LB[cq:A]C[rhi: this is _the_ move !
white *had* to take this life's space.
which makes me say that black should have taken it first ?

however, you now have to take off white's aji: capture !];B[kq]
C[rhi: capture c4 is better];W[jp];B[de]
(;W[ce]
(;B[dg]C[Xris:  Was the jump with black 41 correct or should I have simply extended?

rhi: see variation for traditonal joseki.];W[hc]LB[fc:A]C[rhi: white's too far !
black's next move is the  cut at 'a'];B[ib];W[hb];B[md]LB[je:A]
C[rhi: 'A' is wider !];W[qc];B[qd]MA[qh][rh]C[Xris: Is this the right side to lead white to? I thought that if I had done it the other way round I might have ended up with a little more terretory but put my two black stones marked with X at danger. 

rhi: it is such a difficult question that I can almost tell you ...

but:

black marked stones aren't in danger (you will connect)

it is not a matter of territory, but of splitting white's forces.

it is also a matter of maintaining your own forces connected.

But the main thing: having a good reason for you'r move:
this is *good*.];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[rd];B[re]
;W[rc]
(;B[ci]LB[qf:A]MA[de][dg]C[Xris: Best move? I thought creating a base for the two Xed stones was more important than securing terretory somewhere else

rhi:
first U have to end up with upper right sequence.
connect at 'a' before this weakness leads to a bad thg for U.


second, it is (almost) the right time to play with those 2 black stones
bu look at variation for better moves.];W[dj]
(;B[di]C[rhi: this looks like 'mechanical' answer.
was it necessary ?

a move around uppr left shimari would be better.

see variations: black can get easy life on the edge.];W[cj]
;B[bj]C[rhi: yose move.
prefer an attack in the corner.];W[cd];B[cf];W[qb];B[ng];W[pf]

;B[of];W[nh];B[mg];W[mh];B[fc]MA[hb][hc]C[Xris: Was there a way to cut off the two white stones?

rhi: U did cut'em from other friendly stones.
the question is: how to exploit it ?

W connects at 'a' ;)];B[ec];W[jd]

C[Xris: Did I give him too much terretory there? Now that I look at it I think I should have not played 107 since there is no threat to stones or terretory there.
