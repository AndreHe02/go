C[Hello I am your reviewer today.   My name is Rogerio Luz and every time I will give my opinion I will post after a R>.

Well, I hope we all have fun and grow .];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp]C[B: standard 4-4, 3-4 opening trying to emphasize the right]
;W[op];B[qn];W[dd];B[fc]C[B: approaching top left in anticipation of invading corner later]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[B: trying to pincer and extending from top left

R> Good idea.];W[qc];B[pc]C[B: preventing white linkup

R> this is the right way to go... R16 would only be good if black had a stone at R10]
;W[qd]
(;B[qe]C[R> The correct joseki here is Q15 ..... witch follows :   1. B Q15   W Q18
2. B P18   W  R18
3. B P17   W  R14
4. B P13   ...   (see variation)   Black has outer influence and is very solid white gets the corner and sente.]
;W[re];B[df]C[B: pincer attack on the top left

R> not good... Q18 now links the white group (see variation) and that will make the M17 stone useless.]

(;W[ee];B[rf]C[B: returning to right to do double hane for standard 3-3 invasion, but doesn't seem to work too well (any suggestions?)

R> Why not just extending to R14 and pressing white down? You have the big influence at the top and white still has to run for his life at the left upper corner. You must keep in mind your plan ... if you played Q16 at the beginning you MUST understando why... you want influence. so the midle is very important to you.]
;W[qf]C[B: I was surprised by this move and wasn't sure how to respond to the cut here. In the next move you can see I'm trying to attack the pincered white stone (probably not a good move?)

R> this is a normal joseki, the double hane makes this possible. (see variation). but it is a bad joseki at this time . It let´s white escape from the corner and extend to the side. It was better NOT to make the double hane joseki this time (as I said earlier)]

(;B[ne]C[B];W[md];B[pe]C[B: not sure if this step was necessary -- I was afraid if white took the stone then my shape would collapse on the right]
;W[rg];B[dn]C[B: trying to approach on bottom while forcing white not to pincer so I can establish base between two black tiles

R> You have the right thougt in mind. But you must understand that D6 does not prevent a pincer. But it is bad for white to pincer right now , the best is extending twords the P4 lonely stone.]
;W[fp]
(;B[dj]C[R> D10 is the worst possible place for a stone right now... It leaves two cutting points D8 and D 12. I think the best would be to end the joseki with C4. (see variation ) and then make a more solid extension . D10 DOES NOT CONNECT THE 2 STONES!!]
;W[co];B[cn]C[R> This is just bad play by white ... this makes perfect shape for black. Even if you are not sure if you will live put a stone in those weak spots... the worst you´ll do is waste a stone right now...   There is a go proverb that ilustrate this shape:   "Extend 2 spaces from a stone , extend 3 spaces from a 2 stone wall, extend 4 spaces from a 3 stone wall, etc... "   See how D10 was a space away from ideal extension of D6? When white kicks with C5 it is most of the time good for black to C6. But this time it was EXCELENT for black to do so because now he has ideal shape "... extend 3 spaces from a wall of 2 stones".]
;W[bo];B[do]C[R> Wasted move. If you wanted to play in this area the B6 is better]
;W[bn]C[B: was this a wrong move here? Should I have done a straight attack instead of forming the filled triangle?

R> as I said before it was a wasted move...];B[cm]C[R> Bad move again, the hane at B7 I think was quite solid right now]
;W[lq];B[oq]C[B: trying to take the corner using small knight's move]
;W[nq];B[pq];W[iq]C[B: Should I have pincered instead of protecting corner? Seems like the white gained a lot with this move.

R> Yes white made a very solid territory in the side. J3 instead of P3 was an option here. but it would be an invasion, not a pincer.]
;B[qj]C[B: trying to pincer upward and extend

R> no pincer since the upper right corner for white is safe. The extension is not urgent... the top is urgent... whoever plays there first has the advantage now.]
;W[ge]C[R> See?];B[cc]C[B: invading the corner];W[fh];B[ic]
C[B: again, I'm confused here...when the white moves towards the center, should I follow, or should I have made the move I made?

R> White can´t live any more in the corner so he makes a run for the center... now it is time to put a lot of pressure in this white group so you can build a big territory in the midle.  The thinking is not how to kill white but how o make him live small and leaving black a good center. If you manage to kill him that is a bonus. On the other hand you have to make that stone on the 3x3 at C17 into real territory, or the invasion was just a waste of energy.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[fd];B[gc];W[ie];B[le]C[B: not sure if this was a good move either...trying to peep out into the center and preventing the white from connecting up

R> good move but you must watch out ... there are a lot of living groups near these 2 white stones. (R14 and J15 are alive, if he connects game is over)]
;W[me];B[lh]C[B: trying to further wall off the white and begin center influence]
;W[hh];B[dh];W[on];B[ol]C[B: again, I was trying to extend into the center, but not sure if this made my position weak in the right because it later comes under attack. I try to move to the center early because I used to lose many games by taking all the sides by losing influence in the center. suggestion?

R> this is a weak play. it leaves all kind of ways to attack the right side (R8, Q7, Q9, S10, etc... ) . Or you save the side or you just make a more agressive move like O5 witch cuts white or K7 witch reduces some of the white center]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[rd];B[nd]C[B: should I have attacked white's corner at this point? I guess I was trying to be defensive and form the bamboo joint to secure the 4 black stones while trying to attack the two white stones at N-15 and N-16.

R> Q14 is sente... start with that, then simply Q18 in sente again to protect your territory. But there still is the cut at O5 and the attack ata the center white stones to make more territory.]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[ld]C[B: should I have moved at M-16 instead?

R> M16 is better but you must be carefull about the connection]
;B[ke];W[lb];B[kc];W[nb];B[kb];W[nf];B[of]C[B: here the white at O-14 gave me some pressure since the wall on the left was getting thick, so I tried to come out. is there a better way of doing this?

R> atari at Q14?];W[ma];B[ng]C[R> very bad play... P18 kills the white group]
;W[pb]C[R> This is a conection... white only lost this game because he made a mistake and you were able to cut him at P18, I can't see how white could let you do that, but that is where he lost a 30 point game.]
;B[oc]C[B: trying to form eye since wasn't confident that my black stones could escape

R> Taking a stone at N14 would be better because it eliminates the threat of white cutting the 2 L-M15 stones.]
;W[ml];B[gj]C[B: trying to exert central influence by forming box shape and also enclose top left white stones

R> white´s N8 is an overplay... it can be cut... why not just make him pay with O7?]
;W[hm];B[lk]C[R> this is weak ... white is getting too much of the center. Maybe L7 can still live... I would have tried]
;W[jl];B[gn]C[B: here I was trying to prevent the white from completing the bottom wall, but as you can see later in the game I wasn't very successful.

In general, are there ways of invading this kind of white wall, or is it too thick?

This is getting pretty thick ... letting it get like this is very bad... but ther is still O7 to gain something...]
;W[hn];B[ll]C[B: my attempt at breaking the wall];W[nr];B[ce]
;W[bd];B[be];W[qs];B[qr];W[bm];B[bl];W[al];B[ak]C[B: is there a better way to play this sequence? seems like after I play the double hane my stones are vulnerable to a cut

R> Yes they are under attack since white C8 starts a Ko... but if in the futture you have the same fear you can always extend a space further with C9 and if he extends too at A9 you atari 2 white stones at A10 preventing him of trying a ko.]
;W[mf];B[pg]C[B: further trying to escape and connect my top stones with the stones on the right]
;W[kd];B[jd];W[mk]
(;B[mj]C[B: wrong direction?

R> yes, N7 is a clean cut (see variation)];W[lm];B[mm];W[nm]

(;B[nk]C[R> This is a very bad play. N7 was still a good cut... (see variation)]
;W[mn];B[go]C[B: trying to push downward, again trying to decrease white influence on the bottom and center, but not very successful

R> This is not influence any more this is real territory, influence is used to attack, this is surounding territory in the most honest way white can.]
;W[ip];B[gp];W[gq]C[R> There is a good black invasion here (see variation)]

(;B[ps];W[je];B[bc];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bg];W[pm];B[qm]C[B: the white invasion here caused me some problems....seems like my wall was too thin to prevent the invasion]
;W[lj];B[nj];W[li];B[mi]C[B: trying to build up outer wall]
;W[kh];B[lg];W[lf];B[ki]C[B: is this cut ok? I was trying to trap the two stones and perhaps extend upward and to the right]
;W[kj];B[kg];W[ji]C[B: I used the atari to try and save the two stones at L-15 and M-15 sinec I wanted to try to kill the white group on top that seemed a bit heavy

R> The group is very ... VERY alive.];B[kf];W[jg];B[hl]C[B: trying to increase center influence

R> wrong play. G7 is best];W[gm]C[B: seems like I should have put my black stone here instead?

R> yes];B[fm];W[eo];B[en];W[gl];B[fo];W[ep];B[pl];W[hk];B[nl]
;W[mm]C[B: here it seems white has pretty much secured the bottom and bottom center...I seem to be a bit behind in points

R> seems to me about 30 points in white's favor];B[pn];W[ri]
C[B: should I have made the defense on my stone's base sooner?]
;B[qg];W[rj];B[pf];W[qh];B[sg];W[rk]C[B: white seem to have settled down with a bit of breathing space

R> no breathing space this white group is dead!];B[rl];W[ph]
;B[rh]C[B: trying to isolate the weak white group so it can't form eyes]
;W[om];B[ql];W[ka];B[ja];W[la]C[R> ARRGH! white has just killed himself!! see variations... the right move was to connect at P18 and the game would have been over!.]

(;B[ib];W[po];B[ob]C[B: here I'm trying to cut apart the top two white groups so the corner one will be formed to form eyes and so I might have a chance to attack the left one]
;W[mg];B[mh];W[qb];B[oa];W[fk];B[el];W[fj];B[fi]C[R> giving presents before Christmas? this stone should be at E11.  =))]

;W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[jc];W[pp];B[rq]C[B: at this point I pretty much didn't have a chance of invading the bottom white group, so I tried to kill the top white group that was weak

R> WEAK??? it is DEAD, no need to put any more stones there.  =)]
;W[jf];B[na]C[R> This play is useless... there is no way white can live where are the 2 eyes? so you should play somewhere else... like E12]
;W[ho];B[mb]C[B: I have a question here...was it just because it was the computer so I could succeed in killing off that entire group? If it was a human, how would it respond differently?

R> Probably... see prior comments];W[hp];B[fn];W[ek];B[dk]C[B: now I'm just playing defensively since I'm confident I can kill the corner white group and take the top and right sides

R> If white puts one more stone in the corner it is ALIVE!!!!! so stop awensering him and KILL!! ; )]
;W[fl];B[eh];W[gi];B[cl];W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[de];W[ed];B[or]
;W[ns];B[os];W[ej];B[sb]C[B: attacking the corner white group

R> Yes good idea... but your follow up moves are dreadfull, you must study life and death problems (www.goproblems.com) this white group is at least in seki (both alive, no one can kill) and maybe even dead (see variation). The shape that derives here is called "Bent four in the corner" and if you succeed in making it a "bent four in the corner" it is automatically dead by japanese rules  (see :http://senseis.xmp.net/?BentFourInTheCornerIsDead   for a complete explanation on this. )]
;W[se]
(;B[sf]C[R> This move is awfull ; ) it serves no purposewhite makes his move at T15 so he can have an eye at T17... you have to take that eye away!  = ))]
;W[rb];B[sc];W[gd];B[db];W[aa]C[R> There is still room for a seki in the corner, and if white makes a mistake the "Bent four in the corner shape apears again), but the most white can do is seki.]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[R> Then as it is seki on the upper right, black wins by 5.5 if I am not mistaken.   :))

Sorry for any rudeness, it was always just so you could see my point.   Any questions you can e-mail me and I will happily reply.   For more on Go look at:   **  www.goproblems.com

(;W[nl]C[R> Second ladder: this one is much more tricky and it envolves a type of move that you will hear a lot about, it is called tesuji (the best move you can make in a given situation, on this location of the board).   The ladder starts at M7 but it is now unfavorable for black (white will be saved by the H6 stone) so we will make it favorable and since he has to defend the ladder we will make the ladder breaker stone into a very nice invasion.]
;B[ho]TR[ln][io]SQ[go][gp]C[R> This is a tesuji play.   Now the ladder is favorable for black, so white has 2 choices (triangles) : or he saves his stones by descending to M6 or he puts a stone nearer to the ladder (at J5 or K6 and K7) in any  case black connects his stones (squares)  at G5 or G4 and makes all kind of hell for white AND white still has to play again to prevent black from taking a huge chunk of his territory.]
