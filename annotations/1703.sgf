C[This is a game from KGS where I played black, and lost by 1.5 points.

Neither of us made any major blunders (that I can see, anyway). I can certainly see many smaller mistakes that otherwise would have put me ahead, but then again I can see just about as many on his side, too.

So this seemed like a good game to submit for review, to hear about things that I can't see right now and how to improve my overall play.

The only specific question I would have is around the fairly large open area that white ended up with in the upper left. I feel like I should have been able to invade/reduce that somehow, but I couldn't see where to begin.

Thanks in advance.
