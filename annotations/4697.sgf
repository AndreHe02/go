C[Hi reviewer;

I played Black in this game with very short time to thinking.
I don`t know much about neither fuseki and joseki nor urgent moves and yose, so i hope you can give me some hints to improve this parts of my game. I placed some comments and questions through the hole game. And pls estimate my rank cuz i`m not sure about it.

PS.: Sorry about my english, i`m from switzerland^^

A_ Hi, I hope this review is helpful to you.

I think the best advice I can give you is: look out for weak groups. Attacking or defending a weak group is the simplest definition of an urgent move. Play urgent moves before big ones.

Applying that will give you good ideas for the fuseki.

As for joseki, I believe that there's little value in studying those until one is well into the dan ranks. Just try to read as far ahead as you can with each move, and play what "feels" best.]

;W[qj]
(;B[fq]C[Is this point any good?

A_ By playing 3 stones on the right, you are fairly heavily invested in that side (and also, very strong there). At this point you should attack the invading white stone. Play "urgent" moves before "big" moves.

See the variations];W[nc]C[A_ Now your stone is starting to look isolated... This was your side]
;B[qg]C[Here i aimed for the extension R8];W[qm];B[pc]TR[qe]
C[Earlier i often created to many thin groups so i decided to play more solid. Is this to slow?

A_ This is a good solid way of closing the corner, and also puts pressure on white's O17. But keep in mind that you still have a weakness at the marked point which W may exploit (much) later in the game.]
;W[ip];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ir];W[cj]
(;B[gc]C[I played this two space approach  because of the pincer, what would be a ideal extension from the O17 stone. Maybe the high approach would had been better, i feld i was behind in Influence.

A_ As i see it, you are ahead on territory, but you need to be very careful about how you handle white's left side, because it can become very big very quickly.

Also, White has 3 weak groups. You must be more aggressive and exploit his weakness, otherwise you will allow him to get away with overplays

So before playing this approach, I would start by leaning on white's weak O17 stone to gain some strength. Then reduce/invade the top left

The variation is one possibility];W[ec];B[kc]C[Thats the move i was aiming to do something. to low?]
;W[ge]C[since i`m not a good invader or reducer of big moyos, i decided to take more risks to destroyng it before he could build one. ..

A_ I like the sequence up until now actually. However, G15 is an overplay by W, so punish him!]

(;B[di]C[...There for i played D11

A_ This is not so good. You are creating another weak group. I believe there is a proverb against having more than one weak group on the board! Don't do it!]
;W[ci]C[A_ W is being very careful...];B[dg]C[A_ The preferred move would be D12. If not, W should cut you there (since you are in his sphere of influence, you want to have good shape since W can afford to cut you many many times)]

(;W[cr]C[A_ Tenuki here is a very big mistake by white. You should exploit it]

(;B[fd]C[I didn`t knew wich move are more urgent or bigger but i really wanted to play this move, cuz i think it attacks white and defends against my weakness at J17. Where is the best move

A_ It is true that splitting there is valuable, but there are bigger fish to fry on the board.  See some of the variations]
;W[ch];B[dh]LB[ke:B][ne:A][om:C]C[This move felt slow.

A_ There are stil bigger fish to fry.. I've labeled some possibilities]
;W[bf];B[ke]C[I had no idea how to play now. What are good points?

A_ I've been pointing to this point for a while. This is a good move.]
;W[hf]
(;B[jg]C[I was still afraid of w O15

A_ With H14 white completely misses the point. You should attack his O17 stone]

;W[kp];B[jh];W[ii];B[hj];W[jj];B[co]C[I know there are better points on the board even if i can`t see them^^ Which are they? I wasen`t confident to gain somthing or get out alive. But he let me life, without gain to much.

A_ W should not have let you live ;)

This invasion is rather questionable, since even if you live, you will have made the W group stronger, and your group at F3 proportionally weaker.

Good places to play? If you want a big point, O13 seals off your top right. Otherwise, F7 might be a good idea also... it makes your F3 group somewhat more stable, and also threatens the J4 stones.]

;W[oo]C[Oh look he build up a moyo in the center, how should i attack it?...

A_ Quite frankly, you don't have to... Just close your top side at O13, and you have more than enough points to win the game. However, good reducing moves are shown]

(;B[ni]C[... that was my decision.

From now on i was able to save a lead to the end.

A_ This is the right direction, but a little too deep. You are a little ahead, so you want to defend your lead while reducing your opponent. This leaves W a way in]

A_ This is something you need to get into the habit of: counting. You need to know if you are ahead or behind, so as to pick how risky your next move should be.

A nice game overall. Some general advice:

- Pay attention to weak vs strong groups. You want to help your weak groups, and attack your opponent's. 
- This will help you get a better feel for the proper direction of play.
- Keep counting!! This is very important. The further the game progresses, the more precise your count should get (in the midgame, it's enough to be able to say "roughly a 20 point lead" or "roughly even", but towards the end, you should be able to say "75 - 68" or something like that. There are many counting techniques that make this easier)
- Your endgame was pretty solid. Improving the first 3 areas should help you in this respect also. Counting is very important in the endgame (learn about the miai value of plays).

As for rank? I can't really give you a precise answer, since I don't really know how strong I am myself... But if you can apply my advice above, I think you should be well into the single-digit kyu ranks.

Hope this review was helpful, and feel free to contact me with any questions.]
