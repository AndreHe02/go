Hi Neil,
My name is Leonard Dragomir and I’m a 3 Dan GO player/instructor. My commentaries will start with “L:”]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[cp];W[cd];B[ec];W[gc];B[nq]LB[ee:A][cg:B]C[dont know why i tenuki, i guess this o3 is very big too

L: Yes, it is big ... but you should play the urgent moves first! 
Like A or B.]
(;W[oq]C[L:This is NOT good for White!
please see variation];B[np];W[qn];B[jp]C[L: Good for black!
White shouldn't play this joseki.];W[ed]C[L: I hope you expected that ... once you decided to tenuki ...]

(;B[oc]C[L: Big move, but again ... not an urgent one!

L:I would play something on the left side to  counterattack White thickness over there and to build my own moyo.

See variations.];W[ep]C[L: Yes, this is the point ... and you just make White's live easier because there are no Black stones around D10.]

(;B[eo]C[i guess this is wrong joseki, can you help choose one please?

L: Yes, seams wrong because you don't have any "friends" around D10 point. 

Imagine one Black stone over there instead of upper right shimari move.]
;W[dp]C[L: Better at A or B.];B[do];W[cq]
(;B[bp]C[L: better connect!];W[bq];B[fp];W[fq];B[gq];W[er];B[fr]
;W[eq];B[ck]MA[gp][fo][co][gr]C[is there something better for black?

L: … still you left so many cuttings points behind.]
(;W[gr]C[L: This is bad! If White wants to play there, he should play as in variation ...]
;B[hq]C[L: ... and Black is happy to connect!];W[ci]C[L: Good extension]
;B[po]C[L: I'm afraid I didn’t understand this move ... I don't see any ladder, at least yet?!

;W[cg];B[bj];W[bi];B[lk]LB[jj:B][jk:A]C[what do you think about this?

L: Interesting! Seams like that's your only chance ... build some territory into center.
A little bit to the left side I would say ... maybe better at A or B.]

(;W[kj]C[L: Way too close
see var.];B[jk]C[is this correct?

L: it's ok. But why did you start with this move?];W[kk];B[kl]

(;W[lj]C[L: This is not good!
see var.];B[jj]MA[ei][dk][cm]C[L: good point for Black. It covers left side aji also.]

See variation.];W[ig];B[ih];W[id]
(;B[lc]C[is this the biggest /best move now?

L: it is a good move, but I'll try to take both sides, by playing first on the right. 
Here seams like gote ... I didn’t expect White to respond over there.]
;W[jg]C[L: Too small.];B[kg];W[kf];B[qh]C[L: Good point for Black.]
;W[qj];B[mi];W[mj];B[og]C[L: Good local move, but White C7 is way too big.]

L: Yes, see var.];W[nn];B[mn];W[mm];B[ml];W[nl]C[white should have m7 ?]
;B[lm];W[nm];B[mo];W[oo];B[pj];W[ri];B[rh];W[pk]C[L: ... and White ended up with way too much territory on right side.]

where did I go wrong, was it the mistake at d7 or were there early fuseki / middle game mistakes

many thanks for reviewing
and hope you enjoyed the game

, neil

Yes, was a nice one … and you’ve lost so many opportunities to turn around the game.
It’s hard to say that D7 lost the game … maybe somewhere else, anyhow doesn’t matter. 
I hope that you find this review helpful and for sure you’ll be better prepared for the next fight!
