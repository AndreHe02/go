C[Hi my name is Alfa.
This one is my game on IGS.
At the end I resign because white play very well here.
Please comment my game because I am beginner and still need lo things to learn.
I play as black

*************************

Dear Alfa,

my name is Rainer and I did the review of this game.
All my comments are marked with R:

Generally you should play a bit more defensive. You did spread out too much and produced many weak groups which could easily be attacked and taken profit from.
If you start a local battle you should finish it and not play a gote move elsewhere.

I hope this review will help you in your future games.

Best regards

(;B[po]CR[cn][do]LB[co:A]C[R: A move around A would be another possibility. Even if White finished her corner enclosure, you will get the key point in the middle.]
;W[qo];B[pm]C[R: This is not joseki. Please refer to a joseki book or internet page for the different possible moves.]
;W[pp];B[cf]C[R: Your lower right group is vulnerable to attack. It would be better to play there first.]
;W[do];B[co]C[or should I D7?

R: There are many possible moves here as the opening just started. A pincer might favour your stone on C14.]
;W[cn]
(;B[dp]LB[cp:A]C[R: A move at A is better.];W[eo];B[mc]C[R: You have groups and single stones all over the board. It would be better to solify those positions first.]
;W[fd];B[hc]C[R: You are helping White to get stronger.];W[fc]
;B[cm];W[ef];B[dn];W[qk]C[R: White is making the bigger moves. She attacks your weak positions while taking more territory or building new groups at the same time.]
;B[ci]C[or should I play somewhere else near those Q stones to safe them??

R: It is good that you solify your stones now, but you have to choose which to help first. I think your Q group has enough space to live in the center.]
;W[qh];B[qf]C[R: To help your Q group would be better.];W[ce]

(;B[ei]C[or should I play D12?

R: D12 would be more solid.];W[en]
(;B[bn]C[or D7?

R: Again, D7 would be more solid.];W[ho];B[jo];W[hm]
(;B[in]C[R: This only makes White stronger.];W[hn];B[im];W[el]
;B[dl]TR[pm][pn][po]C[R: Looks like you forgot the marked stones...]
;W[hl];B[il];W[oh];B[hg]CR[ee][he][nm][gq][mq]C[R: What is the meaning of this move? There are bigger moves on the board.]
;W[ee];B[dh];W[qc]TR[qf]C[Try to invasing my group here.
I'm not very good at defending invasion. please help me.
oh and if I were white what must I do to invasing that group>

R: It is hard to invade the corner with the marked stone in place.]

(;B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]C[R: Dangerous, have a look at the variation of the next move...]

(;W[pa];B[sb]
(;W[mh]C[R: White could have lived. See variation.];B[ra]
(;W[ne]C[R: White could still escape.];B[nf]C[R: If you attack a stone, don't touch it.]
;W[me];B[mm]C[R: Why do you leave a battle?];W[of];B[mf]TR[nf]
C[R: Time to play elsewhere. The stone is lost and there is no sense in sacrificing more.]
;W[lf];B[pf]TR[pa][ob][rb][pc][qc]C[R: Now the white marked stones are dead.]
;W[od];B[nc];W[pg];B[nd];W[oe];B[pe];W[mp];B[kq];W[hq];B[dj]
CR[kd][ok][mr]C[R: Unnecessary move. There are much bigger points.]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[hj]C[should I play J11?

R: Certainly not. You would only create cutting points.]
(;B[mq];W[if];B[he]C[R: The marked stone is very weak. You should sacrifice it and play elsewhere.]

;W[op];B[ms];W[np];B[ko];W[ln];B[lm];W[hf];B[gf]C[R: You create too many cutting points.]
;W[kn];B[gi]CR[kd][kk][ok][fq]C[I'm not sure w/ this move.

R: Your prime objective should be to save your weak groups or to gain territory.]

It played.

Hah.....
It was really tough. My stones were under pressure and I couldn't think anything to safe them.
Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.])
