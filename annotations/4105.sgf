You say that you are getting only small side territories while you opponent gets a large center and that this happens in all of your games.
This is interesting because I tend to take my territory out of the center, sometimes too much so. I should be able to help you play more like me.

Just very quickly going through the game, I notice an imbalance in your play.Almost all of your moves are tight, close to your own and your opponent's stones. Many of your moves contact plays against your opponent's stones. You are usually the last to play in an area, whether the moves is needed for life and death or not. You add more stones to a group that is almost dead instead of abandoning it while it is small. All of these things are small ways to play.

Why do you play this way? I suspect that it is a matter of comfort and confidence. Sometimes it is very difficult to decide what to do when you have sente. There are so many choices! So maybe you start unconsciously avoiding sente by making one more move in the corner that you were just playing in, rather than taking a big point. If you are to play away from the other stones, where exactly do you play? Again, there are many choices, so maybe you avoid the choice by playing one more move near other stones. You may have to force yourself to play just a little more daring.

Enough of this psychoanalysis! Let's see some examples in your play.]

[df:B][dp:C][cq:D]C[
It is difficult to say what is the best move here. Your game move is a standard approach, but it's value is less than usual due to the stone at 
A which sort of acts like a pincer. I might consider a move at B, but this woud work better with a corner stone at C instead of D. Not that there is anything wrong with the 3-3 point play.]
;W[df]
(;B[hc]LB[cc:A]C[
A is the joseki move here. See alternate line which would be much better for you. OK, it is a contact move, but contact moves are defensive and you are on the defense here. It gives you a clain to half of the corner which helps you make eyes.]
;W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[dd]LB[cc:A][ed:B][df:C][ff:D]C[
This is a horrible move! In some circumstance, it might be okay if you could really use it to start an attack against w, by say cutting at A, but that is not going to happen here. Look at it this way: You take a stone at B which has 3 of 4 liberties and make it into 2 stones which have only 1/2 of their liberties. Added to this, the w stone at C is giving your 2 stones a dirty look. If you are going to play here, play a move that helps your weak group, like D to escape to the center.]
;W[ce];B[nc]TR[fc][ed][dd][hc]C[Brock2574 [13k\]: i thought this move might be good at attacking the white stone to the left and attacking the corner

Not a bad thought in principle. The only problem is that as w strengthens the stone on the left, the triangle stones will become weaker than they already are. The triangle stones have little eye potential and w 's stones are ahead of them in any run to the center.]

(;B[qb]LB[jc:A][je:B]C[Brock2574 [13k\]: i invade the corner yet i allow my opponent to create a huge outer wall.  This is one of my bigger problems when trying to secure side territory

Giving w a wall can't be helped, if you are going to invade his corner. The wall is w's compensation for your territory. What makes it bad is that it threatens to swallow up your weak stones to give w a truly gigantic territory on the top. Even then, it wouldn't be so bad except that w comes away with sente to make the one move that will protect his weak stone at A and separate and attack your weak stones. You probably have life in this corner, so you should use this move to help your stones at the top. The best move is hard to say. Maybe B on the theory that the enemy's key point is your own. The fighting will be hard for you, but better than after w makes his next move.]
;W[je]C[
It can't get any better for w than this!];B[jd]C[
This is an interesting move! It is not one that I would tend to think of, but it creates the complications that allow you to turn the upper side around.
Nonetheless, this move is not so good that you should get this much out of it. W must be making some mistakes.]

(;W[kd]LB[nc:A]C[
If w wanted to go for everything, he could play on the other side as in the alternate line. Playing on this side swallows up your stone at A, but tends to give w a narrower territory than he might hope for given the strength of his wall. If he could play on the other side, he might get a wider territory or even kill both of your groups. I am tempted by this possibility, but it is risky. It might work, see alternate lines for some possibilities.

This move is safer, in that w pits his weak stones against the weaker of your 2 groups.]
;B[id]
(;W[kc]LB[ke:A]C[
I think that this is a mistake by w. It captures the single b stone, but it lets b have the cutting point toward the center at A and b needs to get to the center with his other stones. W could keep the pressure on with A instead and bring his influence out to the center and across the board. See alternate.]
;B[ke];W[jf]LB[le:A][je:B]C[
The safe thing for w is to play at A and take his territory. You will escape, but he can still harass you and maybe the stone at B will serve some purpose later.]

I think that is a bit of an exageration, but you do split the upper side with w and that is better than you might have hoped.]

;W[eg];B[cj];W[fi];B[iq]TR[jh][kh][lg][lf][le][ld][ke]C[
OK, you have gotten 2 big points, but you have to be mindful of the fact that your triangle stones are extremely weak and just barely able to escape. W should be thinking of how to exploit this weakness and you have to correct it as soon as possible.]

Why not play at A? See alternate];W[bq];B[ao];W[er]C[Brock2574 [13k\]: once again my big problem is i get stuck with a small side territory and my opponent gets a strong wall towards the center

This wall is not that strong. This time your groups on both sides are strong and the walls influence is limited by the presence of your stones.]
;B[lq]LB[jl:A]C[
Now is the time to play on a larger scale  a move at A would strengthen your weak stones, map out a large moyo in the bottom right and prevent w from going places with his stones on the left.

I think that this is a critical point in this game that addresses your concerns. If you are going to take part of the center, you have to play in the center. Not prematurely, but at the right time. That time is now!]

This move lets you force w from above, but he will live and you are still left with a weak group in the center. Bring the group out and block w's advance with a move like A.]

(;B[kr];W[lp];B[mq];W[ho];B[mm];W[nm];B[mn]LB[kl:A]C[
If you are going to play close fighting moves like this, you have to read them out to their conclusion. A is better than these contact plays that w captures. He is only 1 play ahead of you in the capturing race, but that makes all the difference.]
;W[no];B[mo];W[mp];B[np];W[op];B[nq];W[lm];B[on];W[oo];B[ln]
LB[kl:A]C[
Before you lay down a stone like this, think about your opponents next move. These stones are dead, but a move at A will protect your groups in the center while forcing w using your dead stones. When you play the game move you have eliminated the forcing potential of the dead stones and given w a larger territory.]
;W[km];B[jq];W[kn];B[kp];W[lo];B[jk];W[ch];B[nh];W[oj]
(;B[nj]C[
This move gives a bad shape which results in more forcing moves. However, I don't like the alternate either.]

You would be better off ignoring the atari and playing elsewhere. A-C are worth a lot more. If w takes your stone for 1/2 point you can connect then.]

;W[af];B[fr];W[fs];B[fn]LB[dk:A]C[
This is a strange point to play. It is a little far from your lower group given the closeness of w's stones. You are probably going to need to rescue this stone. I guess you force w to take an eye in the corner, but you might be better to take the stone in the corner yourself.

This center territory should more or less not count for either side, becuase it is open to multiple approaches by both sides live groups. I suppose w has a little better claim. Maybe a move like A to capture a stone and give you a little more influence into the center would be good.]

;W[hk];B[hl];W[gk];B[jo]LB[hj:A][jl:B]TR[hl][il]C[
I don't like this move at all, but I am not sure how much you really lose by it. The only reason to play the double hane at A was to be able to come out with the triangle stones. If that plan was any good you should follow through with a connect at B. I think the plan is good. It gives up a small amount of territory around A and neutralizes the rest of this area. The game move doesn't do this any better than a simple connection and just introduces complications for you.]

You should probably just play B and then connect at C to keep your group alive. You end up losing 2 points in the ko fight.]

This is a one point gote move. Something that pushes into w's territory like A or B is better. I suppose you could be setting up some ko threats, but the ko is not that big.]
