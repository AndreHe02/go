C[Jeff M. playing black. Patty playing white.

malveaux: This review was requested by Jeff M. (JMiller), who seems a bit stronger than his nominal 23k.  :-)
In general, Jeff; i see nothing wrong with your play that a few dozen hours of life-and-death problems won't help. (Shameless plug for the GTL sister site, www.goproblems.com) White made some overplays, and you kept calm and took advantage. Good.

(;B[dg]C[malveaux: So far, good. I might have put this on the bottom rather than the left, with the idea that the Black stones support each other better that way. Since Black goes first, you have the luxury of taking a big point on the side that White does not take (go back 1 to see a variation).]
;W[df]TR[jg][kg][jh][kh]C[malveaux: Seems needlessly aggressive. White might do better taking a big point on the right.]
;B[gj]TR[eg]C[malveaux: A calm response; looks good. E7 is what I would probably have played.]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[gg]C[malveaux: At this point, the right side seems bigger. White intends to dominate the center, but that may be a losing strategy if Black gets all the side territory.]
;B[kg]C[malveaux: Good!];W[gi]C[malveaux: White still wants the center, and wants to lure Black into a complicated fight where White presumably will have the advantage of experience.]
;B[hj]C[malveaux: Another calm response.  Good for Black!];W[fj]
;B[fk];W[ei]TR[ke]C[malveaux: White is tenaciously defending 4 or 5 points of center territory. Something like L9 seems more urgent.]
;B[ej]TR[fc][gc][hc][kc][ld][he][ke][le][if]C[malveaux: Nice, but perhaps not necessary: none of Black's stones seem seriously threatened; so maybe Black should take this as an opportunity to go for bigger points near the upper right corner (or perhaps make the upper side invasion that comes later) before White gets too settled.]
;W[fi]C[malveaux: This gives White nice thickness, facing... not much.]
;B[hg]TR[if][ih]C[malveaux: Good idea, but attaching directly is not usually the best way to attack. Normally, this will make White stronger in this area; so Black could do better to approach from a distance first.]
;W[di];B[ci]C[malveaux: Black has some cutting points.]
(;W[hf]C[malveaux: Since White has gone to the trouble to create defects in Black's lower left corner, why not exploit them?  I don't know the best sequence, but White should be able to capture some stones in the lower left corner (back for variation).]
;B[ig];W[if];B[jf];W[cg]TR[cj]C[malveaux: White does better to sacrifice a stone first. Black should thank White, for forcing Black to protect the C6 cutting point.]
;B[ch];W[je];B[kf]TR[ke]SQ[cc][cf][ef][hi][ck]C[malveaux: If you want to play in this area, i like L9 better; but actually, this is not so urgent.
When you're trying to choose a play, look at the whole board. Groups have one of two possible statuses -- rather than merely alive or dead, determine what is settled or unsettled. (If a group is alive, it is settled; and if it's dead, it too is settled. If its life depends on the next play or three, then obviously that's more important than reinforcing an already-alive group.) Remember to re-evaluate groups as more stones come onto the board.
In this case, the area around the lower right corner and right side is mostly settled, even without another Black stone in that area. So, this is a good time to spend that stone in an unsettled area, where it has more value -- either the upper side invasion (though that's less promising now that White has more strength there), or exploit some of the White weaknesses on the left; or patch up some of Black's weak spots in the lower left. Either of those 3 ideas is bigger than the 2 or 3 points this L8 stone protects.
But, this is a bit of a forcing move because if White does not respond in the upper right, Black may M10, taking a chunk of what should be White's corner. And it is good to play moves that let you keep sente; so this move has some merit. On the other hand, since White will answer with something like L9, this move takes away Blacks chance to invade the upper right corner.
All in all, i would prefer something on the left for Black (squares).]
;W[le]
(;B[gc]TR[cc][fc]C[JM -- Was this the right spot to invade?
malveaux: Good question! I'm only about 10k, so it's hard for me to tell sometimes. White is strong all around that area, but all on the 4th line or above.
In the variations I tried, White was able to kill the G11 invasion; but Black F11 had better results. I see stronger players approaching a 4-4 with 3-6 quite often. So, my semi-educated guess is that F11 or C11 would have been better; but you lived anyway in the actual game.
Another interesting question is, Is this the right time for this invasion? In my opinion, it should have come sooner -- around move 17 or 19, before White built so much strength on the top.
Yet another interesting question is, Who is ahead right now? By my rough estimation, White is ahead by about 5 points. Therefore, if the invasion succeeds, Black wins. Even if the invading stones die, the invasion is a success if it helps Black net 7 points or so elsewhere on the board. However, if you are good at keeping sente, the invasion may be unnecessary; it may be enough to use forcing moves to take a bunch of small points from various spots around the board.]

(;W[hc]C[malveaux: Usually it's better to approach from a distance, rather than attaching directly. Attaching like this will generally tend to make Black stronger.]
;B[ec]C[JM -- Too narrow?
malveaux: No; under the circumstances, i think it's just right. In the handful of variations i tried, Black seems to live after White's slack move at H11.]

(;W[gd]
(;B[fc]C[malveaux: You can give up one stone. Better to dive for the corner (go back for variation).]

(;W[db];B[dc]C[JM -- I think I got lucky here. This seems to be a mistake.
malveaux: Yes, D12 does not help White. Go back 2 to see variations with White at D11 instead.]
;W[cc]
(;B[cd]C[JM-- Perhaps I should have played the hane at H-12?
malveaux: No, because it looks like White is still able to restrict you to a dead shape (go back for variation). What you need to do is exploit White's cutting spots .]
;W[bd];B[ce];W[de];B[cb]C[malveaux: Good];W[bc];B[eb];W[be]
;B[da]C[JM -- Can this be killed?
malveaux: No; B12 and H12 are miai now, so Black can get a second eye regardless of White's move.]
;W[gb];B[bb];W[ab];B[ea]TR[ba]C[malveaux: Oops! This needs to be at B13. If White takes B13 now, Black has only one eye. Meanwhile, Black does not have to connect at E13 yet. I guess you were worried about D12 becoming a false eye, but you can connect at E13 or F13 later.]
