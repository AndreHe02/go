C[buckyyowza: comments by Mark Fyffe (buckyyowza).  I'm only 7k on IGS, 1 kyu in Boise, Idaho, so please take my advice with a grain of salt :-)  I primarily comment for white, but may slip one in here or there for black.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[kp];W[po]LB[md:A][nc:B][pl:C]C[buckyyowza: in the opening, it is best to maintain balance.  That is, black is making thick shape on the lower side, so it is better to counter that thickness with your own than to attack it so close.  Consider instead an approach to the upper right hoshi on the upper side like A (n16) or B (o17).  Your play at q5 makes a pincer at C (q8) very dangerous because you have no thickness to back it up.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qf]LB[ql:A][qh:B][qi:C]TR[po]
[qp][qq]C[buckyyowza: A (r8) is an important joseki move.  If black makes shape on the right, the marked stones will become bad aji. If black plays a low pincer at B (r12) or C (r11), both of your right side groups will struggle.]
;B[qk]LB[pj:A]C[buckyyowza: this is too far to cause much trouble.  A shoulder hit at A (q10) now would be a nice way to regain sente.]
;W[qm];B[qh];W[rd];B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[qd];B[pe]
(;W[rg]C[buckyyowza: consider instead the variation on 21.  This lets black wall you in with sente.]
;B[qg];W[pc]LB[rf:A]C[buckyyowza: it is very important to connect at A (s14) to keep black from settling so rapidly. His thickness is bad enough for you without having solid eye shape.]
;B[rf];W[sf];B[rh];W[qf];B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[nd];W[jd]
;B[cf];W[fd];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[cl]LB[hq:A][gp:B][fq:C]C[buckyyowza: extension from to this side is not as strong as a similar move on the lower side. A (h3) or B (g4) would help to neutralize the center.  A black approach like C (f3) now would lead to significant gain for your opponent on the lower side or in the lower left corner (see var.)]

(;B[hc];W[hd];B[ic];W[gc];B[id];W[je]LB[he:A]C[buckyyowza: probably better to extend at A (h15).   k16 is good aji for keeping black's upper side moyo small.  Now if black plays at A (h15), your stones around h16 become weak, with a good distance to run through black influence.]
;B[he];W[ie];B[gd];W[gb];B[fe];W[ed];B[ff];W[bc]TR[qm][po][qp]
[qq][ie][je][jd]C[buckyyowza: now black has a much better game.  With his good fighting position, the marked stones become bad aji for white.  As noted at 46, around k15 there is no base and far to run. Since black now has enclosed all of your settled groups, the stones around r4 become an easy target for attack.]
;B[be];W[jh]C[buckyyowza: nice move. Black's move at b15 was inappropriately defensive, this is a good way to regain sente.]
;B[lh];W[lf];B[mf];W[lg];B[mg];W[mh]LB[ol:A][jj:B]C[buckyyowza: black's next move should illustrate why this is a bad cut.  When playing out a battle, always ask yourself what you want to accomplish.  If you want to reduce black's influence in the right center, try a leaning move like A (p8).  Or if you want to keep the ball rolling with your dragon, a one space jump to B (k10) is much simpler.]
;B[li];W[nh];B[le];W[me];B[ne];W[md];B[ld];W[mc];B[nf];W[lc]
;B[ji]TR[lf][lg]LB[rr:A]C[buckyyowza: now the trouble from your bad cut should be quite evident. You are in danger of being enclosed with no shape or losing the marked stones in a ladder (see var.). If you lose the marked stones, you also lose good aji around o12.  Worse, a black stone at A (s2) is now puts you in a bad way.

;W[gi];B[gj];W[lo]LB[fp:A][cq:B][im:C][rr:D]C[buckyyowza: white is really feeling the pressure from black's influence now. It is difficult for white not to leave at least one group in trouble. Consider the potiential damage black could cause with an approach at A (f4) or invasion at B (c3)... white would have a hard time making eye shape on much of the board.  Perhaps it would be better now to run in that direction with C (j7) than to push against a strong group.  A move at D (s2) is becoming rather urgent as well to save the lower right group.]
;B[lp];W[nn];B[on];W[oo];B[no];W[jl];B[fi]C[buckyyowza: this is overplay.  A good time to take an extra move in sente :-)]
;W[hm]C[buckyyowza: good escape. White should be safe in the lower left now.  Only need to worry about the lower right and preventing black from too much gain on the lower side.]
;B[hp];W[rr];B[rs];W[sq]LB[sr:A]C[buckyyowza: A (t2) prevents a nasty ko, and does better to protect your group.]

(;W[ql]LB[dn:A][pj:B]C[buckyyowza: A (d6) is urgent to protect your connection with your big dragon.  A good option as well is to play some yose sente like B (q10) first (see var.)]

;B[cn]C[buckyyowza: this is another example of pushing your opponent in the wrong direction.  You've failed to find an easy base for your dragon and have lost several points in the corner.  This is why d6 was so important at 110.]

Since the endgame is pretty promising, you now have some hope of winning.  It is important to remember now that sente is the most imporant thing, and that playing simple is the best way to keep it.]

C[buckyyowza: thank you for this opportunity to look over your game.  I've enjoyed this quite a bit.  You and your opponent are very close in strength, which is always the best formula for an interesting game.

Your primary trouble I can see is that you are too eager to attack.  In order to fight, it is usually best to: a) have something to fight for, and b) something to fight with.  You often neglect to wait for either and find that it is you who is under attack.  This is not all bad, however, your opponent played much better in the opening and early middle game, but it was your fighting spirit that prevailed in the end :)  If not for a notable blunder in the endgame, you had the potential to take a small but sufficient lead and win the game.

Please let me know if you have an questions, comments, or difficulties with my review.  I am happy to elaborate.  If you have trouble with some of the terms I use, try the "translate" command on IGS or the InterGo dictionary from Jan van der Steen's website (http://www.cwi.nl/~jansteen/go/).

The game is over.  Final score:
   White = 55 territory + 7 captures + 0.5 komi = 62.5
   Black = 57 territory + 13 captures = 70
