C[Hello. I'm MoonDraGOn (13k KGS). i played black. My opponent has 12k KGS. This game i won, but still i need your advice badly.
Thanks in advance.

****************

Hi MoonDragon, I'll try to give you the best advice I can; I am 3k* on IGS.]

C[DF - 
Black should probably go one line further. Ideal extensions are 3 and 5 lines - 4 and 6 tend to create worse shape.]
;W[qf]C[DF - This invasion by white is a little deep. I would go up a line. Invading low like this indicates that you will try to make territory, but this is impossible with R10.]

DF -
Actually the situation is fine. Both the white group at k7 and the black group at h7 are weak. And the white group at h3 is not strong either.]

Your result was actually good because white missed an opportunity to punish.

See alternative sequences (remember the saying - in cross-cut extend!).]

**************************************
DF-

I would suggest next time you submit a game where your opponent was a little stronger. White failed to punish many of your mistakes and the outcome was in little doubt. In such situations, one does not learn so much from the commentary.

The only general weakness that I saw that might be characteristic of your play is your tendency to tenuki away from weak groups. Your play in the lower left hand side of the board showed this, and this is where you lost the most.

If you have a weak group, generally you help it until you think it can survive OK. Bringing another group under attack with a new stone usually results in a splitting attack against you. Your attack backfires.

I hope my commentary has been helpful.
