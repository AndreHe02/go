;B[ec]C[Good - white should have played 4 differently to stop this move]
;W[dg];B[hd]C[What's a better response?

Your move looks pretty good to me - I can't really fault it]
;W[np];B[od]C[I think I would have played q6 to stop the double kakari. Two high approach moves are rather more difficult to deal with than 2 low or 1 hi 1 lo]
;W[lc];B[nc]TR[ld][md][le][me]SQ[pj][qj][pk][qk][pl][ql][pm]
[qm]C[If you wanted the corner you should have played the shimari at p17/o17  instead of p16.

Then this move would have been unnecessary

Better to come in on top of  white's stone  (on one of the triangled points) and then exxtend down the right side on one of the squared points]
;W[ib];B[gb]C[Why this move?
White can run out into the centre so he is in no trouble.

Ditto the black stones in the top left (and these can also slip into the corner)

You should come in on top - see my previous comment.
The biggest area on the board here is the right side - because of black's shimari n- yet strangely both players ignore this... for the next few moves]
;W[dc];B[jd];W[jc];B[kd]SQ[ld]C[You should play on the squared point to hold white in here]
;W[ld]C[ouch - black should not allow white to poke out like this]
;B[db];W[cb];B[dd];W[cc];B[de];W[ce];B[pj]TR[ld]C[After a long string of low value moves on both sides ( at least white got the corner 10-12 pts - but black has secured only 6-7) black finally puts a stone in the right area - although it is devalued by the triangled stone]
;W[le]C[Double ouch - although white could have jumped  one more line

The top left group (b) is now heavy - and doesn't have very good eye shape.

White could expand his left side by pushing against it];B[jq]
LB[oo:A]C[Better to play A here]

LB[mo:D][oo:C][hp:A][lp:B]TR[ip][kp][jq]C[Although the kakari is a good move black needs to get stones in at points like A-D to stone the three triangled stones necoming weak .

The kakari sort of invites white A - leaving the triangled stones isolated from it. Note that in the end this stone died. Black had too much on his hands to keep both groups alive]
;W[hp];B[lp]LB[in:A]C[Although I suggested this along side some other moves a couple of moves back - it is probably a bit late for this move now - as it is rather slow/low  at this stage A is probably better.]
;W[jr];B[mp];W[mq]TR[no]C[Should I have moved on the triangled spot?

Yes although p5 was the move - earlier on];B[ho];W[no];B[pn]

[lp][mp][jq]SQ[le][dg][no]C[The triangled stones in the "holes" are of little value with squared stones in place and the cut at A works - see variations]

(;W[go];B[gn]
(;W[hn]C[The other cut was better - see variation];B[io];W[in]
;B[kn]C[this way the back stones survive - but they are becoming a liability]
;W[fn]LB[hl:C][il:D][gm:B][fn:E][fo:A]C[White blunders  A or B are better - followed by C od D 
E leaves a weakness  at A and black can fight back];B[gm];W[fo]
LB[hl:B][il:C][fn:A]C[A is now a wasted move, - white would prefer B or C on the board here]
;B[kl]C[black can fight back now];W[il];B[cq]LB[ij:B][fm:A]
[nm:C]C[A distraction from the main line of play - white should have ignored this  (since the white  group on the lower side is not in danger and pushed up at A,B or C]
;W[cr];B[cp];W[br];B[fm];W[em];B[el]TR[do][cp][cq]C[Now a leaning attack - but the 3 marked stones are a big sacrifice  - and I'm not sure they were really necessary]
;W[dm];B[en];W[dl];B[fk];W[cn];B[kr];W[ir];B[fq];W[fp]C[I can't see how black thought this could work - were you short of time?]

no  - although A might be

those 4 stones round d12 aren't important if you could kill the white stones on the top side.]

General comments - tactically both players seem quite sharp - but lack a sense of direction.  Black got himself some heavy positions early on and although white didn't always take proper advantage.

The wasted black moves in the bottom left were the difference between the players in the end]
