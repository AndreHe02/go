C[Thank you for taking the time to review the game.  My questions mostly revolve around the fight that breaks out in the upper right.


Hello. My name is Philip and I'm a KGS 3k. I'll mark all of my comments with a P.]
;B[qe];W[cd];B[oq];W[ep];B[ed];W[qp]C[P: So far everything seems fine.]
;B[qn];W[op];B[np];W[oo]
(;B[pl]LB[pq:a]C[I realize now that B11 is a mistake in joseki.  It should be at A.]
;W[pq];B[or];W[no];B[mp];W[pr]
(;B[hq]LB[kq:A][mo:B]C[P: This move seems too far. The black stones would be vulnerable to an attack at around A, and with white so strong in the corner, it would be better for black to play more tightly here. See variation.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[jp]
(;B[lq]C[P: This is a mistake. See variation.];W[ko];B[jq]C[P: It's not good to let white make a ponnuki like this.]
;W[lp];B[kr];W[iq]C[P: White has no ko threats and cannot play this way.]
;B[kp];W[od];B[lo]C[I decided that having the ponnuki left white with enough weak stones that it was worth sacrificing the corner to take the ko.

P: Yes, this was a huge mistake by white.];W[qd];B[pe];W[pd]
;B[jo];W[ip];B[kn];W[hp];B[cp];W[gq];B[eo];W[dp];B[do];W[cq]
;B[bp];W[cn]C[P: Overplay.]
(;B[co]C[P: See variation.];W[dk]LB[bq:A]C[P: White got away with the overplay and should defend the cut now by playing at A.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[df];B[lc]TR[pe][qe]LB[cc:B]
[qh:A]C[P: This move is too aggressive. The marked stones are weak and short on liberties. White is also very strong in the corner. Black can consider helping these stones at A, or playing a joseki at B.]

(;W[mc]C[P: This is not the proper punishment. See variation.]
;B[ld]C[I read this out as sente, but he dosn't respond.

P: This exchange is good for black.];W[gd];B[nc];W[nd];B[mb]
;W[oc]LB[md:A]C[P: White should just connect at A.];B[md]LB[qb:a]
C[again, i thought this was sente because of the move at A, but got no response.]
;W[ec];B[qb]
(;W[ne]C[P: It seems that white can still live inside. See variation.]
;B[mf]LB[pg:A]C[My goal was not initially to kill, but to keep the group weak enough to chase it arround and build up the sides.

P: This is a good goal, but you have to be careful of your own weaknesses as you play. Attacking from the other side with a move like A is better.]
;W[of];B[pg];W[og];B[ph];W[oh];B[nf]LB[pi:A]C[P: Just extend at A here.]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[oe];B[oi]
(;W[ni];B[oj];W[me]
(;B[lf]C[P: At this point, hoping to kill may be unreasonable. Black can take profit now. See variation.]

(;B[nn]CR[nk][nl]LB[il:c][je:b][om:a]C[I thought about this move for a while before i decided that white could neither kill the marked stones, nor connect out, and his trying to would weaken white's bottom right group.
The other move that I contemplated was A.  It lets the white group live but secures the right hand  side in sente.  I would probably have played B next, since I can connect my center stones out at c. (see varriation)
My big question revolves arround this move.  Did I pick the right path (fighting spirit), or the wrong path (got greedy)?

P: Here I like the move at A. The stones in the bottom right corner are not vulerable, so it is best just to secure the right side as you suggest.]

C[A and B miai.];W[rd]C[P:];B[sb];W[kd]C[Here is where I start getting confused.  White takes the lead here, and I'm not sure if I can stop him or not.]

(;B[je]C[P: Black has to worry about life for the M17 stones. See variation.]
;W[jd];B[ie];W[id];B[if];W[nb]C[P: Now black is in trouble.]
;B[na];W[mc]LB[ob:A]C[P: This is a mistake. White should play at A to kill the black stones.]

(;B[kc]C[P: See variation.];W[oa]TR[qb][ra][rc][sb]C[P: Now white can start a ko to kill the triangle stones as well.]

;W[qa];B[nc];W[rb];B[ob];W[sc];B[pa];W[sa]C[P: Interesting sequence :)]
;B[hd]C[P: Black still owes a move on the right side. White can kill the Q11 group by playing R10 at any time. See variation.]

(;W[gc]C[P: White can kill the stones on the right here. Even if white misses this, white plays the wrong move locally. See variation.]

P: Overall, I think the game was played well. For the most part, your play was very solid. It would be good to look at fights before they start and see how you can profit best from attacking groups that are weak. Also, studying life and death will be a good way to improve, as both players missed the kill on the right side.]
