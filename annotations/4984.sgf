;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[od];B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[cd]C[White deliberately omitted to protect his cut. Should i cut right now?

Breakfast: Yes, it's normal to cut -]
(;B[fd];W[md]
(;B[qf]C[A joseki, but now it's too soft -];W[ic]C[Letting  him finish his joseki and get the J17 extension/pincer looked too good for white afterwards. There definitely must be a black mistake somwhere?

Breakfast: Yes. It's too easy for White.];B[cc];W[dc];B[dd]
;W[db]
(;B[ce]C[It's not a joseki, but you cannot use the standard one here -]
;W[bd];B[de];W[bc];B[ec]LB[ck:B][cn:A]C[It's slow. Better to think about the kakari at A or extension around B]

(;W[eb]C[White may play tennuki -];B[dj]LB[fb:A]C[It's fine. For sure, Black must not block at A]
;W[qo]
(;B[pn]C[Good choice of joseki? i had a hard time choosing one and so i decided to complicate the board ( i was angry after allowing J17, hehe)

Breakfast: Is it a joseki? I thought it's a trick move -];W[po]

(;W[qp]C[After the nose tesuji, R4 felt overplayed. Could i have punished white more?R6 was safer for him?

Breakfast: Yes, his move looks like an overplay. We will find a punishment here -]

(;B[mr]C[It's slow -];W[nm]C[Now it's not ideal];B[ln]C[The result looks a bit better for black but.....

Breakfast: You think so? I feel it's good for White];W[mm];B[lm]
;W[ll];B[fq]
(;W[qj]C[R10 is a key point for white's attack and defense. F3 therefore is bad timing?

Breakfast: F3 looks fine and his attack seems to be early -]

;B[oj];W[ph];B[oi]C[The vital point];W[oh];B[nh];W[of];B[mi]
C[Black made a perfect shape. Now I like your position];W[jl]

(;B[qh]LB[pi:A]C[It's a bad timing. You destroy the possibility to push at A -]
;W[pi]C[Now your group looks weak];B[ki];W[ii]C[White is leading again]
;B[ij]C[A brave move. I understand your opinion to play actively]
;W[jj];B[ji];W[hj];B[ik];W[jk];B[ih];W[hi]
(;B[hl]LB[hk:A]C[It's more powerful to push at A -];W[jn];B[jq]
C[Why is it low? The high extension will put more pressure on White's group]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[qk];B[pl];W[rl]C[It's painful!];B[qm];W[hp];B[gq]
;W[gl]LB[do:A]C[Big loss for black, these cutting stones were important. Any ways to protect bottom and save the 3 stones efficiently?

Breakfast: Yes, it's sad to lose them
Maybe you can use adjis of these stones by attaching at A? -]

(;B[gm];W[hk];B[cn];W[hh];B[ig];W[kg];B[lf]C[Good answer!];W[mf]
;B[kf]C[Black got a base easily. Now the position is unclear again]
;W[jf];B[jg];W[cq]C[The best answer];B[lc]C[Good plan!];W[mb]

(;B[ld]LB[jc:A]C[Can you attach at A? -];W[lb];B[jd];W[jc]C[Now it's a close game. If my calculation is correct, W is few points ahead]
;B[ng]C[It's damaging!];W[pf];B[be]LB[qe:A]TR[qh]C[Later W can use the tesuji at A and cut off the marked stone]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[co];B[dn]LB[fl:A]C[How about atari at A? It's your sente]
;W[fl]C[Very thick move!];B[eh];W[dk]C[I lose on time. From my counting, black still looks ahead by a few points. but white has sente, endgame will be hard for black now, right?

Breakfast: I think, that W is slightly ahead. We can imagine this sequence:]
;B[ck];W[cl];B[dl];W[ek];B[cj];W[dm];B[bl];W[qe];B[re];W[qg]
;B[rf];W[rg]TR[ij][ik]C[The game looks close on the board. W is leading, because of komi.

Conclusion:
Your peep at R12 spoiled a good game. Later you missed some chances to make the game complicated. You lost it completely after allowing White to capture the marked stones. They were very important!]
