C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: slow an serious game played on KGS
BonEsprit [5k?\]: 40 min + 5*40s per personn
BonEsprit [5k?\]: I have lost this game very badly
BonEsprit [5k?\]: After a serious review by myself and friend from the same level, I don't see the reasons of my lost
BonEsprit [5k?\]: If I had to replay the game, I would do exactly the same moves
BonEsprit [5k?\]: I hope that you could help me
BonEsprit [5k?\]: thx in advance

Jay: Hi, I am happy to help.  In this game, W had a good openning.  But, in the middle game fighting made critical mistakes, that made this a relatively short game.]
;B[pd]C[Redbean [6k?\]: again
BonEsprit [5k?\]: hi
BonEsprit [5k?\]: yes:)
Redbean [6k?\]: hi];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[ce];W[dh]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: I found the pinch much more dynamic than C5

Jay: This is a center-oriented preference move.];B[fd]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: hum !
BonEsprit [5k?\]: I was quite surprised by this move
BonEsprit [5k?\]: I tried to punish it
BonEsprit [5k?\]: and cut

Jay: Jump or knight move is more common.  This move is very complex, each side could make mistakes.]
;W[de];B[dd]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: first stern dilema !
BonEsprit [5k?\]: E16 or C16
BonEsprit [5k?\]: the idea of C165 was to leav the corner and the north and keep the west border

Jay: I would choose E16 to be simple.];W[ed];B[cd];W[ee];B[cc]
C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: i hesitated to tenuki
BonEsprit [5k?\]: but we choosed to play safely

Jay: Tenuki may not be good.  Though, you could approach Q5 corner to build a favorable ladder, but, then your D12 stone would be ineffective. Connecting is simple and sente too.]
;W[ec]C[Jay: This is simpler and sente move.];B[bh];W[nc]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: O17 seems to be at the correct distance and in th best direction

Jay: Seems ok.];B[lc]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: I thought : M16 or R17...

Jay: R17 seems ok.  It results in sente for W.]
(;W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[mc];W[nd];B[ic]C[Jay: This is a slow move for B. Would certainly play P14.]
;W[pf]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: maybe a be weak... i really don't know

Jay: This is a bit aggressive.  The general direction is ok.]
;B[qf]C[Jay: B should counter attack by playing P15. This is too passive and made W's Q14 a good move.]
;W[qg];B[qe];W[pg];B[pb];W[po];B[qm]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: well ? what is the best response for white ?
BonEsprit [5k?\]: P6 or S5 ?];W[on]C[Jay: This is ok.];B[qj]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pp];B[qo];W[oq];B[pr];W[qn];B[rn];W[pn];B[rp]
;W[or];B[qr];W[kq]C[Jay: W is ok up till now.];B[iq]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: G3 or C5 ?

Jay: G3.];W[gq];B[io];W[go];B[kp]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: M4 or C6 or elsewhere ?]
;W[cn]C[Jay: This is not urgent, should M3 and continue the attack.]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[cp]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: C3 or D4 ?];W[dp];B[co]
;W[do];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo];W[cm];B[cr];W[dr];B[cq];W[lp]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: in order to stabilize our left group
BonEsprit [5k?\]: i was afraid of black O4 and so...

Jay: M3 is better.];B[ko];W[lo];B[jq];W[bg];B[cg];W[ch];B[bf]
;W[bi];B[dg];W[eg];B[eh];W[ah];B[fh]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: D14 or E14 or something different ?]
;W[ef]C[Jay: E 14 is ok and sente.];B[cf];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf]

;B[mf];W[ne];B[nf];W[oe];B[mh];W[oi];B[ni];W[oj];B[nj]C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: after a struggle, I finally lost the fight
BonEsprit [5k?\]: but I think my biggest mistakes are in the beggining
BonEsprit [5k?\]: Thx in advance for your kind help
BonEsprit [5k?\]: :)

Jay: Up till now I think that W is ok.  Although, you have given away all four corners (the UR still have aji), B has weakly positioned itself by having three weak groups in the center. If you attack skillfully, and it is likely to capture one of them. W is ahead.]
;W[ok];B[oh]
(;W[qi]C[Jay: This move gives W problem. Should'v just Q11 to keep connected.]

(;B[ph]C[Jay: B misses the chance here.]
(;W[rj]C[Jay: Overplay.];B[pi]C[Jay: Now, B cut off W.];W[qh]
;B[pj]C[Jay: Now the table is turned.  W is in trouble.];W[ji]

;B[pk]
(;W[nl]C[Jay: No time to save these few stones. Should press out at K10. This is an urgent point. 

In fact, it's hard to justify the last three W's moves. W is trying to recover from a mistake by making more. 

Keep in mind that the right W group involves a complex ko situation if B play there first.]
;B[jj]
(;W[kj]C[Jay: Overplay.];B[kk]C[Jay: At this point W's J14 group is in trouble.]

C[BonEsprit [5k?\]: thx
Redbean [6k?\]: thx2
BonEsprit [5k?\]: :)
BonEsprit [5k?\]: bye
Redbean [6k?\]: cu

Jay: The some crucial mistakes in mid-game fighting costed W's the game.  You need to improve reading to get stronger.]

(;W[ki]
(;B[kj];W[lh]C[Jay: W's alive here.];B[lk]C[Jay: B has to connect, But, W is behind a lot, having no territory. :(]
)
(;B[lh];W[kj];B[kk];W[lk];B[lj];W[jk];B[kl];W[ll]C[Jay: This way W can come out ahead to either capture the P11 group or the L8 stones.  The weakness at O 6 is not a problem for W, just answering N6.  This would be B's failure.]
)))
(;W[jj];B[jk];W[kk]
(;B[ik];W[nl]C[Jay: This way, B's O11 group is in trouble.]
)
(;B[nl];W[ik]C[Jay: The only chance for W is to keep attacking the weak group of B in the middle, eyeing on the B lower group too.  There is still some chance of tipping the balance.]

;W[po]C[Jay: This is good for W.  In fact, W would almost gain an extra hand.  Both sides would take one corner and have traded for outside influence. Yet, W's Q5 exchanging B's F16 is too good for W.]
