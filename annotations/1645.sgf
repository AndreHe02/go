C[Hello! I'm playing white, it was a 0.5 komi game and i lost by 4.5 points, but i don't know exactly why...
I would appreciate strategic advices as well as some tips in middle game.

Thank you!

lop: I think this is a nice game, no big mistakes.
The main problem for white in this game was the 3-3 invasion in the bottom left which gave black a nice position. You showed good endgame skills. I think you gained a lot in the endgame.]

(;W[df]LB[id:A]C[lop: you choose the peaceful variation, I cannot say anything against that move. Maybe a pincer at A (see var.)  is also an option for more aggressive players.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[hd]C[lop: here black got a very good position at the top.]
;W[dj]C[i thought d10 could work as a d14 group extension as well as d4 group extension, and I placed it at d10, not at c10 because I didn't want to be caped at e10.
But I'm not sure if it is a good move.

lop: Should be OK. But you have to keep in mind that black can maybe invade at C12 or D12 later.]
;B[qk]
(;W[qq]LB[qp:A][nq:C][pq:B]C[I thought san-san was a good point to invade because both r9 and j3 stones are too far from q4. Again, I'm not sure if it was good.

lop: i don't think that R9 would be too far away from the resulting wall (if black blocks at A), i'd even say it's a too close. (see var.)
I think that the 3-3 invasion is not good here however. Because if black blocks at Q3 (B) and builds a strong wall the resulting position is good for black (see later variation). Here i would play an approach at O3 (C) as white. The reason for this is that the J3 stone is far away from the corner. If J3 would sit one move to the right at K3 then the 3-3 invasion is correct because the O3 approach would become attacked strongly.]

(;B[pq]C[lop: yes i'd also block on this side];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro]

(;B[rn];W[pr]C[Is this the correct direction? I thought this would be better than r6 because right side can't be big for black (there is the r14 stone)
lop: yes, this side is better

from here I don't know where my moves were wrong so I would appreciate any advice!
Thanks];B[or];W[oq];B[po];W[nr];B[qr];W[os];B[rr]C[lop: this result is nice for white (as a continuation from R3)]
;W[kq]LB[oo:A]C[lop: A is also a nice point for white, but i think white doesn't necessarily have to play another move in that position now]
;B[qh]LB[re:A]C[lop: this move threatens black S15 (A)];W[pg]
;B[dh]C[lop: black has no weak group so he can play that invasion now]

(;W[cj]LB[eg:A]C[lop: interesting answer, white E13 (A) is also an option, i think white should play A because if white plays C10 then black can start a nice attack. (see later variation)]

(;B[fh]C[lop: i think black should play more aggressive here. once white links up on the left side D14 cannot be attacked anymore.]

(;W[ng]LB[gl:A]C[lop: i think white has to push on with G8 (A)]
;B[nd];W[ff]
(;B[gl]LB[fl:A]C[lop: i prefer black A];W[hf]C[lop: i don't think that this is big since white has the O13 stone already black cannot expect a lot of territory there anyway. i recommend to play at d8 (A).]

;B[np];W[ld]C[lop: good!];B[lc];W[ke];B[kc]C[lop: the problem is: this thickness is not worth a lot since white cannot attack a weak black group in it's vincinity. The strong F10 group neutralizes white's power in the center completly]
