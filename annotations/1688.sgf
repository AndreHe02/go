C[Hi, I am pto, 7 kyu from Finland. I am pretty wild and reckless player, but I try to use that as advantage. 

You have made great effort to help me so I will try to do my best. Thank you.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]LB[cm:3][cn:2][dn:1]C[After kakari to f3 standard responces are these three. Keima to c6 secures corner to some extend, ikken tobi to d6 is more agressive. Okeima to c7 would stretch leaving possibilities to black. I include simple joseki variations from gobase.

I suggest to use 1 or 2 which are, according to dan player, equal for kyu level players.]

(;W[dm]C[[pto\]: So what are defects of this move? Well, it doesn't help much against san-san (3-3) invasion. It leaves other openings too, so it is complex and may lead to complex situations. And it doesn't give that much more in terms of teritory or influence.]
;B[iq];W[qj]LB[qn:A][po:C][qo:B]C[Some observer said (I noticed while editting the SGF):
"Koosh [17k?\]: Oh....R6 looks so good here"

[pto\]:Black R6 would be nice here, it is attack against white R10 and it is shimari securing  huge corner and creating moyo. So black R10 is two in one move. Very short variation follows.

Does that mean good for Black or White? Maybe he wrote it before R10. How much better is R6 than R5 for Black?

[pto\]: Greatly, because R5 would leave white open to extend at R7 (nikentobi-two point extension), which is ideal distance from R10. Third line nikentobi canot be cut without stones nearby. Try it!

[pto\]: I think white would have been better of if he had played Q5 (high to prevent black from groving his moyo). This white move gave black the huge teritory, white weakness allowed black to build it even more. Watch how this black teritory grows.]

(;B[qo]LB[qg:A][qm:B]C[I considered I still had chances to extend to both direction, so I just played tenuki, though maybe R7 was not as good as R13

[pto\]: Just the right thing to think - you seem to be my kind of player ;-). This too shows the weakness of R5. But is tenuki right thing to do here? Did you consider sequence R13-R7-O17, with black starting? Black has huge corner, white gets only weak group. Or the sequence of R8-R13-O17, where black build's huge moyo.

[pto\]: I don't add variation, just practice to "see" this in your mind, and btw. your forecomming "tenuki" is barely tenuki at all, it is just same moves in different order.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[qm];B[qh]C[[pto\]: I don't like this move. It feels way too slow and painfull.]
;W[jd]C[[pto\]:This had very nice flow for white - forcing the opponent to force a move you wan't to make. I think black moves could have been a bit stronger though, but playing safe like this has it's advantages.]
;B[on]C[[pto\]: Now black has created wery strong moyo. Invading it is difficult and dangerous.]
;W[nj]C[[pto\]: Here ikken tobi would be safer than nikentobi, this can be cut!]
;B[kn];W[jj]LB[lc:1][gd:2][dg:3][dj:4][cn:5][cq:6]C[[pto\]: What is meaning of this move? One should, before playing at tengen, allways answer this question. 

[pto\]: After answering "I wan't moyo" one needs to consider if he can keep it. Upper right corner is still open, so it will be easy for black to invade. I'll enumerate all the places where invasions could happen (these are not actual points, just the direction).

[pto\]: How about shimari to C14 or something alike? After that white could meet black invasion with sword, now he must use shield.]
;B[cf];W[ch]LB[ci:1]C[Is the pincer right?

[pto\]: Seems fine, perhas a bit shorter pincer at C11.];B[bd]
;W[cc];B[ef];W[gd]C[Maybe too far away...

[pto\]: I don't think so. If this was shorter, black could perhaps later invade at H17 or H18. Perhaps low.]
;B[cj]C[[pto\]: Black counterattack, shorter pincer would have prevented this.]
;W[eh];B[ej];W[gh];B[fm];W[dk]LB[dh:1]C[My reasoning was to force him to connect, so I was extending in sente from my lower right, which I considered was in some trouble, but now that I look it it doesn't seem so good...

[pto\]: Move's like this strengthen you opponent. But ikken tobi is so strongly connected that this move rarely gives black anything new. I think D9 is more valuable than D10. This puts extra presure on you ikken tobi though.]
;B[dj];W[fo];B[hn];W[gp]LB[fo:1][gp:2]C[1 was probably right, but 2 went too far, right?

[pto\]: White is weak, there is no time to attack. But I don't think these are that bad.]
;B[gq];W[dr]LB[cn:2][cq:1]C[Reasoning: ensure the corner is white.

[pto\]: White is weak so good idea, but is this good implementation? I think after this white has two places to wory. Perhaps playing solidly at D3 would be better.

[pto\]: This is my first time commenting and I have noticed that I don't like variations. They are allways so complex and there is so much possibilities that no variation can good enough. I just show directions, and you can think continuations yourself.]
;B[eo]C[Here is why I say G4 went too far...

[pto\]: White is weak, but I think black could create even stronger attack.]
;W[do];B[ep];W[en];B[fn];W[eq];B[fp];W[fr]C[[pto\]: Very nice result for white. Few stones are allways expendaple, and white couldn't have reduces much anyway.]
;B[gr];W[gf]LB[fg:1]C[Block Black's group

[pto\]: You forgot something: connect you owns. Two in on move again.

[pto\]: You have plan on how to deal black F13, don't you?]

;B[ge];W[he];B[ne];W[ld]LB[qc:A][ld:1]C[Was the san-san good for White? What about after 1 was there? I mean, sometime in the (near) future...

[pto\]: san-san instead of this? No way! Black could invade whites only true asset in this game. But san-san invasion at this setting is interesting. It could even kill black group, but it would also threaten white teritory.

[pto\]: Btw. now when I think it, I think black group at left is dead.]
;B[oi];W[mh];B[mf];W[kf];B[oj]TR[qj][qm]C[Black cuts, I have to make my two stones live...

[pto\]:  Yep, but think again about that tengen stone. I asked earlier what is it's purpose, now I ask what has it accomplished. And the third question is was it worth it? These three question should be answered for every move, but tengen has something magical. Propability of arbitary tengen move to be weak is much larger that for any other move.]
;W[nk];B[ok];W[ri];B[rh];W[rn];B[ro];W[pi]LB[rk:1][rl:2]C[[pto\]: Perhaps some vital point could be nice...]
;B[ph];W[pk];B[pl];W[ql]LB[si:2][rk:1]C[[pto\]: Ok, now I put some variations ;-) 1 Is what I first thought and 2 kills (I think).]

(;B[qi];W[si];B[pj];W[qk];B[pm];W[sm]LB[sh:A][rm:B]C[Is there a way Black can kill after this? I thought he can't. The liberty at A is deciding it all, I think.

[pto\]: I think it is alive. Clearly black A followed by tenuki would kill it. B has some value for white too ;-)]
;B[sk];W[rl]LB[rk:1]C[[pto\]: Bang - your dead. I include the complex variation, you can find the simple ones by ourself. And try living with 1.]

(;B[qn];W[sn];B[sl];W[rk]C[[pto\]: Now white lives again, we can all breath now.]
;B[sj]TR[sk][sl]C[The marked Black group is dead, and the played stone wasn't even a ko threat, so I just tenuki]
;W[lg];B[nl];W[lk]LB[jl:1][ml:A]TR[nj][nk]C[Should have played at A, maybe?

[pto\]: You have weak group, so propably not.  If tengen stone would have been stronger, you could have tried to reduce black teritory.

[pto\]: Perhaps larger scale move at 1 might have worked.];B[ll]
;W[kl];B[lm];W[jl];B[gk]
(;W[ff]TR[bd][cd][de][fe][ge][cf][ef][bg][dg]C[Ok, when I played this I thought Black's group was alive. Was I right? Maybe he played badly....

[pto\]: I think balck is dead, but his is redudant move.];B[ee]
;W[eg]C[[pto\]: This is not the killing move either.];B[be]
LB[cg:A]C[Maybe at A here?

[pto\]: No this is living move, black lives. But A might be better.]
;W[cg];B[df];W[ag]C[[pto\]: This is somehow killin move. It leads to a ko.]
;B[bf]LB[af:A]C[Black at A was a ko, right?

[pto\]: Correct. So back to variations (maybe plural isn't justified here ...).]

[dg]C[Until this point in the game I was convinced Black was alive, but I was wrong. Black was dead anyway, and wasted a good ko threat here.

[pto\]: true.];W[ad];B[ni];W[mi];B[mk];W[mj];B[ml];W[kj]C[[pto\]: This isn't necesary. I guess. It depends how things develop.]

[pto\]: Dead as they stand, never had any chases. Cgoban has weird ideas sometimes.

;B[oa];W[sh];B[sg];W[rj]C[He resigned after this. He said he thought my group was dead.

Well, thanks for reviewing my game. I would like to ask... what areas do you think I should focus in to improve my game?

[pto\]: Thank you, this have been realy fun. I hope my comments are usefull (and correct). Go is difficult game and it is not allways that easy to say some group is alive or dead.

[pto\]: I think you have quite good ballance, your opening fuseki had some great ideas but still contained the tengen-blunder and you life-and-death was strong but it too would have failed in some places. If you wan't to win stronger people than you now do, better life and death is essential. And with that comes allso local judgemenet which helps to make good fuseki moves. 

[pto\]: Lessons from this game.
1 Third line niken tobi can be left alone, but it is dangerous. 
2 Lower left corner was too weak. It was your big mistake in opening. Mistake was tactical, not strategical.
3 Don't play tengen because it is tengen.
4 How on earth did your opponen create so large teritotory so easily?]
