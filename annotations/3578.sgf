C[(SJF) I haven't played for quite a while and decided to play black against GNUgo computer program.
Obviously it was a convicing win, however I felt pressured by him in several areas and would like an opinion of where I could have played better.  Some of the moves were a little experimental and the fuseki was aimed at GNUgo's weakness at gaining territory in the centre.


[JB\]Stuart, I will try to do my best. I added comments and variations at many points in the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]LB[pk:a][qk:b]C[[JB\] This move is not very common, most players would play the chinese fuseki (A or B) here.
Anyway it is sometimes played by pros. Common White responses are L3, K3 and G3.]
;W[jp]C[[JB\] I found 104 games with this position, the last one in 1998.]
;B[jd]LB[cn:a][cj:b][cf:c][lq:d][lp:e]C[[JB\] The marked positions are the most usual responses in pro games.]
;W[qf]C[(SJF) Not sure if a pincer at R12 would have been better here?

[JB\] O16 is not bad though it makes black a bit overconcentrated to my taste. The pincer at R12 does not look bad for black, see Var.2.
Other possibility it the tsuke at Q14, see Var.3]
(;B[nd];W[rd];B[qi]C[(SJF) R17 would have been a better move I think.

[JB\] This cannot be bad considering the strong black position at the bottom. After this white would play R17, but you don't need to answer Q17 (see black 13)]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[[JB\] If you do not answer S16 at R17, that means you are giving up the corner for something else.
So when you play Q17 it is small and overconcentrated.
It is difficult to say what is better anyway. I would play F17 (Var.2), other possibility I would consider is M4 (Var.3).]
;W[hc]
(;B[fd]C[[JB\] I think F17 is much better here since it cuts apart the 2 white stones. White response is too bad, so you were lucky.]

(;W[df]C[[JB\] See var.2 for a better white response. Var.2 is too conservative but anyway the exchange is not bad for white.]
;B[cc]C[[JB\] It looks like you have not a clear plan: F16 and C17 look like they have different goals.]

(;W[cd]C[[JB\] I think D17 is better here (example Var.2)];B[dc]
;W[he];B[ff];W[jb]
(;B[hd]C[(SJF) This was a real experiment.  If GNUgo had been stronger at the centre I never would have tried this move.  Can you suggest a better response?

[JB\] Since you cannot cut, this is not a good move. You are not going to make a lot of points in the top anyway, I would play at G17 and after white connects a big point like C9, G3 or C6 (Var.3). Locally you may play L17 to stop white but the global result is too bad (see Var.2)]
;W[id];B[gd];W[ie]
(;B[jc]C[(SJF) The connection at J15 surprised me given my past games, thus this move to solidify the side a bit.  Ended up being quite a disaster along the top for me. Where should I have played?

[JB\] This move looks bad because: it does not solidify the side, it does not stop white, it does not cuts white and it is played too close to the force. Also, this kind of "straight" moves are to attack and not to defend.
I would abandon K16 and play a big point, but locally, if you want to be more comfortable, attack the corner before K17 (see Var.2) Usually, to help one side, think playing in the opposite one locally speaking (this is a helpful trick).]
;W[je];B[ld];W[lp];B[mq];W[lq];B[pm];W[gp];B[ck];W[ci]
(;B[co]C[(SJF) Was this an over-extension?  With white so strong on the bottom I felt that C6 was too slow.

[JB\] Yes, it is. Probably an invasion at C3 would have been better here, then escape with C9 to the center (Var.2)]
;W[cp]
(;B[ek]C[[JB\] Playing B5 (probably exchange B4 for B3 first) would make the ideal extension between C5 and C9, eg. Var.2]
;W[ic]
(;B[kd]C[(SJF) I thought long and hard about this move but every solution I considered left me open to a cut. L15 was my favourite and probably would have served me better in hindsight.  Any ideas?

[JB\] I still think you don't need to save K16, though it prevents one white eye... but white is not in danger here. Instead of L16 I would try M18 or L18.]
;W[mp];B[nq];W[fb]
(;B[ec]C[(SJF) I was really unsure about how to best respond to this.  I considered attacking at G17 or 18 but couldn't find a followthrough that put him in any less powerful position.  Connecting was my final choice, however I should not have left him open to monkey-jump on me.  So much to do, so little time :-)

[JB\] This is ok.  You can play E18 (see variation) but white gets a lot. The advantage of playing E18 is if you later can play L18, leaving the white group without eyes (see Var.2).]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[lf];B[oh]C[[JB\] This move does not attack, since the white group hase Q18 to live. You can reinforce the top black group first (L18, R18) and then attack.
Anyway it is not bad since it enlarges the right side moyo, though I would have played P11 to disencourage an invasion near R9.]
;W[kb];B[lb]C[(SJF) Hmmm, please tell me this isn't the best move here.  I hated making it, but couldn't find anything better.

[JB\] Agree. Probably it is better to run out (P14) and try to isolate the white M14.
Notice at this point that white is well established with all of its groups, probably the only "weak" one is the left side group.
In territory, it looks close if white cannot invade the right side and black can connect its 2 weak grups at the left side.]

(;W[nm];B[jj]C[(SJF) At this point GNUgo was extending into the centre more than I have seen him do before.  I decided tengen was a great way to spoilt any territory for him and start a framework for me to build a moyo on the oppoosite side to his attack.  There were quite a few options to me here it seemed and I wanted to play for strategic than tactical before sente started to become a real issue.

[JB\] Good option. White O7 was a reducting move, not an attack... White could have played E11 instead, to pressure on E9 and split it from F14 (see Var.2 two moves before)]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[mr];B[nr];W[lr];B[bn];W[bp];B[fn];W[rh];B[qh]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[rg]
(;B[di]C[(SJF) I debated D11 and D12 here.  I normally don't like playing up against a single stone, however D12 felt very thin and I was thinking of my moyo around F10.  B16 and B10 were my other thoughts.

[JB\] Your moyo has a big entry point from H15... This one looks good because the white group is not so strong, but contact moves tend to strengthen the other player.
Of your choices I like B16 which must be answered.];W[ch];B[dg]
;W[cg];B[dh];W[hh]C[(SJF)  Doh!];B[gi]C[(SJF) Should I have been more aggressive here?

[JB\] I though in C15 but it looks like it does not accomplish too much.]
;W[sj];B[rk];W[im];B[kl]C[(SJF) This was a dual pronged move to both spoil white's moyo and possibly engulf J7 if the opportunity presented itself.]
;W[km];B[hn];W[qb];B[pb];W[gq]C[[JB\] Good move. Too difficult to invade white now and yose began.
White: 50-52p, black: 45p. White should win just being conservative.]
;B[io]C[(SJF) The invasion begins.

[JB\] It looks like a reduction from the outside to me.];W[jh]
;B[lh]C[(SJF) This was really a peek at L13, aiming at L14 to split his moyo.]
;W[ll];B[jl];W[jm];B[lk]C[(SJF) Wrong direction?

[JB\] Probably H8 better, but not very big difference.];W[il]
;B[ml];W[lm];B[nl]C[(SJF) This move was aimed at capturing P9.  I only ended up getting it by luck I think.

[JB\] This one was very good. You got very close to white here, probably just at komi difference.]
;W[ik];B[gl];W[ij]C[(SJF) This is classic GnuGo.  Massive wall through the middle with no territory in sight.

[JB\] Agree.];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[sk];B[sl];W[si];B[rm];W[kj]
;B[kk];W[mk]C[(SJF) Certainly didn't see this one coming.

[JB\] Yes, white is back.]
(;B[lj];W[ol]
(;B[mj]C[(SJF) My original idea was to play P7 in response to white P8, however I felt it better to play N10 and leave O8 as aji.  Was there another solution here?

[JB\] I think your choice is good.];W[nk];B[pj];W[ns];B[os]
;W[ms];B[oq];W[pa];B[oa];W[qa];B[nb];W[bj];B[kf]C[(SJF) Finally, time for my big attack!

[JB\] I do not see a problem for white here, but you probably took 4 points off.]
;W[ke];B[kg];W[le];B[kh];W[lc];B[mc];W[kc];B[md];W[ad];B[ac]
;W[ae];B[ef]C[(SJF) Hard to decide between E14 and B9.  Went for the middle.]
;W[ee];B[gf];W[la];B[me];W[mf];B[nf];W[bl]C[(SJF) Ouch!];B[bk]
;W[ak];B[cj];W[mg]C[(SJF) This move over A11 really surprised me.  I spent a LOT of time pondering how to respond here or if I could leave it and attach C8.  R14 had me very worried.

[JB\] I don't think there is real danger here.];B[og];W[mh]
;B[ni];W[mb];B[qd];W[sf]C[[JB\] Big mistake! S15 enough. I cannot understand this in a program.
White was 5-15 points behind, now lost them.];B[re];W[qe];B[rc]
C[(SJF) Happy.];W[sd];B[rb];W[eb];B[sc];W[se];B[cl]C[(SJF) Time to my carefully planned attack, aiming at cutting at C14.  Probably over-ambition thinking I could kill this whole group, but I ended up doing a pretty good job of shutting him down.]
;W[ai];B[bm];W[al];B[am];W[ba]C[(SJF) Why didn't I see this coming?  Blind stupidity I guess :-(

[JB\] You were blindly attacking the left side :-)];B[db];W[da]
;B[gc];W[gb];B[jo];W[aj]C[[JB\] C14 better.];B[ah];W[bi];B[cf]
C[(SJF) My big move!];W[bf];B[de];W[ag]C[(SJF) Doh!  Hadn't calculated the snapback at C15 in my head.  Nevermind.]
;B[df];W[ce];B[ip];W[hf]C[(SJF) Couldn't believe he didn't respond to J4!!!

[JB\] Totally agree.];B[jq]C[(SJF) I was really split at where to move here.  My eventual goal was to threatening to cut the M4 group from M7 so I could play at N8 and save my two stones and capture the O9 group.

[JB\] Too ambicious, though white began to play badly. You cannot save N8-O8, and the O9 group cannot be captured (it can easily connect to the top)
Maybe J2 good too.];W[ir];B[jr];W[ed];B[fc];W[gg];B[fg];W[gh]
;B[fh];W[gj];B[fj];W[gk];B[go]C[(SJF) I was very nervous about G3-4 cutting my bottom group here. What was the best move.  I really regretted whites followup moves through F9.

[JB\] I don't see a cut here.];W[fl];B[gm];W[fk];B[eo];W[ep]
;B[el];W[hi];B[fi];W[ji];B[ki];W[kp];B[iq];W[hr];B[no]C[(SJF) Here goes my last ditch effort to capture O9.]
;W[on]C[[JB\] Bad move, N6 needed.];B[mn];W[ln]C[(SJF) Wow! it worked!!

[JB\] Due to white's mistake. You should not rely on the other player's mistakes, at least soooo big mistakes.]

[JB\] Your welcome. Final comment: try to not rely on GnuGo yose mistakes... Evaluate the position several times during the game, consider who is better and play accordingly.
Do not try to save a bad stone, look for big points.
