C[woj:
 Thank you for reviewing my game.  One go concept that don't quite understand
is "aji".  I would be grateful if you could provide some examples of good
and bad aji in the game.

Hi, my name is Rainer (Beholder 11k at KGS)
This
is my first review at the GTL, so I will probably over do it a bit with my
comments. If you should have any questions about my review, please contact
me at the.beholder@web.de

General comments:

a) Aji means the
possibilities that are still left in a position. During the game the aji
of positions can change with every stone that comes to the board. It is,
of course, desirable to exploid the good aji of each of your positions and
the bad aji of each of your opponents positions to the full.

b) During
the opening you should have an eye for the moyo of your opponent. White dominates
the left side in this game and influences the whole board.

c) Have the principle "corner, sides then center" always in your mind.

I hope my comments help you to get better at this great game

Best regards

Rainer (Beholder)

Hi, my name is David and I'm 3k at IGS.  I will be reviewing Rainer's review.
 I'm not promising that my comments will be "right", only that they may point
out some other ways of looking at the positions.

General comments on the review and the game:

Overall,
a very good review. there were a number of places where stronger plays were
possible, but i'm sure someone else could find better plays than mine.  the
most important weakness that i saw was not getting weak groups settled. 
always keep an eye out for how developments on the rest of the board will
affect your weak groups.  

Best,
David];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd]
(;B[fq]LB[fc:A][ip:a]C[woj:
 Is this the proper direction for attacking the corner? Should I have played
F17 instead, or does it not matter at this stage of the game?

*B*:
As you can see in the variations, there is only a little difference between
both approaches. I would choose the shimari at A

*** D: in my opinion,
it is very difficult to say which is better.  I'm sure that a professional
might feel that one or the other is better, but I can only evaluate the strengths
and weaknesses of the two positions.  Needless to say, the position that
develops out of either approach move will largely depend on the response
of White.  For example, it is logical to pincer the F3 stone with an eye
to an approach move at p4.  So, perhaps a two-spaced high pincer at B might
be a nice response to F3.  Regardless, I can't see a convincing reason to
play one or the other approach moves at this point.  If Black played at A,
W could end up with sente to play at p4.  See variation 3...]

(;W[ip]LB[dj:B][cn:A]C[*B*:
The standard answer to the two space high pincer is the double kakari at
A, if there is no W stone in the area of B, see variation.]

(;B[fo];W[dn]
(;B[lp]C[*B*:
Here you try to attack the single W stone on J4 while trying to get territory
in the lower right corner. This is a good strategy.

***D: I would
say that this counter-pincer is a bit premature.  I would personally want
my stones in the lower left to be a bit more settled.  see the variation]
;W[op]LB[hn:B][in:A]TR[fo][fq]C[*B*:
This stone by W makes things a bit complicated. Now W has two weak stones,
which threaten your stone at M4.
My choice would be A or B, to escape with J4 into the center while building pressure on your still weak marked group.

****D
here again, I would want to get my stones on the lower left settled a bit
to prepare for the running battle that looks sure to develop.]

(;B[pq]C[*B*:
Here you try to get the corner for yourself, but you do not put any pressure
on the attacking W stone which is already in a pincer!
See variations for other possiblilities.];W[qo];B[oq];W[po]
TR[po][qo][op]C[*B*: The marked W group has good aji];B[pp]
LB[qj:A]CR[pj][qk]C[*B*: This stone is very small and not necessary. A play around A would be much bigger.

**D
: Yes, a play around A would be better in this position.  You lower right
stones are pretty settled and a play at A would be both an extension from
the upper right and it would prevent a W extension up from the bottom.]
;W[oo];B[np]LB[qj:A]TR[oo][po][qo]CR[pj][qk]C[*B*:
Another small move. W has a three stone wall (marked) which influences the
right side. Again a play around A would be much bigger.];W[pk]
CR[qj]C[*B*:
The third line would be better.];B[ph]C[***D: instead of this move, I would
still want to do something about the lower left.];W[in]TR[fo]
[fq]LB[dq:a]C[*B*: W goes towards the center, putting more pressure on the marked stones.

***D
: this is a good move, but still lets b settle his stones with a play at
D2 and J2.  As I said in a previous variation, I would play at D3 (a) if
I was white.];B[fc]C[****D : looking at this position, W has some nice moves since B ignored W's J6.  See the variation:]

(;W[hc];B[fe]LB[cc:A]C[*B*: Another possibility would be A, taking the corner.]
;W[df]
(;B[db]C[*B*:
You are trying to get into the corner and to make some eyespace at the egde.
There are bigger moves, see variation.];W[kc];B[nc]TR[nc][pd]
[ph]LB[cc:a]C[*B*: The marked B stones have good aji

***D
: I would really take this opportunity to settle the upper left stones by
playing at A.  If you look at the board, B now has two weak groups that he
will have to take care of.];W[dj]C[*B*: Let's have a look at the board
at this stage of the game. White has the complete left side, a piece of the
right side and a group on the top. The only weak group of white is the one
on the lower side. Black has the lower right corner, the upper right corner
(which is still open for invasion) and two weak groups which will sooner
or later become a heavy burden.];B[fg]LB[cc:A][he:a]C[woj:  Is this move too small?  Would something like F10 or elsewhere be better?

*B*: Your marked group is still weak, a bigger play would be at A to give it some foundation.


***D:
 With O17 in place, I would come over the top and play at B.  This would
open the black stones up to the center and attack the w stones on the top.]
;W[dh]C[*B*: W clearly dominates the left side.];B[kn];W[il]
;B[fm]LB[dr:A]C[*B*: This group is still weak, it would be better to strengthen it with e.g. A.]
;W[dl]LB[he:a][ir:b]C[*B*: W has got a lot of points on the left side.

***D
: B is way behind in territory at this point and still has two weak groups.
 He needs to go on the attack while strengthing his weak stones.  Possibilities
are at A and B]
(;B[bc]LB[cc:A]C[*B*: A would be better, see variation];W[cc]
;B[cb];W[bd];B[bb];W[ed];B[fd]TR[bb][cb][db][bc]C[*B*: The marked B stones have bad aji]
;W[fk]C[*B*: Now B is in deep trouble and should have a hard time to make two eyes]
;B[gl]C[woj:
 When I was playing, I didn't realize how isolated my group in the lower
right was getting.  I was concentrating on preventing white from connecting
his center bottom group to his group on the left, not realizing that my group
would have problems later on.  Would H3 be better?

*B*: D2 would be much better

***D
: D2 followed by J2.  W would have a hard time preventing you from either
linking up to the m4 stones, or making two eyes along the bottom]
;W[km]CR[gk]C[*B*: W should play G9 to increase the pressure on the still weak group]
;B[lm]C[*B*: One of the basic principles of go is to play the urgent moves befor the big ones. The weak group is still urgent.

***D
: B still has the possibiliites at D2 and J2, so this might be a relatively
safe move, but it is hard to see what a good continuation might be.]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[gk]C[*B*: W missed his chance to enclose the B group]
;W[gj];B[hj];W[fj];B[hi]CR[hk]LB[ik:a]C[*B*: The marked cutting point is more urgent.

***D : yes, A would be a much better move.];W[hk];B[hl];W[ik]
;B[kh]TR[hk][ik][kk][il][kl][km][in][ip]C[woj:
 At this point, I wasn't really sure where to play.  I figured that this
move would help me block white from advancing upward from the center of the
board.  What other moves would be good here?

*B*: That would only
make sense if you want to kill the marked W group. W has produced a group
that is now much weaker than some stones before, but it is not weak enough
for you to kill.
Go for territory in the corners and at the side, the center is seldom worth many points.

***D
: more important than where to make points is settling those b stones in
the lower left.  if they die, the game is pretty much over.]
;W[li]TR[ll][lm][kn]LB[pm:a]C[*B*: The marked B stones have bad aji, because there is not much possible to make out of them.

**D : they can support an attack on W's right side group by invading at A.]
;B[lh]C[*B*:
You try to defend a territory that is open at two sides. You have to defend
against the W top middle group and the lower right group which will grow
only stronger while you try to defend.];W[ni]LB[lk:a]C[***D : If I was W, I would play at a.  W may still be able to make at least one eye along the bottom too.]
;B[kj]C[*B*: I can't see any sense in this stone. You can not prevent W from connecting.]
;W[lk];B[nm];W[om];B[nl];W[mh];B[lj];W[mk];B[mj];W[nk];B[nj]
;W[ok]TR[mh][li][ni]C[*B*: The marked W stones have bad aji]
;B[oj]LB[ld:a]C[woj:  This sequence of moves (67 - 73) seemed pretty strange to me.  Who got the advantage here?

*B*: W got the better end of this sequence. Her weak group is now connected and there is still the W group at the middle top.

****D
: it's hard to say.  W was already pretty well connected, so B just made
W do something that W wanted to anyway.  B has isolated the three w stones
and might be able to make some nice territory in the center upper right.
 playing around A would helpt to realize some of the territory on the upper
right.];W[oh]SQ[gb][mb][hd][le]C[*B*: W should not continue playing there,
the top group needs more attention and has more potential (aji) (see marked
plays).

**D : yes, it looks like W is going to have a hard time saving
these stones.  Instead, he should play at D3 and kill the B stones in the
lower left.]
(;B[pg]CR[og]C[*B*: P13 would be better];W[og];B[of];W[nf];B[oe]
;W[ne];B[md]LB[ld:a]C[woj:
 I wasn't too sure, but it looked like I could kill white's top group if
I played right, so I tried to prevent white from connecting to the two stones
at the top.

***D: I think playing at A would be better because it
separates the two W groups and also puts some pressure on the upper W group.]
;W[lf];B[ke];W[kf];B[je];W[jf];B[if]C[*B*:
Here you seem to leave your plan to attack the top group. W middle group
is in deep trouble so this seems correct.];W[mb];B[nb];W[nd]
;B[mc];W[lb];B[le];W[pi];B[oi];W[qi];B[rg]CR[rh]C[*B*: S12 would also be possible and would grant you more territory]
;W[mi]
(;B[ng]CR[ki]C[*B*: Another possibility would be L11

***D the way I see it, you pretty much have to play at L11 at some point.]
;W[ki];B[ji]C[woj:  This was a foolish mistake on my part.  I should have played K10.

*B*: This is not the mistake, it comes later.];W[jj]
(;B[mg]C[woj:  Another dumb mistake.  I'm not sure why I didn't capture at O12.

*B*: Yes, this is the big mistake. O12 would have been much better.]
;W[pj];B[nh]TR[og][oh]C[*B*: This is not so good. W can afford to sacrifice the marked stones.]
;W[jh];B[oi];W[lg];B[mf];W[kg]CR[hh][ii]C[*B*: Unnecessary play by W, the marked plays would be better]
;B[ii]C[woj:  I'm certain that the previous sequence (101 - 111) lost the game for me.]
;W[id];B[ie];W[he];B[hf];W[gb];B[fb];W[qc];B[qd]C[woj:
 S13 looked too far away to help me with this corner invasion, so I decided
to push white to the left.];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[rb]

*B*: No, P16 would be useless, this is a correct move. See variation for another one.]

: yes, at this point, B should probably give up the four stones in the center
and settle the remaining stones by playing at B];B[fn];W[gm]
;B[fl];W[hq];B[hr]C[woj:
 At this point, I realized that my bottom left group was in trouble, so I
had to make some eye space.

(;W[kq]C[woj:  It looks like white felt that his center bottom group was threatened.  Was this a good move for white?

response would be a one-spaced pincer at N3.  Any move that accomplishes
two things at the same time is better than a move that only does one thing.

D: stronger players tend to ignore this move.  The reason is because even
if black plays at A, W has a perfectly acceptable extension at B.  If Black
plays around B, then W can take the corner with A.  So, A and B are mai.
 In addition, if the top of the board is important to W, then she can play
at C to force black into the corner, or to run into the center.  There are
numerous variations here, but remember that the 4-4 stone is not oriented
to taking the corner.  the 4-4 stone has influence toward the center and
a person who plays on the 4-4 point should look to develop that influence
outward.  if you want the corner, play on the 3-3 point.  having said all
of that, W can ignore the D18 move and immediately approach the lower right
corner.];W[op]C[***D: this may look a bit unsettled, but there is still
plenty of time to develop the stone.  as I said, there are a lot of possible
variations for the upper left, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.  It
black forces the situation by extending along the top, or playing into the
corner, then W has plenty of space to respond.]))
