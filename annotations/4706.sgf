C[Hello reviewer I played a game on IGS that I was hoping to get some long wanted advice on a few things and of course everthing else *laffs*.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cn];W[cp]C[Now for them was that a mistake or is that still ok?


tuna:This move is prefectly ok, but seeing that Hoshi(D4 stone) is more on influence than territory. Maybe white should plat at F4. That's the proper joseki. Maybe you would like to find out some special properties on different corner position. Check them out at sensei library. :)]
;B[np]LB[qn:A]C[I probably should have approched them diffrently and also taken advantage of the C4 group right?

tuna: Approaching from R6 is better i think. It's better to apprach from your own sphere of influence. And R6 can be considered as an extension from Q17, although a somewhat weak one. :)]
;W[oq];B[po]C[I think that that move was an ok tujitsu (if thats how you spell that).


tuna:Tesuji you mean? I don't think this move is quite good. white can simple R4 and enclose the whole corner. So your Q5 is actually giving him a big fat corner.]
;W[qo];B[oo]C[Should I have played at P4 instead to get a double atari or was the move I just played unnessesary and I should have played around R6?

tuna: P5 is good];W[nq];B[op]C[that wasn't very good letting them slip out of the corners like that.

tuna: P4 is not needed at all. Play somewhere else. You wasted a move there and made the shape heavy. :)]
;W[qq];B[kp]C[tuna: Nice move.];W[fq]C[tuna: White played too defensive here.]
;B[hq];W[hr];B[ir];W[gr];B[jq];W[qe]C[I think I did those last few moves ok but heres a not so good one...]
;B[nc];W[qc];B[pd];W[qd];B[mq]LB[qb:A]C[RIGHT THERE I'm not sure but wouldn't it have been better to protect my corner with A?

tuna: actually both are pretty small. Why not D11? You can play more effectively if you have stones all over the board during fuseki.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[of];B[qm]C[Me foolishly ignoring it... -.-];W[qk]
;B[ne];W[nf]LB[mf:1][mg:2][lf:3][lg:4][kg:5][kh:6][jg:7][jh:8]
[ih:9][ii:10][hh:11][hi:12]C[now this is somthing that almost ALWAYS occurs in my games and the sequence shown seems to occour with me being greedy or the other person being greedy and I usually try to stop it like I tried in the Middle of the game.

tuna: Don't play at 1 and play at 3. Then you won't get that sequence, and your shape would be much nicer too :)]
;B[mf];W[mg];B[ng]C[See but im not thinking of the consiquences of not answering the next one...]
;W[og];B[lf];W[mh]C[now Im thinking o great I might have found the remedy to this with making bigger downward drops every about 6 stones.]
;B[kh]C[and there I go and seem to ruin it right? or was that nights move a really good move. Hmm i'm not sure about that one...

tuna: very nice move :) one more stone at G16 and you have the whole upper portion!]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[kf]LB[ld:A]C[tuna: A might be a better way to defense than N15 that you played.]
;B[me];W[jf];B[eo];W[fo];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[gp];B[go];W[fn]
;B[gq];W[en];B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[bn];B[hp];W[cm];B[dm];W[cl]
;B[dl];W[ck];B[dj];W[dk]LB[ek:A]C[should have gone at A next...

tuna:probably. if you go at A, E6 stones are dead. They are more or less dead now too anyway.]
;B[cj];W[bj];B[bi];W[bk];B[ai]LB[ch:A]C[still now I definatly should have gone there I just did a totally pointless move making me have to do another move maybe later on...

tuna. A11 is too small. should protect the cut at C12 instead.]
;W[ek];B[hm]C[again not answering correctly... -.-];W[el];B[em]
;W[fm];B[gp];W[gl]LB[ci:A]C[tuna: Now all of them come alive and you must beware of C11 cut.]
;B[ij];W[fi];B[eh]SQ[dj][cj][bi][ai]LB[dh:A]C[I was trying to connect to my upper group, break throguh, and also protect my [\] group.

tuna: D12 would be perfect];W[ei];B[di];W[fh];B[dg]LB[eg:A]
C[maybe at A instead... ya that would be a MUCH better outcome I suppose...

tuna: I think so too.];W[eg];B[dh];W[ef];B[df];W[ed]LB[ec:A]
C[tuna: E17 is very big.];B[hh]C[ignoring it agian >.< and trying almost pointless non sente moves >.>]
;W[hi];B[ii];W[ih];B[ig];W[hg];B[jh];W[if];B[gi]LB[gh:1][gi:2]
[gg:3][gf:4][fg:5][ff:6]C[wrong wrong wrong shoulda gone the sequence from 1-6 me starting at 1.]
;W[hj];B[hk];W[gj];B[hl];W[gh];B[ih];W[cc]C[Thats what I mean by trying somthing pointless and then cuasing them to take the lead....]
;B[dc]C[now that just looks wrong];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[db]
LB[ee:A]C[maybe at A instead?];B[ec];W[fd]LB[eb:A]
(;B[fc];W[gc];B[kd];W[id];B[mi];W[nh];B[ni];W[oi];B[ok]C[trying to block a partly weak stone that I overestimated...

tuna: I think O9 looks better than P9. and no more cutting trouble that occur.]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[nk]C[didn't expect taht and the outcome.];B[mk]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[om]
(;B[pn]LB[li:A]C[nope now i whould have gone with A right?

tuna: probably. Now black is in big trouble. so save whatever you can. 

Check out the sequence I played. Black is still dead though.]
;W[pl]
(;B[on]LB[li:A][lm:B][nm:C]C[now A or B i think or best probably C?\
tuna: C might not be the best.];W[mm]C[guess that might have been myy best move?]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[mn];W[ll];B[je];W[ie]C[THEY RESPONDED... that was bad play from both of us but at that time I was about to click the undo button... not good...]
;B[lk]C[fell for it>.<];W[li];B[mj];W[kk];B[kl];W[lj];B[km]
LB[lm:A][ik:B]C[getting ready for a horrible ending to try and stop them but there was toooo many spots to cover like A and B for a start so...]
;W[jl];B[jm];W[ik]C[I resigned... That wasn't a very good game then even though it took a while for such poor play... Well thank you for reviewing my game and hope that it while help me. One last thing I REALLY would appreciate it if you gave me a way to stop things like on move: 34 Thanks again!

tuna: hope my review helps though.])
