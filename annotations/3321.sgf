AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, I'm Movado,,

I'll be using [M\] for this review.


[M\]- thank you for taking your time off to help me out here.  I have added some comments along the way.]
;W[dd];B[oq];W[qp];B[po];W[qo];B[pn];W[pq];B[or];W[pr];B[qn]
C[[B\] This result is ofcourse great for you! Too good.];W[rn]
;B[rm];W[so];B[jp];W[fq]C[[M\] what is the best move here?  D6 I guess should be played,,

my attachment at F4 helped W get stronger in the area,,


[B\] see the variation of a basic joseki that can be used here.]

(;B[fp]
(;W[ep]C[[B\] white makes a mistake here I think ... G4 would be more likely. ... like you discovered if this move is possible it should ofcourse have a ladder that really works.]
;B[eq];W[eo];B[dq];W[gq];B[go];W[iq]C[[M\] But I thought this to be OK for B, as white got split.

[B\] Yes I agree, it's better for black.];B[jq];W[ip];B[io]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[hr];B[js];W[ir]
(;B[fr]LB[ho:A][jo:B][kq:C]C[[B\] too much aji at the right. See variation for a better sequence]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[lq];B[lr];W[lp];B[mq];W[jo];B[ko];W[ho];B[jn]
;W[fo];B[do];W[mp]
(;B[mr]LB[no:B][np:C][mr:A]C[[M\] - O4 seems to be ok now that I look at the game a second time.

[B\] Yeah I guess C would have been slightly better here.];W[np]
LB[op:A][pp:B][nq:C][nr:D][ks:1][ls:2][ms:3][ns:4][os:5]C[[M\] maybe n6?  no eyes, vs. a eye, I should win and I can..

[B\] yeah i think i would also concider n6 first. You will just need to keep in mind that you can not allow white to reach 5 liberties in sente.]

(;B[op]LB[mn:B][op:A];W[mn];B[lm];W[mm];B[ll]C[[B\] This i see as a mistake. M8 looks way too soft imho. I would have attacked more severly with N8 without any doubt.]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[ol];B[pk];W[nk];B[nj]C[[B\] This O10 move contradicts Q9 imho. Because you know white will be able to push through anyway. And in that process white will attach at Q9, making it weak.]
;W[mj];B[lk];W[oj];B[ni];W[ok]C[[B\] This is what I was talking about ! Q9 needs help and P11 is big. A miai situation.]
;B[pj];W[oi];B[nh];W[oh]
(;B[pl]LB[nf:5][ng:4][nh:3][ni:2][mj:A][nj:1]C[[M\] I was worried w will cut,,
 am I alive at n2?  I think not,,

[B\] since the pushthrough of white it looks like capturing white is impossible. I still blaim m8 for this. In a situation like this o13 is huge though !!! 

With A in place you are almost forced to extend at least 5 stones. This is the most urgent point on the board imho. Protecting against the R7 cut is big too... but not as big as O13 I think. See variation]
;W[ng];B[li];W[pg];B[mg];W[nc]C[[M\] Maybe the atari is ok?

[B\] yeah the atari is a great move i think. Looks agressive from whtie to think he can develop from both sides.]

(;B[of]LB[nf:B][of:A];W[nf]C[[B\] hmm, i overlooked this too !]
;B[pf];W[og]LB[pb:B][mf:A]C[[B\] A is sente for both.  but above all protect the corner here !!! that territory is very big. and on top of that you need to protect the corner here! don't give it away too easely. See variation]

(;B[nd];W[oc];B[mf];W[od];B[ne];W[oe]C[[B\] In big trouble now. Keeping those 3 black stones alive is probably impossible.]
;B[pe];W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb];B[rf]C[[B\] you need to protect your black group now !]

(;W[me]C[[B\] better just sacrifice those 2 stones.

Asuming the right side is alive black m15 feels natural

(but ofcourse you should protect the black group at the right)]

(;B[md];W[le];B[ld];W[ke];B[kd];W[je]C[lVietCongl [?\]: n12 will be vital soon

[B\] I would be surprised if black can get any points from the n16 group. Black should be happy if it lives without problems.]
;B[ic];W[mh];B[mi];W[lh]C[lVietCongl [?\]: too bad for movado lol
lVietCongl [?\]: sad day]
(;B[lg]C[[B\] Impossible to save those. And you probably know that too. :-) So, don't underestimate your opponent it only makes him stronger. You could have played l12 later on in the game.]
;W[kh];B[kg]
(;W[jg]C[cherrypop [11k\]: lol

[B\] A little bit too soft. <see variation>];B[ki]C[cherrypop [11k\]: yup]
;W[jh];B[hn];W[gp];B[fc]
(;W[gn]C[[B\] Hmm i can follow white in protecting his stones. But skipping C14 is a risk I would take]
;B[cf]
(;W[ch]C[[B\] There are a lot of ways to deal with this. And I think i would try to settle c14 by attaching to C12 and then jumping back to the 3-3 point]

(;B[ee];W[ce];B[de];W[cd]
(;B[dg]C[[B\] this lets white connect. Did you think about C13 instead ? Simply playing D14 might be even better because it doesnt strengthen white.]
;W[bf];B[bg];W[cg]C[lVietCongl [?\]: omg];B[df]C[cherrypop [11k\]: bad day
lVietCongl [?\]: mov is going crazy now];W[bh];B[ck];W[cm];B[cn]
;W[dm]SQ[jc][ed][fd][jd]C[[B\] your group at the right is still alive/dead according to sente. So that is ofcourse still the highest priority. Besides that take a look at the variation to get some middlegame ideas of what white might be thinking.]

(;B[ek];W[dn];B[bn];W[bm];B[co];W[el]C[lVietCongl [?\]: m18 is good

[B\] Yes, M18 is a big move for white, and so is H7! Maybe black should play N18 here. Looks like sente.]
;B[ei]C[[B\] looks ok];W[dh];B[eh];W[lb];B[mb];W[mc];B[kb];W[ma]
;B[lc];W[nb];B[jd]C[[B\] K16 is a bit slack];W[ie]SQ[ed][fe]
C[
lVietCongl [?\]: j15 is too slow

[B\] Imho J15 is ok. It would be a sente-move for black and would have sealed of a lot of territory. Also like this the marked cuttingpoint is back in the game.]
;B[qh]C[lVietCongl [?\]: good b

[B\] yeah, that was very urgent and on top of that seals of a lot of territory.]
;W[qg];B[rg];W[qi];B[pi]C[lVietCongl [?\]: free points];W[rd]
;B[qd]C[lVietCongl [?\]: somewhere about d18 is big now

[B\] yeah that's a big spot. Also H7.];W[sc];B[re];W[sd];B[se]
;W[sb];B[qf];W[hc]
(;B[hd]LB[hb:B][hd:A]C[[M\] I guess this is my losing move,,

as i was being greedy.

[B\] H17 is a very nice move. But after some counting you'll notice it's a matter of about 10 points.Nothing is lost yet though.a good endgame can turn that around.

white has:

11pts top right
10pts bot right
 8 points botleft
16pts top left
10pts center
6,5 komi
3 captured
-----
65 pts

black has:
18pts right
 4pts bot
15pts bot left
 9pts top
 8pts center
 1 captured
-----
55pts

Including komi there is a 10 points difference];W[id];B[ib]
;W[gd];B[he];W[ge];B[hf]
(;W[gc]C[lVietCongl [?\]: wow]
(;B[gb];W[hb];B[ha];W[fb];B[ga];W[eb];B[ec];W[dc];B[fe]C[lVietCongl [?\]: man]
;W[gf];B[hg];W[gg]C[lVietCongl [?\]: w could have gotten b]

cherrypop [11k\]: what move?
lVietCongl [?\]: w lives now];W[hh]C[lVietCongl [?\]: oh
lVietCongl [?\]: w shouldn't have gone d17
lVietCongl [?\]: go e16
lVietCongl [?\]: b dies either way
cherrypop [11k\]: i c
lVietCongl [?\]: that's why d18 is big
lVietCongl [?\]: báº½
lVietCongl [?\]: before];B[hi];W[ih];B[ka];W[jc]C[Movado [11k\]: thanks
[M\] I resign here


[BramGo\] The most important thing to remember in this game is what happened around P10. This is the point where you made your first mistakes. Maybe you are playing the moves too much as they come. Reading only a couple of moves deeper can help you a lot !

I don't often advice life and dead problems, but maybe you should take a look at the ones at http://english.dashn.com/life_death/life_death.htm Those are problems of a korean server. They are sorted by level. You get about 30 seconds for every move. They start very easy but the number of moves you need to read ahead increases very fast. You will need to register first though: http://english.dashn.com/newcommers/newcommers.htm Also it only works on Windows.

If I may advice you to read a book: Get Strong At Invading. I'm sure this would help you a lot too. The problems are easy to understand but they give you a nice basic.]
