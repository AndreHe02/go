C[Hi! My nick is wjzz and i'm 6kyu EGF. I will try to help you a bit by giving some comments on this game. Please enjoy!]

SQ[cc]C[Black doesn't have to invade now. He can aim at playing the traingled point later. White can play at san-san (squared point) and take the corner.

Play at 'a' to check what happens after white C17]
(;B[hd]TR[hc]C[K: Perhaps the invasion at one point lower would be more effective? White still has the corner open.

wjzz: One point lower? you mean H15? I have never seen such a move so soon in the game. normally black invades at the triangled point or doesn't invade at all. H16 starts some complex variations, but i have never needed them :)

I included some sample joseki after black plays H17.];W[hc]
;B[gd];W[gc]
(;B[ec]LB[fd:A]C[Bad sequence by black. If i were white i would immediately push at 'A'.  This weakness is very disturbing.]

(;W[qi]C[K: white wants an omoyo game.];B[nq];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq]
;B[kq];W[fq];B[en]TR[fo]SQ[cn]C[First time i see this move. Move usually would be at F5 - it gives more pressure on white and doesn't leave a weakness at C6 (square).]
;W[cq];B[dq]
(;W[dr]C[K: A sub-optimal move by white, Clearly invading playing c4 first would be better, since black blocked on the narrower side.

wjzz - i agree with you, you ended with a very weak group.]
;B[cp]C[Black punishes correctly.];W[eq];B[hq];W[bq];B[bp];W[pe]

(;B[qg]C[K:
Building up the bottom framework with O5 would seem like the key move now.

wjzz - i guess this isn't the best point to play.

there is much more space below.];W[pg]C[K: Both ladders work for white, so the wedge at Q14 is met by the inside atari at R15.

wjzz- good reading!];B[qe];W[qd];B[ph];W[qf];B[qh];W[qk]C[Black has an awful position in the top right corner.]

;W[oj];B[nl]C[K: A brave jump by black. Too brave, it would seem.]
;W[cc]C[K: Bad timing by white. There is close fighting going on, white has no time to play such moves now.]
;B[cd]
(;W[bd]C[E18 is more usual and gives connection.];B[be];W[db]
;B[eb];W[bb]C[This way you can live only in ko.]
(;B[fd]C[K: Black seems afraid of white pushing trough and cutting at F16, so white retains sente.

wjzz- quite a strange seuqence:) you have to know, that you can only live in ko in the corner right now. see variations.]
;W[lh]
(;B[me];W[ng];B[of];W[kg];B[lf];W[mj]LB[jc:A][kh:B]TR[jf]C[K: White stops his position from collapsing. Black still has only one eye.

wjzz - there is a hole at /\, and two major weaknesses at A and B so black is in no trouble, to be honest.

I included some variations with B]
(;B[oe];W[oc];B[jg];W[kh];B[jf]C[K: Black runs into safety.]

(;W[mo]C[K: White expands her framewotk at the key point, planning to engulf the O8 stone at a large scale. while threatening to invade below.]
;B[ko];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp];B[jp];W[jo];B[ip];W[kn];B[kl]TR[kh]
[ki][kj][kk][km][kn]C[K: Seems like a brilliant reduction. Black gives up the stone at O8 an reduces from the outside.

wjzz - in my opinion you didn't have a big moyo there even for a second, because there is a very big hole and black will escape with no problems.]
;W[il];B[jn];W[km]C[K: White tries to capture the reducing stone, treating K5 as inconsequential.]

The proverb says - if black loses 4 corners white wins :)

I believe you played well, omoyo games are difficult for everybody. You won because you fought well in the top right corner. That's all. If you have any questions e-mail me or look for on KGS - my nick's wjzz :)
