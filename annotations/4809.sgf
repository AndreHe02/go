C[Hiya and thanks for the review.
I think my fuseki if kinda weak and not always sure where i should play.

ThorAvaTahr:
-Hi I will look at your game and see where i can give tips]
;B[pd]C[JaKaali [7k\]: onnea peliin
JaKaali [7k\]: kyl];W[dp]C[haukka [7k\]: pidä hassuu :)];B[pp]
;W[dc];B[fq]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- Normal so far ;)];W[eq]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-NOT normal!!

-Your move forces black to make a solid and very strong wall by playing at F4. In the mean while you gain a slightly better corner position. But the corner can still easily be invaded leaving you with nothing. (a play later at c3 and there is nothing you can do, but give away the corner)]
;B[fp];W[cm]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- Now this move is a bit far, so that your corner has worth nothing yet, you need another move there to make it territory. Black however has with it's great move at k4 a big solid moyo. At this point you are behind big.]
;B[jp]C[Here, should I go for lower left or upper right?];W[qn]
C[ThorAvaTahr:
- I am not sure about your question, lower left or upperright?
your play is in the lowerright corner.

- I think this is a reasonable move given the circumstances.]
;B[mq]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-This is a bit an odd move by black, i would rather play a pincer (r8 or Q9 or something) or the touching move at q6 to make thinkness facing the bottom side.]
;W[qk];B[de];W[cg];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[ee]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- Look up the joseki, the right move would be c15 or something, this is bad for white, you gain a wall with weaknesses facing the wrong side, while black gains some points in de corner and is escaped into the center.]
;B[df];W[fc]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- that takes care of the weakness of your wall, but you can see, your stone on c13 is weakened, black has points and sente. Bad exchange for white

-F16 is probably a better shape move to improve your strength]
;B[dh]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- I am not sure about black's move here, he may be spoiling aji here.]

(;W[dg];B[ef]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-Ouch, white hurt his stones on the upper side

- I get the feeling you want don't want to give up either side, so you keep strengthening your weaker side, but this hurts the other side.

-I would have much rather seen a move at O17 or something, in stead of d13 that is. This move utilizes the strength of your wall while chosing not to improve the c13 stone. It is not a sacrifice, black could probably not even capture it when he plays there, and even if you could and would, the stone would still provide aji, so that black can't gain to much there. 

- You should have accepted a loss of position on the left side and have embraced the new position on the top side.]
;W[ch];B[fe];W[fd];B[eg];W[di];B[dk]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-Very bad move for black! 
-Allows white to make a ponnuki shape, which strengthens his position very much. In fact, the ponukki solves all of white's problems allowing him to take the initiative.]
;W[eh];B[dn];W[cn];B[dm];W[do];B[er]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- I can see why white could be scared to play d2 here, but it is possible to play there and much better than making an empty triangle. If white thinks d2 is not possible than playing c3 would make good shape.]

(;W[dq];B[fn];W[dl]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-AjiKeshi, white gains very little while improving the strength of black's wall even more.]
;B[el];W[cl];B[fk];W[nc]C[ThorAvaTahr
- A strategically correct move];B[lc];W[jc]C[ThoravaTahr:
- White is splitting himself up here, when considering the f17 group strong, than it is wrong to use the thickness to build territory. If you think the f17 group is weak than you should not have played o17 but k17 immediately.
- now black can attack two groups];B[nd]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- something like k17, l17  would have been better for black, directly attacking one of the groups, while building strength to destroy the other]
;W[qc]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-White seems to do okay here.]
(;B[pc]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- Not Joseki, the correct move is p17, which removes most of the aji in the o17 stone]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[sb]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- Read something about L-Groups, they are simple to learn and are quit common in actual games. Here for instance the white group is an L+2 group (if black plays s14 and white plays s16 it is obvious to see the L+2 group, if black plays elsewhere white can extend to S14 and easily live) L+2 groups are unconditionally alive, so no need to put in an additional stone.]
;B[hc]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-Overplay, white will not die (if correctly played) and it will only make white very strong. maybe the white territory inside this group is destroyed but white could never make much territory here.
- A better attacking move is K15 that is right on the spot where white would extend. forcing white to make a two eyes, and reducing whites territory while building centrum influence, which works very well with the other influence black has all over the board.]
;W[hd];B[id];W[ic];B[gd];W[he];B[ge];W[gc];B[hb];W[gb];B[kb]

(;W[ib]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-As predicted, black has strengthened white.];B[hf];W[ie];B[if]
;W[je];B[pn]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-Good move for black, attacking white's group (so strengthening it) to gain influence on the bottom and territory in the corner]
;W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp]
(;W[om]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-STOP!
-you are pushing from behind, giving your opponent six lines of territory (counted from the bottom) You however gaing only a bit of influence on the right side. This right side has no value, because of the R14 stone on the third line and the rest of the influence that black allready has with his R14 group.

-];B[nm];W[nl]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- 7 Lines of black territory  ! ! !];B[mm];W[ml]C[now blacks lower part of the board is huge, should i have approched it some other way?

ThorAvaTahr:
-Definitely!! i explained earlier.];B[ok]C[Do i realy need to respond to this? it leaves my n8 stones weak if he cuts, but could i catch that b stone with move somewhere around o12?

ThorAvaTahr:
-You could have played like you suggested when you have a lot of centrum influence. However, in this case, black has all the influence and can easily escape to his friends on the top, where as your group has no escape route. So when you let yourself be cut here, you would be under attack, even if you try to attack the cutting stones.

-Black's move however is very bad, he takes away a weakness in white's stones, while gaining nothing. (a single stone clamped against a white wall is valueless). There is a saying: "Never peep on a cut!" Meaning that maybe somewhere in the future you would much rather cut at p8 than peep at p9.

-Black should obviously have played M7, making 7th line territory. Also black cannot allow white playing on the head of his two stones (M7), which would destroy his shape and allow white to destroy a lot of this influence and territory]
;W[ol];B[qi]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-OUCH!!! black gives white a chance to come back in the game]
;W[lm]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-And white takes it!!!
-Good move!! (explained earlier)];B[mo]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-Good shape!];W[kl]
(;B[jm]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-Black is trying to make centrum territory, which is bad practice. However it is a shape (destroying) move. But i would rather have seen L6 more focussed on making the side territory.]

(;W[pj]C[haukka [7k\]: pitkään harkitsit =)

ThorAvaTahr:
-???
-I can't see why white would play here, the group is all ready strong, and to do something in the top region i would rather see moves like P12 or N12 or anything.]
;B[rf];W[pi];B[rd]C[was this exchange any good?];W[rc];B[se]
;W[ra];B[ph];W[oh];B[pg];W[jf];B[mi]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- Black is giving white a chance to come back here. risking his stones at he moment when white has build up strenght and influence]

(;W[ij]C[ThorAvaTahr:
- ? ? ? !
- Ouch!
- catch the H12 stone!!! (ladder works)]
(;B[lh]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-Black must catch the stones (at least 8 points), whites territory in the centre is very small and can be reduced further by pushing it from the outside ( with nice side effect that it builds your own territory) Also keeps white's groups seperated and weak.]
;W[hi];B[ji]
(;W[ii]C[ThorAvaTahr:
-White should have captured the stone, never mind the atari, it will only cost black his liberties. When you capture the stone you remove aji from the three stones of g13.]
;B[nh];W[ng]C[anyway to avoid my stones to be cut and catch the b n11 stones?
