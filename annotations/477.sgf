C[First off, thank you for reviewing my game.  I preceed my comments with my name,  Rex. I am mainly interested if you see any  bad tendences/habits, or good ones, in the  way I  play.

[Yimeng\] Ok, I will try to comments mainly on Rex's moves as white.  I am 8k AGA.]

[ck:B]TR[jq]C[Rex: I thought of these 2 (K4 and K16). Are they any  good?

I think both are ok.  or around the two B areas.  For the bottom, I'd prefer to play on the 3rd line because i'd be able to swing either way to have a two space extention to have a base.
Also i don't like b to play K3 underneath w stone. I could be wrong.]

;W[hq];B[cm]C[b C7 good, urgent too.];W[jd]MA[jm][ko][fl]C[In order to avoid w group at the bottom getting attacked by b (and be forced to be on the defensive mode), i'd play another stone there, one of the X places.]

C[i'd continue one more stone at A. b can't afford w to turn (P10 and then O10), b group would be under severe attack.

 R8 seems a little far too.  (it got cut off).];B[oj];W[pi]
;B[pj];W[qi];B[qj];W[rj];B[rk];W[si];B[qk]C[too bad w single stone got cut off, w had potential to live much bigger.
w next move is way too small.];W[nb]LB[ci:A][dr:B][mf:C][el:D]
[gl:D][jm:D][ko:D]C[Rex: I know this is a bad move. My idea is  A, B, or C are better.

Yes, A (C11) is good.  C doesn't do much, too small.  B gets base but small too.  I'd consider D.]
;B[nl];W[ci];B[dj];W[di];B[ej];W[ei]C[b last two moves good but only in the sense that if starts to build a wall that can put the w group at the bottom under attack.  but these 2 last moves force white to have a huge looking shape on top, not good for b.

should have tried to reduce another way.  see variation.]

[em][kj]C[I played her to counter his large lower right  corner. Is this correct?

That's a good thought.  another option might be to enlarge w shape and reduce b in the lower middle. consider the X points. b probably cannot go too deep in the left top quarter, but w can do more to reduce in the lower board, i think.]

If you feel the cutting b stone, respond right away, H17 for example.]
;W[mg];B[nf]MA[fi][hc][fd][gc]C[w A again doesn't help much, b won't let you cut. i'd play one of the X places.  most likely F11]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[hc];B[fd];W[fb];B[fh]C[Rex: In the game, I was worried about my 5  stone group being captured if I played A. I  see now this is not the case. Correct?

I could be tricky; i'd do enough worry first; it could be disastrous if w 5 stones are killed. let's try it in variaion.]

B marked stone was played a LONG time ago.  you probably meant K2. K2 looks ugly, i'd play L2 instead.  But, no I wouldn't play hane to atari, w could play L3 atari 3 stones and start a nasty ko.  see variation.]

Could you check my ko threats for both  sides, as I count them. B are Black's ko  threats, and W are White's. To add to W's  ko threats, is it possible to try and make  life in the lower right?

i couple of more ko threat for b and w marked with lower case letters.]

WP: 1

In conclusion, both players played intelligently.  I think both players could try to improve on looking at the whole board after each couple of moves.  Get a sense of what's going on in the big picture.  Try to avoid letting the other form a huge shape before it's too late.  Always look for the biggest move on the board.    Yimeng]
