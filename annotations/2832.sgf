C[Hey, thanks for reviewing my game. Which I was black during.

Chat has been deleted for convenience. So anything here is a question.

The reason I'd like this game reviewed is that I felt the game was going really badly, but I just can't understand why - so I'm just looking for a little help on how White managed to get so far ahead (and control the game so much)? In the end he killed a large group and I resigned.

Thanks =)

Dakre: Hello Jon, i marked my commentary with a "Dakre: " and i hope it is helpful to you...]
;B[pd];W[pq];B[cp];W[dd];B[ep]C[Dakre: maybe e4 would be better a line lower...]
;W[qn];B[jq]C[Dakre: good move... this extension aids your lower left while spoiling white's plans on the lower side...]
;W[lq];B[jo]TR[ci][cj][gq]C[Did I need this move? I did it to stop White invading around G3, but he did anyway and made life easy? Is there a better move (like C10 or C11)?

Dakre: as you already thought, this move is a bit slow... C10, an extension in front of a shimari is much bigger then preventing the invasion around g3... k3 can still run then, which weakens the lower right, too]
;W[gq]C[See! =P];B[fq];W[gp]C[Dakre: F3 leaves a weakness behind at d3... but for now the corner is save]
;B[ho]C[Dakre: I don't like this move... there is a proverb which you didn't follow once: "Don't touch what you attack"... and a shoulder hit play is suggested to be as good as contact play... this strengthens white...
an extension on the right side is still very big...];W[go];B[gn]
C[Dakre: your position is much too thin here to attack this way :/]
;W[eo]TR[dp]C[Dakre: I'd prefer to build a solid base from which you can start to attack or defend the right group...]
;B[fo];W[fp]C[I didn't read this out properly =(];B[do];W[fn]
;B[eq];W[dn]C[Dakre: pretty good shape and result for white :/]
;B[cn];W[hp];B[ip];W[cq]C[Dakre: this is rude... :>];B[gr]C[Should I just have responded to C3?

Dakre: No, i don't think that C3 can live, but i may be mistaken... but when you choose to ignore C3 there is a bigger move out there... H6 means much influence for either player... white has no eyes yet...]
;W[hr];B[fr];W[bp];B[bo];W[aq];B[cr];W[br]
(;B[cs]C[Dakre: no need for ko... look at the variation...]
;W[dr];B[dq];W[bs];B[bq];W[hn];B[ap]C[Was this worth it?

Dakre: i think so... H6 is very big even without the follow up at j5! so black doesn't loose much more after white played there]
;W[io];B[iq];W[gm];B[hq];W[jn];B[ko];W[mo];B[lp]TR[kn]C[Dakre: I'd like the triangle more... your group is not in danger and it is strong compared to the right... with the contact play you strengthen white there, too and give her solid territory]
;W[mp];B[kq];W[lo];B[lr];W[kp]C[Dakre: L6 is very important for both now... keep white seperated...]
;B[mr];W[kn]C[Dakre: very nice result for white... vast outer strength!!]
;B[jp];W[mq];B[nq];W[np];B[oq];W[op];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq]
;B[dm];W[en]LB[fc:A][qh:B][qi:C]C[Dakre: I think these are the interesting points on the board...
with A you force white to extend down the side where she won't make alot territory cuz of black's strong position... or white can choose a princer attack, but that will be a difficult one, because of the black upper right corner... the right side is interesting because it is much worth for white to make a proper extension to build a moyo there...]
;B[dk];W[cj];B[dj];W[ci];B[cg];W[di];B[ck]TR[eg]C[Dakre: I'd like the triangle more... the lower side of your group is already quite strong and your upper stone is the one, who needs support...]
;W[fi];B[eh];W[ei];B[ce]C[Dakre: bad move :/ too narrow to build two eyes here anyway... so just run...]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ee];B[ef];W[fe];B[fh];W[ff];B[eg];W[jd];B[pj]
C[Dakre: maybe a bit too far considering the strong white position at the bottom]
;W[nc];B[oc]C[Dakre: this contactplay doesn't secure the corner, but it gives white a perfect three point extension from a two stone wall... so maybe just sth like r14 would do it, too...]
;W[nd]LB[kc:1][lc:2][mc:3][nc:A][nd:B];B[pf];W[re]C[Did I answer this okay? Should I have just made contact with it on the second line?]
;B[qe]C[Dakre: this one is ok when you want white to decide which side to take... contact play on the second line may cause problems...]
;W[rd];B[rf];W[qc]C[Dakre: this formation looks alive, but you made me think hard about this one :>]
;B[rb];W[pb];B[ob]
(;W[qb]TR[pc]C[Dakre: a slight modification for white here and it looks like seki or at least ko... but i have to admit that i am not able to read this out completly]
;B[rc]C[Dakre: White is dead now];W[qd];B[ra];W[sc];B[se];W[qa]
;B[oa]C[Dakre: P19 is bad because it is not necessary... when you're afraid of ko when white plays p19 just give in and play o18...]
;W[nb];B[pm];W[od];B[pc];W[ql];B[qm];W[rm];B[pn];W[qo];B[po]
;W[pp];B[rl]TR[pl]C[Dakre: Q8 better here... but you probably know yourself now :)]
;W[rk];B[qk]C[Dakre: even now... Q8 is better... just make a solid connection and you don't have to worry about cutting points later...]

[kl]C[Dakre: try to escape earlier... escaping is always superior against to be forced to make two eyes, because you keep white seperated...]
;B[nn];W[oo];B[mn]TR[kj][kk][kl]C[Dakre: N6 is a bad move... should be at one of the triangles...]
;W[ll]C[Is it dead now? or is there something I could have done?]
;B[ml];W[lj]
(;B[lm]C[Dakre: look at the variation...];W[lk];B[km];W[jl]
;B[jm];W[im];B[kl];W[kk]C[Dakre: try to identify such crucial cutting points like white p9 before... and see their true value... even if white doesn't kill, she can build up strength/territory while chasing it... if this group had survived i think the game would have been close...
if you have any questions left don't bother to ask me :)
have a nice day...

(;B[lk]C[Dakre: it is always better to walk through a narrow gate... i think there is a proverb saying sth like this... :> so m9 might work better than m7 does... white can't block directly...]
