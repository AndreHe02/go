Thanks for the review];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd]LB[pc:1][qd:2]
[cf:A][cn:B][qp:3][pq:4]C[these are standard openings, sometimes you should have some strategies like developing the sides first with a 3-4 opening like 1,2,3,4.  Black should have went offense since black has the advantage of first move.  Q10 is a protective move.  A and B serves to disconnect the white two stones.]

(;B[pj];W[nq];B[lq]LB[mo:B][no:A]C[Best move would be A allowing white to escape  and this threatens Q4.  B is indirectly affecting M3.]

(;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]C[this move helps keep White trapped in the corner and fortifies M3]
;W[nc];B[fc]LB[hb:E][hc:D][ic:A][hd:C][id:B]C[Best move at A, B, C,D since it helps defend O17 and attacks F17.  D16 alone can build a group in the corner.  D would probably be the best since it discourages F17 from building a group with E]

[lc][nc][qc]C[C would be extraneous since C is rather safe.  D would be a bolder attack.  Black would definitely respond to D.  A would either lead to a move in E or F.  A is a bad move.  B seems to be a good move but a bolder move at H would lead to a respond at I and this can be followed up with G]

(;W[cj];B[ob];W[oc];B[mb];W[nb];B[mc];W[md];B[lb]LB[ne:A]C[White's move at A actually secured upper right hand corner group.  If white went somewhere else, that group would be cut off]

(;W[ne];B[cm];W[cn];B[fq]LB[fp:A][hp:C][eq:B]C[white should have done something with F3 with A, B or C]

(;W[dm];B[fo]C[Like I said before this keeps you from the lower center region and White doesn't have to overreact to C7]
;W[dl];B[ng];W[nj]LB[oi:A][om:C][pm:B]C[Black doesn't have to be afraid of White jumping at B since a simple move at C would cover that.]
;B[ok];W[oi]LB[ph:A][pi:B]C[Black moved at A which forms a rather weak connection.  B would have done the job]

(;B[ig]LB[hh:A]C[A would have been a better move since White can pull back easily.  This costed Black part of the center.  If Black played at A Black would have crushed White easily.  This is the vital mistake.]

[hi][dj]C[You went at A which is rather useless and costed you the group marked in the squaresB would have been better]

;B[cp]LB[bq:C][br:A][as:B]C[there seems to be no way to kill Black's group since there are several vital points.  If White went after the vital points earlier than the group would either be reduced or dead.  C7 seems to be the deterant and probably White was cautious of this move.  B is kind of important since white can do a seki there if black needed to]

C[This was alittle too deep but Black's tone at  N5 changed the course of the game.  If white went at 1, black at 2, and etc like Black went in the game N8 would be saved and it was a vital move that seperated the white group.  I assumed that white probably thought N8 was pretty much dead so it neglicted it.  If White went at 6, it would have changed the course of the game and allowed the white group to live.]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[ln]LB[km:A][mm:C][kn:B]C[White should also have went at C since black could have went there afterwards.  B seems to be played to simutaneously prevent M6 from extending and would allow white to intrude alittle into black's territory.  this is White's vital mistake]

Black had uncontested control of the right side because white was not aggressive and also because of the move 5.  Both have to learn to read ahead further.  Be aware of the supposedly dead groups since they caused white to lose.  From the score estimate I learned that Black won by 0.5.  That was great play by Black.
