Hello reviewer! 
I had black and without KOMI (therefore handicap)
 
I did so many mistakes and I forgot this game had no KOMI. 
and i resigned. 
However, without no komi white  leaded  only 0.5 points.];W[dc]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[ce]C[Black 5 is the biggest move.];W[dg]C[White 6 is doable but loose pincer is better, because white isn't easy to play on the left side in this situation.]
;B[ee]C[Yes, black must get out and split white.];W[fd];B[dj]
C[Black 9 is a nice pincer and an ideal extension, too.];W[fg]
C[White 10 is a normal way to run. F12 could be better in this case.]
;B[fe]C[Black must push out and split white from here.];W[gd]
C[White has to get out here.];B[ge]C[Black 13 is a must.];W[hd]
C[White has to still get out.];B[he]C[Black 15 is necessary. Now we can see that F13 stone is too close to black's wall. F12 is better.]
;W[id];B[ie]C[Black 17 is a useful forcing move. Black can play a forcing move at E12 first.]
;W[fj]C[White 18 is necessary. Usually white has to respond at K16.]
;B[dm]C[Black 19 is too soon. Black has to squeeze white from K16 first.]
;W[hg]C[I cannot understand 

White has to inside group at K16 first.];B[je]C[Black 21 is a solid move. K16 could be more severe.]
;W[kc]C[White makes a comfortable position on the top side.]
;B[le]C[I don't know my moves are right or not.

Black 23 is thick but not really necessary. Black has to take the biggest move at K4 first.]
;W[jq]C[Now white got the biggest move.];B[hj]C[Black 25 is a severe squeeze.]
;W[ej]C[White 26 is slow. D11 is a more useful forcing move.]
;B[di]C[Black 27 is the key point, it takes away white's eye-space, also leaves cutting point in white's position.]
;W[eh]C[White 28 is necesary but white shape is overconcentrated.]
;B[gh]C[Black 29 is a strong attack.];W[dk];B[ck]C[Black 31 is a must.]
;W[cl]C[White 32 is a common tesuji.];B[dl];W[ek]
(;B[cj]C[b9 connection is better than c10?

Black 35 is ok. B10 is better.];W[gg];B[hh]C[Black 37 is the best way to use previous move.]
;W[ei];B[ig]C[Black has to help his three stones at K12.];W[cm]
;B[cn];W[bn];B[co];W[bo];B[bp];W[cq];B[cp];W[bi];B[bk];W[em]
;B[dn]C[Even though white did a few useful forcing moves, but overall black is fine.]
;W[hk]C[White 52 is the best way to run out.];B[ik]C[Black 53 is the proper move, because J10 isn't a real cutting point.]
;W[hl]C[White needs more liberties here.];B[il]C[Black 55 is the correct direction to squeeze white.]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[gm];B[im];W[gn];B[gk];W[gl];B[gj];W[el]C[These exchanges are painful for white, because all black outside moves are much more useful than all white's response at the inside.]
;B[jo]C[Black 65 isn't that useful. Black has to squeeze white from G3 which is more valuable.]
;W[hp];B[mp]C[As w68 was so good position,    n4 might be big mistake.  
n6  or n7 may be good position. 
what move is the best?

Black now isn't easy to attack white group. Therefore Q10 is more valuable than Black 67.]
;W[pn]C[White 68 is a nice defense.];B[pj]C[Black 69 is still the biggest move.]
;W[mn]C[White 70 is a nice squeeze that is also good for reducing black's influence.]
;B[pq]C[Black 71 isn't good, it will help white stronger. L3 is a better way to help black weak stone.]
;W[qq]C[Black then has to play a forcing move at P4...]
(;B[qr]C[Black 73 is too low.];W[oq]C[White 74 is a good squeeze.]
;B[pr];W[np]
(;B[qp];W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq]C[Black lives in the corner, but white got thickness at the outside that is more useful.]
;W[nj]C[White 82 is a nice reduction.];B[pg]C[R14 is a more valuable defense.]
;W[in]C[White 84 is too aggressive. White has to invade at R17 first.]
;B[jn];W[jm]C[White isn't easy to fight from here, since black has more stones in the center area.]
;B[km]C[Black 87 is the correct direction to squeeze white.]
;W[jl];B[kl];W[jk];B[ij];W[jj];B[lj]C[Black must split white from here.]
;W[ji];B[jh]C[It is a necessary defense.];W[li];B[mi]C[Black must split white from here.]
;W[mj]
(;B[kk]C[It is the best defense, because it takes away a liberty on white.]
;W[kh];B[mh]C[It is the best way to help cutting stone.];W[kg]
;B[lo]C[Black 103 is a necessary defense.];W[jf]C[Black now must save his center group at J14 no matter what ...]

(;B[lf]C[As white has so many Ko threat, I  feard Ko.  
Ko or not ko, what move is the best?

Black 105 is so weak. It seems like black is going to give up this game.]

C[Black 115 is the best way to help his weak group.];W[ml]C[White 116 isn't that useful.]
;B[mk];W[ok]C[White 118 is a heavy play. White has to just defend at O7.]
;B[nn]C[Black 119 isn't a good timing. Black has to split white from P8.]
;W[pk]C[White 120 is a good defense.];B[qj];W[nm]C[White 122 is an important point.]
;B[om];W[mm]C[White makes a straight shape, it also leaves many cutting points in black shape.]
;B[nk];W[oj]C[White 126 is a heavy play. White has to just defend at P6.]
;B[ol];W[on]
(;B[ql]C[I thought next Shibori might be effective.  

Black 129 is the best way to split white.];W[qk]
(;B[qm]C[Black 131 is the best move.];W[rj];B[ri]C[Black 133 is a mistake. Black has to defend at R12.]
;W[rl]C[White 134 is too soon. White has to cut at R11 first. If black answers at Q11, black then hane at S8.]
;B[sj]C[Black 135 is a good timing.];W[rk];B[rm];W[qi];B[rh]
C[Now black will not answer at Q11.];W[pi];B[mo]C[Black 141 is a key point.]
;W[no]C[White 142 is too much. White must play at N3 first.]

Editor's note: This move was actually played at 'A'. White 182 here is a transcription error. Yilun Yang was unaware of this transcription error when he made the review. Please take this into account when reading the following comments.]

This game was handicap (without KOMI) , but  I forgot it.
I resighned at e4 move.

Thereafter a reprensentative proceeding might be next.
Is it right move?

Thank you very much again!

The sequence from 1 to 8 is the best play locally. But it is hard to believe that both players doesn't see the move at j11. Thank you!  -- Yilun Yang]
