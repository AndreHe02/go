C[Javi:

Hi,

I would try to help you a bit but I am only 8k so my comments are only a rough idea, not the very truth.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[cd]C[I've been experimenting with moves other than hoshi in the opening. Does it matter much here what I play, given the rest of the board? Or are the corner openings more or less independent of each other?

javi:

There are certain sequences that are played many times in a corner. They are called "joseki" in japanese and they are *locally* equal. But the very important thing is to use the proper joseki for the WHOLE board.

There are, also, a whole side moves like sanrensei or chinese opening, etc which are very usual and they are worth of study.]
;W[dp];B[fq];W[ip]C[javi:

For example, here I know two basic josekis, look at the variations]

(;B[dq]C[javi:

I have showed two better options for black here but this is not very bad, just too solid and defensive.]
;W[cq];B[eq];W[cr]C[javi:

When white played this, you should check if the cuts works.

Let´s see it ...]
(;B[iq]C[Is this okay here? Should I have cut after white's response? Or nobi?

javi:

We now know that black can not cut, but white j4 stone is alone and attaching to a weak stone is not good usually.

I would have played around L3 pincering white. Or just jump at f5.]
;W[hq]C[javi:

In this kind of situations, the usual move is cross cut.]
(;B[hr];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr]C[javi:

White is playing very aggresively ¡]
(;B[hp];W[ho];B[gp];W[jo];B[kp];W[jp];B[lq];W[np]C[javi:

This is an overplay  by white.];B[nq];W[oq]C[javi:

This is not needed. Look at the previous variations.];W[lr]
;B[ec];W[pn];B[qn];W[qm]
(;B[rn]C[Javi:

I dont like this move. It lefts a big weakness at r5.];W[pl]
;B[om];W[pm];B[on]C[javi: 

White could have played at r5 directly.]
(;W[po];B[oo];W[qo];B[ro];W[qp];B[qq];W[rp];B[sp];W[sq];B[rq]
;W[so]C[javi:

This result is very bad for black :(];B[rm];W[rl];B[sr];W[sp]
;B[rr];W[qk];B[ol];W[ko];B[ll]C[javi:

This move greatly reduced white center influence but in my opinion a mover around c10 is much, much bigger now.]
;W[cn];B[dl]C[javi:

I am not sure about what was you idea with this move. It didnt make territory at left side nor attacked white corner because it is already secured.

I would have played around c11 or o17.];W[cj];B[cl];W[cg]C[Javi:

Black has separated white, true, but his c8 group is much weaker than white stones, so this is very bad for black.

The left side should have been black territory and if white invaded, black should have a good attack]
;B[di];W[ci];B[dh];W[dj];B[ej];W[dg];B[eg];W[ef];B[fg];W[de]
;B[fe]C[javi: I think that this move is an overplay.

Black is very weak at the corner and f15 neither defends the corner nor the center group.]
;W[ff];B[gf];W[gg];B[gh];W[hg];B[ee];W[df];B[hf];W[eh];B[fh]
C[javi:

White should have saved his g13 stones.];W[ek];B[ig];W[ch];B[ei]

;W[ep];B[fo];W[fp];B[go];W[do];B[en];W[jk];B[ij];W[ik]C[javi: This is small. Much bigger a move around n17 or q14 or push and cut at d16.]
;B[jj];W[hj];B[hi];W[fj];B[fi];W[gj];B[hk];W[hl];B[kk];W[jl]
;B[lj];W[hn];B[nc]C[javi: GOOD :)];W[kd]C[javi:

Black is very strong at top so I think this pincer is an overplay.]

(;B[kc]C[javi:

Again touching a weak stone. I would have played the variation.]
;W[jc];B[lc];W[jd];B[me]C[javi:

Anyway, you have succeded in separate white stones while reinforcing your group.]

(;B[lh]C[javi: This is a small move, b15, b8 much bigger. And of course, j18.]
;W[kb];B[lb];W[ka]C[Javi: Again j18 kills or at least a seki. Look at the variations.]

;B[dc];W[cc];B[bd];W[cb]C[javi:

You should block at the other side. Otherwise white can connect at d18 or f18]

javi: before white played at l5, it would be a good squeeze against n4 stones but now it is not so useful.]
;W[lm];B[km];W[kl];B[jm];W[il];B[mn]C[javi: It should be at n5 because it is atari.]

javi:

As a final commentary I would like to say that you havent made big mistakes but I would recommend to you to study a bit of joseki or at least watch and replay some 10k or stronger games at the opening.

I think that you should improve at close fighting because you have not got the best results at fights. A bit of life and death study would help you also.]
