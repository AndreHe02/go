Hi, thanks in advance to whomever reviews this game. My name is kitts and I'm white in this game. I'm currently ranked 14 kyu on KGS (don't know how reliable that is, I was stuck at 20 for a long time before taking some time off and playing 1000 games of 9x9 vs. computer to polish life and death skills). Anyhow, I'm usually okay at tactics but I'm weak at opening strategy. Sometimes I can recover, but in this game I opened really poorly, I think, and would really like to know what some better responses to black's opening moves could be. You don't need to review the game all the way through to the end, if you don't want. I also don't study joseki (I've heard people recommend against it until you're close to dan level), but I get the feeling it might have come in handy here, so if there are any resources or general principles I should know, I'd appreciate any help in that area.

[gromit\] Hi, I'll do my best to answer those questions, but don't hesitate to contact me for more info if you feel that it's necessary.

kitts [16k\]: good luck];B[dc];W[pd];B[pp];W[dp];B[ce];W[nq]
;B[pn];W[pr];B[nc];W[oc]C[[gromit\] Ok, up to now I didn't have much to say, but...
This move is bad for White: The usual consequence will be a reinforcement of B at O16 an extension of W at Q14 (to avoid being locked in the corner) and... an extension of B around K16 (see var).
This K16 move will be a very good move for B, perfect extension of both his upper left corner and his two stone formation.

The kosumi-tsuke (P17) is a good *attacking* move, but only when W is strong around K16, robbing in advance B of his natural extension. Otherwise it should be avoided.]

(;B[me]C[[gromit\] uncommon ;)];W[kc]CR[fc][lc]TR[ic]C[To reviewer: I suppose a better move here would be closer to the upper left?

[gromit\] A natural invasion poitn would be the triangle marked point, allowing for a two space extension on both sides (if B takes one, W has the other as miai).

If what W is trying to do is exploiting the weakness of B last move, then a clamp at N17 seems better.]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[gc];W[ic];B[id];W[gb];B[fc];W[fb];B[eb];W[ha]
TR[nc][me]SQ[mc]C[[gromit\] Now that W has a base, jumping to the center, and thus attacking the two B stones on the right would be better. W still has N17 if necessary.]
;B[kd]C[To reviewer: Ok, at this stage, I'm alive but totally boxed in. I addressed what I thought was a potential threat here, but allowed myself to get boxed in even more. Would the smart thing now be to play at C 12 or thereabouts?

[gromit\] If W plays on the left, playing high (4th line) and not to colse to B seems better. I'd say that D11 keeps things balanced with W lower left.

The right side is interesting too: B didn't answer Q2 so moves around R9 will build and attack.]
;W[jd];B[je];W[jc];B[ld];W[lc];B[mc];W[pg]C[To reviewer: In retrospect, I think if I was going to play along the right side, I should have gone at around R8 or so. Any thoughts?

[gromit\] Yes R8 or R9 are good, in relation to lower right.
R17 is still open so Q13 seems unnecessarily far from the corner (locally R14 would have been better).]
;B[pk];W[qi]C[[gromit\] This seems a bit slow. B doesn't have to answer and W upper right is STILL open!!!]
;B[of];W[pf];B[og];W[hg]C[To reviewer: At this point I was worried that if I didn't establish a presence here Black would totally take over the entire board. I managed to live, but a move along the sides have been better, I assume.

[gromit\] No, I think you had the right idea: B reinforced W upper right corner to get more central influence. W has to counter that in some way.

However, H13 seems too close to B thickness (stay away from thickness says the proverb) H10 seems enough of an erosion (if B H12, B is highly overconcentrated).

Using the sides is still possible (around D10 for insatnce), but will turn the game into a struggle between two big territories, which might be tough for W.]
;B[jg];W[ge]C[[gromit\] Now W is greedy!
Pulling back to H11 would be more than enough.];B[dh];W[ef]
;B[df];W[cj]C[[gromit\] W plays in the wrong direction, pushing B towards his weak central group...
That group *has* to run to the center.];B[fg];W[gg];B[eg];W[ff]
TR[gj]C[[gromit\] It's only 1 stone, W should run for his life.]
;B[kp];W[mo]TR[no]C[[gromit\] A solid 1 point jump is better. Don't play keima (horse jump) when weak.]
;B[hp];W[fq];B[mp];W[np];B[mq];W[nn];B[gq];W[cm]TR[fp][iq]C[[gromit\] The iron pillar in response to B move would strengthen W lower left corner, and attack B (threatening J3)]
;B[fr];W[er];B[eq];W[dq];B[fp];W[ep]TR[gj][qq]C[[gomit\] Useless, B is already alive, and might even not answer.
W lower right on the contrary might need help and R3 is also big in terms of territory.
Juming out from the center group is important too.];B[fq];W[dr]

;B[po];W[ml];B[qr];W[pm]C[[gromit\] W is very lucky to get his stones out, but B still got a big corner. That's where W loses the game in my opinion.]

In any case, you don't need to review any further if you don't want...

[gromit\] resigning was an option ;)

[gromit\] Well, I don't think that W opening was *that* bad. Of course the upper side invasion was not very good, but W tried to counter B central influence and not too bad.

However, the lower side was very strange to me: B left a weak position for a long time in the lower right corner, then invaded the lower side, but W instead of attacking these two weak groups, left his own group get attacked in the middle, ending in a big profit for B (look at the lower side plus lower right corner).

W did play quite well tactically, but in terms of directions there are a few things to remember:
- avoid kosumi-tsuke if you're not already pincering the stone
- avoid getting too close to thickness (being greedy is not necessary)
- an invasion move should ideally extend on both sides
- if moves secure a base for one of your groups while stealing the opponent's, they are urgent (R3!!!)

Good luck, and if you still have questions, please don't hesitate to ask me.]

(;B[nd];W[pf];B[jd]TR[qc]C[[gromit\] B has a perfect structure on the top, the upper right corner is still open...]
