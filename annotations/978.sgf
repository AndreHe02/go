(;B[qi]C[patrickb: The extension to R11 seems a little short. If b extended to R10 instead, white would not be able to make a two-point extension (a "base") along the right side with his R6 stone.]
;W[qk]LB[nc:C][rd:B][qo:A][np:D]C[patrickb: Now, right right side is symetric, but it's b's move and b should try and take the initiative on that side of the board... What kind of moves should he consider? A is an attempt to make w over-concentrated, B to prevent w from doing the same to him. C tries to put direct pressure on the Q16 stone. Just playing D directly seems wrong. The variations explain each of these approaches, including why D feels luke-warm at best.]

(;B[ro]C[patrickb: This is an aggressive move on b's part, perhaps overly so at this point. The concern is that the R6 stones might become stronger and then used to attack the R11 stones above. Not a bad move, I don't think, just a little strange.]
;W[oq]C[patrickb: odd move. b plays P4 then P6, and the w stones look weak.]
;B[np]C[patrickb: Okay, the first really questionable move. b is "playing into a peep". If the Q4 and O4 stones existed by themselves, and w played P3, b would have to respond, to prevent w from playing P4 and cutting. Black just *gave* w the opportunity to push and cut.]
;W[op];B[oo]
(;W[pq]C[patrickb: too passive. cut at Q5 instead. Asks b to play R5, weakening the w stones at R6, etc.]
;B[qo]C[patrickb: good.];W[pn];B[po];W[qq]
(;B[om]LB[oj:A][ok:B][nm:C]C[patrickb: right idea from black to attack the w stones, but an odd choice of move to use to do so. What about leaning at P10, and then using that thickness to take profit at the top? A, B, and C are the moves that leap to mind. The principles that are important here are "attack from a distance", and " look for profit while attacking". Frequently it's better to harass your opponent's stones than to try to surround them to tightly. Doing the later frequently leaves behind weak points in your own postion that your opponent can try to exploit.]
;W[pj];B[oe]C[patrickb: interesting idea to lean on this w stone and use that to attack the other w stones at the bottom. The only downside is that it forces w to make a large area at the top.]
;W[nc]C[patrickb: O17 seems passive and a little low. Better to just play at P16 instead, probably.]
;B[md];W[mc];B[ld];W[pi];B[ph];W[oh];B[qd]LB[qc:A]C[patrickb: somewhat strange. This removes the chance to later invade at A.]
;W[qc];B[pe];W[rd];B[qe];W[rc]C[patrickb: this white move is a waste. Better to connect at Q17 at the minimum. Now b gets another forcing move.]
;B[od];W[pc];B[nh]C[patrickb: very odd move. w can simply cut at R12 and become stable on the right side.]

C[patrickb: I'm not sure what the point of this move is... I don't see that it particularly does anything for white.]
;B[ol];W[pk];B[ll]C[patrickb: probably better to just ignore M7 and play somewhere else, like on the left side.]

;W[gp];B[fo];W[hq];B[ho];W[iq];B[jq];W[jr];B[ee]C[patrickb: why play this move? Black is playing a lot of moves whose point is not particularly clear. This move just forces w to make a large top-left corner when he plays E16. I don't see how b gets any compensation that is equivalent.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[ic];B[jb];W[hd];B[ec]C[patrickb: now w plays a one-point jump that is already peeped. On the whole both players are trying interesting things, which is good, but it's not clear that either has read out or planned a follow-up to the move.]

;W[db];B[fa]C[patrickb: okay, in this sequence, w was much too greedy for only a small corner. Now b should look for a chance to attack the J17 stones. Also - I don't like the F19 play. It leaves some potential for the F17 cut which is troubling.]
;W[dg]
(;B[dh]C[patrickb: the ladder at E13 works instead.];W[eg];B[ef]
C[patrickb: an empty triangle that doesn't seem to help much. Part of the problem now, though, is the F17 cut which b left behind. Better to have reinforced at G17 (which also further weakens the H16 stones) than to have played F19.]
;W[eh];B[ek]C[patrickb: Is b planning to kill the C2 stones? This does help keep the E12 stones and the D8 stones separated, but I think something like G14 is urgent now.]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[el]C[patrickb: this move doesn't help much. It just makes b play E10, weakening the E12 stones.]
;B[bh];W[af];B[ej];W[gg]C[patrickb: interesting fight at the top now. b's E14 stones are weak and the F17 cut is a problem.]
;B[mj]C[patrickb: This move has no real point. w will catch some b stones at the top now, and the middle is not big enough.]

(;W[fc];B[fd];W[gc];B[hb];W[ib];B[ia]C[patrickb: this connection underneath is dangerous because of the weakness at L17 where w can try to cut.]
