;B[qd]C[I played white...

... and want to thank you for your help.];W[cp]C[-- Hello!  My name is Zoran Rilak (8k at KGS) and I'll be doing the review for White as requested.]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[pj];W[jq]TR[jc][kc][nc][oc][ce][ep][fp][jp][eq]
[fq]C[--  Good idea.  You know that White cannot follow by replicating Blacks' moves for the entire game, so you've decided to break the symmetry.  On the other hand, this is not the best move around.  There's a list of several possible continuations (marked with triangles).
  Note the point K4: it's very close to your stone but it's a much better move.  Here's why: in the early opening, whether you play on the 3rd or the 4th line is a very important thing and as a rule of thumb one can say that when your opponent has a high stone (4rd line) on the other side, you should ho low for territory, and when his stone is low (3rd line) as here, you then go high for influence.  
  I've inserted two variations to illustrate why this is so.]

(;B[jc];W[cj]C[-- Once more: this could easily have been placed one line higher.  There is really no need to focus on the territory this early in the game or you will suffer serious trouble later when Black starts developing center.  Go high when you have a high stone in one corner!  Let your opponent invade, then descend from your high position and attack forcing them to flee for life.]
;B[lq]TR[eq]C[-- This is bad.  It's small both in influence and in territory.  Black has answered your bad move with an even worse one, so you can be happy. :)]
;W[gq]LB[jo:A][nq:B]TR[cp][jq]C[-- Better would be to jump to K5 (A).  In that way you would *both* start developing a wall, aiming for an intrusion at around B, and prepare a very huge moyo (potential territory) between the two marked stones.  Always try to think how to attack *and* make something for yourself while your opponent defends!  Three or four attacks of this kind, when you build some territory while they have to retaliate, and the game will quickly turn into your favor.]
;B[jp];W[ip];B[kp];W[df]TR[ip]C[--  The move is locally very good, but you shouldn't have left that J4 stone alone.  It is true that Black cannot capture or reduce your territory significantly, but he can 'lean over' J4 and push you downwards, which would greatly help him in creating a moyo at the righthand side of the board.  J5 is urgent here and Black's response to J5 is almost absolutely mandatory.]
;B[gd]C[-- Black is really letting you have territory. :)];W[gf]
TR[io]C[-- An interesting move!  You're announcing your intention to secure a big moyo on the left, but you still sorely lack a stone at the triangled point.  One Black's move there and all your effort in the upper part of the board will be turned to naught.]
;B[hf];W[hg];B[if];W[ig];B[jg];W[jh];B[kg];W[ii];B[ff];W[fg]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[ge];W[gg]C[-- You don't really need this.  If Black captures, you can stop him with a move at G12.]
;B[de];W[ee]C[-- This is a good use of Black's bad shape.];B[fe]
;W[ed];B[ki];W[ce]C[-- Absolutely superflous.  Were you afraid of a cut at D13?]
;B[io]C[-- Here comes that dreaded J5...];W[hp];B[ho];W[go]
;B[hn]C[-- Black is making a great lot of dubious shapes.];W[gn]
;B[hl];W[qo]C[-- So you're giving up the territory in the left part of the board.  In time, because if you went on to save it you wouldn't end up with a lot of it left, while Black would have closed you between iron bars.]
;B[qp]C[-- Blakc should have pincered here at R7.  For your info, if you get into a similar position as Black here and your opponent invades the corner, the best course is to let them have it, but enclose and shut them in tightly so the entire rest of your moyo is yours and only yours.  Of course, if you're certain that they cannot live, then sure, go ahead and score a kill. ;)]

(;W[rp]C[-- Hm, the standard reply is Q5 (see variation).  This is doomed to failure if you're looking for life.]
;B[rq];W[pp];B[qr];W[qq]C[-- Black continues to play awkwardly in the local battles.  Simply connecting after you attacked his stone would give him a strong position; this way, you get a ko for life.]
;B[dg];W[dd];B[qp]TR[ql]C[-- What you need is a nice internal threat, that is, a ko threat which aims to perform the same thing this ko is about: life for White.  R8 in that direction would be nice]
;W[ro];B[nq]
(;W[qq]C[-- This stone isn't important anymore; you've connected.  Now you must extend to R8 and fight for life before it's too late.  See variation.]
;B[cf];W[oq]C[-- I understand your concern over the life of your invading stones, but don't just let Black endanger all you've made so far in exchange for a (small?) life in the corner!  Just connect and let Black play again.  If Black captures D14 you will be fighting a *very* unpleasant ko.]
;B[qp];W[de]C[-- What an odd exchange on both sides :)];B[qq]
;W[cg]C[-- Alas, another unneccessary move.  Keep sente (tempo)!  Don't just let them play and be content with answering their moves. Be the one who dictates the course of the game and if you win, it will be your credit, and if you lose at least you'd know what and where went wrong.]
;B[op];W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[nn];W[pm];B[om];W[pn];B[nm];W[ql]
;B[ol];W[kh]C[-- Cool, so you're almost alive in the corner, and you've noticed the gaping flaw in Black's shape.  Frankly I'm expecting you to win this game unless something goes badly wrong, i.e. Black somehow manages to encircle that giant territory on the top.  An invasion at P17 is something you should be seriously considering right now.]
;B[lh];W[gc]LB[lg:A]C[-- My guess is that you were aiming for the cut at A, counted the moves and found out that you were one liberty short of capturing those five Black stones.  So G17 is a two-purpose move: aiding for the incoming attack and increasing your territory.  But, the problem is, what if Black sees your intentions as well?  The he will simply connect at A and leave you with only that five or six points you managed to grab with G17.  The idea itself was great, but the move you played is of little value except as a supporting stone for the attack, so actually you're giving him a chance to spot the danger and defend in time.]
;B[hc];W[fd];B[fc];W[gb];B[fb]C[-- Now's the time to cut!  Since you've missed it I'll show you in a variation.]

(;W[hb];B[hd];W[eb];B[ib];W[fa];B[ha];W[ec];B[pl]LB[qk:A]C[-- It's very important to extend to A.  It's a move Black cannot neglect, and you'd have more eye space to secure the group.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[ob];B[qa];W[pb];B[od];W[pa]C[-- This doesn't give you any eye space; in fact, you're very close to the edge of the board and I'm afraid this invasion has already failed.]
;B[ra];W[mc];B[nc];W[nb];B[md];W[lc];B[kb];W[lb]
(;B[kd]C[-- Black misses the killing move.  Can you find it? ;)  (see variation you you can't)]
;W[ka]C[-- And you miss the move to live, which is in exactly the same spot where Black would play to kill.]
;B[ma]C[-- there. :)];W[na];B[la];W[mb];B[la];W[ma];B[ja];W[kc]
;B[la]C[-- okay, you've got a two-step ko, but a very hard one to win...  Let's see how well you handle this situation :)]
;W[oc];B[nd];W[ka];B[qm];W[jb];B[ic];W[ia];B[qk];W[ga]C[-- too bad you had to give up that bottom group.  It might in fact prove that losing it meant losing the game for you.  All that because you didn't see the life-making move on the top.]
;B[rl];W[ld];B[le];W[jd];B[ke];W[id];B[he];W[jf]C[-- Simply great!  You didn't lose your 'cool' :)]
;B[kf];W[ie];B[je];W[li];B[lj];W[mi];B[mj];W[mh];B[mf]
(;W[lg]LB[pd:A]C[-- here's another option: what about A?];B[nh]
;W[kj]LB[ni:A]C[-- 'A' is much better.  As long as they must keep answering your moves and you reduce their territory, you're good.]
;B[ni];W[lf];B[me];W[mg];B[ng];W[ji];B[kk];W[jk];B[kl];W[jl]
;B[jm];W[il];B[im];W[gm];B[hm];W[gl];B[hk];W[gk];B[ij]LB[hj:A]
C[-- 'A' is a very nice response to this move.]
(;W[gj];B[jj];W[hj];B[ki];W[lh];B[kj];W[nf]LB[pd:A]C[-- You should *first* have pushed through at 'A'.  Then you'd still have the options to capture the corner or that big clump of black stones.]

;B[ne];W[rc];B[sc]C[-- a mistake.  You should have punished it like I have in the variation.]

If he chooses to block White right away, then he'd create another pair of cutting points, giving White a fine chance to entertain himself with cutting to no end.  So Black mustn't block, but if he doesn't do that, then White will either rnu towards his weak group in the lower left corner or turn upwards, destroying Black's area there.]

(;W[dq];B[ep];W[cn];B[hp];W[mq];B[po]C[--  Here White accomplishes little, while Black has played lightly and secured a piece of firm territory in the corner.  Both Black and White groups are yet unsettled and will surely take part in serious fighting later in the game, but it's fair to say that Black has the fighting advantage right now: the wall on the right and a lively group on the left, eagerly looking to support an invasion into the White's weak two-stone position.]

(;W[gq]C[-- (This is called a 'pincer': squeezing Black stone from both sides)]

Again his two stones appear weak in front of Black's wall on the left and the looming oogeima (large knight's move) on the right.  Sore, white can live here with a sliding move at M2, but that would be too easy-going on Black who then could develop a nice, juicy, fat potential territory on the right side of the board.]
