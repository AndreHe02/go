C[This is a game played against a gnugo-bot on KGS.
This time I didn't make any obvious big mistakes, didn't loose a big group/corner or made other big blunder in the endgame ... but lost with 12,5 points.
I had 3 corners, but lost control over the center.
Which were the keypoints I missed? Where do I have to improve most?
Any great opportunities/tesujis I missed? :-)

Many thanks in advance,

Markus];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[pj]C[Though Im no fan of learning Joseki before 5kyu, that E17 position is dangerous because it can make a huge stable corner enclosure. Your move at Q10 isnt "wrong", but just something to think about.]

C[Bad move. the fertile fields are in the OTHER direction. Even if you somehow won the battle there it wouldnt be much of a gain. His stones at L17 would minimize any damage even an expert could inflict upon him (in other words, attacking him probably will be to his benefit as it will make his stones work together).]

(;B[ch]C[Hmm ... looks somehow small, better pincer? (corner should be alive anyway?)

I believe it would live at the risk of losing your small foothold in the corner. Overall Im getting the impression your play is too solid. You lose the efficiency you would get from having slightly unstable groups that could run into the center (or anywhere else). The efficiency in doing this is you build influence, or even territory, while running thereby doing two things at once. Playing solid only allows you to do one thing at a time. (See possible Variations one step before)]

(;B[dc]C[again too small?

Yup. Small and worthless.
With his two stone wall at C11, white threatens to make his stones work together and take the whole bottom left side. I would immediately consider an invasion of some sort. 

If you would play between his 2 stone group and D4, you make the D4 group a weak unstable group from whichyou can extract some profit. (see possible var)]
;W[dm];B[ed]C[yeah, stupid ... only one point];W[fd];B[cq];W[dq]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[dd];B[dr]C[Too small. You need to stop being afraid of invasions or of losing groups/stones. Id play G3 or G4 or maybe even H17.

The rational of G3/G4 (assuming it works) would be to nullify the effect of Whites massive wall. White already has some stones on the opposite side at L3 so can easily extract profit from the wall.]
;W[er];B[cr];W[fq]C[D9 would seem better here. C7 doesnt really make you much territory or stablilize your group (which is already 100% stable). And once again, D9 would slightly cut the C11 stone off from support. Even if you dont kill it (most likely), you can chase it for a while and thereby build a arm or wall out into the center which would then be helpful in an invasion at the bottom of the board.]
;B[cm];W[pb];B[oq];W[np];B[qc];W[nn];B[dn];W[do]C[Tough situation. Im not 100% sure its better, but my own play style would make me play E8 here. That would keep a bit of pressure up on C11]

[ss]C[In conclusion, you have to "loosen up" your play.
Notice that you didnt lose a single major group. Though this is a good thing, I suspect its all too common in your games. You have to take more risks because that makes your (locally weaker) stones interact better, allowing for more efficiency (but greater risk of miscalculation).


Good Game.])
