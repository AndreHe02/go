C[Brodie:  First, I'm very sorry about the delay in getting this done.  

One thing you mentioned is how when you play, your opponent always manages to build up some very large territory.  Just build your own group in that area first!   In this game there were lots of chances where might have saved yourself some trouble if you'd done that.  

Apart from that, please refrain from making end game moves before the end game.  That will help a lot!

Aside from that, you seemed to have the right general idea about what you were supposed to be doing.

I hope this helps!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[dm];B[dr]
;W[cq];B[jp];W[pf];B[nc];W[pi];B[jd];W[de]C[Brodie:  Everything is looking pretty good so far.  Maybe K16 would have been better here at D15.  Both are probably fine, but in this case white ends up getting the entire side.  

From here on ~D11 would be good at almost any time.];B[pl];W[qk]
;B[ql];W[pk]
(;B[gc]TR[ol]C[Brodie:  White should probably have played at P8.   The fact that there's a proverb about it, hane at the head of two stones, you can be sure it's important!  

For black, that would make P9 worth considering.  D11 might be another option.  I don't personally like G17;  at best white'll decide to play around D12 and secure the rest of the side.]

(;W[fc]TR[di][ol][nq]C[Brodie:  This play by white seems a little strange.  Contact plays aren't typically good.  Furthermore,  playing along the left side, or near the bottom right would be more important.  

What's important is that F17 doesn't do very much.  There are lots of better options.  That's part of the reason I disliked G17.  White can just ignore and move on to bigger and better things.]
;B[ge]C[Brodie:  again, why not just play around D11? or P9?  If you want to stop white from building a large territory along the left side, you could simply play there first!]
;W[fe]C[Brodie:  yet again!  This move is a little redundant.  It's not making territory, nor is it securing anything.]

(;B[gg]TR[fg][fi][fk][fm]SQ[gi][gk][gm]C[Brodie:  Okay.  To make a point.  Just suppose this carries on like this.  White plays at F13, black G11, and so on.  

The point is, you shouldn't just push white along, and let him build a big wall.  You're getting a wall too, but yours isn't really enclosing anything, or otherwise helping you out much.  You could wind up giving white an awful lot of territory here, so why not just make a play around D 11, or C10 now?]
;W[fg]
(;B[nf]C[Brodie:  D11, or C10, or anything around there would be better.  This stone will help protect ~5 points or so towards the middle there.  Where as something around D or C 10 will stop white from getting ~ a million points on the side.]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[ni];B[mi]C[Brodie:  This may be good for black.]
;W[nj]C[Brodie: maybe white should probably have played N10 instead.]
;B[mj];W[mk];B[lk]C[Brodie:  It makes sense, but D10 and N4 are still pretty big.]
;W[np]C[Brodie:  note, white plays in one of these larger areas first!

In fact, white goes on to play near D10 first as well.];B[nl]
C[Brodie:  This is more or less the right idea.   It threatens to cut, and puts pressure on the lone white stone.]
;W[ml]C[Brodie:  What about P6?  (see variation)   Cutting here seems to lead to problems for you.]

(;B[nk];W[ok]
(;B[mm]C[Brodie: just connect  =)];W[ol]
(;B[nm]C[Brodie:  capturing M8 would be fine as well.];W[om]

(;B[pm]C[Brodie:  Okay, this is not very good.  R6 is a much better connection to Q4!! R6 would pretty much have saved your corner.]
;W[pn];B[on]C[Brodie:  very dangerous.];W[oo];B[nn]
(;W[qn]C[Brodie:  This may be a slip for white.  Just connecting should work out much better.]

;B[rq];W[pr];B[qs];W[mq];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr];W[gb]C[Brodie:  Okay.  White appears to be a little ahead here.  You gave up a large part of the corner, but you did make a fairly large wall.  Walls are typically for attacking, and there's not all that much to attack around your wall.  This entire episode in the corner has been, on a whole, fairly bad for black.  

So where next?  The D10 area is still open!!  After that,  all that's left is to fight over some edges, and see how much black can make in the center.]
;B[hc]C[Brodie:  Not too sure about this one.  I would be all for playing at D10.  It does seem a little big to ignore though.]
;W[hb];B[ib]C[Brodie:  This one would have been a little easier to ignore.]
;W[fh];B[ha]C[Brodie:  Okay.  this is an endgame move for sure.  This is very small, and very unimportant.  D10 would be much better.

In this case it doesn't matter.  White instinctively responds with F18, and you're both happy.  However, suppose white did not just play F18.  Suppose white played around D10.  White will finish securing the side = MANY POINTS.   Black, will capture two stones = FEW POINTS.

In all, this doesn't work out badly, but you gave white the chance to make it work out badly for you.  Similarly, try to spot other players making similar plays against you.  Always ask yourself, do I really have to reply to that??  In some sense, you should do your best to ignore what your opponent is doing.  Well, at least when they make irrelevant plays.]
;W[fb];B[gh];W[fj]C[Brodie:  White is the first to play somewhere near D10 as well.]

(;B[gj]TR[ah][bh][ch][dh][eh]SQ[hh][ih][jh][kh][lh]C[Brodie:  This may be okay.  I would probably play H10, which wouldn't be much different.

I wasn't too keen on the idea of pushing along like this before.  However, for every point you push along, you each get about 5 points.  It's not working out all that badly.  White is pushing farther ahead, though, and so white kind of bulges in and gains more territory in the end.]

;W[cr];B[ho];W[go];B[gp];W[fo]C[Brodie: White seems to have gotten the best out of this.  Suppose black had played at D10 long ago, and settled a group in that area.  That would have severely cut down this territory white built up.  

White is still ahead, and there is not all that much left to do.  R15 will give a few points, and there are numerous other little moves, but most of the big plays are gone.]
;B[eq]C[Brodie:  I would ignore you here and play something like N13 or R15.  This is another example of moves which can be ignored, and lead to serious problems.]

(;W[ep];B[dq]C[Brodie:  This is kind of meaningless.  Who cares about one point?? Also, this is gote, so you lose the initiative.  R15 is worth much more than that!]

(;B[rf]C[Brodie: finally!  Although, I'm not so sure about S14.  It may work in some incredibly complicated way, however, see the variations.  White, I believe, has a move out of it.]

C[
All right.  With the exception of you capturing the N4 group, white was ahead for much of the game.  A large part of this is simply the fact that white played N4 first, and that white played around D10 first.  

So, just try very hard to ignore your opponent, and play at these big points first.   Essentially, you should try to always play the most important move.  This is not always grabbing open territory, so be careful, but these moves are usually pretty big.  If you're stuck for a good move, they're probably a decent choice.

As for the bottom right.  There was a little slip up (move 43), it could have turned out much better for you.

As for S14, R15 would have been much simpler.

I've tried to add variations to illustrate as many points as possible.  I hope this helps.

Happy Go playing
