White - baba006 (9k)
Black - Raine (12k - me)

A game that was longer than it needed to be turned out to be a crushing loss by resignation.  I'm submitting it because I have no idea what happened, or how I lost by so much.

I play certain moves because they've worked before, but they turn out to be horrible mistakes when I play them later.  Basically I'm trying to figure out how some moves are unrecoverable mistakes at some times and perfectly feasable at others.

(RickMott: because if the moves worked the same way all the time, Go wouldn't be nearly as interesting as it is.... :)

Playing this game was particularly frustrating because I kept seeing territory I surrounded simply vanish after a play or two, and I once again embarked upon a ko that ended up decimating my position.  Any general comments are appreciated, as are any comments regarding the use of ko.

A note: I've been playing a lot of high handicap (5 stones) games lately.  I take it those moves and strategies are skewing my perception of what's allowable and what isn't.

RickMott: I'll do my best to help you.  Whether a move is good or bad always depends on the surrounding positions,
which are rarely exactly the same.  White wouldn't be giving you a handicap if he weren't better at local tactics than
you are, which means he can get away with moves that wouldn't work against a equally-rated player.]
;W[dc];B[ce];W[cg];B[ee];W[fd];B[dh]C[RickMott: I don't think this is best for Black.  The usual response to a shoulder
hit is to stand up at D13, which would separate Black.  I would be more inclined
to pincer the white stone, say at C10.];W[ch];B[di]C[RickMott: This is the right response if he pushes on the 3rd line.]
;W[cj]C[I feel like this exchange (b8 for w9) was a mistake for me (black), but leaving the situation as it was would have been playing too lightly in an important area.

I also feel like this play (white 9) was an overplay, and that I should have forced immediately (C11) to take one side or the other, but at the same time, I'm worried that white will simply push at D13 and sacrifice C10 to take the two stones up top (C15, E15).

RickMott: Pushing along the 4th line is fine for you.  And you're instinct is right; you should push into the gap at C11
right away to create cutting points in white' s shape.  You don't necessarily have to cut right away, though.]
;B[fe];W[gd]C[This felt awful, but I felt I needed more stability, as I wanted to attack around K17 and sweep underneath white.  This turned out to be a poor idea, as is evident later.

RickMott: The exchange seems OK to me, but if you make white stronger on top in order to
strengthen your own line of stones, you really have to push at C11 next.  A play at K17 is a
fine idea because white's shape is open at the top edge, but it isn't urgent.]
;B[jc]C[RickMott: Too soon.  You give white a chance to patch up his weakness on the left.]
;W[ge]C[RickMott: but he doesn't do it???  Ok, I would still play C11 here, but if you want to
connect, F13 is a good way.  It maintains separation of the two white groups.  If
white plays D13, you make a bamboo joint with E13.  White can't cut because you
can capture in a net with F11.];B[gf]C[RickMott: Doesn't put enough pressure on the left-side group, and doesn't guarantee a connection.]
;W[hf];B[gg];W[ie];B[hb]C[RickMott: This is a small move (little value).  White can't make any significant territory here.
There are much bigger plays: the push at C11 still looks good to me; a play near the middle
of the two remaining open sides would be bigger; a pincer at C7 to prevent white's left side
group from making a base.  You could also simply extend at N17 or N16.]
;W[lc]C[So I cut under and get seperated immediately.  I can see why now; white has plenty to connect to around H15 and can always leap out right if blocked off.  Whereas I can scrape along underneath white, but not with very little territory.

N17 would have been a much better idea than H18, but during the game, it was difficult for me to turn from my previous plan, because I thought white would counter around B16 and I'd be able to jump out after that.

RickMott: You need to break out here and separate white as well.  This will turn into a running battle, 
but you must not let yourself become enclosed.  Start with the shoulder hit at L16.]
;B[kd]C[RickMott: Good!];W[ld];B[ke];W[nd];B[oc];W[mf]C[Another awful exchange for black; I'm cut off from my other group now.  I suppose I should have given up the corner to connect and make a wall, but that seems like such a big loss that I would be doomed to a loss.

RickMott: It's not that bad.  This is how running fights go.  You should just jump out at L13.]
;B[ec];W[ed];B[fb]C[RickMott: Trying to live inside isn't the best choice for two reasons: (1) you will strengthen
white in the upper left corner, and (2) you may not make two eyes anyway.  Also, you don't
keep any pressure on white.  Remember his group around N16 is weak, too.  This is why
jumping out with L13 is better.];W[cd];B[db]C[Here because I want to make eyeshape and can't attack the corner anymore.]
;W[cb];B[kb];W[lb];B[id];W[pe]C[RickMott: Ouch.  Letting white get the first move here hurts.  Compare this to a black jump to Q14.]
;B[qe];W[od];B[qc];W[pf];B[cm]C[And I jump away here.  Any comments about the general state of things at this point?  What about this move?  I like it, as it makes influence and threatens to attack white's group, but maybe my thinking is flawed?

RickMott: I would say you should push once more on the 3rd line at R14.  You may find the upper right
corner enclosed.  But it general, C7 looks like a good move.  However, now is when you wish you
hadn't made white's corner so much stronger.  This wiould be a stronger attack if white C16 weren't
already there, supported by a tiger's mouth on both sides.]
;W[be];B[ci];W[bi]
(;B[dj]C[RickMott: This is not good; it just forces white to connect.  Having created the cutting
points, wait until you know how you want to use them.  See the variation starting with
C14.];W[bj]C[RickMott: This way you just force white to patch up his weakness and remove all aji from the position.]
;B[eg]C[Now I'm safe, but at what cost?

RickMott: Is this move really the most important?  I'd play around the bottom center instead.  Much bigger.]
;W[ih]C[RickMott" Now you have to read out whether the top group can live.  If you can't you need to spend aonther
move here.  It's complicated.  As white, I'd start with H17.]

(;B[hg]C[Better at J14 maybe?  Maybe better to tenuki?  How does black respond to J13?

RickMott: This move is definitely useless.  You just force white to make a tiger's mouth.
Tenuki and play bottom center.];W[ig]C[RickMott: Did white remember to say thank you?  :)]
;B[jf]C[RickMott: You would play this peep to help yourself get out at L12 next.  Don't waste it now.
Bottom center is still biggest play on the board for both sides.]
;W[if];B[qf]C[I played this because I wanted to attack the P15 group.  Too slow!

RickMott: It's not terrible; a white play here is quite big, too.  The reason to play it is not
attacking white, but taking a point of high value for both sides.  But I think the bottom
center is bigger.];W[nq]C[RickMott: and so does white. :)];B[pn]
C[RickMott: I know this is a standard response, but in this situation it's the wrong direction of play. 
You want to pincer in order to make a double wing from the lower left corner.  You won't make much
on the right, because white has already pressed you down to the 3rd line.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[kq]
(;B[gq]C[RickMott: I would be tempted to hane at Q13 instead.  The bottom is not so big any more; having spent
3 stonds in the bottom right, you should aim for territory on the right side.  Maybe even a double hane,
Q13, w P13, P12, but that's a complicated fight for the weaker player to try.  See variation, last move.]
;W[qr]C[RickMott: This is a small move; you should ignore it.  Play somewhere on the right side, either
hane at the top or Q10/R10.];B[rr];W[ql];B[qi];W[rp]C[This tesuji was horribly frightening!  I have no idea how to counter this, and didn't see it coming at all!

RickMott: The key is to separate white's stones on the right side.  Your 2-2 stone isn't important.
I'd play R5.];B[rn]C[Naturally, my response is awful and riddled with weakness.

RickMott: The idea is correct, though.  Keep white separated.  R5 would have worked better, I think.]
;W[rq];B[qn]C[I wanted to play Q8, but then I'd lose R3 and Q4.  Then again, if I could wipe out R8, perhaps I should be happy to lose those couple stones.

RickMott: I still like the double tiger's mouth at R5.  I wouldn't connect this peep until somebody attacks it.
If you wanted to attack R8, better to do so directly with a cap at P8.  You are locally stronger, you should
do well in the fighting.];W[ol]C[RickMott: See?  This is a terrible outcome for black.  Now you are the one under attack, and your line of
3 stones is heavy instead of strong.];B[pk]C[RickMott: Don't make the stones near your weak group stronger!  This peep doesn't do anything for you.  Run away
lightly with O5.  You may get to attack these later, but save your own stones first.]
;W[pl];B[lr]C[A stone aimed at giving me the ability to play on the outside...

RickMott: Better to run with your weak group.  Your last two plays have the effect of making white
much stronger near your weak group in the lower right.];W[lq]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[ks];W[mr];B[ls];W[js];B[is];W[ms];B[js];W[jq]
C[RickMott: In return for a few points on the bottom, you've given white sente to attack your
weak group.  If white plays O6, I don't think you can save it.]
;B[iq]C[Which ridiculously fails.  Is there something I should be keeping in mind as far as plays on the inside go?  I've had it work before, but not with any consistancy.

RickMott: The key is to remember that this kind of sequence is an end-game play.  Worry about your
weak groups first!  Your lower right group has no eye space, and is about to be enclosed.  You
should not have started this in the first place.];W[nn]C[RickMott: This is huge for white, worth much more than the handful of points you got at the bottom.
I don't think this group can be saved.  The best you can do is to play something like J6 and try for
a big territory in the lower left as compensation.]
(;B[rl]C[RickMott: There's no way you can make two eyes inside.  If you're going to fight here, the only chance you
have is to try cutting off white's three stones in the right center.  I don't think you can do it, though.  See
variation.];W[rk];B[qm];W[sl]C[RickMott: This is a mistake for white.  He should not allow you to start a ko; if he just connects at R9, you
can only make one eye.];B[sm];W[rm]C[Ah, the awful ko.  Let's watch as I tear myself to shreds on the right side.

RickMott: Even if you could win the ko, you don't have two eyes.  So why
fight the ko?];B[mp];W[mq];B[rl]C[RickMott: The peep was a good idea, but don't take the ko now.  Maybe you can escape!  How about
trying O4?];W[qk];B[sk];W[sj]C[RickMott: Bad move for white!  He should just extend along the 2nd line at S10.  Now you have a
chance to make this a real ko for the life of your group by cutting at S10.]
;B[rj]C[Too greedy!  I could just fill instead, though I'm not sure it would do the trick.

RickMott: No this is absolutely correct.  If you can win this new ko, you're ahead in the game.
Even if you don't, you should get something out of it now.]
;W[sl];B[de]C[RickMott: Good choice.  Not only is this a valid threat, it strengthens you locally and saves a stone that white
could otherwise capture.];W[dd];B[sk];W[gb];B[gc]C[RickMott: I think white's threat is not big enough.  Play T11 now, and let white take your three stones.
Then try to run out with your top center group by playing L12 etc.  Once your lower right group is
alive, you may have a chance to attack white's center-right stones.

If you are going to answer at all, G17 is bad; it gives white several more ko threats in this area.
Consider H16 instead, which threatens to cut off white's 5-stone group on the next move.]
;W[sl];B[bh]C[RickMott: B14 is probably better, because it gives you another threat later.]
;W[rm]C[RickMott: White should just connect at T9.  Taking this ko is wrong.  You have no eyes.]
;B[bg]C[RickMott: This is big, though.  You get a lot on the left side, at least 20 points.]
;W[ri]C[And now my right side is under attack...

... RickMott: So start building up the left, where you took your compensation.  Play somewhere in the J line;
probably J7 or J8.];B[qj]C[RickMott: Not the biggest area.  Even if you were going to play on the right, atari at S12 instead to
protect as much of your corner as possible.];W[rh]C[RickMott: If you had played here first, white would have gotten one or two stones (4 points).  This way,
he takes 10 or more points from you.];B[qh];W[rg];B[qg];W[oh]
C[And my right side is gone as is all influence from the wall I just built.

RickMott: But you haven't lost yet, and you have sente.  Start with securing your top
group with H16; white will almost certainly respond with H15.  Then play J6, J7 or
J8, as we discussed earlier.  The main battle line in this game is now the boundary
between the black moyo in the lower left and the white one in the lower right.]
;B[oj]C[RickMott: Not the most important area now.  Save the reducing moves for later.]
;W[fc];B[ga]C[RickMott: Better to connect at H17 and take on the next move.  This allows white to make trouble by
playing there himself.  That could become a ko for the life of your group.]
;W[eb];B[hc]C[RickMott: But he let you get away with it.  This move would be much better at H16 now, threatening to cut white.]
;W[cq];B[dq]C[RickMott: Ouch!  Wrong side!  It's very important that your strong wall face the stones
you must capture.  This gives white a chance to really make trouble.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn]C[RickMott: You should hane at B6 and make a tiger's mouth here.  No need to give white this much.]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[br];B[dr]C[RickMott: Not a big move, and gives up sente.  You must play along the J line to establish your
moyo and press on white's potential boundary.];W[bs];B[np]C[RickMott: This is not the right way to use any remaining aji in these stones.  You can't possibly live insde,
so save the threat to connect out as a way to reduce white's moyo after establishing the fighting line at J.
White can even ignore this entirely.];W[ln]C[RickMott: This move should be at least 2 lines further, at K6, but in any event the result of this exchange is
to make white stronger without helping you at all.];B[no];W[mn]
;B[on]C[RickMott: Oh, boy!  You made an eye.  Oh, wait.... you need two...]
;W[sn]C[RickMott: Killing a dead group.  Whoever notices that first and plays on the J line will have a big edge.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[ro];W[qp];B[pq]
(;W[so]C[RickMott: Terrible error for white!   He means to connect, but now you can live, which is a 30-point
swing in the score.  He should play atari at Q5 to kill.  See variation.]
;B[qo]C[RickMott: The only play to live.  Good job.];W[sp]C[RickMott: White figures out that this is the best he can do.]
;B[oo]C[Such small life, and white connects in the meantime.

RickMott: Be grateful he let you live!  He shouldn't have.  Now your chances in this game look pretty good.

Let's look at the balance of territory.  White has three corners.  His lower corners are not large, thanks to
a misreading that let you live in the lower right.  The upper left and lower right are both about 15 points;
the lower left is 5 or 6 points, max.  So give him 36 points of settled territory, plus a couple for the group
around O15.  That won't be much, so make the whole thing 40 points.

Your upper right corner is only worth around 10 points, because white can reduce it with a monkey
jump from either side.  The bottom center is worth about 10 as it stands.  The left side should be at
least 20 points, with the capture of white's stones (note: this is not guaranteed -- we'll get back to this).

So on (mostly) settled territory, it's an even game, but you have better chances with your center-left
moyo than white does in the center right; your are poking into the middle of his moyo from two sides
(top and right).

Now, back to the issue of white's five stones on the left side.  B14 is a critical point for both sides.
If white plays there, he can connect to his three stones around B10.  If you play there, you capture
the stones and threaten to capture B15 also.  So although it doesn't look like much, B14 creates
an 18 or 20 point swing in the score.  You must balance that against what you can gain by making
the left-center moyo bigger.  20 points is a lot at this stage of the game, though.]
;W[hn]C[Now I'm stuck again...  I have absolutely no idea where to play.

RickMott: As I said last move, B14 takes secure territory.  I'd play there first.
H9 is also a possibility -- mutual destruction, threaten to jump into white's
moyo also.  Cutting white apart with K6, or even a contact play at J6 followed
by a cross-cut, would be playable.  This is really an overplay by white; he
shouldn't jump in so far.];B[gl]C[I felt nothing at all about this move.  It didn't do me any good in the end.

RickMott: It's not bad; you should follow up at H10.];W[ip]
;B[hq];W[fn];B[il]C[RickMott: I would start with H10 instead, and at least make a little territory before reducing.]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[bf]C[RickMott: Ouch.  White found this one first.]
;B[cf];W[ag];B[dg];W[ah]C[And I lose more territory to a connection I didn't see before...  Maybe I need to force myself to read all surrounding groups for connections as well?  I don't see many problems that deal with this type of thing.

RickMott: Go to www.yutopian.com/go and buy "The Art of Cutting and Connecting" for many useful problems.
Now, where can we use sente best?  You could use H11 to make territory.  Or you could jump out at L12 to
reduce.  Or you could spoil the bamboo joint at F7.  Or you could peep at K5  to start a fight; white's stones
are a little loose in this area.  You can try to cut off either the three stones above and to the left, or the three
stones in a line above right.];B[jn]C[RickMott: Ok, this is a reasonable idea.]
;W[io];B[ko]C[RickMott: Good followup.];W[jp]
(;B[lo]C[RickMott: This one isn't right, though.  You don't need to connect, because you can always connect either
here or at K7.  Now is the time to cut white at O7.  See variation.]
;W[ml]C[RickMott: Now you have no chance to attack white's 3 stones.]
;B[nk]C[RickMott: What does this peep do for you?  Why not take some actual territory with S14 or H11?]
;W[nl];B[lj]C[RickMott: Reducing is a good idea, but you have a weakness from the atari at P9 and you have two other
ways to reduce this area.  I would take territory.];W[nc];B[ob]
;W[mi];B[kh];W[li];B[ki];W[mj];B[mk];W[lg];B[lh];W[mh];B[le]
;W[me];B[lf];W[kg];B[jg]C[RickMott: Ouch.  This cut is not meaningful.  You need to protect your stones at L9.]
;W[kj];B[kf];W[jj];B[lk]C[RickMott: I would take the two stones at N13.  You'll get some sente plays out of it.]
;W[mg];B[jh]C[RickMott: In this sequence, white gets sente.  You needed to keep sente in order to secure some territory.]
;W[ii];B[mb]C[RickMott: Not the biggest area.  S14 is worth more.  So are G11 and maybe C9.]
;W[nb];B[la]C[RickMott: Hane from this side will cost you a couple of points in the corner.]
;W[na];B[ma];W[ka];B[ja];W[mc];B[ka]C[Well, I'm not exactly sure where I am now...  By the way, I can't figure out why white keeps throwing in on the first line.  It doesn't seem to be very useful.]
;W[oa];B[pb];W[pa];B[qa]C[RickMott:  Basically, this whole sequence was misguided.  Again, you lose sente.]
;W[rb];B[qb];W[sd]C[And there goes even more territory.  I'm very aggravated at this point.

RickMott: Understandable, but the endgame is one place where a little learning can gain you a lot of
points.  You need to learn (a) how to manage sente much better, (b) how to count up endgame move
values.  I recommend Janice Kim's "Learn to Play Go, V5: Palace of Memory".  It's pretty good overall,
but the last quarter of the book is devoted to endgame analysis.  It's made a big difference in my own
game to train my eye to see endgame moves that don't look like much but are actually very valuable.]
;B[kl];W[rd];B[qd];W[ok]C[And now I see my connection is destroyed...

RickMott: but this is a small move for white.  He can't prevent you from making your second eye.
You can ignore this and make territory at our old friends G11 or F7.]

;B[go];W[gn];B[fo];W[fk]C[RickMott: this looks like an overplay, but I'm not sure how to handle it.]
;B[ek];W[fl];B[em]C[RickMott: I like this better at E6, where it takes a couple of points and still threatens the cut.]

;W[eo];B[ep];W[hs];B[ir];W[nj]
(;B[og]C[RickMott: This worked out well, but I think you could get the same effect without sacrificing this stone by
playing Q12 directly.  Then you have the option of either P11 to save the stone, or making this move if
white takes at P11.  White can't cut you.  See variation.];W[pg]
;B[ph];W[of];B[oi];W[nh]C[RickMott: I'm wrong, this is actually 1 point better (white only has 6 including the capture).]

;B[fa];W[kc];B[jd];W[kn];B[jo];W[fj]C[RickMott: This is dangerous because F7 is no longer sente for you to connect.  You have to protect your weak
connecttions around K8.];B[gk];W[jl]C[RickMott: Ouch.  You're going to lose something here on one side or the other.]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[jm];W[ll];B[km]C[And after losing yet another group that had its connection severed I do a quick count in my head, surmise that I lost a while ago, and really ought to stop playing.  I still don't see how white came up with half of his moves, and because of that, I'm at a loss as to how to improve from this game.

I'm not sure if white was throwing off overplay after overplay and I didn't know how to respond, or I was simply too timid, or made bad decisions, or am thinking about the whole board the wrong way, or all of the above...  Again, any comments are welcome.  Thanks for taking your time to review my game.

RickMott: If I try to summarize what you need to work on most, it's focussing on cuts and connections, and finishing
boundaries before moving elsewhere.  You tend to invade too much, perhaps; look for moves which strengthen
your position as well as weakening your opponent.  Invasions almost always cost you sente in the end, and sente
is very valuable.  Don't invade small to take away a few points; only invade to destroy a really big moyo.  Also, you
need to work on reading in the endgame, both for sente and to find the biggest moves.  The endgame is where
things simplify enough that you can actually apply a fairly brute force analysis, border by border.

Good luck!
