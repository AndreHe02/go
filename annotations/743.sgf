C[DRS: I am "sencha", the player with the black stones.  It seems like things mostly went my way in this game, and yet I still lost by a small amount.

All my (the reviewers) comments are preceded by the tag [orionsky\] to indicate it is me writing.]

DRS: I've been experimenting with this opening lately, mostly just because Cho Chikun played it in a lot of his games.  Any insights into how to use this would be appreciated.

[orionsky\]:
The basic idea with this opening is to pincer any approach stone played on the right side. If white plays two similar approach moves against the black corners, black gets a good position with this strategy. However, things are unlikely to develop so peacefully...]
;W[dp];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr]C[[orionsky\]:
This move usually not good since afterwards, black cannot enter at 3-3 anymore. The position is settled where it need not have been, destroying aji.]
;W[cq];B[iq]TR[dr][cq]LB[jp:a]C[[orionsky\]:
Without the marked exchange (d2, c3) black could play at a (k4) getting a higher position which would work better with a pincer on the right. Furthermore all black stones on the lower side are on the third line or even below!]
;W[ci]LB[cj:a]C[[orionsky\]:
Strange shape, better at a (c10) or b (d10)];B[jc]C[[orionsky\]:
Hm, all stones on the third line - this will lead to a disadvantage when the fighting starts.]
;W[pe];B[ph];W[oc];B[ob];W[od];B[nc]LB[nb:a]C[DRS: Joseki?

[orionsky\]:
Just extending at a (O18) is better since the ladder shown in the variation is bad for black.]

(;W[nb]C[[orionsky\]:
Fortunately white cuts on the wrong side. Taking territory is not so important at the moment.]
;B[mb];W[pb];B[na];W[qc];B[qk];W[qo]C[[orionsky\]:
This should become difficult for white, he doesn't have enough space to form a base so he should try to escape into the center but that would be easier if he played this stone on the fourth line.]

;W[qr];B[po]C[[orionsky\]:
Aji keshi.];W[qp];B[mq]LB[nq:a]C[[orionsky\]:
Bad shape. When you want to defend, then do this thouroughly with a play at a(O3).]
;W[qm];B[pl]C[[orionsky\]:
Hm, this will give black bad shape again.];W[pm];B[om];W[ol]
;B[pn]LB[nm:a]TR[ol]C[[orionsky\]:
Aji keshi (this waists a ko threat). Better extend at a (O7) to presure the marked stone more effictively and prevent a white atari there.]
;W[qn];B[df]LB[cl:a]C[[orionsky\]:
Difficult, I would rather play at a (c8) to exploit white's overextension there and leave the upper left corner open for an invasion at 3-3.]
;W[fc];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[bc];B[dl]C[[orionsky\]:
Bad, now white will cut black into two unsettled groups. Black should not play so impatiently, he is not too much behind.]
;W[ei];B[ff];W[cr];B[fl];W[fo];B[in];W[nm];B[on];W[ok]C[[orionsky\]:
This sequence was played too early (the marked white stones on the left are still unsettled) but it shows how bad black's shape in this area is. Now the black group on the right side might get into serious trouble.]
;B[hf]LB[nl:a]C[DRS: Appropriate ladder breaker?

[orionsky\]:
Hm?? Which ladder do you mean? Cutting at a (O8) is the only ladder I can see, but playing there means taking territory. This is not important when there are so many weak groups on the board. Better attack/defend and leave this cut for later.]
;W[gi];B[nl];W[ii];B[ml]LB[qj:a]C[[orionsky\]:
White a (R 10) captures the cutting stone.]

;W[ql];B[pi];W[pk];B[oj];W[pj];B[nk];W[qi]LB[ck:a]C[[orionsky\]:
All in all this is ok for black, the game is now staged on how white handles his four stones on the left.
With black I would probably attack at a (C9), which also helps black to get eyespace on the edge.]
;B[jk]C[[orionsky\]:
This is too much concerned about territory, the key to a successful attack is to reduce the opponent's eyespace.]
;W[hk];B[gm];W[hm];B[hn];W[gl];B[fn];W[fk]C[DRS: Mistake?  W should E7?

[orionsky\]:
E7 is an all-out move. If white doesn't fall behind with his move its ok.]

[orionsky\]:
Yes, much to timid. Please see varition for the previous move.]
