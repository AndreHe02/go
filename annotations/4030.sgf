AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hi, I am playing black and would be thankful for hints in every part of the game. I am especially interestet in your ideas on how to save the big group in der center and right part of the board.

Thank you very much for your help!

Chris: Hi Carsten,
Let me point out a few fundamental flaws in your game and some generic comments about handicap games. 
1.) You are not using your stones to your advantage. Stones need a purpose; this does not mean they have to be saved. You have to decide what to save and use your friendly surrounding stones to accomplish that target.
2.) Your plans are not very flexible enough. This is also a result from point #1. Every now and then, preferably after a local exchange, you should evaluate the board. Where are the weak groups? Where can you take profit? Where can you make a moyo? How can you attack/be attacked? If you fix your mind on accomplishing only one target, you are bound to fail 90% of the time, as the board might change rapidly after a local fight.
3.) The most important part of becoming stronger is reading. This is true for you, me and also that 4d at my club.

I would suggest, if you want to become stronger, to solve easy reading problems, that you can solve in maybe 30 seconds. Solve them more than once, so if a similar position occurs, you can identify the vital points more easily, or if the same positon occurs, even dont have to read at all.
The second thing I can recommend is getting somebody slightly stronger than you, maybe 3 stones, to play you regularly. Slowly you will adopt the more successful style and ideas of that player.
Apart from that getting games commented is probably always a good idea, but only if you know your own game well. This means that you dont just say during the review "ahh yes i should have seen that" but recognise positions, where you made the same mistake, and eventually completely get rid of that mistake.

About Handicap Games: You have probably already heard about handicap stones being fighting stones. What does this mean? In every corner the 3-3 point is open to invasion, hence the star points dont surround terretory! Also consider White having a weak group anywhere on the board. Where can White run to? Nowhere! Black is already everywhere on the board. It is probably best to not really think about handicap stones too much and just play your game. If the time comes, they will be there to help you.

Lets look at the game now.];W[qn];B[nq];W[qf];B[nd];W[nj]C[How to defend against this attack? In 6-stone-handicap-games it happens too often... and I get problems to save my handicap-stone.

Chris: You can see big gaps between the white stones and strong black groups on the top and bottom. The idea is to separate white one way or another now.]

(;B[mb]LB[qf:3]C[Chris: What is the meaning of this move? Now would be a good time to look at the board and discover that W3 has little places to run to. You should use that to your advantage and get the corner terretory and life in the corner.]
;W[lb];B[mc]LB[mc:20]C[Chris: Do you think the corner is terretory now? Think again. As I said in the beginning, star points make securing terretory not easy. I will put down 2 variations one for white making life, one for invading the corner. Consider the variation I gave earlier how to protect against this. Here it is not a single move that was wrong, but rather the idea that you get the corner terretory by closing it off with black 20]

(;W[fd]C[Chris: White has thickness here. Why start a fight? I would rather take a lot of points now.]

(;B[kd];W[ld];B[gc];W[fc]C[Chris: The difference here to the variation I showed was that Black is weaker on the top left. The more Black fights now in between Whites groups, the more his corner will suffer...]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[df]LB[kd:A][ld:B]C[Chris: Now there are a lot more Black stones on the top and it would be much more painful to sacrifice them if you need to. A genereal idea you have to adopt is to retain this possibilty. You saw that there is probably enough space for Black to live, but you did not see that by doing that, you made your life more difficult. 
In the same context consider the peep A and connect at B. Black could have cut beforehand, but now this option is gone. Ask yourself, was it worth that?]

(;B[gj];W[hj];B[fj];W[hc];B[gb];W[hb];B[ei];W[jf];B[jj]TR[jc]
[kd]C[Chris: The result here is not too bad. The only problem I see is that White captured the 2 marked stones. It is not the terretory here that is the problem. It is rather that now this group is alive! If you could have chased it for only 1 move, you might have made the whole right side Black, not to mention future attacks, that give you even more somewhere else on the board. It seems to be a common mistake to underestimate the point value a weak group is. Imagine a game where you could take all the terretory you have in sente. Wouldnt that be great? How much other possibilities might you use then?]

;W[fq]C[Can I kill the white group in the upper left corner? D18 and A18? 

Chris: You can see you have a lot of thickness just above the white stone. The correct direction of play would be a pincer here, since it denies white to make life easily without being shut in.]

(;B[dq];W[iq]LB[cn:A]C[Chris: Now white has a solid base to work from. If he gets a little stronger, a move at A could cause Black a headache, as it would be very difficult to answer.]

[gr][gs][hr][hs]C[All the time I thought I could kill the white group - but now it changed.

I think I play to agressive - by the way I think I am leading with a lot of points: 40 or 50 in the left part and 10 - 15 in the upper and lower right --- and white has only the small group in the upper middle and in the center and around the just played stone. I think black leads with 70 to 40.

Am I right?

Chris: I marked the prospective terretory for both players. So yes Black is ahead by lots. What do you do when you are ahead? You play solid! This is a very very important concept to grasp. Do not leave cutting points. Do not attack unless you have to. Do not create weak groups among yourself. Protect terretory. Make moyos into terretory. Generally keep things simple. Why give yourself a chance to make a mistake, when you are leading?]

1.) Keep your opponent from making a base along the side or in the corners.
2.) Make the opponents eyespace small. (Peep, Hane, etc)

Chris: The answer is again: reading. I guess you should get a good tsumego collection. I personally like Cho Chikuns old dos program "Dictionary of Life and Death". There is a script on senseis library that converts these problems to sgf, so you can use them with your favourite go problem program (I like GoGrinder). A good book with 200+ problems would be good too.]

(;B[bf]C[Chris: This might be enough. This clearly shows that your reading is weak. If you are attacking or defending close quarters, of course you have to be able to read 4 or 5 moves ahead. Try it on this position maybe. 

I have seem many players, who are unable to or just too lazy to read, so they start defening an ultra strong position like this with further moves. That is *not* the right way to go. I assume you judged correctly that Black is very very strong at this part of the board, so an invasion *should* not succeed. This judgement is absolutely right. Now you only have to learn to read enough to kill an overplay like this.]
