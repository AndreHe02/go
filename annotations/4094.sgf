C[Hi , in this game i am black, i think that white went easy on me but can anyone give me a review of this game? i will really appreciate it.

Black took a lot of chances in this game; white did not punish sufficiently.  

Both sides played very slowly.  Often ignoring big plays to make tiny moves that might well have been ignored by the other.

The opening is very unusual, with urgent plays being ignored by both sides; I found that this made reviewing the game more challenging.  I hope that I managed to do a decent job of it.  
In general, I have not followed with long variations, instead I have tried to focus on particular moves.  In some cases, where I have made a long variation, this is only to demonstrate one possible outcome.  The initial move is the important thing to consider.

Sometimes I took the liberty to make alternate moves for white.  In most cases, I did this to try and demonstrate why black's move is inferior to alternative choices.]

oblivion: hi];B[pp];W[dp];B[dj];W[cm];B[dq]C[Too early for a probe like this.  Black can successfully invade the corner, but white will be left with strong outside influence.  The result will likely leave black's Q4 stone weakened.]

(;B[md]LB[kc:B][rd:A]C[this move seems questionable to me (N16).  It is too far away from Q16 to help the corner, too far from R13 to put any pressure on white's weak stone, and too high to make any side territory.  white L17 would be a frustration for black.]

(;W[rd];B[qc];W[qj]LB[rc:B][qe:A]C[B is better.  It defends the corner and is sente.]

(;B[qe];W[re]C[R15 has only reduced white by 2 points.];B[rf]
C[bad, white will cut and kill this stone.];W[qf];B[jc]C[an urgent move for black.  Good choice I think.
Although something on the bottom might be bigger.];W[rc];B[qb]
;W[rb];B[qk];W[pj]LB[cc:B][jj:A][ok:C][pk:D][kq:E]C[in the Game black chose A, but there are many bigger, more urgent choices than this point.

B.  This corner is still open, black could steal in and get life or a ko-for-life.

C or D. a defensive move around here is pretty big.  if black does nothing, white Q9 would be painful.

E.  Weak Black group.  This group would be  hard to kill, but relatively simple to press down and seal in I think.  So black should help this group some how.  E is tempting, since it makes more eye-space for the group and puts pressure on white's weak group.


and here is a good time to consider "flow."  Moves B,D, E all are sente, which is the most urgent?  B seems biggest, if white get's a chance, he should help his corner, now that black is pressing the corner on both sides.]

(;B[jj];W[fl]LB[en:A][fn:B]C[Notice how F8 has not affected the large moves that black had before.  F8 is not much pressure on black anywhere.  So it's time for a big move.  Like the previous ones identified.]
