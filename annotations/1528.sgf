C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.

It seems as though no matter what I try, I fall very far behind
very early on in the game, and I don't have any idea where I'm
going wrong.

I find that most of the time I play, I end up thinking about
advice that stronger players have given to me.  As a result,
I end up rejecting moves, thinking, "If I play here, a stronger
play will criticize it for such-and-such a reason".  But that
doesn't actually help me to come up with the right move, or why
some partiular move is even a good move.  Indeed, the moves that
that I *do* think are good moves (like my pincer attacks in this
game) end up leaving me with weak positions.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger (Fedya on KGS)


Hi Ted,

I'll do my best!!

I'll just comment on the fuseki then. There is a good book called
501 Opening Problems published by Kiseido that is very good on
the basic principles of the opening.

In this game you're comments show a good understanding of the
game. I think white looses because he doesn't recognise the significance
of weak groups and doesn't attack them for his own advantage.
I have shown you some ways I would have played this game.

Please get back to me if you have any further questions

Robin Hobbes  (Robin on IGS)];B[pp];W[dd]
(;B[pd];W[dq]C[Ted: I wonder whether I should have played around R10 immediately
to prevent Black from getting a good framework.  Stronger players
have told me that's not necessary, but every time my opponent
gets a framework on the side like that (say, by playing sanrensei
or the Chinese fuseki), I find it very difficult to invade and
get anything out of it.

I think it is too early to play r or q 10. If your oponent gets
a sanrensei then one way to counteract it is to make sure you
have thickness oposite it so you can then easily invade and escape.
The thing to remeber with any large framework is that it has
to be shared .. the judgement is in deciding when to move in.

I also do not like playing against the chinese opening so I always
play against the 4/3 stone. Normally q5 .. see the variation]
;B[co]
(;W[cm]C[Ted: I've had a number of stronger players tell me I need to
play more "dual purpose" moves.  This is a specific example of
such a move one of them suggested: the C7 stone is supposed to
serve both as a pincer attack on the C5 stone, and as an extension
from the D16 stone.  For some reason, when I try it, however,
the result is near-immediate disaster.  I quickly ended up with
weak groups at the bottom, and on the left side.


This is a fine move .. see variation for another possibilty ..
however if you pincer that you will have a fight so it is worth
doing if you like to develop that style of play. The variation
shows a way of responding that is more territory orientated]
;B[eo]
(;W[fq]C[I think f3 is a bit slow. You want to respond from the weakest
side so f is the right direction to play. But you want to move
either as far as you safely can to get a larger framework or
to move in a way that you think your oponent must respond. See
variation];B[bq]
(;W[cj]C[Ted: I took a lot of time to think about this move.  Clearly,
I can't sacrifice the C7 stone -- otherwise, there's no point
in playing a pincer attack.  On the other hand, I've had a lot
of similar positions where I end up with a weak group on the
bottom after my opponent plays something like K3.

This is the problem with f3 because now black can attack f3 group.
It is a difficult choice for white I think];B[pj]C[In the fuseki you want to try to not have a weak group as it
can be attacked and then your oponent builds territory. So what
options does white have here. Is there a weak group white can
attack .. there is but it is not very weak. So one possibilty
is to attakce that group from two places e7 or g5. e7 helps white
build a moyo but further weakens f3 group. g5 means black has
to play c2 to live or run out towards wher white is strong ..
not a good idea. Alternatively white can build a moyo by playing
around k16. o3 looks a possibilty if black doesnt pincer but
if he does you have two weak groups o3 and f3 .. you want to
avoid this whenever possible. I think I would play g5 see varaiation]

(;W[nq]C[Ted: Again, I thought for quite some time about what the best
way would be to deal with Black's framework on the right side.
I considered invading at R6, but when I invade, I seem to end
up with a weak group while my opponent gets a great position.
So I tried the approach instead, especially because I figured
it would go well with the two stones at D/F3.

See variation];B[lq]C[Ted: My opponent plays a pincer attack and ends up with a good
position.  When I play a pincer attack, I don't end up with a
good position.


Yes well the problem here is that f3 weak group];W[no];B[pn]

(;W[iq]C[Ted: I felt this served as both an extenstion from the D/F3 stones,
and a pincer attack on M3.  But, it doesn't work out that way
for me.

This seems to help black in a way as he now puts pressure on
your two stones];B[lo]C[White must move out .. separate black]

(;W[pr];B[qq];W[qr];B[fc];W[dc];B[jd]
(;W[qc]TR[hc][ld][nc][qf][qj][ql][pl]C[Ted: I felt I had to do something to stop Black from getting
a huge moyo.  I'm already in some difficulty with a weak group
in the bottom right.  Also, in situations like this, when my
opponent invades a corner like this, I end up with thickness
that's of no use, so I figured my opponent wouldn't be able to
use the thickness either.

Looking at the situation white has two weak groups and black
has two weak groups. There are a number of weak points in blacks
position - marked on the board and you can always invade in them.
I think I would attack black at this point in order to strenghten
one of my weak groups and then invade blacks moyo .. see variation]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd]C[See variation]

(;W[sb];B[cf]
(;W[ce]C[Ted: I don't know what I should have played here.  In this sequence,
I don't think I got anything good out of it.

No it is better to play on the top as h17 is a significant weak
point in blacks shape and you can threaten it .. see variation]
;B[df];W[rq]TR[qj][pi][ql][lq][lo][bq][eo][co]C[Ted: Would B15 or C12 have been better here?  The problem is
that I feel I already have multiple weak groups, while I really
can't find any weaknesses Black has, except for possibly the
group at the bottom left.


\I have marked the weaknesses I see in black here - I would attacke
the groups as I suggested earlier];B[rp];W[rr];B[ci];W[dj];B[di]
;W[ej];B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[cd];B[bf]
(;W[bb]C[Ted: I hated having to play this move, but remembered the proverb
about urgent moves before big moves.  Clearly I have to do something
to make certain I don't get killed in the corner.

I agree];B[fe];W[go]C[Ted: This was a case of not knowing what to do.  I figured putting
some pressure on the bottom left group was a good idea.

Yes this is a good move];B[bn];W[bm];B[cq];W[mc]C[Ted: Another case where I thought for a long time.  I concluded
that there was no way I could kill the Black group in the bottom
left, so I'd better do something that gets me territory.

I think this is a good move but m3 group is better];B[md]
(;W[lc];B[kc];W[ld];B[nd];W[nm]C[Ted: For some reason, Black looks even stronger than when I played
N17.  But I couldn't see any place to invade and make a living
group.

[al:E][ap:D][gr:I][kr:A][qs:B]C[Ted: I really had no idea what to do here.  I have a feeling
the game is already lost, though:

Black is equal with White at the bottom (A vs. B); Black's left
side is equal to White's left side (C and D vs. E and F); and
the territory Black has on the right side and top is much more
than White can get anywhere else (G and H vs. I and J).


Yes I agree it is very difficult now for white];B[gl];W[fl]
;B[hk];W[kd]C[Ted: I spent an inordinately long time on this move as well.
I'm not certain why.  But I think it has the benefits of forcing
Black to respond at the top, which makes it sente; at the same
time it keeps Black from the peep at M15.];B[jc];W[je];B[ie]

;W[js]TR[pk]C[Ted: You're probably going to criticize this for being an endgame
move, but I figured this move is sente, and much better than
allowing Black to play J1.

almost complete, and I can't find any way to catch up.  I count
about 60 points for White (including the komi), while Black has
at least 80.  Did I resign too early?

No I think you chose correctly to resign.])
