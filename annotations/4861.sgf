C[Brenno: This is the most recent game I have played against a friend of mine to whom I taught go. We have been playing go for about three months now. Given that I am the only person he plays against, and since we only play one game a week, his progress has been very fast: we are playing even games (I am roughly 15k on KGS), and in this game I managed to win by only 3 and a half points. Would it be possible to say that we are both the same level? Or were my moves of a level below 15k?

Throughout the game I made some comments and asked some questions. Apart from that, if you could help me see where the biggest moves were (especially when we missed them), as well as when to tenuki, that will be very helpful. I find I have a hard time both detecting the biggest plays and ignoring a local play in order to play something bigger somewhere else.

Any general comments on tactics and strategy would be much welcome as well.

*: All my comments will start with "*".  I am not going to judge you to say you were playing at 15k or not, I am only 4K myself.  I generally play on IGS and at the local go club only.  I will comment in the on move per move basis.

That is I will not look ahead to see if you did something I am thinking right now (for both sides).  This will teach you the timing of your moves, even if you got the move I got it might be too late or too early.  

Big challange in the game is getting the timing right, if you play a stone too soon, it's meaningless, if you play it too late it's meaningless.  Because playing it soon, your opponent can tenuki.  Playing it late, has no value to you.

I will try to answer your questions to best of my ability.

I used MultiGO editor to make the comments.

*: 1st run: I went through the game on a quick look, and saw lots of shape issues.  For both sides, both sides were rushing alot of critical areas.  Have to play more carefully in these areas.]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[po];W[ce];B[eq];W[oc];B[pe]C[*: Another possibility for Q15, is K3.  This exact pattern up to 8 has been played in 33 games, and K3 and Q15 are the two most played moves.

*: I would personally like Q15 because you don't want white to push you down at Q15.]
;W[pc]TR[qg][qm][gq][mq]LB[qj:1][nd:2][jq:3][pj:4][oe:5]C[*: This is a strange move ...  The right side pattern been only played 9 times (excluding #10).  But #10 never has been an answer in pro games.  In the 1997 game Cho Chikun played Q10 as a response to #9.  Which I agree with more then #10.  However there are other possibilities.

*: The numbers are arranged in order of frequency they were played.  So lets look at two possibilities, 1 and 3 in comparison to #10.

*: #10 stops black from making a strong shape at Q17, black might also lose the corner.  #10 makes white a bit stronger, but at same time makes white heavy.  This early in game this is not good.  You should play solid but when you play this solid on move #10 it can be a painfully slow game.

*: #1 now creates miai at R13 and R7.  You are asking black to choose which is important, and at same time making sure black doesn't get a huge side.

*: #3 again makes miai at G3 and N3.  But this time it also acts as a pincer against E3, not a very strong one but black has to decide its fate now.

*: I would play 1 as trying to brake into someone's moyo later in game becomes a death match, best to avoide those :).]
;B[qc];W[pg];B[qi]C[*: This is a bad move, you are asking white to split you with R14.

*: This exact pattern for the top right corner only showed up once in pro games.  And pro's answer to #12 was at O15.

*: The reason you want to play O15 is, it gets you out into center, and makes it hard for white to link up P17 group and Q13.  You might be able to have a two attacks going at onces.  And when that heppens you will usually end up gaining something.]
;W[qf]C[Q: I found move #14 by W particularly effective in splitting B's group from R11.  Was B's pincer at R11 a bad move? How should B have dealt with W's Q13 in the first place?

*: Look at previous comments.];B[jd]C[Q: should B have played locally instead of tenuking at 15?

*: Yes O15 is important!!! You might get sealed in, which would be bad for your group, they are not light.

*: Remeber 1 stone is light, 2 stones is HEAVY.  You almost never want to abandon a heavy group.

*: In this case this would be too big for white, he messed up your side and gets the corner how is that fare exchange?]
;W[qe];B[pd];W[rd];B[iq]C[*: Rushed.  You have to play O15!!!]

(;W[cm]C[*: Not a serious mistake but white should captalized on blacks mistake and attack at O15.  This will cause black problems by having to deal with two groups.  And white gets to have a huge influce.]
;B[pf];W[ph]C[*: This doesn't make good shape.  With R11, S12 sticks out like soure thump.  R13 is better shape here.]
;B[pi]
(;W[qh]TR[pg][ph]C[*: Bad shape.  This makes an empty triangle, 8/10 times this is considered bad.  Better move for white is S12.

*: It is a key shape move, and also grantees you safty.]
(;B[gd]C[Q: 25 to N16? O16?

*: I think that is the right direction, because of your stones at Q16, you should use them to attack P17 group.

*: Look at my example for one possibility, my recommendation O16.]
;W[ld]
(;B[rg]C[Q: How should have B played here in order to use/save  his wall? 27 proved to be a total failure.

*: I think 27 is nice idea, but your wall is getting very weak.  So you should make that strong before launching an attack.  Please look at my example at S17.]
;W[rh];B[qg]C[*: BAD!!!! What do you hope to accomplish with this?  White is group to atari at S14.]
;W[rf];B[ri]C[*: Defending your side .. i guess thats okay but the price was not right.  You are losing ground fast, you have to make it up before white gets stronger, you haven't touched the left side at all.  You should start your attack there.  #31, should be at C13.]
;W[ne]C[*: This HURTS!  And with black making White's group on right Urber strong, S17 has lost 100% of it's affect.  Black's group is in serious trouble.  There is no easy way to save that group, you can run around and probably save it, but the cost will be high.

*: but at same time you can't abandon it, because then white gets at least 25 points.  So look at my example starting at S17.]

(;B[og];W[oh];B[of];W[ng]C[Q: At this point I thought that instead of saving the wall, I should rather come out of it with a strong wall on the outside. However, this fight and the dead black stones cost me about 15-20 points and nearly cost me the game. How could B have come out with a better result?

*: Don't abandon soo many stones?  If you don't have a solution to the problem sometimes coming black to it later helps.  So so intead of investing stone after stone into it, go do something else, you had the whole board to play on.  And come back later to this.

*: And when you come back maybe the local position would have changed to your favor.

*: Maybe white will ignore your tenuki and play O14, that can't be helped you are in trouble.  But you will get one free move.  So make most of it.

*: But this costed you more then 20 points, this was worth at least 30-35 points.  This is a way to save it.  Please look at my example.]
;B[nf];W[mf]
(;B[nh]C[*: Wrong starting point, if you want to help your group (I know you decided not to, which I don't think was right).  You should play N15 first this creates thread of double atari at N13.]
;W[mg];B[oi];W[sg];B[mh];W[kc]
(;B[jc]C[*: You are playing whites game, when are you going to play your own game?]
;W[di];B[lh]C[*: Too slow K12.];W[kf];B[if]C[Q: Any bigger moves on the board instead of 49?

*: Yes... C14.  You need to reduce white.];W[jh]C[*: I don't like this move, I understand white trying to break out.  But black has a moyo on bottom, this can help black expand it more.  White should play P3.]
;B[jg];W[kh];B[kg];W[lg];B[ih];W[hg]C[*: NOT Good. white has to defend his two stones that he played first.

*: This peep only helps white, you want to play a peep where it doesn't help black.  Black is very happy to be solid there.

*: A peep is good if black is force to play a move that he didn't want to play.  This he does .. so it loses it's meaning.  It is an earily x-mas present.

*: Always fix your own weakness before attacking your opponents.  If not they will come back to bite you. I would not play in that area right now, I would like to start with R4, P3, or even deeper with L3 or such.]
;B[ig]
(;W[ii]C[*: Another sign of good peek is it doesn't need defending.  Peeps are there to force the other player, if you have to defend your peep it doesn't hinder the other play it hinders you.  Foreget about it.]
;B[hh];W[hi];B[ji]C[Q: Should W sacrifice the stones?

*: Yes they lost all meaning ....];W[jj];B[ki]
(;W[kj]C[*: Bad shape. black is going to play M10.

*: Proverb, NEVER RUN INTO a HANE.  You never will run into a wall on purpose in real life so why do it here?  Better shape at K9.]
;B[lj]C[Q: Should W have corrected his weakness at J9 instead? (see variation)

*: Yes, but white should have played 64 at J9 to begin with look at the example.]

(;W[lk];B[mj];W[kl];B[ij];W[hj]C[*: Bad tatics, you getting strong there gets you nothing, you being string in center can help you invade the right the bottom, the possibilities are endless.  This ... ends all those endless possibilites.]
;B[ik];W[im]C[*: Wrong shape.  Shape move is K8.];B[jl];W[jm]
;B[kk];W[lm];B[mk]
(;W[ll]C[*: I understand the urge to save your stones, but white cannot let black get the entire right side.]
;B[hk]C[*: HUGE MISTAKE.  Bad direction, black should play O7 to solidfy the right.]
;W[gk]C[*: Again why defend that?

*: MISTAKE! Black made the mistake, white needs to captalize on it. Play Q7.]
;B[gh];W[il]C[*: WHy?  This just helps black ...your shape move is F11.  If anything play Q7.]
;B[jk];W[fj]C[*: Shape move is F11.];B[gi];W[gj];B[gf];W[fg]
;B[gg];W[ff];B[fe];W[ee];B[ed];W[dd]C[*: I think white should play solid at D15.]

(;B[ec]C[*: White has some weaknesses maybe take advantage of those before playing E17. Look at my example.]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[ea];B[fa];W[cb];B[ei]C[Q: by playing 101, B's plan was that W should feel tempted to connect at E10, and then Black D14. The plan didn't work as I had expected though. Was there anything to be taken out of it? Or any bigger moves on the board?

*: Well F17 is important .. look at my example to see what happens if white played there.

*: But to answer your question white doesn't have to connect .. but the better chooice is E12.  See my eailer examples.]

(;W[eh];B[ef]C[*: And bingo was his namo .. all though blacks weakness at F17 isn't nice .. this hurts white alot.  White should scarfice E15, instead of trying to defend it.  Look at my example.]

(;W[de];B[eg];W[fh];B[fi];W[dh];B[ej];W[ek];B[dj];W[cj]
(;B[dk]C[*: C9 is the right move here.  Please look at example.]
;W[cl]C[*: Mistake. White needs G7 now.]
(;B[el]C[*: Bad atari. ALWAYS atari from the side that means more. Look at example.]

White:
Left - 45

Komi: 6.5

Total: 101.5

Black: 

Top - 19
Bottom - 6
Right - 46

Total: 71

White+30.5

Black needs to do something .. maybe E6 could get you a kill but chances of that are not high.  Never assume you can kill. 

A pro said always assume you can't kill, so always try to find a way to attack the weak group to win the battle.  L4 looks nice right now.]

;W[gn];B[hn];W[gm];B[lq];W[in]C[Q: Is there any way for B to kill W's group in the middle?

*: Nope ... But you can get lots of cash by threating to kill it like N5.]
;B[nm];W[ho];B[hp];W[io];B[mo];W[jp];B[jq];W[ip];B[cr];W[dp]
;B[ep];W[si];B[sj]C[*: Mistake. Should be S10.  You don't want white to start a ko at S10.]

;W[bo];B[ml];W[as]C[*: B1 is better ..

Reasons:

1) It creates a KO, KOs area lways fun ;-)
2) It robs black of a point, now black has to fight to get it back.
3) Even if you don't get it, you might be able to use that 1/2 point ko to get something else on the board :D.]
;B[bs];W[aq];B[je];W[jf];B[tt]C[*: Interseting game to review ... 

Key lessons

1) SHAPES.  I recommend Masting the Basics, Volumn 3: Making Good Shapes by Rob van Zeijst and Richard Bozulich.

Or Shape Up! on GoBase.org

Both these books will help to improve your underastanding of shapes and thus improve your games.

2) Don't follow your opponent around the game, it did switch around a bit, but both of you played each others game, there was no trying to resist the flow of the game. That is to change the flow of the game .. it was somewhat non-dramtic.

3) Don't attack to kill, attack to gain profit.

4) Don't think you can kill, always think you can't then try to gain profit from it.

5) Timing!  The F17 weakness is there, but it's too late now white missed the chance and can't get that.

6) Don't let your opponent build such huge moyo that it becomes huge space.  Black was behind 30 points, and caught up because white let him get entire side and bottom.

7) When you have choice to atari from two sides.  Always atari from the side that has more value, so your opponent can't ignore you.

8) Never answer a move like T11 at T10, those kind of ko's are almost always BAD for the side playing T10.

9) Through out the game both sides kept finishing the bottom that is playing sequence like 96-100 right away, the timing for that is wrong.  These are called End-Game moves, and should not be played until you don't have any bigger moves to play.

10) When attacking a weakness don't follow the most obvious path, first search for a way to grantee a gain.  That is if you see two weak groups, attack in a way it attacks both groups not just one.  If you attack unprepared you might lose instead of gaining.

11) When a large group of stones is in danger don't abandom them like black did at R17.  That group costs black too much, and at later black made up for it with the bottom, but too close for comfert.

12) When trying to live, run don't walk. When you are in danger run into center, hitting the walls first will not give life.  Walls lead to death.

13) Passive defense vs. active defense.  Learn that properly I did have one example in game.  I recommend the book "Attack and Defense" to show you details of that kind of manvouring.]
