C[(I am neoKupo)  Please tell me anything you see me doing very wrong.  I tried very hard this game, so assume I thought all my moves were the best for the situation, unless I say otherwise.


LF- Hello, I am lefrog, I will tell you what I think about this game, and some moves that strike me :) My comments will be prepended with LF. 
LF - Overall, I think you're lacking in determination, in maintaining the same direction, and also, you need to take care of your weak groups. A weak group is almost always a good way for the oponent to make territory for free. so before you attack, strengthen your groups !
Let me know via email if something is not clear or needs more explanation.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[nc]LB[ce:B][de:A][cf:C]C[LF - This is one possibility, but one I wouldn't play. I tend to make a shimari looking towards my other stones, in this case, A, B or C, not looking towards the oponent's stones, as you did. A shimari is facing one direction, on must take that into account.]
;W[ce];B[cg];W[ee];B[fd];W[fe];B[gd];W[dh];B[ch];W[di]C[LF - You are pushing from behind, you are one move behind your oponent. In this situation, you have to try to jump ahead, you cannot stay behind. Jumping ahead at the first occasion, so you have to read the variations before you choose.]

(;B[ci];W[dj]
(;B[cj];W[ck];B[dg];W[eg]
(;B[df]C[LF - This is terrible. It doesn't bring you anything, and creates an empty triangle at C14 (bad shape). On top of this, you force white to strengthen himself.]
;W[de];B[ef];W[ff];B[eh];W[fg];B[dk]
(;W[fi]C[LF - White must play E9 first.];B[ek];W[fj];B[cl];W[bk]

(;B[bl]C[LF - I think you don't need to play that];W[cc]
(;B[jp]C[LF - I don't think this is bigger than R10 or E17]
;W[pj];B[qh];W[hp];B[hq];W[gq];B[iq];W[cp]LB[np:B][nq:A]C[LF - Here I think A or B are more interesting than the cut right away. Stabilizing the black group while approaching the corner is paramount.]

(;B[gp]
(;W[fp];B[go];W[fq];B[fo];W[eo];B[im]C[LF alas this is gote, and it's a moment in the game when you need sente. To put it differently, you gave up sente for too little. (one stone !)]
;W[mq]C[LF - Here is a moment where you might ask yourself what you want. THere are several alternatives, but your goal might be to enlarge your prospective territory while reducing your oponent's. I have played variaitons to show what could be done. It is a difficult moment in the game.]

(;B[ql];W[ec]C[LF - Here you have a choice. Either you let white have it and grab something from him, or you defend, but you must not end in gote.]
;B[ed];W[dd];B[fc];W[db];B[jc]LB[ie:A][hf:B]C[LF - I would rather play at A or B]
;W[qf];B[oh];W[pd]
(;B[qe]C[LF - This is playing complicated, I like the simple hane better]
;W[pe]
(;B[pf]C[LF - This is not good, I think it helps white];W[pg]
;B[of];W[qg];B[pc];W[ph];B[og];W[qi]C[LF - The invasion was a success for white]
;B[qp]LB[hf:A];W[qq]
(;B[qo]C[LF - I don't like this. You are trying to make sabaki, having a light shape, this move does not help. You must be ready to sacrifice, you are not in a black area.]
;W[po];B[pn];W[rq]
(;B[on];W[if]
(;B[lf]C[LF - This is vague. It doesn't defend nor attack, nor secure territory - see vars.]

;B[ie];W[ge]
(;B[eb]C[LF - This is damezumari. You take away one of your liberties. In a semeai (race) like this one, it's a big blunder.]
