C[Hi!

Thanks for reviewing the game!

I played B in this match, and started out ok, I think.  But I'm not quite sure about a few moves in the early stage, so please comment on them (and other questionable moves, if you see them).  It seems B lost by trying too hard in the middle game, and suffered some unncessary bad losses.  Is this a correct assessment?

Again, thanks for the review.

Best,
Ken

forfun (FF) - In this game B started out well.  I liked the approach taken in the lower right corner and the thinking applied in the upper left.  In part B was helped by some W plays in the lower right that forced B to do things that B wanted to do anyway (so called "thank you moves" by W).  However, the exchange of B 31 in the upper left for W 32 in the center greatly favored W.  I don't think B realized this and overestimated his position in the middle game.  B fell behind when B's invasion of the left side allowed W to break into B's position on the bottom.  In the close fighting on the bottom B made two successive reading mistakes involving shortage of liberties.  Although B was able to build a substantial center territory it was not enough.  Finally B fell into a flower-viewing ko when W unleashed a basic tesuji that again caught B short of liberties.

B could benefit from studying tesuji.  There is nothing more important for improving your ability to effectively put your strategic ideas into practice on the Go board.  Many basic tesuji revolve around shortage of liberties and B needs to better grasp this concept in order to improve.  In addition, B should work on counting.  I would highly recommend the study of Cho Chikun's "Positional Judgement" from Ishi Press.  Personally it took me a couple of tries at reading this book carefully because I found it pretty dry.  However, I think that it had a significant effect once I took it seriously and began to apply it consistently to my games.    Overall I thought that this was a very interesting game.  I really enjoyed analyzing it.  I hope that the comments and variations make sense and do not contain too many errors (please realize that there are errors there, I leave it as an exercise for the reader to discover what they are :-)

Thank you for the opportunity to spend a couple of evenings working on some interesting questions.   Dave]
;B[pd];W[eq];B[cd];W[ed];B[oq];W[qp];B[qm]
(;W[op];B[np];W[oo];B[pq];W[qn];B[pm];W[no]C[FF - As analyzed earlier, this should be at R3.  That would leave B thin on both sides and W solid as a rock in the corner.]
;B[mp];W[nm]
(;B[pj]SQ[pm][qm]C[Better to play r3 first?  Doesn't seem to be much W can do against the two marked stones for now.

FF - I think that you made the right choice.  Q10 works well with your stone at Q16 and after W has exchanged O5 for N4, R3 is less urgent from your point of view.  It is still a very important point - taking away W's base and big in territory.  However, if W plays R3 now and B extends along the bottom, B can be content to have played on both sides (remember this is the original intention of the plays at P3 and R7!).  Also if W plays R3 now, O5 and O7 will have become very bad plays that forced B to strengthen himself on each side.]
;W[nc];B[kd];W[ne]C[FF - Although this approach allows W to play a pincer against the stone at L16, it also allows B to connect the stones on the right side to the upper right corner.  This makes W O7 a meaningless play.  It seems like W needs to try something like the double approach move at Q13 instead of O15.  But this raises the issue of whether O17 should have simply been around Q13 to start with.  However, such an approach doesn't look too dangerous for B.  To me it shows that B's result in the lower right was quite good, mainly due to W's unnecessary forcing plays.]
;B[pf];W[ng];B[ph]C[More than happy to jump along the fourth line, and was not too concerned about L16 stone, since it's high, and W's 3-stone group's pretty thin itself.  Still, would it perhaps be better for B to play, say, H16 or G16 instead of Q12?

FF  - This all flowed quite naturally for B.  As you say, the W stones are not strong yet.  Also after this the threat of B playing at R3 is greater.]
;W[id]C[FF - W's natural compensation for B's gains on the right.]
;B[kf];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[de]C[Didn't want to get into B15-D14 sequence.  But perhaps should've played the more solid move?

FF - I think this is a quite interest thought on your part.  I like it.  Playing B15 here would represent  very narrow thinking.    In a broader sense we should consider whether B could have ignored C17 instead of playing B17?  If B had used the opportunity to play something like M12 instead, W would have been in some difficulty.  It is worth studying a little about the joseki in the upper left when B does not answer.  There are various possibilities for W but it is not possible to capture the B stone with one more play.]
;W[if]
(;B[ee]C[FF - This play is beside the point here.  B should just jump out again, putting pressure on the 3 W stones on the right (see the variation).]
;W[jg]C[FF - This is a very strong play by W.  The power of the J14 and K13 stones have a major effect on the course of the game.  The exchange of K13 for E15 is a big plus for W.]

(;B[ic]C[Would it be a good idea to play G17 now?];W[hc];B[jc]
;W[gd]C[FF - W should connect at H16 instead.  There is no reason to leave behind some bad aji at F17.]
;B[md];W[nd];B[lh];W[ni];B[mf];W[nf];B[lj]C[Seems unnecessary.  Q18 better?

FF - This seems natural.  It gets B well out into the center and again looks at the link between the W stones in the bottom right and those in the top right.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc]C[FF - Note that B can not put up any resistance here because of the strengthening of W's wall caused by B plays at N16 and N14.  These were necessary because B allowed W to play in the center first at K13.]
;W[rb];B[oc];W[pb];B[od];W[ob];B[re]C[Duh....];W[cg];B[be];W[cj]
;B[bb]C[Too slow, or is this a good solid move?

FF - A good, solid, slow move :-)  With W's power in the center of the board (J14 and K13), this feels like a reasonable approach.]
;W[cp]C[Still felt okay here.  Since the top's open on the left, and B can still get something on the bottom.  And W's center seems quite open.]
;B[mb]C[Trying to take some sente profit.  Too small?

FF - This play itself is not small, but it feels like B is unnecessarily settling the shape here or at least using up some major ko threats.  In terms of taking profit, I think it is better to leave this alone for now.  On the other hand, as a preliminary to invading the left side, this could be good preparation as it strengthens B's center stones in sente.]
;W[mc];B[lc]C[B would like to be able to pull back to M18 in this kind of shape, preventing W from making 2 eyes on the side.  However, here W looks too strong on the outside for B to make anything out of it.]
;W[nb];B[nk]C[FF - This looks like the wrong idea to me.  In terms of the upper W group all that this does is make M18 sente (W T18).  B would be better off to grab R3.  If W responds with N9, B has taken a big corner in sente.]
;W[ln]C[FF - W should just play R3.];B[lb];W[mg];B[lg];W[mi]
C[FF - This seems like a pointless strengthening of B's wall, W should skip it.]
;B[mh];W[nh];B[li];W[me];B[le];W[sb];B[jp]C[Any suggestion for alternatives?

FF - The alternative would still be R3.  On the other hand, if R3 now, something like L4 or L5 will help build W's position in the lower left.  K4 has good balance.]
;W[qq]
(;B[gq]C[FF - This is natural but can't be considered the best play.  W's next at D7 is almost a perfect play in this shape.  Since B played steadily at B19 earlier, playing now at C8 or C5 to break up W's side seems more appropriate (see the variations).]
;W[dm]C[Did a quick count, and felt B's doing pretty well, especially since he gets to play next.  Correct?

FF - Let's do a quick count:
Black:
- Upper Left about 6 points so far
- Upper Side about 5 points so far
- Right Side about 25 points so far
- Lower Side about 20 points so far
Total of just over 55 points

White:
- Lower Right about 8 points so far
- Upper Right about 4 points so far
- Upper Side about 5 points so far
- Left Side about 32 points so far
- Komi 5.5 points
Total of just under 55 points.

I would count B *perhaps* slightly ahead in territory but what about potential?  B's right side has almost no potential for expansion.  Similarly, the center B stones have little or no potential.  In fact they have a problem in that they do not clearly have 2 eyes yet if they ever get cut off in future fighting in the center (realize that W K15 is sente threatening to cut in ko).  The B stones in the upper right also can not make significant new territory.  Only the bottom stones have the potential to expand.  However, if they expand in step with the W stones to the left, W will gain more because the W framework is larger to begin with.  At the same time the black bottom position suffers from a weak point at J3 and another at M3 (because of the W stone on M6).  This is a serious problem if B invades the left side and W becomes stronger in the fighting.

The only position with significant potential for expansion is W's left side.  B should not overestimate his chances here.]
;B[bp]C[Couldn't really decide on where to play #79.  What happened here's really not good :(  Where do you think B 79 should've been?

FF - Actually I think that B's result here is very good.  The issue comes up of whether W answered well or not.  I actually can't say what is best here, it is a very difficult question.  But by now B has to anticipate W responding with an invasion of the bottom after B has a go at the left side.]

(;W[bq];B[co];W[bo]
(;B[bn]C[FF - This is the wrong atari to play first (see variation). In this kind of position B is always hoping to be able to play both atari's.  So the question is whether W can or can not capture after each atari.]

;B[qr]C[FF - In this type of position the correct play is Q2 followed by R1 in order to keep sente.  But in this game the gap in B's group at L4, M4 means that W probably won't accept gote in the corner anyway.]
