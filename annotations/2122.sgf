C[Hello, in this game on KGS, I played black. I started badly and lost in territories at first. I thought the opponent had the lead all the time, so I fought all out without thinking of counting the territories. Somehow I got the game turned around in chuban (middle-game), and I won by 3.5 points.
I see that my starting moves were bad. Because I didn't count territories during the game, I played some risky moves and the yose was badly played too. I've just learnt to play 3 months ago, so I want to learn more about counting territories and how to analyze the situations and find out the strategies for them.
Thanks for your comments!

;W[cd]C[patrickb: With the facing 3-4 points at the top, I'd suggest that an approach to the top left or an enclosure in the top right are the two biggest points on the board right now. An enclosure at the top lets black make a combination pincer/extension on any approach to the bottom right, for example, and any approach at the top is backed up by a stone in the adjacent corner.]
;B[qo]C[patrickb: in contrast, this enclosure doesn't do as much - if D3 were C4, it would be threatening an approach to that stone, but with D3 where it is, this seems less important.]
;W[lc]C[patrickb: strange move by w - asking b to make two corner enclosures. This is too far from C16 for safety, too.]
;B[oc];W[qi]
(;B[ql]C[Extend the top group (r13) is better?

patrickb: that's my intuition, yes. See the variation.];W[qf]
;B[fp];W[jq]C[patrickb: another odd move by w - he seems to want lots of small territories. D5 is now natural for b, or C5, though that can lead to messy fighting.]
;B[mq]C[patrickb - this isn't bad, but if you're going to play here, might as well go one line farther to M3. You don't really have to worry much about a w invasion at O3 soon, since K3 is under pressure. I still prefer D5 to put pressure on the lower left corner.]
;W[gq]C[patrickb - black must block the connection at F3 here. Keep your opponent separated if possible!]

(;B[cp]C[patrickb - ugh.];W[cq];B[dp];W[eq]C[patrickb: white connected here too easily.]

(;B[cl]C[Is e4 sente?

patrickb: for b? Not quite, though it makes a ladder toward the upper right interesting - see the variation. b has a lot of defects in his wall at D4 that make C8 smaller than it looks. Not separating w before is hurting b now.]
;W[cg];B[gc]C[patrickb - a little off the mark here, but the right idea, I think. The white stone on the top is the weak one here, so you want to pressure it - that means either playing closer to the corner at the top left so that w either has to make a slightly long extention, or immediately pincering  M17 directly. IMO this allows M17 to make a base to easily while putting pressure on G17 instead.]
;W[ic];B[dc]C[patrickb: having to play this is painful :(];W[cc]
;B[dd];W[de];B[ee];W[ef];B[fe]C[patrickb - this is the problem here - black gets bent backwards while white builds a wall on the left side.]

(;W[cj]C[patrickb - feels too soon by w here. My instinct is to keep bending b back. See the variation.]
;B[df];W[ce];B[eg]C[patrickb - white should exchange D13 for F14 here.]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[fo]C[patrickb: this is immensely painful];B[fn]

(;W[go];B[dn];W[gn];B[fm]C[is the lower left of b in bad shape?

patrickb - no, not really except in the sense that it's not that big and w has some big endgame moves to seriously reduce its size.]
;W[ko]C[patrickb - not sure I like this - it helps black make a big lower right corner.]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[ff]C[I think this was too soon (too carefully), something like n5 is better. This wasn't urgent so it was small.

patrickb - well, the ladder wasn't broken yet, but taking it is not bad, since black's hane at C18 is now sente and you have moves against the left side now which are moderately large. If w had made teh D13/F14 exchange earlier, this wouldn't have been an issue for him]

patrickb - this is a good move - it weakens both w groups while securing the upper right corner.]
;W[of];B[ne];W[nf];B[mf]C[patrickb: just extending instead, letting b help you kill the stones at the top seems simpler.]

(;B[kc];W[jd];B[mc];W[lb];B[kb];W[ji]C[That's where I took back the lead. But because I didn't count, so I didn't play safe and lost the advantage. Please show me the right way of analyzing and thinking strategy in this situation.

patrickb - black does indeed have the lead now. All you need to do is reduce the size of the center and consolidate your gains. Where are your weaknesses and where does w want territory? 

B has a weakness at the top with the shortage of liberties on J11 and  L14, and w wants to make a large center, which is looking troublesome now. The liberty problems at the top seem urgent, however.]
