C[I couldn't really tell what I did wrong in general in this game.
Comment on the opening would be appreciated


Black plays better as the game progresses. He sees good moves
in the middle game. In the opening black needs to look for big
moves and generally consider where he will get sente and develop
that as a rationale for playing. You might fine the book "get
strong at the opening " useful.

Enjoy your Go life


Robin];B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fq];B[dj];W[cf]C[This is not a good move by white - there are so many different
ways to respond that then make life difficult for white.]
(;B[ch]MA[cn][dj][ch]C[This is not a good reply - it appears to strengthen the bl group
- but more important is the corner.];W[bd]C[c17 too slow really. At the beginning of the game look for big
moves you can make and/or moves that maximise your territory.
Here I think it is fine to give white the corner - one possibility
could be as follows]

to respond as it all gets very complicated .. probably variation
is better as black ends up with outside thickness]

are all much stronger than his. If he attacks marked group it
gets stronger]

problem];B[mp]

right?

This looks good to me black does well and greatly reduces whites

Yea I agree .. can't live here .. marked points seem pretty good
to me

You can get a ko .. but don't see how you can work it to your
advantage yet .. maybe wait and then play for the ko];W[rr]

I think at this point you need to kill the centre white group
to win so go for it!!]
