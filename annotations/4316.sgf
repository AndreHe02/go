C[[Malweth\]: (I was playing Black in this game). Aside from one major mistake I think I was leading this game. I was surprised he turned it around, though I managed a 1/2 point win.

Could you explain what I could have done better and why my lead was lost so easily?

z -- Hello Malweth.  I am Bill, "zinger" in the internet Go community.  We recently played on Dragon.  Good to see you again!  

My comments are marked with "z --".  I hope they are useful.  But remember, I am also a weak amateur.  So be sure to consider my comments and variations critically - almost certainly, I have made a few mistakes.

I prefer to reference move numbers and board markings in my comments, rather than grid coordinates.  Hopefully you have an SGF reader which displays these properly.  I recommend glGo or Drago, which I used to make the review.

To address your two questions from above: how could you have done better? - see the game comments.  And, how was your lead lost? - I would say your lead was lost for three main reasons:

1.  Not appreciating the thickness in the top right.  Black 73 and 105 in particular were poor uses of that pretty wall.

2.  Tactical errors, including: failure to just kill white's group on the top side; 135 which I'm sure you were aware of; and a few others as commented.

3.  Imprecise endgame.  Which is true for all of us :)

I hope the review helped.  Good luck !];B[qd];W[dd];B[nc]C[z -- interesting idea.]

(;B[pr]C[z -- 11 seems too easy on white, since his normal extension is already there (white 6).  Since the lower left corner is black, jumping once more and then attacking seems like a good alternative.]
;W[qq];B[kr];W[mp]LB[cp:a]C[z -- this is rushing things a bit - how can white know now that this is the best way to use the aji here?  14 should be at A.]
;B[np];W[lr];B[lq];W[kq];B[mr];W[jr];B[ls];W[ip];B[cp];W[dj]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[pl]TR[qj][pn]LB[ql:a][pm:b][gd:c]C[z -- 27 is a common mistake.  It accomplishes nothing if white responds at A.  If black wants to invade the marked shape, he usually must play A or B.

I think the normal move at C is appropriate here.]
(;W[ec];B[qm]C[z -- now 27 and 29 look like good moves.];W[om]
;B[ol];W[nm];B[qh];W[oj];B[qn]LB[ro:a][qo:b][nl:c][nk:d]C[z -- 35 is not good: aji-keshi.  Black A would be better endgame, and B might work better for eye removal.  Instead, black should continue outward with C or D.  Then, if later it turns out that 35 is good, it can still be played.]
;W[qo];B[oo];W[po];B[nl]LB[qr:a]C[z -- white can still live locally with A if he needs to, so 35 and 37 didn't accomplish much.]
;W[mm];B[nj];W[oh];B[ll]LB[pf:a][pg:b][qg:c]C[z -- I think it would be better to take territory while attacking with A or B.  This 43 allows white to play C.]

;B[re];W[rf];B[qr]LB[rp:a][rr:b][rn:c][cl:d][od:e]C[z -- black 59 is a mistake.  Even after this, white can live in the corner with A (then B and C are miai).  This means that 59 is just a big endgame move, still too small right now.  Black D looks like good alternative, or perhaps E which erases aji and encloses white.]
;W[kn]LB[cm:a]C[z -- white could switch to A on the left side, treating connecting or living as miai.]
;B[cl]C[z -- good move];W[pd];B[pc];W[qc]
(;B[od]LB[rc:a]C[z -- I think black A is better, keeping the corner territory.]
;W[rd];B[pe];W[qe];B[qb];W[pd];B[oe];W[qd]TR[fc]LB[gc:a][hc:b]
C[z -- really small !  White should play on the top side instead (A or B, perhaps), to reduce black's thickness and squelch the aji of the marked stone.]
;B[cg]LB[ce:a][gd:b][hd:c][gc:d][hc:e][cc:f]C[z -- black 73 looks like the wrong direction.  The dominant feature of this position is black's thickness in the top right.  White is in a good position to reduce it, so black must act fast.  B-E all look possible.  I would probably choose B, or perhaps D which also increases the nuissance value of the invasion at F.  I'm not sure what is best, but I don't think 73 is it.

In addition, 73 is risky locally.  Be aware that white could reply at A, and 73 could not connect to 61.]
;W[eo]C[z -- wrong direction by white.  The top side is biggest. 

Also 74 isn't very good locally.  This kind of reduction is appropriate when black has extended both ways from the shimari.  In this position, it just gives black free territory.]
;B[dn]C[z -- good move];W[fq]C[z -- from 76-84, either player could, and should, switch to the top.]
;B[fr];W[dq];B[dp];W[er];B[ep];W[gr];B[dr];W[fs];B[bd]LB[cc:a]
C[z -- black 85 should still be at the top.  Also, it removes the possibility of black A.]
;W[cd];B[be];W[bc];B[ic]LB[ci:a][gd:b][hd:c]C[z -- this area is still important, but be aware that your top left group is not settled yet - white can attack at A, and the 3-3 invasion is no longer possible.

z -- also I think that locally, black 89 doesn't quite do full justice to the thickness.  B and C feel better.]
;W[ie]C[z -- good move by white.  This is why I think 89 should be on the fourth line.]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[hd];W[jc]
(;B[fb]LB[jd:a]C[z -- I would play black 95 at A instead, which looks like enough territory to win.  Still, I can't really call 95 bad.]
;W[gb];B[fe];W[ed];B[hb];W[fa];B[hf]LB[jd:a]C[z -- good move, attacking on a large scale.  Also black A still looks like enough to win.]
;W[nf];B[of];W[ke];B[lc]LB[jg:a]C[z -- ugh, black 105 is much too submissive, so close to your own thickness.  Instead, attack from the outside at A.]
;W[kc];B[lb];W[ld]LB[jg:a]C[z -- white should run at A.];B[jg]
C[z -- good move];W[kg];B[jf]C[z -- looks like white is dead.]
;W[je];B[el]C[z --  Instead, black 113 can just add a move to absolutely kill the top white group, and cruise to a safe win.  But I understand the desire to take up the challenge of playing tenuki.]
;W[he];B[ge];W[if];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh];W[jh];B[df]LB[fj:a]C[z -- is this necessary ?  How about A instead.]

;W[ek];B[em]LB[dk:a][ii:b]C[z -- how about black 133 at A, and if white connects, then B?]
;W[ik];B[hm]C[z -- oops !  I assume this is the major mistake you mentioned at the beginning.]
;W[hl];B[ei]LB[bj:a]C[z -- it easy, even for strong players, to get psychologically disrupted after a mistake such as 135.  That leads to follow-up mistakes such as 137, which is not really a peep.  Instead, the slide at A looks big.]
