C[The marked white stone has room to either extend along the top side, or run out into the middle.  Even if black blocks one of those options, this stone will still have some way of escaping. So, white doesn't have to respond to black's move and can play elsewhere.]
;W[fr]SQ[do][gq][fp]C[This is rather low for the opening.  In general, opening moves should be on the 3rd or 4th line.  If you end up in a contact fight, like most Joseki, then you would play where you need to to secure your group.  Once you are back to making widely spaced opening moves, go back to playing just the 3rd and 4th lines. If you want to play in this corner, then the squares would be good choices.]
;B[fo];W[dj]C[Good. You should consider playing around Q10.  If you don't play there before black does, black will have a large area of potential territory that would be hard to invade.]
;B[do]SQ[cq]C[How would you answer this?

The 3x3 point is usually very important for controlling a corner, so that is a good place to start looking for move options.  In this case, playing on the 3x3 point (the square) towards making a live group in the corner.
See variation starting next move.]
(;W[bp]C[See Variation.

This is rather widely spaced to make a single secure group.  These stones are a small knight's move apart.  A small knight's move can usually be cut if your oppenent is determined.  In this case, the white stones are close enough to the edges to make a cut, I think, impossible.]
;B[bn];W[co]TR[qj]MA[cq][aq][bq][ar][br][cr][dr][er][es][ds]
[cs][bs][as]C[What are you trying to accomplish at this point?
If you want to make sure your corner group is alive, then C3 is better.
If you are trying to enlarge your corner territory, then it is too early in the game.  This is still the opening because there is still a lot of "unclaimed" space, mainly on the right side. Playing this one stone around R10 does a lot more for your score than your next 5 moves together.  
Currently, the white group in the lower left encloses 13 points of territory.  Jump to the next comment at move 26.]

[cq][cr][cs][ds][dr][er][es][eq][ep]C[White has played 7 stones from move 14 to here.  The white corner group is now worth 17 points.  This is a gain of 4 points, so each stone has gained white slightly over 1/2 point each.
Now imagine that white played on the squares instead.  This white side group would be worth 10 points, so each stone would have gained white slightly over 3 points each.
Don't get too caught up in one small portion of the board.  When you look for your next move, look for the best move on the whole board, not the best move within 2 inches of your opponent's last move]

(;W[fi]SQ[qc][qq]C[Pushing around the edges of black's large potential territory gives him a chance to build more secure borders around this territory. This type of reduction would be fine if the score was close. In this case, however, it helps black secure a huge area while only reducing it a little.
White's best move is to invade at R10.  There is still enough space around the right side for white to make a live group.  Other good options would be 3x3 point invasions in either right side corner.

;B[io];W[qo]C[This is a bit late for invading the corner.
The score is close at this point, so white doesn't need to do anything desperate. You should be able to at least estimate the score.  An estimate would consist of noting that the white upper left corner and black lower right corner are similar size.  White has probably a bit more territory in the other 2 corners than black has in the center.  So, the score is close with white perhaps slightly ahead.
I would focus on solidifying your borders around G14.
Of course, I am assuming that the invasion will (or at least should) fail.  If you succeed, then the invasion was a good idea.]

As you can see in this game, I get too hung up on dead stones, I need to work on that.

My biggest problem though is that I focus too much on the corner and sides. Even if I try to get influence on the center I always fail, somehow. Could you give me any advice on how to improve my play (overall and at the center). It's been like this in most of my games, I have mostly corner and sides, and the opponent has the center. I just can't seem to get influence and territory at the center.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

Actually, I think black focused too much on the center.  White has control of 3 and 1/2 corners and black is the only player with territory in the center.  White wins by 35 points (including komi).  White was able to push a long line of stones into the center and reduce black's territory by a large margin.  Since you have to block all 4 sides of center territory, it is usually impossible to prevent this sort of incursion and massive reduction of the center territory.]
