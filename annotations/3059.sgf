AB[dp][pp][pd]C[Llywelyn: Thank you for reviewing my game. I lost this game by 30.5 points, and while there were some things I know I could have done differently, I only got that many points because he failed to stop me from penetrating into a large moyo, but still gave him far too much on the left side.]
;W[dd]C[dede: Hi, I'm 4k in my country ranks. This is 'review of the review', I hope you'll be satisfied with my comments]
;B[cf];W[ch]
(;B[ef]C[REV: According to Kogo's joseki dictionary, this is not recommended.
Black should actually jump into the corner at the 3-3 point.

dede: Actually, you must take in consideration overall position on the board. If game will follow with W f16, B d11. Black gets strong wall that will work pretty nice. Jumping right into 3-3 point gives Black some profit, but now it's White who get pretty wall. As stronger player, White is supposed to use walls much better.]
;W[fd]
(;B[cj]C[REV: Apparently, this move should have been at D11.

dede:  Move at c9 is possible after B g14, W h16];W[eh]LB[ce:A]
C[REV: This move might have been better at C15 (A).];B[gf]
(;W[he]LB[ce:A][nc:B]C[REV: You don't have much of a threat against the three black stones, so this
move seems a bit high.  Maybe still C15 (A), or possibly O17 (B).

dede: This move is simply too aggresive. Now Black has pretty move at h17. Just h16 is ok. C15 looks for me like defensive move - White must be active playing on handicaps]
;B[gh];W[cn]LB[cj:A][dk:B]C[REV:  With this move, you're making it easy for black to pincer you, with
support.  Maybe you should rather attack the black stone at C10 (A) first,
maybe by playing D9 (B) to build up some thickness before you approach the
corner.
dede: White is determined to make complications - this is good approach in handicap game. Playing c9 would make game pretty easy for for Black. It would be asking - 'pleeease, take some territory on the left, I just want jump out of trouble' :)]
;B[cl];W[cq]C[REV: This is the correct response.

dede: I disagree. C6 can be used in many ways - c3, f3, or abandoned for a while. Black cannot kill it with one move. But stones c12/e12 look now very vulnerable. A Black move around f10 or f9 would be very dangerous. My proposition is e10.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fq];B[eq]C[REV: It isn't a good idea for black to cut immediately, as he is
reducing his options.

dede Yes, it's definitely aji keshi];W[er];B[dn]LB[fp:A]C[REV: This move seems a bit paranoid for black.  Maybe better to
push along at F4 (A)];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc]C[dede: now the hole between l17 and h15 is clearly visible. H15 should stand at h16. Now invasion or deep reduction for Black is much easier.]
;B[fj]C[dede: Big. Now game is difficult for White.];W[nq];B[lq]
C[dede: This move is Black's mistake,];W[no]C[Llywelyn: Would the attachment at M4 have been preferable?
REV: Yes, according to Kogo, seeing as you have some support on the left.]
;B[iq]C[REV: Probably not the best response

dede: It's the only move for Black. Now q4 is vulnerable and White has sente - thats the reason m3 was a mistake.]

(;W[po]LB[qq:A]C[REV: This seems a bit too aggressive to me, but I'm not quite sure what one should do here, maybe R3 (A) instead?

dede: This is terrible mistake. Don't touch what you want to attack. Attaching moves are generally DEFENSIVE moves.]
;B[qo];W[pn]LB[iq:A][lq:B]C[REV: Now you start building thickness, but with black's stones at J3 and M3 (A, B), the influence of the wall is not so great.]
;B[qn];W[pm];B[qm];W[op];B[pq]
(;W[ql]C[dede: this is bad move. Wall is ready. Now it is time to use it.]
;B[cc]C[dede: I think this move is a huge mistake. Sequence that goes on weakens c14/e14 stones. Following fight is favorable for White.]

(;W[cd]TR[ch][eh]C[REV:  I think this is the wrong direction.  You're probably not going to save the two marked stones at C12 and E12, so you won't get that much from cutting his invasion off.  I would rather try to keep as much territory as possible by playing at D17 (see variation).

dede: actually, I think White made a right choice. Explanation later.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]
(;W[ce];B[bf]
(;W[df]LB[ae:A]C[REV: Here I would rather descend to A15 (A) to force the corner group to make eyes.  I included some possible variations.  Don't take them as gospel; I'm not a dan player!

dede: It works, imho White played well];B[dg];W[de];B[ee];W[ed]
;B[eg]
(;W[cg]C[If you played the cut because you thought you could kill the corner group, OK, you were just being somewhat overambitious.  I wouldn't have thought it would work, though.  Better just to play A15.  Then you get the two black stones anyway, or else kill black's corner.  Or at least, that's what I read, just check my variations and see what you think.]

C[Llywelyn: Any way I could have improved my odds in this capture race, or was it pretty much a lost cause?
REV:  I had a look at it, and I think I see a way for white to win the exchange.

dede: Black is dead. A18 is the only move for White.];B[ad]

(;W[ba]C[REV: He has 3 liberties, you have 3 liberties.  You must find a move which removes his liberties.

dede: this is losing move of the game. A19 is a standard tesuji. I think White should make tsumego problems to improve.]
;B[ai];W[ca];B[ah];W[hf];B[ge];W[gd];B[fp]C[dede: huge move]

;W[br];B[bs];W[cs];B[od];W[tt]C[dede: Game is pretty well commented. Important  misses are: -usefulness of White wall in down-right area which was totally wasted. 
- direction of reaction on c17 move. I think White chose the  right direction.

By the way, a18 gives White 2 points  and s15 gives 1 point. It may has no meaning in this game, but such careless finishing can become a bad habit. White should resign or play to the real end of game.]
