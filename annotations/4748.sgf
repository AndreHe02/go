C[Hello,

I played this game on kgs, with a quite long time limit (60 min + 25/10min byo-yomi).  I was white in this game, played without komi.  I would lose even with the komi, but very close.

I am probably leaving too many weaknesses behind; three times in this game, I had to respond submissively to invasions, and although I do not think my opponent gained too much from them, I had a bad feeling about this. I would appreciate if you could point out any other mistakes you spot, of course.

I will mark my comments and questions with ZD.];B[pp];W[dq]
;B[pc];W[cd];B[qi];W[jd];B[jq];W[co];B[ed];W[ec]LB[gc:A][df:B]
C[ZD: A pincer at A would probably be better.
BT: A would be too close to the white stone to the right. B seems much bigger.]
N[B];B[dd];W[dc];B[ce];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc];B[df]C[BT: I'm not sure this was so good for Black. Usually this is played when Black has a position on the lower left.]
;W[ck]LB[cl:A][cj:B][cg:C]C[ZD: This goes too close to the thickness, A would have been better.
BT: Black's group is weak, so you should play at B, threatening C.]
;B[ci]C[BT: Black was correct to respond.];W[hq]LB[qn:A]C[BT: A is better as it is the most open part of the board. 20 is a big point, but smaller than A.]
;B[jo]C[BT: This exchange has made it more difficult for White to reduce Black's territory.]
;W[qn]LB[oi:A][ho:B][pk:C]C[ZD: Reducing at A and then defending at B might be better.
BT: 22 seems fine to me. A seems tempting, but if Black answers at C, it seems that 
you have helped Black to consolidate.];B[ld]LB[ro:A][np:B][rp:C]
[qk:D]C[BT: Black played too close to White's thickness. I would prefer A. Black B is too passive, as White can play C and D, settling himself comfortably and leaving Black
overconcentrated.];W[np]LB[pe:B][qk:A][np:C][ro:D][qq:E]C[ZD: A might be better, making B and C miai.
BT: A is a heavy move, inviting D. Sometimes Black will respond to C with E, which
is dangerous for White. I recommend that White play E himself which is much safer.]
;B[oo];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[om]LB[no:A][nn:B][pr:C][or:D][oq:E]
[qr:F][po:G][ph:H]C[BT: In order to take advantage of the white stone that has been cut off, I
might like to try A. Black has to be careful, because if black B, then White C, Black
D, White E, and if Black F, then White G.
Right now, though, the focus is on the upper right, and White should play a move like H.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[pl]LB[ph:A]C[BT: White 34 and following seem to consolidate Black. I would like to try white A.]
;B[ol];W[pk];B[oi]C[BT: Black has built a nice framework, but he may have overdone it because White can invade. Still, move builds power in the center.]
;W[ok]C[BT: White should have immediately invaded above. Black doesn't have to answer this.]
;B[ml]LB[nk:A][ok:B][pe:C]C[ZD: I think black should have played at A (and I should not have played B)
BT: Defending at black C seems better.];W[nk];B[fq]C[BT: This is too small, compared to defending the upper right.]
;W[fr]C[BT: This move resulted in Black making a lot of territory at the bottom, while White's thickness was not so useful. So jumping seems better.]

(;B[er];W[eq];B[gr];W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[hr];W[dr]LB[dr:A]C[ZD: Gote, but pushing at A would be big and it would also weaken the thickness I gained.]
;B[rk]C[BT: Too greedy, Black should defend the corner.];W[po]
;B[pn];W[qo];B[no];W[nl];B[nm];W[mm]C[BT: Again, these moves are smaller than the upper right corner. Also, White could be captured.]
;B[mn]LB[ll:A][kl:B]C[BT: Black is giving up too easily. Play A or B instead.]
;W[lm];B[ln];W[km];B[in];W[qc]LB[pd:A][qd:B][re:C][md:D]C[BT: Oops, Black lost his chance to defend here. But he can try to kill White with Black A, White B. Black C.White can't make two eyes, but he can create complicatations with moves like D.]
;B[qd];W[pd];B[oc];W[rd];B[qe];W[re]LB[rc:A]C[BT: Here, Black could consider cutting at A. Then he can maintain an attack against White.]
;B[qf];W[qb]C[BT: White lived too comfortably here, making the game more difficult for Black than it would have been.]
;B[rf];W[sc];B[mj];W[mk];B[pb];W[lj]LB[pb:A]C[ZD: The corner is ko, but answering A looks a bit small just now.
BT: I agree. Black's move at A may not be so good. It would have been fine to expand the center some more.]
;B[kc];W[jc];B[cm]C[ZD: I thought I can fight here, given my thickness in lower left, but blacks positions around are also strong.]

;W[cj];B[bi];W[ek];B[aj];W[di];B[ge];W[ch];B[bh];W[dh];B[cg]
LB[el:A]C[ZD: Taking A directly might be better, but I wanted sente to prevent the ko in the upper right corner.]

;W[fl];B[hc];W[hb];B[gb]LB[hd:A]C[BT: What if White plays at A?]
;W[gc];B[ib];W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[jb];W[gd];B[il]C[ZD: At this point, I have some 50 pts, black some 70, and there is little I can do about it.
BT: White's positions were often overconcentrated at the beginning, whereas Black was more spread out. Later, White didn't take advantage of Black's weaknesses in time.]
