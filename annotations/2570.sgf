C[While there was no stone handicap, white had two beers during play, while black had none. This could be construed as a handicap.

Hi there,

my name is Josh and I am about 6 kyu on KGS. 

Both players were, perhaps, a little reckless in this game. Both created too many weak groups. Try to think about making your stones work together more. Often it is easy to save one group at the cost of weakening another. This is undesirable. It is better to avoid this "family feud" as Ishida puts it. In general, try to find moves that achieve your goals that do not benefit your opponent.]

;B[od]C[vernon: I played this as a wind up for attacking R13.]
;W[of]LB[oc:a]C[vernon: B choses to try to save R13 split instead of the corner.]
;B[oc];W[rc];B[pb];W[qc];B[re]C[vernon: I was pretty sure that B owned the corner at this point, but W's strategy is to wall in the corner in sente for power on the outside, not save it.]

(;B[qb]C[* "Hit the head of two stones. Always" -- O18];W[cn]
C[vernon: White gets sente for his efforts.];B[fp];W[hq];B[ed]
C[vernon: B leaves the lower left thin in order to attack the upper left.]
;W[hc]C[vernon: Again, W choses not to defend the corner directly, probably in order to expand upper side territory.]
;B[cg];W[di]LB[dc:a]MA[cn]C[vernon: I believe that W needed to defend the corner directly with D17 (a). I suspect that W's strategy was to keep C6 (X) from being isolated.]
;B[cc];W[ef]MA[de]C[vernon: I feel this was a mistake. Better to play D15 to keep the B stones split.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[bc];B[cb]
(;W[ee]MA[dd]C[vernon: I think that this was a big mistake. D16 seems to break up B's position.

* D16 is not dangerous to blacks stones. White has a shortage of liberties that makes it very difficult to threaten black.]
;B[dd];W[be];B[bf];W[ch];B[df]C[* I would consider playing somewhere else because this stone does not seem necessary at the moment. If white cuts at D14, black can play B15. It would be nice to play G16 or reinforce one of the many isolated stones...]
;W[fd]C[vernon: B seems to have staked out all of the corners, but if W can build big moyos, B is in trouble. So B invades.]
;B[kc]C[* I feel that this is a mistake. Black has solid territory in the top two corners. White has potential, but imany weaknesses. The top IS whites best hope for territory but it is wide open so there is no need to rush in just yet. It would be better to form a stronger position from which to attack. The problem here is that black is creating weak groups that are going to be difficult to manage later on...]

;W[oe];B[pd];W[oq];B[oo]C[vernon: I felt that it was more important to split W than to take the corner with Q3.]
;W[nj];B[qh]C[vernon: I planned this as a double attack. Q11 can either connect with Q15 or jump out with O12. W can only stop one of them.]
;W[rg];B[nh];W[oh];B[oi];W[ng];B[ni];W[lg];B[jf];W[ki]C[vernon: W seems to have a good position. Q11 is cut off from uniting with L15. Black has weak groups everywhere.

* Yes. This is a good indication that blacks stones are not working together.]
;B[li];W[lj];B[mj];W[mk];B[mi];W[ok]C[vernon: I feel W was playing too close and has allowed weaknesses.

* Perhaps, but black is still giving white some thickness in return for a heavy group. Instead of playing M10, I think playing Q9 would be better.]
;B[kj];W[lk];B[kh];W[ji];B[mg];W[lh]C[vernon: I thought this move by W was strong and prevents B from connecting Q11 to L15. So I change strategy and try to connect Q11 to Q15 after all.

* This actually does nothing for white. Playing L13 will capture the white M12 stones (see variations).]

(;B[pf]C[* This is a mistake. The black corner is not in any danger. N14 is a vital point (see variations).]

;W[hi];B[gh];W[hh];B[gf];W[gi];B[fh];W[eg]C[vernon: I thought this was a good block of L15 from E16.]
;B[ei]C[vernon: Should B have played F15 here, which he eventually does?]
;W[eh];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[ek];B[co];W[en];B[fc]C[vernon: I now conceive of playing F15, but do a lot of perhaps unnecessary preparation work, giving W too much time to correct it.]

;W[np];B[fe]C[vernon: Finally F15. The cut that turned the game.]
;W[fk];B[ib]C[vernon: Although I though I already had the H17 group, this secures it.]

;W[ql];B[qn];W[nn];B[rl];W[qk];B[rk];W[qj];B[rh]C[vernon: I decided the risk was too great that R13 would connect to a live group. I thought Q4 was alive. Is that correct?

* Yes];W[rj];B[sm];W[gj]
(;B[gb]C[vernon: A bad move that costs over ten points and almost loses the big upper side black kill. It should be H13.

* H13 is actually no better (see variation). Either G13 or F14 seem best to me.]
