RE[W+75.5]

C[markm: In this game, I didn't notice until too late that gnu go had taken over the left hand side.  This is not the only game that I have this kind of blindness, and I would like some help in overcoming it.

Hi  I am David and I will be reviewing your game. Ifyou have any questions you can email me back or contact me on KGS or IGS as Xif.]
;B[dq];W[cd];B[pc]C[markm: is it better to play the first two moves on the same side, or are diagonals OK?

Diagonals are prefectly fine. They generally lead to more of a fighting game though.]
;W[qe];B[nc]LB[mc:A][nd:B]C[This move is slow. It isn't a common reponse you should try either A or B if you want to devlop in that direction. Jumping the stone is also possible]

C[markm: I'm feeling good at this point.];W[po]
(;B[qp]C[markm: trying to block off the corner

This move generally isn't great becuase white has such a strong reply at R5 and there is a better move to block off the corner to take territory]
;W[ec];B[nq]C[you are already strong here so a more aggressive attacking move is warented maybe somewhere at R10]
;W[qh];B[qj];W[qo];B[qm]C[markm: now I'm trying to make room on the right, and limit the q5 group


This move is right on the money, make a base while taking away white's base and now white has to run]
;W[no];B[pm]C[THis moves feels too slow could be wrong. I would have jumped out one more at p7]
;W[pp];B[qq]C[R4 might be slightly better];W[fo];B[gp]LB[cg:A]
[jc:C][pf:B]C[This move isn't to big right now. Some ideas are A B and C

A is the invastion
B will help you build outside influence on the upper right corner and C is a big move for both white and black.]
;W[go];B[ip];W[rc];B[qb]C[you can also consider playing K17 and making a base on the the other sie]
;W[id];B[kc]C[markm: is it too late to invade?  Would C12 have been better at this point?

Its not to late becuase you can run to the center it would jsut be difficult. I would try it just becuase you feel behind on influence]
;W[ch]
(;B[ic]C[Generally you don't want to touch a weak stone see varation. Also it might be the wrong direction becuase you are causing whites influence to be stronger and thicker for a gain of about 6 to 8 points.]
;W[hc];B[ib];W[if];B[ke];W[lq];B[mp];W[mr];B[nr]C[markm: I was hoping to be able to stop him from living here.

Looks possible at this point since white has two weak groups right there.]
;W[kp];B[mo];W[kn];B[mm];W[ih]C[see you got the other group in compensations so this is okay that you didn't kill the N2 group]
;B[kg];W[ij];B[in];W[hm];B[jm];W[oh]C[This is why playing a computer is bad it plays away when it shouldn't]
;B[oj];W[jo];B[io];W[lo]C[markm: ...but I don't know the point at which he has enough for life

I think its dead (see varation) could be wrong since I am not a 9d]

[qf][qg][rd][re][rf][rh][sa][sb][sc][sd][se][sf][sg]C[markm: so I gave up a huge chunk of one side.  I need to learn how to avoid doing that.  Many thanks for your help.

The whole left side was due to whites more efficeint play and could play elsewhere against some of your weaker moves. I would suggest looking over pro game openings for some examples (http://igo-kisen.hp.infoseek.co.jp/news.html ttry this website for some examples). You should try to feel out where bigger moves are through out the game and try to play less locally. Take a look at a few joseki to get an idea of some of the responses that you can make in the corner. I think if you slowed down your playing a bit and looked more moves you would create a jump in your skill (easier said than done thought since it is one of my bad habits) If you have any question emial me back and I will get back to you. any terms you don't understand go to http://senseis.xmp.net/?BeginnerGoTerms]
