C[Hi! Thank you so much for reviewing my game. This is a game I played on Yah
oo. I played black. I estimate my rank to be around 20 Kyu. My opponent was a 
couple of ranks higher than me. The game was played with no handicap, and 6 ko
mi.

M:  Hi, I'm Munisai.  Thanks for sending this game in for review.

M:  In summary, I think your did not pause to consider what the biggest move w
as at every point.  You had a good plan (to control the center), but you inves
ted far too many stones there, and white simply gathered the territory needed 
to win the game.  In the future, before you play a stone, consider two things:
1.  Am I playing in the biggest part of the board?
2.  How would I respond to the move I'm about to make?  Is it still a good move?]
;B[dd]LB[fc:B][ce:A]C[Someone told me that on full size boards, pros tend to use stones on one si
de of the board to influence stones on the other side, and that on a 9x9 board
, the center IS the other side of the board. Therefore, this person said, I sh
ould try to "own the center" for the first few opening moves. The 4-4 point is
 my favorite opening for this purpose.

M:  That's excellent advice.  I've seen 5-5 played on 9x9 often, too.  However
, the only way to win is to take territory.  "Owning the center" will make fig
hting easier, which will make taking territory easier.  However, you cannot al
low yourself to fall too far behind in solid points, or you will be unable to 
catch up.  

M:  The weakness of 4-4 is its inefficiency in taking corner territory.  You n
eed two other moves (A and B) to take the corner.];W[gf]
(;B[fe]LB[gd:B][dg:A][eg:C]C[Here I'm still trying to "own the center", while also putting some pressu
re on g4. Looking at it now, I think e4 may have been more efficient.

M:  F5 feels very inefficient to me.  
1)  It does not greatly enhance your ability to control the center.  It largel
y duplicates your first move.
2)  It does not threaten your opponent's stone.  G4 still has several options 
to live.  

M:  A, B, and C seem like large moves to me.];W[ge];B[gd]LB[fe:B]
[eg:A]C[I think this is the correct move.

M:  It is hard to argue with it.  However, I still think A is big.  This makes
 me think that A would have been a much better move than F5 (B).]
;W[dg];B[ef]C[Still controlling the center and putting pressure on d3, while also tryin
g to separate the white stones.

M:  This feels too slow to me.  Look how many stones you have clustered close 
together.]
(;W[fg]LB[eg:A]C[M:  A would have been better for white.  Why give black a chance to pee
p?]
(;B[ff]LB[hd:B][eg:A]TR[fe][ef]C[M:  Inefficient.  This makes an "empty triangle."  What is the stone 
with a square on it doing?  The two stones with triangles on them are in no da
nger of being disconnected if it is not there.

M:  Using A is risky, but white will need to patch it if you play B.  B gets y
ou profit in sente.];W[eg];B[df];W[cc]C[Should I have better protected that corner? Also, I think I could hav
e better used my stones in the center to influence that corner, but I'm not su
re how.

M:  This is the weakness of 4-4.  It is open to 3-3.];B[dc]

(;W[cd]LB[bd:A]C[M:  This is a mistake.  The best white can do is ko.  A is correct.]

(;B[cb]LB[ce:A]C[Here I thought I would be able to use my stones in the center to 
cut the white stones from the ones on the bottom, so I tried to make sure whit
e couldn't live in the corner.

M:  A is better.];W[cf]C[But this move ensured a connection]

(;B[ie]LB[hd:A]C[M:  A is better, as it retains better potential.]

;W[bb];B[ca];W[ba];B[eb];W[tt]C[I counted the territories, and realized I had lost. I made a 
futile attempt to invade white's territory.

M:  Such an attempt insults your opponent.  If you can read that the attempt i
s futile, you should pass and end the game (or resign, if you haven't entered 
the endgame).];B[cg];W[bg];B[ch];W[bh];B[dh];W[gh];B[tt];W[tt]
