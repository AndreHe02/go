C[
I am the black stones. I have asked some questions in the record.

If possible, when viewing this game, the viewer should be set to "show the
next move" as the character "a". When I refer to "a", I am referring
to the upcoming move. Also if I put in an alternate next move
I thought of in a few places it shows up as "b".

Thanks.

of w's extra long extension at C9?

klin: As you said, b is normal.  A is OK, but one place above, i.e. D15 is also good, maybe better.]

(;B[ce];W[cg]C[Black is out numbered here, so playing defense at a seems right?

klin: Yes.];B[dd];W[cc];B[fd];W[ed]C[klin: W 12 simply E17 better.]

klin: A is OK.  H16 is another possibility.];B[cm];W[eg]C[I guess immediately moving out at b is right? (But I did not
see how w could immediately punish the black stones so I grabed
a big point.)

klin: I like b better.]

settles black's group.)

klin: A is Ok. (See comment on next move.)];B[po];W[op];B[qk]
C[klin: B can play at 33 is because of 31 (Q5).];W[qf]C[Is black's next move at a too slow?

klin: No.  It is a good move.];B[oe];W[oi];B[ok];W[mi]C[At this point, how should black assess this game? Also, can the
three w stones on the top left be attacked somehow to advantage?
Or, is invading the bottom good timing now? (Obviously I feel
confused here.)

klin: A is too close to w's strong group. G3 or K4 better.]
;B[lp];W[io];B[jp];W[ip];B[km];W[mm];B[nj];W[ni]C[Black seems pretty thin but somehow comes out all right. Did
white miss opportunities to punish black in this area?
