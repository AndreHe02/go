A few general comments:
* You make a bit too many "thank-you" moves, helping white where you shouldn't.
*
You played far too aggressively when you should've just defended. Learn to
count the score during the game - this should help you decide whether to
attack or defend.
* You should learn which stones are important and which can be sacrificed.]

was surprised by white not taking the other corner. So I took that corner,
thinking that if he did attack D17, i would extend along the top.

--

This
is a possible way of playing. However, it does give white the possibility
to contain the D17 stone so that it does not run outside.]

far. Your marked group is the weak one, not your corner stone. Better to
play at a or thereabouts.

See variation.];W[qf]
(;B[rd]C[I'm not sure that s16 was the best response, but i didn't wan't white to take the corner...

Also, would it have been better to ignore w R14 and instead play at K16 to secure the top?

--

That would've been a possibility, but I would've rather played a hasami (pincer). See variation.

Now
you have many weak points along the top.  White can make himself stronger
with less stones than what it takes for black to protect all of his problematic
places.];W[pi];B[rj]LB[cj:C][ep:B][oq:A]C[I think S10 was overplay...
but my opponent didn't punish it. Where should I have played, and how could
white punish S10.

--

Yes, this was overplay. You could've just played elsewhere. For example, A, B or C.]

bit early for white. He should play big points around now, or at least take
care of his right-side group. This also destroys the aji of the marked plays.]

keshi - there is no need to force here, since you do not yet know which way
you want to play, and by forcing white to defend, you are making a so called
"thank you move" - because white wants to defend.

The marked stones also form a bad, inefficient shape.];W[cq]
;B[dn];W[cm];B[eq];W[dm]C[Ouch.
You should've continued to push as long as white wanted to. This works beautifully
with his top group, and makes it impossible to invade - reduction is the
only possibility from here on onwards.];B[jq];W[lq]
(;B[lp]LB[jd:B][ne:2][di:1][em:D][qn:A][jo:C][lo:3]C[Too
aggressive. Take a look at the current board. Black has about four weak spots
where a white play would hurt, whereas white has roughly three. I have marked
black's big points with A-D and white with 1-3.

If you look at the board, and examine each point:

A = purely defensive, big for black.
B = Defensive, stops white from invading, takes about 20 points.
C = Defends black group, takes about 10 points (because white D still hurts)
D = Both defensive and aggressive (white will hane on top, growing his moyo. The white D7 stone really shines now.

1 = very big for white, but still has weak points (this can be invaded) - white needs another stone
2
= Would be essential to assure the survivability of white group on the right.
Is big for black as well, because it helps strengthen the top.
3 = White needs this to survive.

I
would've played 2, and then C (or perhaps vice versa). C practically forces
white to play 3, after which you can either invade or turn at D - both way,
black is winning.];W[mp];B[kq];W[lr];B[kr]C[Bad shape. Do not make empty triangles.]
;W[lo]C[This is big for white. You are trying to kill a live shape here, and now white ponnuki will dominate the center.]

(;B[di]C[I didn't want white to complete his moyo along the side...

A good idea, and a good spot.

Saving M4 is very important, though. See variation.]

split my two groups in the top. I probably should have protected against
K17 some earlier time in the game, but looking back I don't know when exactly
I should have done this.

H18 probably wasn't the best response given
the way white played next. But I had to stop white playing there, and leaving
my group without a base. What would have been better. H17 maybe?

--

Yes,
H17 is much better. It robs white from his base, and saves your groups. Your
right side is already alive, so you don't have to worry about that.]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[ib]C[Good shape for white.];B[hd];W[ic];B[ga]
;W[je];B[ff]LB[ne:A]C[I figured I should keep white's top left corner contained

--

Play at A first, since it is sente against the right side group.]
;W[me];B[jg]C[i
saw that white had an opertunity to make territory in the center-right, I
though K13 was the best was of minimising this.

--

It is too close.  It is much more important for you to protect your bottom area, so you could've come in with K11 for example.]
;W[kf];B[if]C[Just
treat K13 as a kikashi, and let it be. Let white capture it if he really
wants, and protect your weak points in the mean while.];W[ie]
;B[he];W[pn];B[rn];W[rq]C[Mm...
This is the 3-2 point, not the 3-3 point. White should not be able to live
here. See variations.

However, descending at Q2 is a mistake. See also variation.]

There is a knight's jump connection between the marked stones. You should remember that it is cuttable.

In fact, up to this point, black is winning by about 20 points.

However, black greediness will cost you more than that :-).]
