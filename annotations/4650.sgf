C[This was an okay game.  I experiemnted a little bit with invading and reductions.  Perhaps you could help me with these.  I also had some silly moves.  Don't mind those.  I wasn't thinking too much by the end there.

The lower left could have been done better I feel.

Hi! I am Tobias a 2nd kyu from the Netherlands.
First a sorry for the long time it took to finish this but I was kind of busy.
So here finally my review. Hope you like it.];B[pd]C[Maimonedes [7k\]: hi
digital8 [9k\]: hello];W[dp]C[digital8 [9k\]: have a good game]
;B[pp]C[Maimonedes [7k\]: u2];W[dc];B[jp];W[ci]
(;B[de]LB[gd:B][ce:C][pj:A]C[Direction of play?

Tobias: This is a difficult question, but it looks too early at this stage for a high approach, OR bl should use the low approach (C). I guess I would have played A (sanrensei) or B and make it a moyo battle (see var.).]
;W[fd]
(;B[cd]LB[cc:A]C[Tobias: This creats a heavy group. 

If you want to settle the group right now you should go for the limit at A (see var.)]
;W[cc]C[Tobias: Wht get's a lot profit while attacking.];B[cg]
C[Jump out instead?

Tobias: No. This seems better then a jump. With C16 the group has got heavy so it must live now.]
;W[ic]
(;B[cn]LB[cl:A]C[Creating two weak groups - bad, I know.  This cost me.  Suggestions for better direction?

Tobias: If you know that its bad why you play it then? This is a big mistake cause wht will be happy to pincer you AND have a nice 2 space extension with A.
Actually the fact that C11 get's much stronger through A weakens the upper bl group as well.
 
Suggestions for better direction? ...
Yeah. Keep things simple and look to the overall balance. For me this situation screams for a sanrensei (see var.)]
;W[cl]C[Tobias: Yeah! Of course.]
(;B[cp]C[Tobias: This means one eye for black and another running group. Bl still can play A in sente and then B (see var.).]
;W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[do];W[ep]C[Tobias: One eye.];B[em];W[hq]

(;B[iq]LB[pj:A]C[Tobias: Again A (see var.)];W[nq];B[np]LB[pj:A]
[qj:B]C[Tobias: This move is just recommended when you have A or B.
Like this it's bad. It strengthens wht cause it touches it.]
;W[mp]C[Tobias: You see];B[mq]LB[pj:A]TR[kq][lq][jr][kr][lr]
[mr][ks][ls][ms]C[Tobias: Whow... what is that??

It looks to me as if you can't stand to give the opponent ANY territory or alive group. C6 was that kind of move too. 
You cut and fight... but what for? Are you seriously fighting for 10 (marked) points when A is still open?]
;W[lp]C[Tobias: On the next 10 moves there won't be any comment of mine cause the variations are endless, and all I am missing in that fight is the REASON.]
;B[lq];W[kq];B[nr];W[oq]C[Tobias: You'r about to destroy you're own corner for 10 points.]
;B[kr];W[op];B[no];W[pq];B[kp];W[qp];B[lo]LB[pj:A][qj:B]C[Tobias: Big mistake. Must be at A or B probably. What if wht plays B now? Then bl has lost his advantage.]

(;W[po]LB[qj:A]C[Tobias: Wht makes the same mistake. Should be at A (see var.).]
;B[qj]C[closer to lower right group, or would that just be too much
I feel I need to play a little moer territory based

Tobias: At least you got that point.];W[ql]
(;B[fq]TR[iq]C[move I just learned and then wasted it by having a weak group later

There are probably better laternatives though - pleas help

Tobias: This move aims at a connection witth the marked stone and you played the sequence quite ok IF this connection is what you want..
For me the most potential now lies in the upper right corner and in attacking the 2 wht stones at the left side.]
;W[fp];B[hr];W[gq];B[gr];W[fr];B[hp];W[gp];B[ho]C[Tobias: This move is the same categorie like M5. You give away sente for free.]

(;W[er]C[silly by him or am I not seeing something?

Tobias: You're right. That's what I mean with you giving away sente. Wht could have used this move more efficient. 
See the var. of what wht might be afraid of.]
(;B[dh]C[I dont' like this shape.  Better moves?

Tobias: I don't like this shape either. :) See the vars for better ones.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[el];B[bm];W[bl];B[di];W[dj];B[ej];W[ek];B[fj]
;W[gm]C[this move was more imprtoant for me.  Lack of shape too it seems.]
;B[gn];W[fn]
(;B[fo]C[Tobias: Oh... wrong side. Now black must live at the edge which is almost impossible (see var.)]
;W[eo]C[nice];B[cm];W[fm]C[Tobias: Bl is dead];B[al]
(;W[ak]C[Tobias: Mistake by wht. Wht should take things easy (see var.)]
;B[bk];W[am];B[an];W[dn];B[al];W[mr];B[lr];W[am];B[bo];W[co]
;B[al];W[ir];B[aj]C[worth it I suppose?  Bad situation to be in in any case

Tobias: Bl is lucky.];W[hs];B[cj];W[dk];B[ck];W[dl];B[bi]C[I didn't see I needed this gote move at first.. unfortunate

Tobias: Bl can be happy to have this gote life.];W[nc]
(;B[qf]LB[qh:A]C[q14 better?

Tobias: I would say yes. Bl has no good answer to A];W[qh]
(;B[oj]LB[pb:A]C[I am sorely lacking territory.  Suggestions?

Tobias: Yeah. Play a better opening. :) Another option in this situation would be A (see var.).]
;W[oh];B[ol]TR[oj][qj]C[Tobias: The marked stones are not really in danger so why playing P8?]
;W[mn];B[mo];W[nn]C[nice]
(;B[lj]LB[qm:A]C[Tobias: If you can live locally you should not run. Wht has no good answer to A (see var.).]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[ok];B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[nm]
(;B[qk]LB[rl:A]C[ajikeshi? just have left aji maybe for later

Tobias: This is a bit small. Better would be A if you want to get a base (see var.).]
;W[pl];B[mj]LB[nj:A]C[Tobias: A is the better connection.];W[ni]
C[Tobias: You see...];B[nj];W[ne];B[gc]C[Tobias: Another brute force attack...]
;W[gd];B[ec];W[fc];B[ed]LB[ed:A]C[I think I got lucky to make this connection

Tobias: You're right. Wht should have played A.];W[eb];B[kb]
LB[kc:A]C[Tobias: Whats that?? A would be reasonable.];W[kc]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[ld];W[le];B[ke];W[md];B[lf];W[me];B[jd];W[jc]
;B[jf];W[lb]C[another time?

Tobias: Wasted move by wht.];B[lg]LB[pb:A]C[Tobias: Wasted move by bl. Should be at A.]

I need help prioritizing]
