This game was played at our Go club (http://voltar.org/kgcf) on 8-18-05.  I had white (I'm Ben) against Jason with a 2 stone handicap.  I told Jason I would submit this game but I dont really have too many comments/questions.  I guess the reason is because of the handicap.  There was never a stage where it was equal and then suddenly my game fell apart.  Or there was some part I found difficult to handle.  It was always difficult to handle and my game was pretty much worse all the way to the end.  The only reason I managed to win is because a mistake by Jason at the end.

Tobias: Hi! I'm Tobias and I am a 2nd kyu here at our club in Groningen / the Netherlands means I'm not soo strong. But whatever, I'll just explain what I would have done in this game
I hope you will like it :)
Have fun!];W[dd]C[Ben:  Jason plays a really solid game.  He reads very well and is adept at life and death, more than a 12 or 13 kyu ranking would indicate.  He is sometimes a little trusting of "vulgar" plays and this frustrates a better ranking at KGS.  At the club, where players a less likely to make emotional or intimidating moves his game is much improved.  He also had the additional duty of being the game recorder.  For this game I really tried to forget that there was a handicap as quickly as possible and just tried to play the best possible moves the same as if there was no handicap.  In this way I was kind of playing into his strength.]
;B[pp];W[cn];B[fp]
(;W[bp]LB[dj:C][cq:A][hq:B]TR[dp][fp]C[Tobias: I would'nt play this move so early cause it removes all chances to go to sansan (A) or an effective attack on the marked bl stones (for instance with B) later. 
Simply playing at C would be enough here. (see var)];B[cq]
(;W[dl]LB[ck:A]TR[dd]C[Tobias: In my opinion this move leaves the left side too much open. The distance between the two marked stones is too wide and they are both high on the 4th line. (see var of move 8)
Playing at A would give you a strong position (see var).]
(;B[jq];W[nc]
(;B[lc]LB[qc:A][ne:B][qf:C]C[Tobias: Ooeps...  I wouldn't have played this pincer here. It gives wht good opportunitys. Both wht A or B is hard to answer.
I would have played C (see var)]
(;W[qc]C[Tobias: Good!    but see the var for another idea]

(;B[qd]LB[pc:A][pj:B]C[Ben: Jason spotted later that a better move may have been at a.

Tobias: I would call A the Only move cos there is no stone around B (see var)]
;W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[pj]
(;W[oj]LB[me:D][ph:A][qn:B][nq:C]C[Tobias: Whow... thats heavy... and I would call it  wrong. 
Attaching makes your opponent stronger. 
White is in a position to attack here (maybe at A, B, C or D)
If you want to attack = keep a distance, if you need to defend = attach.]

(;B[ok]C[Tobias: Bl is not punishing whites mistake. I would say simply extending is much better (see var)]
;W[pk]C[Tobias: lol... party time!  :)];B[qj]LB[pi:A]C[Tobias: Extending is fine but I would prefer A]
;W[ol];B[nk];W[qk]
(;B[oi]LB[nl:A]TR[oj]C[Tobias: Ok, the ladder works for bl but I think A is much more severe. There is nothing to worry about the marked wht stone. (see var)]
;W[md]LB[jc:B][nl:A]C[Tobias: Wht takes a coffiebreak... 
I don't think there is time for this move now. 
A is the only move here but if you really want to do something at the upper edge than play at least a ladder breaker at B or so.]

(;B[rk]LB[nl:A]C[Tobias: A is still THE move (see var)]
(;W[ql]LB[nl:A]C[Tobias: Empty triangle... Bad shape!   Still A is pressing (see var)]

(;B[fc]C[Tobias: Now bl takes a coffiebreak...  (see var)];W[cg]
LB[ic:A]TR[fc]C[Tobias: This exchange is too good for wht. Bl has no prospects at the upper edge cause its still wide open at A. Now the 3 wht stones lower left are shining.]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd]
(;B[ec]LB[eb:A]C[Tobias: A is the right shape here (see var)]
;W[pn]LB[nl:A]C[Tobias: A is bigger];B[qo]LB[nl:A]C[Tobias: still...]
;W[qn]LB[nl:A]C[Tobias: still...];B[rl]LB[nl:A]C[Tobias: still... :)]
;W[rm]
(;B[nq]LB[nl:A]C[Tobias: Looks a bit slow. I would play A];W[qq]
C[Tobias: Whow... wht is not afraid]
(;B[pq]LB[ro:A]C[Tobias: BIG mistake. A is the ONLY move (see var)]
;W[ro];B[ke]C[Tobias: the upper edge is not intresting. see the 2nd var of bl 46 for what I mean]
;W[fe]
(;B[dh]LB[cj:A]TR[dl][cn][bp]C[Tobias: you should hit where it hurts. a move at A would expose the weakness of the marked group (see var)]
;W[ci];B[ch];W[bh];B[dg];W[bg]
(;B[ee]LB[gh:A]C[Tobias: I don't think this will work. I would jump to A]

(;W[fd]LB[ed:A]C[Tobias: Of course A is the move]
(;B[ni]LB[ed:A][mj:B]C[Ben: It seems like just cutting me off at e-16 was the way to go, I'm not sure why he was worried about this stone escaping.

Tobias: First of all... bl MUST connect at A!!
wht's last move was to bad to be true and needs to be punished!
btw
if black wants to get a clean situation at the right side capturing is the way cos now there is still a peep at B]
;W[ed];B[de]LB[gh:A]C[Tobias: completly wasted]
(;W[ce]C[Tobias: Wasted too. white has nothing to worry on the left side (see var)]
;B[di];W[cj];B[hc];W[mf]LB[gh:A]C[Tobias: A is bigger];B[of]
;W[jo]LB[gh:A]C[Tobias: A is bigger];B[lp];W[ho];B[hq];W[fn]
;B[gi]C[Tobias:Wht missed a good chance to capture the bl left side grroup, or at least drive it across the bord gaining power to reduce the bl lower edge to nothin.

Ok. I'll stop my comments here. I hope you enjoied it! For me it was interesting to do this and I did my best.
If you want (both of you) we can play a game on KGS one day.

keep it up!
Tobias];W[hh]C[Ben: This move is bad in my opinion.  G-9 seems interesting to me now though.]
