C[WayFarer: Hi, I played White in this game.  There is a reverse komi of -5.5.  Black had thickness early in the game, but he made several gote sequences early on, letting me get big points on the board.  He was ahead for much of the game, until he gave me a golden opportunity to resurrect some dead stones.

WayFarer: I'm looking for comments in general.  Thanx!

Reviewer:

Hi, Before starting, I would like to introduce myself shortly. My name is Ruben Cornelissen, and I am a dutch 1-dan (current egf rating 2096). I hope my review will be of any help to you.

I reviewed the White as well as some of the Black moves, since they might be of help to you as well.]

(;W[ce]LB[cg:A][cm:B]C[This is very big, but slow and gote since Black can always extend to either A or B. See variation for more active ways to play]

;W[qf];B[lc]C[This seems to close to Black's thickness, White's response is solid and good]
;W[je];B[le]LB[cg:B][cm:C][jq:A]C[This is even worse, Black is trying to make territory with his thickness. A is a much bigger move here, alternatives are B and C]

(;W[ch]C[For an alternative way, see variation];B[cm]
(;W[fo]LB[eo:A]C[This is a strange move. It puts too little pressure on the weak Black two space extension, it doesn't make territory and it also doesn't build a moyo. It does make the shimari stronger, but to do that, A would be better shape.

In the beginning, White let himself be cut and Black got a big advantage. In the middle game, White had some opportunities to catch up during the fight on the upper left side, but he didn't grab them. In the endgame however, Black made two blunders which let White capture the right side. After that, the issue was decided. 

I hope my review is of any help to you. Good luck with studying Go.
