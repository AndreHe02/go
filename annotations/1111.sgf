C[This is a game I played on IGS as black. I felt this game was very close through the very end. I had trouble deciding how to use the walls I had built on the left and right sides of the board. I have been told not to use thickness to build territory, but to use it to attack. In this game, I wasn't sure how I should have attacked the white stones that had developed on the four sides of the board.          Hello Griffin,     I'm Manuel, 13kyu on IGS. You seem to have a grasp on the principles of Go, but having knowledge of the principles is not applying them to your games. You judgement is usually correct, but due to limitations on your reading abilities you didn't see the optimal uses of the strenght that you developed near the center.     Well, let's begin.]
;B[dc];W[dp];B[qd];W[pp]C[Manuel:     As fas as things go he has 2 stones on the third line and your opponent is on the fourth.     Not only that, but but it makes white 15C a perfect attack as it has D4 on the fourth line to offer support against a pincer.     In case of black going to 16F white can extend to 12C and black still can't be too sure of the top side as his stone at R16 is far away.     But then again, at kyuu level you should be able to cope with openings like these as your opponent wouldn't know how to punish you properly.]
;B[oc]C[Gote. You protect the corner yes. But now white has the iniciative. In this position white would usually extend from his 4th line stones. With your stones on the fourth lines this move seems somewhat heavy.]
;W[fd]
(;B[ce];W[ef]C[A little bit submissive for my taste. You could have played at 15D, putting more pressure on 6 a running through the sixth line.]
;B[qk]C[I understand the value on this point, but the whole board situation calls for an attack on the left fisrt and then this point.     But this invites an invation( as indeed happened) and in a running chase white has the stones on the left to get support.     I would recommend R11 instead as it leaves less space for invation.]
;W[qf];B[qh]C[I felt very good about this situation on the right side. Driving around weak groups builds territory, but I was not able to find a way to get territory from this running battle, only thickness.          All your stones now lay on the third line the top is open for white and yes, you are chasing the groups. But does that really help you? Black 5 doesn't put a whole lot of pressure on white..]
;W[of];B[ne]C[I decided to drive the white stones downward to keep the f16-f14 stones separated from the weak group. I had reservations about doing this, however, because it would seriously weaken my two stones on the right side.]
;W[nf];B[pe];W[pf];B[me];W[lc]
(;B[kd]C[This was an attempt to lean on the white group on the top before I attacked O14-R14.]
;W[jb];B[kc];W[kb];B[hc];W[hb];B[ic]C[Better to keep pressing white against the second line..]
;W[gb]C[Now white connects easily.];B[fc];W[gc];B[ec];W[hd]
C[This hurt pretty badly. Not only did it protect against the cut at G16, it also destroyed the influence of the top middle group.]
;B[id];W[he];B[lg];W[ld]
(;B[le];W[nh];B[mi]C[?     Why defend the center? White ix powerful now that he's gone out and the black and white stones just guarantee that there wont be much territory there in the future, better to chase from the right and get out of the third line quickly, especially with white going out. and developing a wall that makes your two line extesion in the right look feeble.]
;W[ni]
(;B[mj]C[This];W[nj];B[nl];W[nk];B[mk];W[pk];B[ql];W[pl]C[See var.]
;B[nm];W[pm]C[I felt this could have turned out much better.          Yep,should have chased from the right side instead of chasing from the center.     There could have been a happier ending for black if 15H weren't on the board.]
;B[np];W[qm];B[rm];W[rn];B[rk]C[to connect is better than to create a false eyer]
;W[sm];B[pj];W[oj];B[pi];W[qg];B[rg];W[rf];B[sg];W[sf];B[rh]
;W[ri]C[here's where you should have played to make living easier.]
;B[rj];W[si];B[qi];W[rl];B[sj]C[This wasn't actually necessary, better an attack on D4]
;W[ph];B[dg]C[I was going to try to get 4th line territory along the left side with this and then negate all white center thickness with my wall on the right.          Then again, keep consitent with your strategy. either take the side or the center. if white runs with you it will totally negate the effect of your wall.]
;W[df];B[cf];W[ch];B[cj];W[cg];B[dh];W[ci];B[di];W[bj]
(;B[ck];W[bk];B[cl];W[bl];B[cm];W[bm];B[co]C[I felt really good about this wall on the left also. I had driven white along the 2nd and 3rd lines. The D4 stone was bothering me though, so I tried to cut it off with this move. I was unsure about this move even while making it because white had plenty of room to run.               Your line of thinking is good. 2 powerfull walls on each side. are good. But white has D4, 14E and 15H. All in good position to reduce black's territory, they make black's stones inneficient.]
;W[bo];B[cp];W[cn];B[dn];W[bn];B[do];W[ep];B[gp];W[fo];B[fn]
;W[go];B[hp]C[Should be G6 if you are going for the center.]
;W[hn];B[gg]C[This was the beginning of an attempt to make a large center territory by attacking the white group on top and then cutting off the 5 white stones on the bottom left.          This group lives comfortably. The 4 stones on the bottom are uncuttable as they are connected by a diagonal conection.]
;W[hg];B[hh];W[ig];B[ih];W[jg]
(;B[kf]C[Now I wish I would have played this at K12. I might have lost the 5 black stones in the center top, but i would have had a strong wall enclosing the center.          No easy way around this, see var.     But now that I see it, the cause of your wall being broken is not this move, but your next.]

In various books, when a player attacks a weak group in a running battle, the wall that is produced usually ends up creating a large moyo. I did not see that in this game though. I felt I had a large lead and then white just slowly whittled it down to nothing.          Manuel:     This happened mainly because you seemed undecesive whether to go for the center or the sides during key moments in the game.,. Then when you let white into your center territory instead of fighting back there is little to hope for. In a game you must stick to your strategy and  adapt accordingly.]
