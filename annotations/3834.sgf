C[Hi,

I'm Joona Karjalainen (tarragone in KGS), 10 kyu in Finland. I will write "T:" before my comments so it's easier to tell them from yours.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[qp];B[ec]LB[do:A]C[T: I would play at A.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nc]LB[qh:A]C[i thought i should have played at O16 instead after i played this move. just to balance out territory and influence

T: I think A would be logical, because now you have four stones on one side.]
;W[qi]LB[pj:A]C[T: White really likes the third line. I'd prefer a move like A.]
;B[oq];W[pq];B[op];W[qm];B[kq];W[mp];B[mq];W[nq]LB[np:A]C[T: Often in situations like this, cutting is the only move. However, I cannot really criticize the result.]

(;B[nr];W[lq];B[np];W[lp];B[lr];W[kp];B[jq];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip]
C[T: It is noticeable that white didn't really use the thickness in this game.]
;B[do];W[co]LB[cn:A]C[T: I would play simply at A]
(;B[eq]C[i knew this could be cut but i thought if he cut me i would simply connect it to my K3 Group.

T: This is a difficult move. I wouldn't be so sure about connecting, see variation.

I believe this isn't a good move.]
(;W[dp]C[T: It's a good move by white.];B[ep];W[dr]LB[hq:A]
C[i thought this was a small move for now so i ignored it

T: Your three stones seem weak and white can still cut at A]
;B[dn];W[cn];B[dm];W[fo]C[T: As a general rule, you should try to find alternatives for simply connecting.]

(;B[eo];W[gp]
(;B[gq]LB[cm:A]C[T: I don't think there is much to defend here. If you want to have your stones safe, you can play at A]
;W[fm];B[hp]C[T: I think this is aji-keshi. That is, white gets a safe shape for free.]
;W[ho];B[hq];W[im];B[fn]C[T: What's the point? There are big points on the board.]
;W[gn];B[en]C[T: Looks like an "automatic" move that doesn't do much. You could have done much better.]
;W[go];B[dk]LB[cj:A]C[i played this hoping that it would have the same effect as (A) or about the same anyway

T: I think it's a big difference.]
(;W[cl];B[ck]C[T: Good.];W[dl];B[el];W[cm]
(;B[em]LB[ek:A]C[T: A instead.];W[ek]
(;B[gm]C[and then things sort of changed into a very long fight all over the board]
;W[fl];B[fk]C[double atari :-)];W[gl];B[ej]LB[lc:A]C[T: I feel black is leading now. Getting the cutting stone here gave black a moyo. A is a good idea for white. If he gets in a trouble, he can connect with stones in the center and on the right side.]
;W[df]
(;B[ch]C[T: White's invasion was deep. This answer is too careful.]
;W[gk]LB[gj:A]C[T: Black can just play at A];B[fj];W[gj];B[gi]
;W[ij]
(;B[hi]C[T: Good.]
(;W[hj];B[gf];W[ii];B[on];W[mn];B[nm];W[mm];B[nl];W[ml];B[nk]
LB[jd:A]C[T: White's central territory is small. Maybe it would be a good time to play around A now?]
;W[qk];B[mj];W[mk];B[lj];W[nj];B[ni];W[oj];B[mh]LB[jc:A]C[we sort of almost surrounded half of the board and left the other open. i don't know why it happened it doesn't usualy happen but this game it just semed like there were moves i could play.

i also noticed (A) was left alone until now even though it was a big move

T: Correct.];W[ih];B[gh]LB[jd:A]C[T: I wonder what you're afraid of here.]

(;W[gc]LB[jc:A]C[y didn't he invade at (A)? that would have made his life much easier wouldn't it?]
;B[fd]LB[jc:A]SQ[df]C[I didn't want it to connect with the marked stone or else i would have playe around (A) to put pressure on the stone, and deny it a base.

[ks][ls][ms][ns][os][qs][rs][ss]C[Thanks for your help,

I have one more question. It's about counting.

Do you count how many territory you have, they have, etc and judge whether you are winning or not during a game? can you give me some tips on that? i find that when i count, i tend to estimate, and i'm off by about 8-10 points usually.

Thanks again,
Akimatsu


T: In slow games, I do count maybe about 3 times per game. Counting during middle game is difficult, but you can make decisions on how aggressively you will play, based on that counting. In the endgame, I count almost all points one by one. At first it is slow but as you practise you gain speed soon.

However, I don't think you have to practice counting at this level. There were a lot of small mistakes in the game and I believe that you could have avoided these with a little reading, just avoid making moves automatically.
