C[Hello, thank you for taking the time to look over this game.  It was a close game that I ended up losing by just a little.  I feel that I played strongly and that I started out with an advantage, which is why I would like to have the game reviewed.  I have made specific notes on the moves where they apply.

Comments:

Overall the game was played very well, the attacking was great.  I would say the game was lost in end game however, and sente was lost too often as were many big moves.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp]
(;B[cn];W[ed];B[cg];W[dc]C[This move is non-joseki so I get a few points out of it.]
;B[cc];W[hd]LB[jc:A][qn:E][fp:B][np:D][fq:C]C[this is pretty good for white, but black gets a few moves that would severly damage white.

They should be kept in mind concerning your next moves.

B and C are good to damage the white corner, but since the stone is already there, you can even ignore and take D or E.  E would be nice to setup for A]

(;B[fq];W[dn];B[dm];W[co];B[en];W[bn]C[This mistake is what gives me the advantage early in the game.

Reviewer: You are correct.  This was quite damaging for white.  The move at d5 is correct.]
;B[do];W[bp]LB[bm:F][cm:E][pn:A][qn:B][ep:G][np:C][nq:D]C[Although b7 is a good solid move, i would be more inclined to make a move at A/B or C/D to help develop your current moyo.

I would not worry about the ko at E since black also has a great move at k17, this would setup mulitple ko threats on the same group.

F and G can be miai to defend your group.];B[bm]C[this  compliments the stone at C13 and is very solid.]
;W[eq]
(;B[fp];W[cq]C[I end in sente and with bit influence.

This worked out great, playing it to the end is worth the sente.]
;B[jq];W[lq]LB[qn:B][mp:A]C[I felt that this was too close to me so I tried to punish with a move on the other side.  Is there a better way to do that?


Reviewer:  I would ignore this move, and play at k17.

I would not worry about punishing it right now.  I would consider the shoulder hit at n4, but r6 is good as a move to make later on.]
;B[qn];W[nc]C[this complicates things a bit.  It would be good to play a bit more conservativly as you did.  This helps in fixing up the problem at k17.

I would play k17 now and work with the complications.]
(;B[qf];W[kc]
(;B[pb]C[I was unsure about this move.  It would be joseki for him to take it, so I took it on that logic.  Perhaps leave it for something else?

I would have played r3 instead.];W[qg];B[pg];W[qe];B[pf];W[qh]
;B[rf];W[ph]
(;B[nq]CR[pj]TR[qg][ph][qh]C[In retrospect, I would like to have put pressure on his marked group.  Perhaps I should have played at the marked point.]

;W[om]SQ[qg][ph][qh]C[Now that group is nicely placed for him.

Reviewer:  If you build the base at r9 first, you would still have a convenient way to escape.  This has pulled white quite ahead.]

(;B[ke]C[I shouldn't have played this.

Reviewer: I agree.];W[je];B[kf];W[jj]
(;B[dj]C[I was looking for an alternative to this move.  I didn't want to leave him invasion space.  I often have problems thinking something is territory when it isn't, so I was trying to avoid that.  I thought about E13.]
;W[cj];B[ci];W[di];B[ch];W[ej];B[dk];W[ei]C[Is there a better play here, or should I take the territory and be satisfied?

Reviewer: it was good to take the territory.  Black has solid territory and black can take away any change of large territory in the middle.]

(;B[ek]CR[ee][ig]C[Here I considered the marked points for carving out his moyo.  I decided on the one I did because I thought that I had potential for territory there, not just for destroying his.

Reviewer:  

The move at e15 has potential, but it gives white a solid wall for territory.

j13 is better in this situation, especially after e9.];W[fk]
