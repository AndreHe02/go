;B[fe];W[pj]C[This was probably a bad move. It let milax make a huge moyo. (Dan =
Amodeo)

I think it's a good move, well balanced with your stones on the right =
side. The only problem here is black's one stone ahead, but that's =
always the case!

You should look next after your upper left group, it should develop =
soon.];B[dj]C[This is a very good move, but you should be able to counteract.]
;W[qq]C[I think this invasion is premature: what about invading his moyo at, =
say, D6? Or maybe O4 to destroy his lower right corner?];B[pq]
;W[qp];B[po];W[qo]C[As you can see now, he's developing a big territory, while you're only =
getting a few points. Not a very good deal.];B[qr]C[Bad, Q6 was better.]
;W[on]C[I thought this was better than Q6, but now I'm not sure. (Dan Amodeo)

It was weaker, but I think Q6 was too slow.

However, I think you should have invaded his moyo instead of pressing =
from outside. Your group was not in danger, so...];B[np]C[Very slow of black...at the very least, O5]
;W[mo]C[Nice, a knight-pressing move.];B[mp];W[lo];B[lp];W[le]
C[Now it's *your* moyo which is looking big! But, I still think invading =
was better.];B[qf]C[This is the problem: your moyo is big, but open to invasion. You won't =
be able to kill this move, but you should try!];W[qh]C[Not the move to kill: black can live in the corner. Better, R15 or R16 =
and chase him

He'll now take the corner...];B[qd];W[qc];B[rd]C[I don't know what I should have done here. What I did didn't work out =
very well. (Dan Amodeo)

The problem was the R12 move... now, he should live];W[rc];B[pe]
;W[od];B[rg];W[rh];B[sg];W[qg];B[pg];W[sh];B[re];W[of]C[I think it's time to look away (tenuki). You can still invade!

Always think about stopping an attack when it's not worth...]
;B[pf];W[og];B[ph];W[qi];B[oh];W[lg];B[jf];W[eg]C[No! this move invites him to reinforce his left side. It's still  time =
to invade (C6...)

Try always to imagine his answer, and you'll  avoid this kind of moves: =
you make no territory, he reinforces himself];B[ch]C[Ops! Problems ahead...]
;W[hg]C[What's the purpose of this move? This black group his really hard to =
kill, if possible.

I think you lost focus...];B[hf]C[All these moves are a little bit out of order: The critical zone is =
the lower left side];W[ig];B[if]C[He's making territory, and you?]
;W[gg]C[This move is better left unplayed: you can connect at G13 (this move) =
or K13, which makes miai: no need to play either yet.];B[kb]
;W[eb]C[Good.];B[fb];W[ec];B[ed];W[ee];B[fd];W[gf]C[Endgame move: just 1 point, and...]
;B[ge];W[ff];B[de]C[This is the problem: too much weakenesses.]
;W[cd];B[ef];W[df];B[ee];W[ce];B[ea];W[db];B[da];W[ca];B[fa]
;W[cb];B[dm]C[Oh oh, now he's really reinforced. Time to san-san. (invading at C3)]

(;W[fp]C[I've got to do something fast to reduce milax's moyos and get some =
territory for myself. This looked like the best place to start, but I =
think it let milax turn his moyos into more territory than I got. What =
should I have done here, or was the game lost already? (Dan Amodeo)

I think a C3 approach (see variation just in case), and the trying to =
reduce from above was a better tactics; however, the game was difficult =
already.];B[dq];W[hq];B[iq];W[in];B[ko];W[kn];B[jn];W[jm];B[jo]

;W[fn];B[eo];W[fo];B[en];W[fl];B[ni]C[You're attack's been succesfull anyhow, but he managed to get a lot of =
territory.

Unless you make a big center territory, which is really difficult, =
you're lost.];W[lj]C[Good.];B[jg];W[jh];B[ej]C[Slow. Better F10.]
;W[gj]C[Good.];B[eh];W[fh];B[dg];W[fg]C[No need, just 1 point, better get sente, then play M18, O9... big =
endgame points.];B[fi];W[gi];B[fj];W[gk]C[Why not F9?];B[ng]

C[No more comments. Just two suggestion:

- never "automatically" answer a move; you give away sente very easily.

- stop every 20 or so moves (or better, when local situations settles) =
and look at the whole board; you'll find better moves.

Good luck.
