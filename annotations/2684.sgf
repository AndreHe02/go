;B[qc];W[rc]C[It is not normal to play here in this joseki.]
;B[fc]C["But I'm not sure of this move. After I played this, I wished I had played K4"

This is the wrong direction. If the follow up in the top right leaves B strong then, because N17 is low, the top is not interesting.  If, on the other hand, B ends up weak at the top right then this is too far away to help.  A kakari in the lower left would be best.]
;W[id]C["Good, so I can go into the corner, take territory (which I like, very much) and then take K4"

This is tue, but K4 is not the most important.  Also, because N17 is low, it is not so important to go into the corner.  A counter pincer is also a nice option.]

LB[ch:A]C[There is nothing really wrong with this sequence, but the B stones do not have a big an effect on the lower left and W can  play at 'A' to help establish a position on the left.]
;B[jp]C[I'm happy now :)];W[hq];B[ho]C[I usually end up with territory everywhere, and my opponent has all the influence, so I thought I could take some influence for a change]
;W[gp]C[Not so good when then corner is open.];B[co]LB[ho:A]
C['What is the best approach in this situation? Is this too near?'

Not too near.  The question is whether it is the best kakari.  After B'a' it is hard for W to get outside influence so perhaps B should enter at the 3-3 point.  W would then be hard pressed to make good shape.]
;W[cq];B[cl]LB[ch:A][co:B]C[This leaves B with a low position on the left.  Also, 'a' is sente for W so it is hard for B to turn this into a good position. Having said that it is hard to find anything much better after B'b']
;W[cj]C[Wrong point. 'a' is better]

C12 is much better as it defends the corner.];W[di];B[dk];W[ch]

LB[fi:A]TR[dk][ho]C[B has not gain a lot by this seuqence. 'a' helps W much more than anything B has gained.  B now needs to connect the marked stones in order to retreive anything.]
;B[kc]LB[ke:B][ej:A]C["My idea was to threaten to activate F17's potential, extend my territory, and when white defends, jump and try to reduce his ability to expand his moyo. If he doesn't defend... well, I guess I didn't have a plan for that... which I realised as soon as I clicked on the board."

There is no reason for W to defend as the resulting territory would be small.  Much better for W to press at  'a'  and the cap at 'b' and aim for a central moyo]
;W[jc]C[Luckily he defended];B[ke]C[Bad exchange for W. He should be playing for a central moyo.]

;W[hf];B[ig];W[hg];B[og]LB[if:A]SQ[hf][hg][ig]C["Now I got greedy.... I always do that... maybe J2, or P8?"

B show never leave the marked stones like this - a hane for W is way too good. Also, pushing at 'A' has little value as W is open at the left.  Both J2 and P8 are better.]
;W[of];B[pf];W[pg];B[pe]LB[qe:A]C[Why not 'A'?  It is sente.]

Q11 in sente before this move is correct.];W[nh];B[oi];W[ni]

;B[nk]C[I was happy to be able to turn here....];W[mj];B[mk]

;B[lb]LB[ie:B][ne:A][ii:C]C["I was afraid of my ability to live here, so I just wanted to be sure. Looking back, it looks too small, white should answer this."

There is no rush to play this in gote.  B can play 'A' and 'B' in sente before jumping to 'C']
;W[jb]C["But he does.... I won't complain..."

Gote.  B is alive.];B[kk]LB[ir:A]C["Looks like I can hurt him if he doesn't respond, but I'm actually not sure."

;W[ii];B[hh];W[ik];B[gh]TR[ik]C["You reduce me, I reduce you."

B now has a huge lead and should not be able to lose.];W[or]
LB[pq:A]C["  "No you won't" white says. Ok, so how do I answer this? Is the kind of move that gets on my nerve.  And I'm never happy with the result.

After this point I added variations to illustrate some things I saw as possibilities at the time... they are the product of me just happily clicking on the board, so please ignore the really bad moves they have :) Just comment on the concepts of the first move and the intention of the continuation."

SF:  This is too late. No way this can live.  If B pulls back to 'A' is it hard to find a move for W]

That is also good, but there is nothing wrong with this is the follow up is correct.]

And that is exactly where you did lose it.  You had many ways to kill.  Most of the rest of the game was much more reasonable., but you cannot play at 1d if you cannot kill groups like that one.]
