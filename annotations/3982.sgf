AB[pd][dp][pp]C[[dww\] games are won and lost by only one point. While there were several places where I noticed a few mistakes throughout the game, the very last move I overlooked _the_ last 1 point play and played a dame point instead. I lost by 1/2 point.

[fgb\] w missed some opportunities and played a little slack so felt lucky to end up with the win.

[ZD\] Hello. I am now 6k on kgs, which is not that much stronger than you, so please do not take my comments too seriously, and if you disagree with anything, feel free to contact me by e-mail.  I will mark my comments with [ZD\].

I will try to point out the places where one of the players could tenuki but did not; however, my impression is that this is not the main problem.]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[fc]
(;B[di]C[[ZD\] This is definitely playable, but the variations seem more efficient to me.]
;W[qf];B[pi]
(;W[pg]LB[of:A]C[[ZD\] This is too slow; better at A.  The outcome in variation can then be expected.]
;B[of]LB[rd:A]C[[ZD\] Black cannot close W, and since W has a strong position in upper left corner, making thickness in that direction is not very useful.  I am not really sure what is the best move here, I would consider A to secure the corner and prevent W from making a base.]
;W[og];B[nf];W[rd];B[qc];W[oi]
(;B[pj]C[[ZD\] It is hard to attack W, so this move looks a bit heavy.]
;W[qh]LB[mh:A]TR[pi][pj]C[[fgb\] r12 felt slow.

[ZD\] r12 secures base and weakens triangled stones, so I think it is OK. Other possibility is to jump to A. Tenuki now would not be too good, as r12 would also be a very good point for black.]

(;B[kc]LB[hc:A][ri:C][jp:B]TR[pi][pj]C[[ZD\] This is too slow -- you play too close to your thickness.  A would be interesting.  B is the biggest move. C threatens to take base of the white stones, and helps the triangled group a bit.]
;W[ic]LB[bd:A]C[[fgb\] this feels too low, w possibly should have capped at L15

[ZD\] Neither J17 nor L15 are too important -- they are basically miai. If you need to help the corner, A seems better to me.]
;B[ke]TR[pi][pj]SQ[di]C[[dww\] I'm feeling pretty good about my opening lead so far

[ZD\] Black has some 20 pts of territory now, white has say 10. Black has weak group (the triangled one), while white is quite solid. The square stone is too far from the lower left corner, so white can split there and make troubles.  I think the game is about even, W might be leading a bit.]
;W[qn]TR[pi][pj]C[[ZD\] I like this move -- separating the marked group is important.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[ql]LB[qo:A]C[[ZD\] I think W should have played at A now -- if B does not answer, you gain the corner.]

(;B[ok];W[qo];B[qp];W[om];B[nn];W[nm];B[ni]TR[ql][nm][om][pm]
[qn][qo]C[[dww\] I was starting to worry about my center side stones

[ZD\] I think the sequence in game is correct to help them.  It also makes it possible to attack the triangled stones.]
;W[nh];B[nj];W[lh];B[li];W[kg];B[ji];W[po]C[[dww\] rats, I knew I left something unfinished there

[ZD\] Just give up the three stones, and be happy about the points you get on the bottom -- W is forcing you to make territory on the 4th line.]

(;B[np];W[oo];B[no];W[op];B[oq];W[rp]C[[fgb\] missed opportunity; w should have cut immediately at o3 or q3.

[ZD\] Possibly; but you gain from this sequence as well, and you can still cut later.]
;B[qq]LB[nq:B][pq:C][rq:A]C[[ZD\] Making this empty triangle does not seem very useful -- w can still cut at B. Playing at A seems too dangerous, I would consider connecting at either B or C.]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[nq]C[[dww\] uh oh, looks like I might lose either one group or the other

[ZD\] The variations are difficult, I think you should lose something but I am not entirely sure.]
;B[mq];W[nr];B[or]
(;W[lo]C[[dww\] hummm... I was fearing N2. now I feel like I can protect both with M4 then M2

[ZD\] White decided to help you.  The other possibility now is to play N2 directly.]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[jq];W[km];B[kk]LB[hi:A]C[[dww\] I'm feeling like I need eyespace for this center group

[ZD\] Making eyes in the center is the last choice, not the first one, so if you are worried about your group, jumping to A would be better.  However, your move also threatens to cut white as in the variation, which is more important.]

(;W[ln];B[mr]C[[dww\] maybe that wasn't necessary?

[ZD\] Definitely no -- this move just loses one point and sente.]
;W[iq]LB[io:B][ip:A]C[[ZD\] Bad idea, white will just get cut. B is solid, and after A, extension to B is sente for him, so you could not profit from this fight.]
;B[ip];W[cn];B[fq];W[bp];B[cq];W[ck];B[bd];W[cc]C[[dww\] I remember doing a quick count durning the game and feeling like I was still comfortabily ahead (I didn't take the time to count any more later in the game)

[ZD\] I count 40 for B and say 30 for W, and B does not have too serious weakness now.  B will probably capture j4  and gain even more territory, while it will be difficult for W to gain too much anywhere, so you are indeed ahead.]
;B[io]TR[ko]SQ[jp][kp]C[[dww\] small forcing move as I'm aiming to connect in the center

[ZD\] W should ignore this move.  J3 is now totally dead, so the squared stones have no purpose any more (they are just 4 points).  You still need to play at triangle to take them, so W gets two free moves, more than compensating for the loss.]
;W[jn];B[bi]C[[ZD\] Solid move, fixing the last potential weakness (the stones on right also are not completely safe, so you need to take care about them, but that should not be difficult.]
;W[fo]C[[ZD\] It might be possible to tenuki here, but the variations are complicated, so it is better not to risk it.]
;B[gp];W[en]LB[bc:B][rc:C][fk:A][bq:D]C[[ZD\] W should now try something larger.  Perhaps A, also threatening to separate B groups. B, C and D are also big, and if they are ignored, they have big followups.]
;B[ik]LB[jf:D][gg:E][ig:C][fi:B][hi:A]C[[dww\] a little more eyespace in case I can't connect

[ZD\] This definitely is slow -- you need to support this group, but jumping to A is better.  If W tries B to separate, you can jump to C and futher threaten to connect, by playing D or E.]
;W[bq];B[br];W[mk]C[[ZD\] I think this can be ignored -- the cut seems not to work.]

(;B[lj];W[mc]LB[lb:B][lc:A]C[[dww\] nice. I'm not quite sure how to respond. I need to get over my fear of invasions.

[ZD\] He cannot make eyes here. His only hope is to connect out, so you must prevent this. I would consider A or B.]
;B[md]LB[kb:A]C[[ZD\] This is bad.  By attaching, you give him chance to get stronger. Also, it does not entirely eliminate possibility to connect at A (although it does not work directly).]

(;W[nd]
(;B[oc]LB[me:A]TR[nc]C[[dww\] should I have just cut? But I wanted to at least be able to live in the corner in case my groups got split here.

[ZD\] I would extend to A. White cannot cut, see the variations.]
;W[ld];B[me]
(;W[kb]C[[dww\] Why didn't white cut at L16?

[ZD\] Something like the variation.];B[lc];W[lb]
(;B[nc];W[mb];B[kd]TR[nb]C[[dww\] I'm hoping I can come back later to protect my weakness in the corner.

[ZD\] See the variations at move 89.];W[ie];B[jf]LB[rc:A]C[[ZD\] You should first play A, otherwise you are just forcing W to take a big point.]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[ef];B[bc];W[bb];B[if];W[he];B[ek]LB[ge:B][gf:C]
[if:A]TR[hf]C[[dww\] maybe I should have extended one more instead?

[ZD\] You should not have pushed at A at all. If you don't play it, you may still hope to be able to play at B later. If W plays at A himself, C still reduces him by about the same amount A did.]
;W[ch];B[bh];W[cg];B[bg];W[df];B[ci]TR[dg]C[[dww\] another forcing move]
;W[eh];B[dk];W[cp];B[dr];W[cl];B[fi];W[rj]C[[dww\] that was good -- wished I had seen that sooner.]

(;B[nb]C[[dww\] so now I can't afford to lose that too.];W[sb]
;B[ra]LB[qb:A][qd:B]C[[ZD\] Better at A, so that B is not sente.]
;W[qd];B[pb];W[pe];B[oe];W[lf];B[mg]C[[dww\] I think you were hoping to get N13 also, so I decided to take it myself -- realizing that I'll still have time to either take M16 or something bigger. (I was actually a little pleased with this move)]
;W[mh];B[lg]C[[dww\] yes, you still can't rescue M16];W[jh]
;B[jg]C[[dww\] hummm... now I'm wondering if I've made a mistake.]
;W[ih]
(;B[hi]C[[dww\] yep, this was a mistake for sure.];W[kf];B[le]
C[[dww\] can't afford to lose 7 stones (though I still hadn't fully realized my mistake yet)]
;W[je]LB[gg:A]C[[ZD\] A to threaten to save the stones is about the best you can get here now]
;B[hg];W[hf];B[hh]C[[dww\] best I can do now :(

[ZD\] better keep this -- it is not that big, and sente for you.]
;W[ig];B[gm];W[ei];B[ej];W[fh];B[gh]LB[gi:A]C[[ZD\] A might be better, not to create a weakness (you will have to play there anyway, most likely).]
;W[ii];B[ij];W[jl]C[[ZD\] This can be ignored.];B[jk];W[fl]
;B[fm]
(;W[em];B[el];W[cj]LB[fj:A]C[[ZD\] Fixes blacks aji (there might be some double-atari possible at A later), and does not gain much.]
;B[dj]TR[ce][fj]C[[dww\] did I need to connect here? I was worried about these weaknesses

[ZD\] It is definitely better, especially since it did not cost you anything.]
;W[gg]C[[dww\] mistake?...

[ZD\] Yes.  You need to consider one more variation for white, but that does not work for him, either.]

(;B[gj]C[[dww\]... but I didn't see it until after I played (because I was worried only about my own weaknesses)

[fgb\] w also was too focused on b's weaknesses];W[dh];B[cd]
;W[cb];B[rr];W[ar];B[bs];W[do];B[ep];W[sr]
(;B[ak]TR[al]C[[dww\] I suppose I should have streached one further

[fgb\] yes i thought that was funny.  a normal 3-space monkey jump would have given b 1 more point.

[ZD\] but gote, so the small one may be better. Also, there is a mistake in the provided variation for the monkey jump.]

;W[oj];B[nk];W[ml];B[ki];W[kh]LB[jf:A][pf:B][qg:C][kh:D]C[[fgb\] unnecessary wasted move by w

[ZD\] Two points in gote, more precisely -- if black plays D, white will have to connect at A later. Also, when black plays B in sente, white would have to play at C.]
;B[ce]C[[fgb\] w should have wedged in there (c15) earlier

[ZD\] Yes, you should first play all sente moves (except for those that are still too small and not too interesting for the other side).]
;W[de];B[jc];W[jb];B[ab];W[dl]C[[fgb\] this was gote, w should have looked harder for a sente move (but was in byo-yomi).]
;B[jo];W[ko];B[eo];W[fn];B[pf];W[qe];B[mn]C[[dww\] oops, forgot about the snapback...]
;W[mm];B[mp]C[[dww\] so I had to connect in gote];W[qj];B[pk]

;W[fp];B[gq]LB[eq:A]C[[dww\] last point move.  I had to connect -- and I lost by 1/2 point :(

[ZD\] You are lucky, see the followup (you have to connect at A.]

(;W[jm];B[hm];W[aa]LB[mc:A]C[last recorded move... the rest are dame

[ZD\] It is hard to tell what decided this game. Definitely, black could have handled the invasion at A better, and did not have to risk the cuts in lower right corner.  White on the other hand should get the lower right corner.  But given the close result, any of the small mistakes would be sufficient to change it.]
