Helcio: Greetings from Brazil.

This was a very nice game and you showed nice fighting spirit. You asked me to comment on your fuseki because you felt that playing white was hard.

When you play white you must keep in mind that you start with 6.5 komi in your cash. It's not too much, but it is something.

Overall I felt that you and your opponent lacked of some concepts in the fuseki and early chuban.

About Fuseki:

I strongly recomend the book "Tn the beginning" by Ikuro Ishigure (8p). It will teach you to play fuseki in a classical way that will surely help you. It talks about nice fuseki concepts:

1) Make You Stones Work Together

2) Efficiency

3) Play Away From Strength

4) Thickness and Walls

5) Open at the Bottom

6) The Third and Fourth

7) Reverse Strategy

8) Light and Heavy

9) Attack and Defense

I tried to show during the review some of this concepts. The book has also talks about other things related to fuseki as shimari, kakari, extensions, extensions to the center, pincer attack, invasions, pushing and crawling and natural development of corner stones.

About Early Chuban:

I felt that both opponents was not able to recognise weak groups, or perhaps, didn't know how to attack it. Also, didn't recognise thickness and walls, or maybe, didn't know how to use it.

Walls:
a) "Use walls to attack"
b) "Don't use walls to build territory"

Walls is better used to attack and not to make territory. Making territory with walls is very inefficent because you usually end up investing a huge amount of stones for a modest territory.

Thickness:

"Play away from thickness".

A group is thick when it has no weakness or when it is alive and any play around it changes this status. A thick group has a power that is felt around it. If you have a thick group and plays near it, it will be inefficient because you aren't making it strong because it is as strong as it can be. There is no point in making a live group more alive. Also, there is no point in attacking an alive group. The attack just doesn't have enough power and the attacking stone will probably be subject of an attack itself.

So, many times in your game you came behind on territory not because of a bad joseki choice, but because your play lacked efficience if compared with your opponent although you were tatically stronger than him!

Well, after such a long introdution, I hope you enjoy the review as much as I enjoyed reviewing your game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]LB[iq:a][ip:b]C[Helcio:
Black K4 is a slight overplay because white's keima response to black kakari is solid and strong. White can invade later at H3 . Another way to view this is that black needs to reinforce at F5 later so that K4 is not a efficient move.

Better play: J3(a) or J4(b)]
(;W[nc]LB[qn:a][ce:b]C[Ramanujan [7k?\]: ko every time bigger
Ninjinka [8k\]: ahahah i'm 8 year old... you know...

Helcio: This is a nice move, but I'm afraid it is not the biggest move around. Making a shimari at C15 is a bit better than the move you made. You get about 10 points in the corner and your territory would count to about 16.5 while black gets a big framework but no sure territory. See the variation for a possible flow of the game after C15.

Said that, a kakari at R6 is also big and it can control black framework.]
;B[pj]C[Helcio: This is a very provocative but also risky move, as white get's a big corner. It sets some traps.]

(;B[pg]C[markus [7k\]: ok, back to the game

Helcio: A bad move as comented. Black gets nothing with it.]
;W[ce]C[Xan [-\]: if b on top w d10

Helcio: After black mistake, this is a very good move.]
(;B[ic]
(;W[kc]LB[gc:a]C[Ramanujan [7k?\]: g17
markus [7k\]: l17?
Ramanujan [7k?\]: yes

Helcio: This is the wrong direction :( G17 is the right direction and you can play sente move ate S16 to make your corner group stronger and unconditionaly alive. Please, check the variations.

This is the point that your fuseki play start to go on the wrong way. You are actually ahead here and could get a big lead.]
;B[fc]C[Ramanujan [7k?\]: tu che dici
Ramanujan [7k?\]: i dont like that];W[fd]C[Helcio: Not so good. Black stones are weak. So, don't touch them. You also lose sente with this sequence. At least you get a strong group as compensation. The value of this exchange depends on how well will you use this power later. Anyway, a dubious exchange at first sight.]
;B[gd]C[Helcio: Black could play just G17 and not give white shape.]
;W[fe];B[ec]C[Ramanujan [7k?\]: d16!];W[dd]C[markus [7k\]: i was not really happy with this
Ninjinka [8k\]: i was happy whit this :)
markus [7k\]: i force you to make good shape

Helcio: Question... You got happy with you good shape that gives you a nice thickness, but, how do you use it?]
;B[pq];W[re]C[Helcio: Oh no!!!! As I pointed out when this corner was played, this is a dead stone that is too small to be saved. You may think that you are taking territory from your opponent, but you are just moving it to place where it will be much bigger. Black invested a lot of stones to capture R14. This alone is enough pain for him. Now you turn his misplaced stone into a nice wall.

You got a nice thickness with your D16 group and should put it into use with a move around D10. Perhaps you can extend at G15 and then play at D10.]

Helcio: Pretas estão muito felizes => A comment for the brazilian audience :)

Black should really be very happy here! White lives but black gets much more on the outside and white corner is quite weak now. Also, white must live in gote, what makes the result even worse. 

Trying to make a dead stone alive gave your oponnent a big lead. From now you can only catch up with invasions, which are very hard to make because of black strong position. White game is difficult.]

(;W[hq]TR[nf][ng][oh][oi][pj]LB[jn:a][dj:b][ie:c]SQ[fe][fd]
[dd][ce][dc]C[Helcio: This has always been around. The question is if it 's the right moment for it. White R14 group needs a move to live and since you invested so much on it, you should not tenuki although living in gote is really bad for white.

But I think that you played here because you thought that your group was alive, but actually it depends on sente. This shows a point where you can improve: Life&Death.

Locally, H3 seems to soon since the corner is still open. In black next move I give an example of  sacrificing F3 stone and use the aji of it to get the corner.

 The most important things here are black marked stones and white marked ones. They are both strong and have a lot of potencial. Your move just ignore these stones and the power that they have. K6 (a) seems to be the key point for both sides. Its away enough from both strong groups, reduce black territory, make O5 and H3 miai and cooperates well with white strong group.

D10 (b) seems big, but it is too close to white strong groups to be as efficient as (a). Because it is not so big, it would be a bit slow to play here. Locally I'd play F10 or E9 to invite an invasion.

The cap J15 (c) is also another excellent key move. I show a variation with (a) only and one with (c) cooperating with (a) that seems to be the best.]

(;B[hp];W[gq];B[iq];W[gp]
(;B[cq]C[markus [7k\]: i think this is a mistake
Ramanujan [7k?\]: too tricky :-D

Helcio: This move is not wrong, it's just too soon to play it although it is big.]

(;W[cp]C[Ninjinka [8k\]: i want to play s13 or s11 but no time.

Helcio: Yep, its a small move as was the whole sequence. You need to get sente and play all big moves and hope that in the future you can play s13.]
;B[dq];W[fp];B[ep];W[eo];B[eq]
(;W[ho]C[Helcio: The variation that was analised at KGS by observers is better. Anyway, you lose a lot here due to tatics.]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[do]C[wyrms [9k\]: lÃ¤ski tummuu]
(;W[dn];B[co];W[di]C[Helcio: Ouch... If I can say something about this move, I would say that it is inefficient and slow. Too few for too much stones. This is a weakness I see in your game: You don't know how to handle influence and thickness.]
;B[fi]SQ[ec][fc][gd][ic]TR[oi][oh][ng][nf][pj]C[Ramanujan [7k?\]: w  must not give black an impressive wall like he did
markus [7k\]: the next sequence decided the outcome of this game in my opinion
Ramanujan [7k?\]: maybe h11 is risky now

Helcio: This is a slight overplay. Although black has a the strong marked group, he has the weak marked too. If he wants to reduce white, he should make his weak group stronger so that he can fight with free hands.]

The only point is that although white fought bravely, and got something in this unfavorable position, it was not enough to catch up. Black needs to improve his reading skill and make better shape over all. He lost many fights on tatics and didn't make the best of his position.]

(;B[og];W[oh];B[nj];W[nh];B[md]C[Helcio: White escapes into the center but black is building a huge moyo while attacking this groups. This is what I mean when I said that you where not taking away black territory, just moving it.
Also,  black can take away your eyes playing S13 and attack your corner with S17, S18.]
))
(;W[gc]TR[ge]C[Helcio: This is the right direction. An extension from a shimari is usually a big move.
Also, its important to see that this move has a much more territorial potencial than L17 because it has a good follow up at G15 while L15 isn't a good continuation from L17 because it needs one more move like N15 to start to build some territory, that, by the way, is smaller than what white gets with G17.]
;B[lc]C[Ramanujan [7k?\]: n18
marchetto [10k?\]: N16
Xan [-\]: d10 before top
Ninjinka [8k\]: hmmm..
Ramanujan [7k?\]: uhm better n16];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe]C[Helcio: The corner is alive in sente and G7 works well with shimari preparing to build a moyo with G15 that also puts a slight pressure on J17/M17 group. Also, after this exchange, there still remains aji in R14 stone :)

Lets do some counting here:

White: UL=15 points
           UR=10 points
           komi=6.5 points
           total-> 31.5 points 

Black: UG = 5 points
           RS = 14 points
          total -> 19 points

White has a nice lead (about 10 points, actually its more with sente) and although black has a lot of potencial for territory, he can't take it all because he has a weak group on the upper side.]

(;W[dj]C[marchetto [10k?\]: good
marchetto [10k?\]: to me
markus [7k\]: gote but huge
Xan [-\]: hard to really attack j17
markus [7k\]: biggest point for b now?
Ramanujan [7k?\]: center? f17 semms big to me
markus [7k\]: if i had the guts..

Helcio: G17 is bigger than D10! Also Xan comment that is hard to attack J17 is wrong. If he means it's hard to kill it, he is right, but to kill any stone or group is hard in go. But white can get a lot attacking the wariuchi J17.]

(;B[me]C[Helcio: This move is also possible. Let's talk about that R14 stone. It's is an almost dead stone and white should not try to make it live unless it is necessary. Black is strong all around and if you try to make it alive black will be able not to kill, but to get a strong attack on it a probably a big profit. Use this stone to play sente moves like s16 later in the game and it will reduce black framework nicely. For this same reason, black should not think about killing this stone.]
