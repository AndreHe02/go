AB[dd][dj][dp][pd][pj][pp]C[Hello, I'm white in this game.  Before I start, I want to say that my opponent was defenitely stronger than the 26k indicated.  I wanted to get a handicap game reviewed where I was white because I've been playing a lot of handicap games where I'm black lately and I think that it's improved my defensive ability, but my invading and attacking abilities haven't improved much.

Thanks for reviewing!

Hi, comments by Juho P, 5 kyu in Finland. As always, some maybe wrong so take them as my opinions.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[pr]C[JP: I cannot say this is bad, but it seems to me a bit slow way to play for white, in a high handicap game. White get's a strong position but so does black, and black gets sente too.

I think that in a high handicap game (if the goal is to win) white should avoid making moves that are easy to answer strongly by black. White should try spread the stones quite lightly around the board, so that white would be present everywhere. White has to leave some weaknesses and then just hope black cannot exploit them well.

I think going to F3, F4, or G4, or some corner approach in the upper half of the board could be good.]
;B[qq];W[kq];B[np];W[mp];B[oq]
(;W[or]C[I think I should have gone O2 instead, given up the q2 stone, and extended into the center.

JP: O2 seems correct, but I would connect at P1 if white pushes (see variation).]
;B[mq];W[nr];B[lp]
(;W[mo]C[JP: This does not seem to work at all. You should admit your mistake and connect at N2 instead.]
;B[lq];W[mr]
(;B[lo]C[JP: Black should cut at M2 immediately. I think white can barely live in the corner, but completely surrounded, with only a couple weak stones outside.]
;W[oo]C[JP: This is not much good if black correctly plays P4. Therefore you should just M2.]

(;B[mn]C[Maybe I should have given up these 3 stones and tried playing elsewhere, but I was afraid of giving black too much influence here.  Should I have gone p4 instead to take the p3 stone?

JP: Yes you should have. This is a huge mistake by black, instead of P4.]

(;W[no];B[op];W[nn]C[JP: Now black can choose whether to kill O2 or O5 it seems.]
;B[nm];W[om];B[po];W[on];B[nl];W[ol];B[ok];W[ql];B[pl];W[pm]

(;B[pk]C[JP: R7 would be the easy capture for black (see var).]
;W[qm];B[qk];W[rn];B[rm];W[rl];B[ro];W[sm];B[so];W[rk];B[rj]
;W[sk];B[sn];W[sj];B[ri];W[si];B[rh];W[mm]C[JP: This should not work, so you should maybe play M2 to save at least something.]
;B[ln];W[lm];B[sh]C[JP: This is of course very unnecessary.]
;W[km];B[gq]
(;W[ef]C[yes, this was a trick play that looked like an attack on hoshi but actually set up the ladder.  Maybe I shouldn't have used it, but I figured the game would be more interesting this way. If he had responded correctly, I probably would have resigned after.

JP: Funny thing is, you don't need a ladder. See variation starting at O9. Try to learn about nets (geta). For them and capturing in general (among other things) I recommend 'Tesuji' book by Davies, or Kageyama's 'Lessons in the fundamentals of go'.

And this is otherwise a bad move that helps black greatly.]
;B[fc];W[nk];B[ml];W[mk];B[ll];W[lk]C[JP: Still, L9 is better ..]
;B[rm];W[kl]C[JP: Good to capture things inside ladders quickly, but you would have time to play M2 now, which is much more urgent.]
;B[cf];W[lr]C[JP: Good.];B[dm];W[kp]C[Maybe I shouldn't have killed those 6 stones and instead start invading as his left moyo is getting huge.

JP: Yes, this is a big gote capture but probably not big enough.]
;B[gn]C[JP: 'Fortunately' black makes this bad move. C4 e.g., closing the corner is much bigger, but upper side K16, O17 or such seems even bigger to me.]
;W[cq]C[I figure 3-3 invasion would be best here as he already has a lot of influence towards the center from this area, so giving him more isn't really going to make things worse.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[bp];B[bo];W[aq];B[cn];W[ds]
;B[gj]C[JP: Another bad move by black. This does not make much territory or attack E14 hard enough.]
;W[ei]C[JP: I don't think this is very good. This is easy to answer as D11. If you are going to leave the whole left side for black, you could leave the E14 stone for the time being and play on the upper side.

One could also try some attachments which often work when one is managing weak stones inside opponents moyo. Weaker player also easily answers them wrong. 

E.g. C13, C16, G17. I tried some variations but I am not good enough to give very good ones anyway ..]
;B[di];W[dh];B[ch];W[dg];B[cg]C[JP: At this point I would just leave the white stones here and play on the upper side. The white stones are not very easy to kill anyway.]

(;W[ej];B[gg]C[JP: This is not good, helps white fight. Black should play on the upper side]

(;W[gi]C[JP: G14 seems to be the right direction. It is not enouigh to connect your stones but you must try destroy what black is building on the upper side.]
;B[hi];W[gh];B[fe]C[maybe black should have gone h12?  It doesn't look like I have much room to escape or make eyes.

JP: After black H12, white could still escape by cutting at H13 I think.]

(;W[hh];B[hg];W[ih]C[JP: You must not push like this and let black make the wall facing upper side. This is the worst thing to do. You have to play on the upper side. White cannot prevent your escape by blocking at J12 because of the cutting points.]
;B[ig];W[jh];B[jg];W[kh];B[kg]C[I think I pushed too far because I was about to invade the top next and this black wall blocks my escape route from there if things get messy.  Then again, I want to be certain that I can connect these stones to my middle group.

JP: See earlier comments; You should have stopped at least 3 steps before.]
;W[jc]C[JP: No way! Much too close to the huge black wall. You need to play near the Q16 stone.]
;B[lc];W[hc]C[JP: These stones should be dead.]

C[well, I'm not too sure I'm that happy with the result.  I reduced his moyo a lot, but I only got about 6 points of territory  and he secured his territory to the top left and possibly top right.

JP: Well, you should be happy you lived :)];B[mi]C[Probably an overplay by black.

JP: Yes, and what makes it a bad move: an entirely unnecessary overplay.]
;W[mh];B[ni];W[oi];B[pi];W[oj]C[JP: Don't worry about the 2 black stones but about how to get to the upper right corner!]
;B[oh];W[nj]
(;B[lh];W[li];B[lg];W[og];B[ph];W[nf];B[mg];W[ng];B[ne]C[Do you think I should have tried killing the black Q8 and q10 groups here?  I didn't think my chances were very good, and if I failed, it probably meant I couldn't invade at the 3-3 point, which I wanted to do awhile ago.

JP: cannot kill, but maybe threatening at R14 would make it easier to get to the corner.]
;W[qc]C[JP: I think black could kill this, playing right. Maybe R16 would be better, either living in corner or linking to P13.]
