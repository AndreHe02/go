C[I have been told that
a) need to be more attacking
b) need to concentrate now upon my middle game moves where currently I react instantly as opposed to looking at bigger picture

In this game I conciously tried to address those areas and so would welcome comments in particular on phase of game between 45-120

I have tried to explain the thinking behind my moves and would welcome comments  on my strategy and ' the missed opportunities ' I just did not see.

Thanks Peter aka Ash];B[pd]C[Thames [19k\]: hello];W[pp];B[dc]

(;B[jc];W[pj]
(;B[cn]C[Considered c10 / q13 as alternatives but went for c6 as more aggressive, and i had the hope that his response might allow me to play c9 or c10 so creating a double wing formation

>agressive is good at the moment, as white's moyo can grow faster than yours you cannot let it be a peaceful game.

I would personally be much more aggressive... and attack at either O3 or R6... the reason being that this is white's power base and that if white were to play either of these moves it would be worth a large amount (as it's much closer to solid territory), whereas on the left side, D10 is not so good for white, as C15 has influence along the side, an invasion on the left would be in your favour, but an invasion on the lower right may be impossible in a few moves.]
;W[bp]C[Have not encountered this response before

>This move is bad, I think, the point of the star is to take hold of the centre and make influence possibly at the expense of the corner... white has undermined this strategy by picking territory over influence... 

I also believe there are certain vulnerabilites in white's position that could be exploited later in the game (especially an invasion around F4)]

(;B[ck]C[as plan BUT open to ijnvasion at c12... wondered about D10 but thought the extension was too loose

>I like D10, it's too loose to make a stable group, but the aim is to make white invade... see variation]

(;W[ch]C[which he played :-(]
(;B[dg]C[unsure here. D13 was aimed at building a moyo at the top and relying upon c6-9 being a living grp

i also considered e10 or e13

Fleetingly i wondered about an invasion of my own at G4

or to ignore it and play r13.

Trying to be more aggressive.. d13

>I'll offer some opinions of them in their nodes (plus the ones I've added)... the best of which are impossible for me to choose between, all of them are good as long as you have a plan beforehand to keep care of C6 and your territory.]
;W[cj]
(;B[dj]C[considered also b10 but had vague ideas of an outer wall of influence forming if d10

> white is powerful in this area, I would avoid a fight and move somewhere like D9 to make shape (the quicker you have shape for yourself, the faster you can use it to attack white, but attacking without strength is a gamble)

some possible moves are shown for your group to grow quickly and gain shape]
;W[di];B[bj]C[now d10, also considering life for c6-9 grp

>these are good moves];W[eh];B[ci];W[dh]C[this is good, the defects of your group are repaired and you have made shape]

(;B[cg]C[This move doesn't do very much... at best it'll save you about 3 points... I'd rather gain territory at the top, threatening d12 at the same time...]
;W[bi];B[cj];W[bg];B[bf];W[af];B[ae];W[ag]
(;B[be]C[It all looks very heavy but i felt ok. C17 corner looked safe and a wall forming as part of my upper moyo. Meanwhile the c9 grp looked alive with possibility of moving out to centre

> all true, but B15 in useless, you need not fear invasion in that corner]
;W[ai]
(;B[qn]C[i have been caughgt out many times where my opponent grows a moyo by stealth..and i suddenly realize i am lost.
Hence r6. Also considered O3

Wondered about F3 but thought that W B4 made that move inferior

> I think you need to attack the white group... that way you can build power and any invasion should turn out better... white will respond as losing the group isn't something she can do...

> A moyo is just that, a framework, they can be invaded, reduced, or completely destroyed... and shouldn't be feared...]
;W[qm]C[had not encountered this before. wondered about Q7 as a response but went for ' if pincered go to 3,3 as a trusty response]
;B[qq]C[I believe this is correct];W[pq];B[qp]
(;W[mp]
(;B[pm]C[now q7 as i thought the r4 grp had life];W[ql]
(;B[pl]C[was this a mistake? q5 or q6 better preventing the cut

this is a mistake, if your groups are weak you've got to baby them, and look after them, if they can stand up for themselves it's a world of difference... protecting the cut at Q5... even before Q7... Q5 was a wonderful move]
;W[pk];B[po]C[rectifying ' the problem '];W[pe]C[Not sure how to respond to  attachment plays, of which this is but one example]
;B[qd]C[so tried to protect the corner and connect stones

>I prefer P16, the side is larger than the corner and this is only slightly more effective in the corner buf does very little for the side]
;W[qe];B[nd]C[>>wants especially<<

^^ yes, this is a very good turnout for black];W[pg]
(;B[pr]C[Phase 1 of the game, the Opening is now virtually over and I wondered what to do next.

I was not happy with Q2 as it seemed small but the idea was to cement my corner.

G4 looks bigger.

OR , go back to original plan and start building walls of my moyo O14

I looked at K15, recognizing that getting area in the centre is difficult and that K stones might work with my C wall.

Again , i had played the c9 group to disrupt his space and live. There was now a possibility to expand this group towards the centre.

I looked to see if W had any weak grps and determined that D12 was the weakest with only 1 eye but could easily run so not an obvious target

> Comments in the variations

I think this is the least good move, but by no means useless]
;W[or];B[qr];W[op];B[oo]C[What happened to my plan!!
This was an instant response to p4 but i felt that it started a B wall and was (very ) loosely opposite the c9 grp

> yes O5 would be much better than P5... however, invading around F3 is stll the best move, I think]
;W[no];B[nn];W[bn];B[bm];W[ao]
(;B[am]C[Very unsure about this. I wanted to ensure that this grp lived and was concious of W a10 creeping in and destroying base. I felt that i needed at least 1 eye on this base to ensure that life would be maintained.

I have lost many groups which were ' theoretically settled and safe ' because i did NOT settle them

> we all have, only reading power can help with this (ie. lots of life and death practice)]
;W[co];B[dn]C[there is beginning to look to be enough room for 2 eyes nowaround c8 area]
;W[gp]C[plugging my potential invasion point. Perhaps I should have played here instead of A7 ?

>you must play a move in the A7 area to secure your group... the group is worth more than the invasion... however this is still a very painful moment]
;B[ff]C[Concious that i too have a hole at g17 but this seemed more attacking and my top area was beginning to form]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[fj];B[fk];W[gj];B[gk];W[hk]TR[jc][nd][oe][pl]
[pm][nn]C[W no longer has any weak grps and his bottom G3 area looks imposing. If he can build a moyo based upon his R11 base he should win

> you area at least as powerful in the, o12 area, where you are worried white'll build territory (because of the marked stones... P15 is marked because it would be very helpful)...  at the worst you should neither get much territory...

>about the other issue, that is, white no longer having weak groups... I think the big group still looks pretty weak, and I'd cut at H10... my reason for thinking this is important, and it's explained in the variations]

(;B[gm]TR[el][fl][em][fm]C[played to try and secure my d8 area

>This is small... maybe the marked 4 points... there is bigger]
;W[hl];B[gl];W[eg];B[ef];W[fg]C[> attacking white is no longer a prospect]

(;B[gf]C[I considered G13 here but was concious of 2 point notch at c13 and i seem to lose out every time i try to hane. This built my wall and protected further my g17 area

> There's no simple system you can use to work out whether it's okay, this is just a part of the game that requires reading, gambling, or holding back... again life and death problems do wonders for reading]
;W[oe];B[ne]C[i chose this in preference to p16 as it started to enclose the g16 framework

>N15 is also an option];W[od];B[oc];W[nf]C[he hanes at EVERY opportunity,  squeezing my space]
;B[mf];W[ng];B[mg]C[the top area looks good for B but i am concious that it is all empty and doubt my skills to destroy any invaders :-(

> I don't, I think you've got the skills

> A bit of peace of mind is worth at least 10 points... if you're going to be worrying about it constantly, it draws concentration from the rest of your game (where stuff is actually happening)... so I'd rather put my mind to rest... even if you lose the game because of it (very unlikely) you'll have a good enough blood pressure to play many more games ^^]
;W[mh]C[hane again

> I'm not sure about the integrity of this wall you're building... I'd rather move K13 next... closing off my territory and maybe making the wall less likely to fall down =P (examplein next node)]
;B[lh]
(;W[mi];B[li];W[lj]C[my moves were played in instant response mode.
I recognized that his q11 area was growing but felt that i could still expand from q8 andthat if i could connect m11 to g14 i would have a powerful area of my own]
;B[hm]C[so i switched point of play to try and reduce his space]
;W[im];B[jj]C[looking to break connection between m10 and g10 and also thinking that B k12 would form a table and help my upper area

> I don't think m10 connecting to g10 is particularly bad... I'd rather try to start mobalizing troops on the lower side to push down on right, making that territory as small as possible]
;W[ij]
(;B[ii];W[hi];B[ih];W[hh]
(;B[ig]C[I was really tempted to play H13  ( hane at head of 2 ) but worried about cutting counter attacks ( which I did not try and read out )
I suppose I could also have considered g13..but this does not work for B

> you're right, g13 doesn't work... hane is indeed better, and safe]
;W[hg];B[hf];W[nl]C[Time to consider.
For B, my upper moyo looks promising but full of empty space..can i handle an invasion? There are safe bases for my other 2 grps centred on d8 and s5.
Against this W has a strong position at the bottom and a growing influence centred on R11 which hwe is trying to connect to g11 grp.
I also have threatened cuttinp points at m12 / n15

So my plan is to try and REDUCE his territory by expanding into L6 space and look for sente endgame type moves to accumulate small advantages

> from a strategic point of view, I'd suggest moving at S16 first (white responds... if she doesn't you make a profit)... the second priority is to reduce the bottom with moves like E5, aiming at E4 and F4... etc... your last priority strategically is to move into the l6 space... there are minute differences between each option, but I'm sure of their order.]
