;B[dp]C[My Name is Eric Poupaert. I live in Belgium. My rank is approximately belgian 15k. I was black in this game. Although I made big mistakes on the upper border, I think I made other more profound errors. Many thanks in advance for the review.

My name is Slawek Piela.
I am Polish 9k (10k* IGS)
I will try to help you as much as I can.
I play on almost all servers as slawek.
Catch me there :)];W[pd];B[pq];W[po];B[dd];W[qq];B[pp];W[qp]
;B[oo];W[qn];B[pn];W[qo];B[pm]C[I dont think B chose right line of play here
You do get a wall but it has many weaknesses as you experienced later on during the game  B should have played less agresively
Consider :
B r2
W r4
W p2

You do get less but whit invested more (you played tenuki and took d16) so you are not worse off]
;W[iq]MA[kq]C[This move removes the value of my wall. I should have played around K4 but when ?

I am not really able to assess value of walls really.

However:
Your l3 was not very efficient because you tried to make territory with your wall.

I am told that you should use wall to attack not make territory.

If your wall were strong I would recomend a play around g3 but here:
B g3  W o3 (threatens Wp4)
and you are in trouble white rids you of the base, possibly cuts or takes unduly large territory at the bottom despite your wall

K4 is a reducing move and so far you have nothing to reduce but to attack.

I would probably play closer to the wal than l3l to cover for the weakness in the wall]
;B[kq]C[I think this move is in the wrong direction.

As I said before you have a weakness you have to cover.

Normally you would play from the other side.

There is a proverb that says:
"Play from the weak group"

According to this proverb your move was correct to some extent.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[pr];B[np];W[dr]C[Should white continue fighting with P3 instead of

this move ?

Here the weaknes comes to play:

Consider W o3 !!!

Work out variations - black should be thankful for the opportunity to play p2]
;B[cq];W[ci];B[or];W[qr]C[W should play :
W p3
B p4
W r2

gives better endgame for W];B[qm];W[cf];B[fd];W[bd];B[cc]C[Good]
;W[qh];B[kc]C[Not a good place. Where should I have played ? K16 or K17 ?

Tough choice.
K16 and K 17 still could be subject to invasion at H17.

Maybe o17 or n17  would be a better option.
If W pincers you run to the center and counterpincer

If W takes some ground by q17 you extend back to l3 forming a base.   if W q14 - corner is open for invasion]
;W[ic];B[jd]C[o17 might be better first];W[ec]C[Consider f17

Should work for B much better];B[gb];W[gc];B[fc];W[gd];B[ge]
;W[id];B[hd];W[hc]C[I think this is a very bad move. When the fight started I had no idea what I should try to obtain in the end.

In a situation like this:
Option 1 - kill the invaeder - difficult and dangerous. Dangerous because if they live  they usually spoil your position so badly that you loose the game.

Option 2 - confine to a small area and let live

Option 3 - dont let make two eyes and chese in the directiion you want . You build thinckness or construct moyo , get territory]
;B[he];W[ie];B[ib]C[Wrong - W doesnt have eyes at the bottom anyway.

Better to take care of your stones];W[hb];B[fb];W[jb];B[kb]
;W[je];B[nc]C[Good ! Finally black has base];W[fe];B[ff];W[ee]
;B[ef]C[e16 better];W[de]C[imagine W e15 !!! problems for B]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[be];W[bf];B[bc];W[ae];B[ed];W[kd];B[pb]C[Good! r 16 stone is not important]
;W[qc];B[ld];W[jc];B[le];W[ei];B[ck]C[you took territory - good

you left your h15 stones for W to be eaten alive on the grand scale (W r12 or such)]
;W[ih];B[ig]C[thees stones are dead   It is better to threaten to pull them out from the outside - build a wall and then attack r12 or confine f3 group]
;W[jh];B[jg];W[kg];B[kf];W[hg];B[gf];W[ke];B[lf]C[m13 better]
;W[jf];B[lg];W[kh];B[lh];W[qf]C[I think 85 should have been played at 86.

Definetly :(];B[qj]C[good];W[fo];B[jo]C[good];W[li];B[df]C[With this move I tried to help escaping. But this was a failure. What should I have done with these stones?

leave them alone

if they are on the board they still pose some threat  if you play it out to the end they become totally useles]
;W[ce];B[fi];W[fj];B[eh]C[Is 95 at G11 better ?

not really

I would not try to live or escape with these stones for the reasons I gave before

I would try to get some points in the centre and then go to yose]

;B[pc];W[qd];B[od]C[m8 (or around there) is much bigger];W[ll]
C[as I said W took those few points you needed to win from you]
;B[in]C[small m6 bigger];W[ln];B[jk]C[I thought that invading white center is more than urgent at this time. Is this the correct move?

yes but I would play more carefully k8 maybe];W[jl]C[big mistake   contact plays are for defense

W k7 would put you in a very difficult position];B[hk];W[gk]

A good way to improve is doing lost of simple problems (Go problems for begginers is excellent) and studing tesuji.

It helped me a lot

see you on IGS
