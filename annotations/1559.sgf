C[pajaro: Hi. This is a game I played as white. After going over it, I think that I lost because I didn't manage to play in the right direction at the right time. Also, my yose is awful. I must work on it. I have made some commentaries, which will begin with pajaro:

Thanks.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc]LB[po:a][qo:b]C[pajaro: I san-san good here? Black seems to want to play chinese fuseki. I don't want to do the same.  I have problems dealing with it, so I thought that I would have a secure corner, to not having to worry about it.

Per:
Your move is OK. If you want to avoid the chinese fuseki you should play at A or B immedately.]
;B[pk]C[pajaro: As expected.];W[nc]LB[po:a][mp:b][jp:c]C[pajaro: Right approach?

Per: Yes. This is one of many options for white. The moves a, b or c are also possible]
;B[pf];W[jd]C[pajaro: I think my upper side is now nicely balanced.

Per: I agree];B[jp];W[dj];B[fq];W[po]C[pajaro: I know it is hard to let black play a double-kakari. But if I just play C6 and let black make a shimari with Q5, his position will seem to good.

Per:
In this case the double kakari isn't that severe since you have a stone at C10.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]C[Per:

Black S2 put more pressure on white.];W[ql]C[pajaro: After the game, I saw in a book that this might be bad. Better one line shorter (R7) in order to not help black. Right?

Per:
Yes.];B[qk];W[ol]C[Per:
This look a little strange to me. White expects black Q8, but black has other options. See variation.]

(;B[pl]C[Per: Black plays along with white's intentions to sacrifice R8.]
;W[pm];B[qm]C[Per:

Black P7 is probaly better.];W[qn];B[rl];W[on]C[pajaro: Black is stronger in the side, and I am alive. Good exchange?

Per:
I'm not strong enough to say, but it looks even to me.];B[lp]
C[Per:
To slow];W[ph]LB[dn:a][ne:b][df:c]C[Per:

This is an overplay black is very strong here.
The moves a,b or c are all better.];B[ne];W[ld]
(;B[ok];W[nh];B[oi]C[Per:

Black O8 is huge];W[of]C[pajaro: I tried to play lightly here. Connecting would be heavy.]
;B[oh];W[pg];B[og];W[qf];B[pe];W[qc]C[pajaro: As the invasion hasn't gone well, I invade. Black will have to give me the side I want. I'm happy with this.

Per:
It is correct that you get a big corner, but the price is high.
Black has got influence on the outside and the atari at O8. Black is clearly leading the game.
The reason is white's overplay at Q12];B[qe];W[pc]C[Per:

Black should attak with O8. See variation]
(;B[nf]C[pajaro: After the invasion, black plays this to remove aji. Since it's gote, the P14 stone now seems to have been a better play, though I don't think that black should have played O14 now.

Per: You are right O14 isn't needed.];W[cf]C[pajaro: Nothing to attack, nothing to invade... Let's take profit. Is this the biggest area?

Per: O8 is still best. Not only does it protect white it also reduce the value of blacks influence.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fp]C[pajaro: I'll try to lean on these stones, go into the center, and attack the D6 group.]

Good move];B[bn];W[bo];B[cr];W[dr]C[Per:

Playing on the out side is better.];B[dq];W[cq];B[bq];W[cp]
C[Per:

Black can play B2]

Good sequense from white. The game is now more close];B[fj]
;W[ej]C[pajaro: This is a mistake. I didn't want black to but me, but I think that I can capture C11 easily, so I'm strong. Thanks to this, black will make shape.

Per: 
E9 is more aggressive, but leaves a lot of aji.
I would play E10.];B[ek]C[pajaro: Now black is very strong]
;W[gh]C[Per:

Besides from O8 a move around G16 looks better];B[gc];W[gj]
;B[hl];W[im];B[il];W[ec];B[jb];W[kb]C[Per: K17 is better style]
;B[jc];W[kc];B[hc];W[id];B[ge];W[ef]C[Per:

H14 is better. D13 is unimportant];B[ed];W[dd]C[Per:

D17 is better style, since black F17 becomes gote];B[ee];W[de]

;B[hb];W[ia]C[Per: This is a small end game move];B[ha];W[ka]
C[pajaro: He's alive, but I feel that white might have done better.

Per: 
Yes, you main mistake in this fight was to capture D13];B[rd]
;W[rc];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml]C[Per:

Black is strong in this area and can play N7];W[mm];B[ll];W[jl]
C[pajaro: This is the las attempt agains the black G8 group, as he has only one eye.

Per:

This is an overplay since the white group on the right is not alive yet]
