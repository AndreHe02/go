AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hey, reveiwer. i really need to better myself in containment and prevention of break-ins. Thanks for giving your time to assist me!

[JB\] Hi. I will try to help, but in general words I can say that you play too close to your opponent, and trying to push him all the time you leave many cutting points. With 9 stones you can play quite conservative, you do not need to kill your opponent... just leave him live trying to get as much territory as you can.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[[JB\] With 9 stones, typically you would play R15 (var.2). This one is not bad anyway.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[pe]C[better stuff for opening?

[JB\] I have shown a variation before. Now, you should play S16 (big!) before any other, as in var.2.]

(;B[oe]LB[pc:a][od:b]C[[JB\] Too close to white, leaving many cuts (A, B). If you don't atari at C, better play at B (P16).]
;W[of];B[ne];W[nf];B[mf];W[mg]C[what should i have done here?

[JB\] You should realize that you are playing constantly sticked to white. This has several problems: (1) by playing close to white you are making him stronger, and (2) with all those hane's you have lots of cuts.
But just answering, I would play S16, then N15 to fix the position (Var.2). This is quite passive but you are ahead anyway. Don't need to kill white, just attack him from enough distance, and while he tries to live (small) reinforce your walls making territory or influence.]

(;B[ng];W[lf];B[me];W[og];B[nh];W[oh];B[mh];W[lg]
(;B[oi]C[[JB\] If you want to connect, N10 (var.2) looks better. Even if it does not connect to Q10, it makes life easier for N12 - one less problem. Q10 can be safe easily after you played N10... again: not so close to white.]
;W[ni];B[mi];W[nj];B[oj];W[mj]
(;B[lj]C[this was a misclick, i should've gone m11

[JB\] Of course, this one is a disaster. White will be very strong with all of its stones connected.
Anyway I prefer L12, which puts more pressure on M13 (see var.2 and var.3)]
;W[li];B[ki];W[lh];B[jf]C[how should i stop his spreading?

[JB\] K14 is not bad. Remember: you cannot pretend to kill white everywhere, just try to keep yourself ahead.]
;W[mp];B[pm];W[lk];B[kj];W[mm];B[jm]C[[JB\] So far, so good. The white stones at N4 and N7 do not make any point.]
;W[oq]C[how should i respond to this?];B[qq]LB[pq:a]C[[JB\] Better at A (Q3)]
;W[pq];B[op]C[[JB\] I would play R2 here.];W[np];B[no];W[mo]
C[[JB\] Again playing too close. Yo cannot cut, and this play leaves lots of cutting points.]
;B[nn];W[mn];B[gp]C[i'm protecting my position as best i could tell, was there anything better?

[JB\] You are doing not bad but there are better moves, like S16 before or G3 here (better protection against invasion at C3). Since you have so many handicap stones it still does not look so bad, but as an example your position on the right can be reduced a lot (with an average white play you have less than 20 points there; in the game you lost the group).]
;W[cn];B[bo];W[co];B[cp];W[ep]C[I am really lost..];B[eq];W[eo]
;B[do];W[dn];B[fp]C[[JB\] F3 is stronger here. The "hanging" E3 stone leaves weak points. White did not play well here, he is making you strong: if you had played properly, you would have almost 30 points here and white influence is reduced by D10.]
;W[fn];B[fo];W[en];B[gn];W[dq];B[cq];W[dr];B[er];W[cr]C[how would i have saved this group?

[JB\] Play B2 (see variation)]
(;B[bp];W[br]C[[JB\] When somthing is lost, do not try to save it (it can be useful as aji). Count liberties: white has 5, you cannot increase yours to 6 or reduce white's to one less than yours.]
;B[bn];W[bm];B[ds];W[ap]C[[JB\] Better B3; if black A3 it difficult to analyze the position and a lo may appear (not easy for black anyway).]
;B[cs];W[an];B[bs];W[ar]
(;B[es]C[[JB\] Not needed, look for a bigger point. It is very important to get sente when you lose something big, so the loss won't be so big.
Even locally, C7 is better if you keep this dead group with a couple of liberties (it will take white 2 moves to take it, see var.2)]
;W[ao]C[[JB\] Not needed, if black A1 then white A3, if black A3 then white B3, black A1, white A5.]
;B[fm];W[cj];B[ci];W[bj];B[bi];W[gd]C[how should i be containing him?

[JB\] Again: just push him against your stronger stones, let hime escape if you cannot kill but be sure your stones are strong, and he does not get points. In this case, if you cannot kill him (and you probably won't), there will be no loss.]
;B[cf];W[gf];B[gh];W[hg];B[hh];W[ig]
(;B[ih]C[[JB\] K13 better, try to prevent his weak stones to connect to a strong group.]
;W[jg];B[fc];W[gc];B[gb];W[hb];B[fd];W[fb]
(;B[ff]C[[JB\] You should stop him at E18, the corner is too big to let him enter.]

(;W[fe]C[[JB\] White mistake, E18 better. White can live in the top, and the K13 stone is connected to M13 group (if black L13, white L12).]
;B[ee];W[ge];B[eb];W[ga];B[fg];W[le]
(;B[ke]C[[JB\] M16 here!!! If possible, never let the opponent push in the middle of your wall.]
;W[ld];B[lc];W[md];B[mc];W[od];B[nd];W[pc]C[what would've been better?

[JB\] Too late... but I will see :-)]
(;B[pb];W[qb];B[oc];W[rc];B[pa]
(;W[kd]C[[JB\] Better at L17, see var.2];B[kc];W[jc];B[ic]C[[JB\] K2 better]
;W[jb];B[ib]
(;W[id]C[[JB\] White mistake, should have played J19.];B[kb]
;W[je];B[ja];W[jd];B[ek];W[ma];B[la];W[mb];B[nb];W[na];B[oa]
;W[qa];B[lb];W[ec]C[how should i be containing him?];B[dc]C[[JB\] Correct.]
;W[ed]
(;B[df]C[[JB\] Probably better to play D18, though white can create some complications at D15 (see variation)]
;W[db]C[dumb

[JB\] You played D14 instead of D18... Probably you did not need D14, but this is less complicated.]

[JB\] :-)];W[dl];B[dk];W[kr];B[ir];W[jq];B[iq];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr]
C[[JB\] Notice white hase S4 tesuji (if black T3, white R4). S5 or R5 would help here.]
;B[nm];W[ok];B[pk];W[ol];B[nl]C[[JB\] Q8 better, remember to block the entry to your territory.]

;W[rj];B[rk];W[qg];B[qk]C[[JB\] You do not need this one now, if you want to prevent a move at R7 play there, or S6 better (white has a good move at S4).]

C[So really my question is how should i contain better, and hot to prevent mass breaking-in of my territory. Thanks, reveiwer, your assistance is much appreciated!

Kamtre

[JB\] Last words: try to contain from far. Playing in contact strengthens your opponent, and if he is stronger it is a sure path to disaster.
