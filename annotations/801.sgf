C[To the reviewer:

As always, I'd like to thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  I've been thinking quite a bit about what I've been doing wrong, and it seems that I fall behind early in the game either by my opponent's building a large moyo, or by my ending up with a bunch of weak groups which my opponents can attack easily.    With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger, Fedya on KGS

To Ted and other readers :
I'll begin my comments with j> so they are not confused with comments from the player]
;B[dp];W[cd];B[qp];W[pd];B[qf];W[nc];B[pj];W[pf]
(;B[qg]C[j> too submissive, especially if you intend to surrender the right side
Q13 instead or R12 look good for me (see var)];W[pg];B[ph];W[qe]
;B[kp]C[Fedya: I wasn't certain what to do here with sente.  I figured this would help me get a good deal of territory on the right side and the bottom, as it would be difficult for White to invade.

j> to secure the right and bottom, this move should be shifted a little to the right (M3 for example). Else white can invade
if you're looking for a chinese style formation on the bottom, it would be better placer on K4 or K3

L4 appears (to me) as a "bad" move cause it is supposed to have a double effect (which is good in theory)
but lacks the power it would have when shifted one line right or left]
;W[cn];B[cl]TR[kp]C[Fedya: I was under the impression that a pincer attack was a good idea if you have a stone in the area of the marked stone.  Unfortunately, I ended up with two weak groups, which implies that I did something wrong.

j> marked stone is too far away from this corner to be really effective (see previous remark)
anyway, getting weak groups is the danger in pincering ... usually, white's group should be weak too, so it's ok]
;W[en];B[fp];W[gn];B[ci]C[j> E8 first. if white then plays around c11, g8 etc ... two lines of stones but whites are severed by strong black stones on the side]
;W[cg];B[el]C[Fedya: Is E11 better or worse than this move?  Or is there an entirely different plan I should be following?  I played at E8 because I wanted to put pressure on the White stones below, while at the same time making certain my group above didn't become weak.

j> better plan is e8 first];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq];B[cr]C[j> too submissive
b2 is mandatory here];W[fl];B[ek];W[em];B[hc]C[Fedya: Again, I have sente, and am trying to figure out the right thing to do.  I thought this was the biggest part of the board.  But, I just end up with another weak group.

j> your notion of sente must be revised
your left side group is still weak. you must defend it first
when white plays E7, it serves not only to connect his stones, but also to attack yours]
;W[fc]C[j> this had to be expected];B[kc];W[ld];B[kd]C[Fedya: Would it have been better here to play at M17 instead?

j> i'd rather try h15 now, to get farther in the center];W[gd]
;B[hd];W[hp]C[j> now your stones in lower left are in danger
this results from using "sente" to play at h17 instead of putting pressure on white group and reinforcing your left group]
;B[gq]LB[iq:A]C[Fedya: I've always been told that you're supposed to defend from the weaker side.  But in this case, which side is that?  I think this is a better move than, say, J3, since White threatens to take away eye-space from the group on the left with a move like F2.

j> white can't play f2 after black j3.];W[op];B[nq]C[Fedya: Again I have to guess which is the weaker side.  I guessed wrong, since I ended up losing the entire corner.

j> here, you have to play j3 and connect your stones on the side

if you're planning to keep white from the center, Q3 is the move that springs to mind
it would put white p4 under some pressure and force him to attack fiercely your l4 stone]
;W[np];B[mq];W[mp];B[lp];W[oq];B[or]C[j> this leads to giving corner  r3 may look very awkward but would defend it better
r2 would surely be my choice here];W[pr];B[nr];W[qq];B[qm]C[Fedya: When I first went over the game, I thought this was the losing move, since White was able to take the entire corner.  But I went on to lose by something like 40 points, so I doubt there's one losing move.  Is there a move which would have saved the R4 stone and prevented White from taking the corner?  I've looked at R6, which I don't think works, and Q5.  On the other hand, since I lost by over 40 points, maybe there was no one losing move.

What's worse is that at the time I was playing, I actually thought I was comfortably ahead.

j> at the moment, you have two weak groups, white has none (since lower right corner is secure if he plays there)  and white is strong in the center
maybe you're not behind in territory yet, but it is only a question of time, cause white will build territory while you
only struggle for the life of your groups];W[qo];B[po]C[Fedya: In hindsight, S5 might have been better.

j> s5 secures more territory on the side];W[pp];B[qn];W[ro]
;B[eh]C[Fedya: I really had no idea what to do here.  Before White played R5, I thought I was doing well; now I think I've got several weaknesses: White will get the chance to play either the monkey jump at S8 or Q6, both of which gain White a good deal of territory.  So, I felt I had to do something to make sure I get more territory myself.

j> this doesn't secure much territory , yet it strengthens your left group
p12 to keep white from installing in the corner looks appealing to me
l14 would be my choice today, getting in white's way to the center while getting my head out

if you're to play here, look for e13 which will reduce white's territory at the same time]
;W[eg];B[fh];W[fg];B[gg];W[gf]C[j> this sequence only expands white's territory, especially if you don"t defend against the cut at g12]
;B[le]C[Fedya: Probably not a good idea, but I realized that if I played H13, White would be able to stop me from connecting the groups around H16 and F12.  So I decided to sacrifice the G13 stone and play to connect the H16 group to the group on the right side, which I figured would also reduce the amount of territory White could get in the top right.

j> l14 is still a good move
if you give up g13, then it's better not to play anything at e12 first]
;W[lc];B[kf]C[Fedya: I was very worried both about the cut at L15, and White playing at L18.  I decided finally that preventing the cut at L15 would be best.  After this move, it would be best to try to connect to the group on the right, I think]
;W[me];B[lg];W[hk];B[iq]C[j> finally !
imagine a white stone at h3 before you play this ?];W[hq];B[hr]
;W[ip];B[jq];W[jp];B[ir]C[j> unnecessary
this loses a lot   if you're to defend on the lower side, f2 is way better]
;W[gp];B[fq]C[j> f2 would have prevented you from answering this move]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[om];W[nn];B[rn]C[Fedya: I had to make certain I prevented the monkey jump at S8.  At this point, I still thought I was ahead.

j> at this point, you can look at cgoban's evaluation and see that even if you get lots of points in the center,  white will still be ahead by more than 10 points

if you're so afraid of the monkey jump, or if you think it is such a powerful move, then threaten to make monkey jumps
yourself, playing at G18, b12, l18 and s14 first.
by the way, l18 is really a must play move at this stage];W[so]

(;B[ln]C[Fedya: I think White's last move was a mistake, giving up sente.  I don't know what the right thing to do with sente is, however.  Could an invasion at R17 survive?  Knowing now how the game ended, I think this would have been my only chance to win.

j> white surely misread and thought it was necessary to prevent
bs4 (atari), wp5, bs5  connects ... but w can of course play s5 to defend atari

here l9 or l8 (see var for visual impression) looks better for me
building territory for you, and reducing white's prospects the same time
your move only hinders white];W[gh];B[hg];W[hh];B[hf];W[ge]
;B[he];W[dh];B[ei]C[Fedya: This move, in hindsight, is a waste of time.  It would have been better to play D11 immediately.  At the time, however, I was worried about White cutting.

j> white cannot cut, as you realised later];W[di];B[dj];W[fi]
;B[ej];W[fj]C[j> result of this sequence : white build territory, black adds stones to his groups
anything else would be better, starting with tenuki ... l18, g18 are big sente moves]
;B[fk];W[gk];B[ch];W[dg];B[bg]C[j> bad, because it's gote];W[bf]
;B[bh];W[ih];B[li];W[bm];B[bl];W[jm];B[ll]TR[mh][oh][ml][ol]
C[Fedya: I still thought I was doing OK, especially because I now thought I was going ot get a good deal of territory in the center (specifically in the marked area).

j> even with the marked area counted yours, black is behind by 20 points]
;W[nm];B[nl];W[kk];B[lk];W[kj];B[lj];W[kb]C[j> same mistake as B b13 (nearly, m18 being "less" sente than b12)]
;B[jb];W[lb];B[ja];W[ng];B[mf]C[Fedya: I probably should have played at O12 instead, but I'd still be leaving myself a lot of cutting points.

j> o12 is not sente (n14 is , but doesn't acomplish much)
in the endgame, you should first look for double-sente moves
(moves that are sente for either side, they are the most valuable ... l18 or m18 earlier)
then sente moves wich are worth twice their amount of points]
;W[nf];B[mg]C[j> what is this move for ?
to keep the one point at m14 ?

black is so far behind in the game, he can't afford to play 1 point gote moves

end of review];W[oh];B[pi];W[mh];B[lh];W[rf];B[rg];W[sf];B[sg]
;W[re];B[ri]C[Fedya: This move turns out not to be necessary, in that I can win the ladder should White try R12.  None of the cuts in the center work, so I guess the best thing would be to try B15 and hope my opponent errs.  By this time I began to realize that I wasn't winning, but I didn't know that I was going to go on to lose by 40+ points!]

;W[rg];B[og]C[surely not the best sequence locally, but it illustrates the fact that you can solidify the right side wihout giving the center

of course, you offer a stone for this, but white's corner is not that much bigger than in actual game]
