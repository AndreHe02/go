C[Hi, I played a bblack and was pretty much destroyed in this game. My main concern is with the opening -- how to handle the top josekis/approaches, because I let him take territory and erase the influence of my wall.  In the top right corner I just misread and that hurt.   But even before that I still felt white was being a little too ambitious but I didn't know how to take advantage of it.  Big picture comments (big points vs. urgent points, general strategy direction of play) with follow up moves would be much appreciated.  Thanks!!

Thank you for the opportunity to comment your game. Only a high ranking pro can know the truth about go. To the extend my comments help stimulate your own thinking about the game, they may have some value. Don't put more stock in them than that. Enjoy.

;W[dp];B[ec];W[cd];B[de]C[Black 5: I understand this is probably something you wanted to try out; which is fine. But in theory, black 5 is poor. 

The move is too early. 

The remaining opening corner is the biggest point. 

Black 5 attaches to a potentially weak stone, so is aji-keshi (erases potential) because you may wish to play some other squeeze, such as D14, C14 or C13, depending on how things develop.]
;W[qp]C[White 6: wrong. White must help C16. White did a big point before an urgent point. It is urgent to move the inside stone out.]
;B[oq]C[Black 7: now Black follows with a big point while ignoring an urgent point. C15 is the only move. Black 7 prevents a white shimari; but is that more valuable than destroying the C16 white stone by playhing at C15? It is not.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[Black 9: still C15 is the only move; nevertheless, black 9 is a good pincer when black is strong on the upper side. When strong, pincer tight. When weaker pincer soft.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[cg];B[dg]C[Black 13: it is not necessary to keep going here because the O17 is urgent. Black should play O16 or P17 to take advantage of White's tenuki in the upper right.]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[jc]C[White 16: this seems like too much. A fight should not be favorable to White on the top, where Black is much stronger. If White is going to play on the top, White must settle himself there with either Q17, R17, or perhaps try to make Black overconcentrated with M16.]
;B[cf]C[Black 17: dont push in (reduce your own liberty) unless you can cut. C11 is an urgent point on the left.]
;W[bf]C[I should have pressed harder on this group while I had the chance, I think, but I wasn't sure what the best move was, or what was sente....]

(;B[le]C[Probably not the most effective move in this area?  Better to N16, maybe?

L17 first to prevent a white connection underneath, then M19 to begin a running battle. White has to handle two weaknesses; Black will get a benefit.]
;W[dc];B[eb];W[gd];B[dd];W[cc];B[fd]C[Black 25: may be its slack? White cannot cut at E16.]
;W[je];B[jg]C[Black 27: an interesting move.];W[gc];B[kb];W[kf]
;B[lh];W[gf];B[gh]C[Black gets a benefit towards the center.]
;W[lf];B[me];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[qe]C[Big mistake.  I wonder, if I just played Q15, how wiould my position be vs. white's?

Q15 is correct because of the aji of O17.];W[qb]C[You can tenuki from the upper right corner and seal the white group in with N14.]

;B[jd];W[ld];B[if]C[I haven't looked at this too much, but I get the feeling n16 first is better

Yes.];W[kc];B[ke]C[Had a choice to get g17 group. too, with J17 -- that probably would have been better  But at least I get sente this way.

J17 is bigger.];W[md];B[ie];W[ic]C[Black is a unsatisfied.]

(;B[fq]C[Black 83: perhaps C11 is urgent? it makes the difference who dominates the left side.]
;W[dn];B[dr]C[Bad?  Should I just C11?  or c8?  Not that I have much of a chance, but if it were closer I'd like to know better moves/strategy for the bottom half of the board.

Settling on the bottom is ok; White cannot secure all the left immediately so you have time. Previous to F3 I like C11.]
;W[ck];B[oo]C[Q 11 much bigger, I think.

Black 87: it is a bit vague. Black is thick in the center so Black still wants a fight. Black can try Q6 to make mischief with the Taisha.]
;W[pi]C[This is big but White should help R4 (move the inside stone out).]

(;B[oj]C[Black 89: this helps strengthen White. Don't push the opponent along the 4th line generally. In case case, it is URGENT to punish the R4 stone. R6 is the only move for Black. Punish and seal in the stone with a base problem.]

(;B[ok]C[Black 159: you just save a single stone in gote. Was that stone important? If it connects groups, protects a territory, or is a cutting stone, it was important. Compare with playing B19. Black 159 is the total opposite of an urgent move. Look over this game for example of taking small sente endgame moves. It seems like you got a bit tired in the endgame.]

;W[sk];B[rl];W[ik];B[bg];W[bh];B[hk];W[tt];B[hi];C[Lessons from this game:

1. Urgent points before Big points. Don't tenuki urgent points.
2. However, if there is not an urgent point, tenuki if opponent plays small and there is larger. 
3. Reveiw two or three easy problems a day to build up your fighting muscle. Then you will have less disasters like the upper right.

NOTE:
Urgent point means 

(1) help your stone or group that is uncomfortble because of some liberty, connection or base problem; or punishing your opponents stone or group that has such problems.

(2) move the inside stone out

(3)invading or reducing a zone where opponent can finish it off in one move.

(4)a double sente point.])
