;B[qp]C[JSG: I'm black in this game.];W[dd];B[pc];W[qe];B[qh]
LB[qg:A]C[JSG: Was this a good pincer?

NA: Depends on what your intentions are.  It is not as severe
as "A", for example.];W[ne];B[pe]C[JSG: Does this joseki I played  make any sense?  I play on  principle
of connecting and cutting,  and I was trying to link up my  stones
and cut white at same  time, but I also know that attaching  can make opponent stronger.

NA:  In the joseki tutor in MFGO, this move doesn't exist, so
I don't recommend it.];W[pf];B[oe]C[JSG: Not sure about Joseki--this  shape seems a little heavy.

NA:  It is not a joseki...];W[of];B[qf];W[qg];B[rf];W[rg];B[nd]
;W[re];B[me];W[nf];B[qd];W[dq]LB[md:A]C[NA:  A joseki should have somewhat equal results.  The result
in the upper right corner clearly favors White and he also gets
sente to play the lower corner!  Black still has a weak point
at A to deal with.

W certainly has the better result.];B[qj]C[NA: Not good - what's its purpose?  Almost a pass.]
;W[oq]C[W is ahead already];B[pq]LB[op:A][oo:B]TR[qj][qh]C[JSG: I should have attached at A  (p4) or played at B (p5) right?
I  took corner because I thought that  3-4 opening emphasises
corner  territory, but perhaps I should  have gone for outside
influence  aiming at right side considering  my marked stones.
Or, was a  pincer in order?

NA:  Your marked stones are weak and I don't like A or B.  I
think a pincer is better.];W[op];B[po];W[pp];B[qq];W[oo];B[pn]
;W[jp]C[JSG: Is this a fair exchange?

NA:  W is a little better because your area on the side is open
and a little weak.];B[jq]LB[do:A]C[NA:  Unnecessarily complicated and overdoing things - why not
just play around A?];W[iq];B[ip];W[kp];B[hq];W[ir];B[hp];W[jr]
;B[co];W[fq]LB[eo:A]TR[ip][hp][hq]C[NA:  Bad move by W - he should play around A and split up your
stones.  The marked group is heavy.];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[hr]
;B[dj]LB[cf:A]TR[co][ep][fp][hp][ip]C[JSG: Right time?  Right point?

NA:  I would have played A - If W pincers you, then you use your
influence.  W certainly misplayed the bottom area and B has caught
up significantly.];W[dp];B[do];W[gp];B[go]C[W 46 and 48 are unecessary at this point]
;W[gq];B[in]LB[ho:A]C[JSG: Was my outside thickness  worth the territory white got
on the  bottom?

NA:  I think B is better.

Why not just connect at A - if W cuts later, it will not be easy
to survive.];W[cg]LB[cf:A]C[NA:  This is why you should have played at A.]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[cc]C[JSG: Seemed okay to take corner  because I figured that if he
gets  outside thickness facing the top  side, it won't do him
much good.

NA:  Agreed.];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[ce];B[bf]

(;B[gn]C[JSG: Wrong response?  I was  worried about H5.

which is better for B.];W[eo];B[dm];W[fn];B[gl];W[gm];B[hm]

tesujis.
