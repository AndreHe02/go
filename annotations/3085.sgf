C[This is a game to the IAG League. I played white and my opponent Izgonjes was black. I'm 8kyu and he is 10 kyu. The game was even with 6.5 komi for white as it is set by the rules of the IAG League. The game was played on KGS


Thanks for the chance to review!  I'd say what you want to work on most is thinking about the direction of play (as in your response to the c14 approach), and keeping your opponent from settling too easily inside your territory.  Also, remember that invasions are attempts to live inside your opponents territory, but reductions are moves that require some preparation -- strength or wide open space close enough so that b can't make too much profit chasing you.  There's a book called "reducing territorial frameworks" that explains a lot about invasions/reductions.  Your impulse to reduce b's right side while at the same time making a wall to trap b's invading group was a good one, but the wall was too far, and ended in gote, for it to be practical.  You have to make sure you can end in sente for that to work.]

;B[pc];W[ic];B[pf]C[--> Black here is a little tight and slow; since white made a very loose connection, b is a little better off playing r10 or thereabout.]

(;W[cm]C[this was i think too passive i made black get a big moyo. I don't know if a move near q4 isn't better

--> This is not a bad move.  However, now is a good time to mess with b's plans.  

That being said....  o3 and r6 are NOT equal.  R6 is a move b would welcome... it's a perfect textbook opportunity for b to play the ideal move -- one that acts as a pincer and an extension.  Much better to make black  regret the tight q14 play in the corner by approaching from the left side, and then waiting for the chance to invade the too-wide-gap in the middle of the right side.]
;B[pj]C[Big, but just a touch slow, since b has already invested a lot on that side.]
;W[jp]C[A move that can't get much territory and is begging to let b make a nice pincer/extension from the bottom corner.  This is one of those cases where a great move for your opponent is not necessarily the best move for you.  Better to approach with o3.]
;B[lp];W[hq]C[--> wrong direction, and too close to the k4 stone.  

Instead, you should make b heavy AND take away his base making potentional by playing d3 or possibly e3 first.  If he stands, you can just jump up with k6 and be satisfied that you will make territory on the left as he runs.  If he tries to make a base with a play around h3 or j3, you happily block, limiting him to one eye, strengthening your own group, and savoring the damage to the bottom right all at once.]
;B[cq]
(;W[dq]C[i think that i sould've made a wall facing the upper side

--> No, this is the right move -- the c7 stone is too close to the wall you would build to be very effective.  The problem is not this move but h3.  See comments at the end of your variation.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[cp];B[bp]C[--> The c4/b4 exchange is BAD for white.  Why strengthen b?  Lightly and strongly connecting at d6 is the joseki.  It also prevents b c6, w d6, b b7 from sneaking way into your potential territory.]

(;W[me]C[this was the start of my problems

==>  But then, the alternative, b playing here in sente, prepares him for a perfect attack-while-solidifying-territory on your reducing stone.  Better to approach, now around between q and r 6-8.  If you want to play on top, the move is f16, but invading/reducing is urgent now.  .]
;B[mf];W[lf]C[--> I'm not sure responding to this is good for you.  See next comments.]
;B[mg];W[lg]C[-->B's actual territory is becoming bigger and more solid with each push -- while you are expanding your own moyo, your is still more invadable.]
;B[lh];W[jg];B[kh];W[jf]C[i gave black a strong possition and couldn't do much about it

--> This is not  good.  Yes, if you play away, b can isolate  the k13 stone by pushing because your stones are a bit short of liberties, but that's not as big as getting into b's moyo.  

How to invade this moyo is a big question.  Now o10 would just help b by giving him a target.  Your best bet is still to approach the corner, but you are in a hard position here.  Maybe try r7, and if b responds on bottom see what s10 gets you -- either a base in sente or small life inside the moyo.]
;B[cf]C[i didn't know how to answer this move so i chose a pincer

-->  Bad reasoning.  When you don't know where to play, just think about where you want to make territory.  B can reduce your left side from both the bottom corner and the middle of the board -- plus, your pincer and c7 are too far apart AND both on the third line -- not good shape.  In this case, you have the most potential on the top, plus you want to keep b from settling easily.  So try w C15, b d14, w f16 (or even f17)]

(;W[hb]C[i think that i could play tenuki instead of this move

-->Yes, this move is vey bad and dramatucally hurts your chances of winning.  It is small and gote and lets b get away with some devastation.  .  The alternative would have been much better.]
;B[cj]C[here i got completly lost in my play

-->True, b just split your moyo down the middle.  Still, it might have been better for him to reduce your moyo while expanding his own, and save the invasion for later.  This lets you dig into his side while you're attacking.]

(;W[ln]C[This move is aimless and in a bad relation to your other stones. Keep up the attack on the b group, and THEN, once you've made a nice strong center position as a result of attacking, you invade.]

The idea is good, but you are too far away for this to have immediate effect -- b will just make eyes and live small where he is.]

Actually, if this had been a close game, here you would have had to defend by playing q19.  Otherwise....]
