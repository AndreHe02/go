C[Hi.  I've requested this review to get some comments on the fuseki. I don't like the way it ended (I'm playing white). I only won the game because I managed to kill a large group near the end.

Also, there's a life and death situation near the end I'd like some comments on.]

;B[cg];W[ee];B[cj];W[nc]C[I played this kakari further from the corner stone because I was afraid that if I played the closer approach and he pincered, I'd be left with two weak groups. However, I'm not sure it was the right thing to do. After all, both of those groups would have open access to the center.

There's nothing wrong with the distance of the approach, but I think it's better to shut in black's stone in the upper left. That will make your group strong and black would have to worry about the corner.]
;B[fc]C[This is a nice move for black.];W[jc]TR[ee][ce]C[This extension is too long. Black can invade between the two stones and with the marked stones still being a little weak, he will have a good fight.]

(;B[oc]C[This makes things too easy for white.];W[od]LB[nd:A]
TR[jc]C[Just extending to A may be better. It would give the marked extension the right distance and the black corner is not so strong.
After this move black solidifies his corner and then you have to play A or some other defending move anyway.]
;B[pc]C[Up until here, I think the fuseki is pretty even.]
(;W[of]LB[nd:A]C[This is my first clear mistake I think. Should have played more solidly.

If you connect at A the pattern looks like a common joseki, you just played the moves in a strange differend order. See variation]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[mc];B[oe]C[After this, I'm getting overconcentrated, with the K17 stone too close to the N17 group]
;W[pe];B[pd];W[qf]TR[pe][of]C[The marked two stones are not the most important ones on the board. It would be better to strengthen your stones in the upper left or make a shimari in the lower right corner.]
;B[qe];W[pf]TR[qe]C[The marked exchange is good for white.]
;B[nf];W[ng];B[qn]C[I can't decide if this is a good play by black or not. It doesn't seem severe.

An approach from the other direction seems better indeed.]
(;W[nq]TR[pe][qf][of][ng][pf]C[I'm not sure this response was the best one either. Would a pincer have been more effective?

I think so. It would work well with the strength of the marked stones. See variation.]

That group is hard to attack. C2 would strengthen your lower left corner group and gain some points.]

;W[mb];B[ob];W[sc]C[At this point, the black group isn't doing well. He didn't manage to save it, but I'm pretty sure the variation is enough to do the job.]

(;B[rb]C[This response, however, didn't work.

I think this respons is ok, his next move is the fatal mistake.]
;W[rc]C[Is there some way for black to save the group from here?

Black should simply play A. Then there's no way white can kill.]
