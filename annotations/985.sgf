C[
pajaro: Hi. In this game I played black, against an opponent two stones stronger than me. Although I think I did quite well (I won :) I'd like to know my weak spots in the game, as I felt I was winning fairly larger than the actual result.
Thanks


:: Hello, I hope my comments will present some interesting ideas to you...

Steffen has prefixed his comments with ::, I have prefixed my comments with C:]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pj];B[pl]LB[ph:A]C[pajaro: May be pressing from upside, towards my shimari?


:: Yes, since your extension seems to be too close towards your corner stones below.

C: I agree, if Q10 was at R10 then I think q8 is ok because w is settled then and so b is going for simple points.  With Q10 high, it is better to harras white, so playing above (e.g. Q13 or Q12) is better.  That way w has no logical move on the lower side that will leave him settled (Q7?, R7?)]
;W[pf];B[nc]LB[nd:A]C[

:: I would play one line below. But that's mostly taste, I'd guess.

C: Mostly;  o17 emphasises the corner more than the side.  Since Q8 is relativly strong, you'll probably want to keep the option of an agressive Q12 pincer available, so I'd O17 here.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[fq]LB[rc:A][fp:B][gp:C]TR[ph]C[

:: I would perhaps first extend with A. This serves two purposes:
1. you strengthen your own group
2. you might later on be able to exploit the weak extension around Q12.
(see variation for what happens if white gets to play there first)

To the actual line of play:
 I would play one line above (B or C). Seems to better match with the right side. Though, of course, this is a nice one, too. And most likely bigger (not more urgent!) than (A).

C: I strongly agree that A is important, I would not leave it. As an anecdote, I recently played a game where I left an important move to take a big move like your F3 because I'd carefully read that after ignoring I still just live.  Sure enough my F3 was worth quite a few points but instead of neither of us getting any points around my weak group (R17 in this case), my opponent got points there.  Furthermore, S17 keeps white weak and so supports Q8.  if w has miai of S17 and e.g. R9 available then he is in a much stronger position.

C: I think your stone (f3) is fine where it is.  I don't like C so much, but b is quite nice.  Since your shimari is pointing up anyway, you're not going to get a great deal on this edge, and you're perhaps better to be low so you can settle for some territory quickly, especially if you're planning on coming back for S17.  F4 requires a followup move more than f3, so makes the S17 weakness worse.]

(;W[ql]
(;B[qk]C[

:: I don't know. Seems like you cannot kill that group this way. So this will actually help white.

C: I would back up a bit (see variation).  R9 is ok if you see it as a sacrifice for sente, otherwise it is wrong and you're better with r7.]
;W[pk];B[qm]
(;W[rl]C[

:: as white I'd have an eye on the black moyo below and would try to play not that submissive (see variation).]
;B[rm]
(;W[pm]C[

:: Actually this one helps black. Thanks, white! ;-)];B[ol]
;W[rk]
(;B[pn]C[pajaro: Now white is quite safer, and I... well, did I get enough? I guess no.


:: this formation pumps power into the lower part of the board since it is quite thick. It's a bit cramped to the right, though.

C: I prefer P7 to q6.  While the ladder works it won't for all the game so you'll have to add a move later.  P7 wraps white's stone up without much aji and leaves over 20 pts in the corner.

B may also leave Q7 to die on a large scale by playing e.g. M7]
;W[om]C[:: bonus points!];B[nm];W[on]C[C: terrible by white, b is now well ahead]
;B[oo];W[jq]
(;B[lq]LB[nn:A]TR[fq]C[pajaro: The ladder has a very bad aji. I know I'm supposed to capture the sooner, but...


:: No 'but'. Capture now. If not, white can exploit it even more. Thank him for the power you gain! After capturing these stones you will no longer have to worry about the right side. You can fully concentrate on F3 and the like.
The power you get by capturing will shine over the whole board: into the center and even to the left since white has just few stones there. After S17 even the white group above could be squeezed out.
Due to this power the white stone will look quite lonely (see variation).

YES, take immediatly.];W[hq];B[fo];W[dq]C[

:: I guess what white wants here is to connect the stones to the right with the ones to the left...

C: White's move is bad, overemphasising the corner and allowing b to take gote to fix his weakness.  With the weakness at O6 you'll be fighitng with one hand tied behind your back, and you cannot expect a good result.  Incidentially, C6 is quite a nice move now.]
;B[fc]LB[cn:C][er:A][gr:B]TR[fo][fq]C[

:: ...I'd play one more move at the bottom - e.g. E2 to separate the groups fully and move on after that.
Perhaps G2 would be even better. To fully remove eyespace from white's group. The idea is to get these two stones moving. Now it is a bit of a drawback that you did not capture the ladder-stones.
But your own two stones will get stronger by squeezing white's two stones to the right..

There is another possibility by attacking the two stones to the left - e.g. via C6:
Let white connect but get some of the left side of the board in exchange.

The acutally played F17 looks good, of course, too.

C: I think another move at the bottom is important.  b is ahead thanks to the ladder so doesn't want to invite weakness.]

(;W[df];B[ic];W[dc]C[C: Ok, the top is sufficiently settled and it is important for b to fix up a weakness now.]
;B[dk]TR[fo][fq]C[

:: This could be responsible for pressure on your two bottom stones. You will have to be careful with such moves!]
;W[dn]C[

:: white starts to put pressure on two weak groups.

C: W could have been more severe than this too, I wouldn't be surprised to see D9 die.]
;B[dh];W[eh]LB[ge:A][in:B]C[

:: for White:
:: this is not a good move by white, making contact. Better to stay away like she did with D6. Putting pressure on the two black stones and reducing black's moyo to the top. Maybe G15.
It would also be possible for white to play below. Maybe this is even a better idea. Drawing the two lone stones into the center with - say - J6.
After exchanges around D/E12 this will get harder.

C: E12 is a terrible move by w.  B has two weak groups so w should play between them (F7 is best), or at the least kill eyespace with c11.]
;B[eg]C[

:: Just now this seems to be the wrong side to me. This group of yours is not that strong and the two stones at the bottom are even weaker. Later, if they should get in trouble, it is better to have a strong group here.

So watch for the right direction. This works out fine for you. This time.

I don't like d13, b has a critical weakness at around f7, and b is inviting w to make things complicated there, what if w plays d11 now? if w gets strong in sente around d9 then b will be in real trouble.]
;W[dg];B[ei];W[fh];B[ch]C[C: connecting simply at d11 is better

you've got weakness problems, so don't make them worse.  This move just begs w to lean on you with f11 and get a good base for attacking f5.]

(;W[ff];B[fi];W[fg]C[

:: well done!];B[cm]C[C: I'd have played f7 here];W[cn];B[bf]
TR[eg]C[pajaro: Necessary?


:: what for?
white's group surely lives since the captured stone. At least it has quite enough room to live.  So this move is just to reduce territory.]

(;W[fd]TR[ff][fg][fh]C[

:: this seems to be no good move. Better to make the group live for sure. The stones around F13 already build a wall pointing towards the right side. F16 seems to serve the same purpose, since there will be no real damage to the 3rd-line stones of black emerging from that move.  Conclusion: play as in the variation (just to give an idea).

C: I'm not very find of either variation, though both are much better than f16.  F16 helps b for no gain to w, but w is alive there anyway so can tenuki, f6,  s17, etc.]
;B[gc];W[be]C[
:: so this move played immediatelly is better than F16 first.]
;B[fm]TR[gm]C[pajaro: After not answering to W B15, I think I should not have played B14. Right?


:: Depends, see there.  F7 is quite important now. A very good move. Perhaps one line to the right will put more pressure on the two stones. The group around D9 lives and don't has to be connected...

C: No (to your question), b14 is fine, you're stronger than if neither b14 and b15 had been played.  F7 is an important move so you did the right thing to come back here.]
;W[bg]
(;B[cg]LB[bh:A]C[

:: better not. stay away a bit with A and keep sente (hopefully. But B14 must be something worth to white why else should she play B13? :-))]
;W[cf];B[bh];W[lp]
(;B[nn]C[

:: well seen. Just - the white group at the bottom now gets eyespace :-(

C: Have a look through my variations to see how b can be more agressive.  You will see that a) it requires very tricky reading, and b) often the natural move for b is unavailable because every move must be a ladder saver.  I'm not necessaraly saying you should be able to read out all the ladders, though it is probably the best way to teach yourself to read, what I'm trying to demonstrate is because b did not take initially, the fight always favours w and so b loses more than if he'd taken in the first place.]
;W[mq];B[kq];W[kp]
(;B[mp]LB[io:A]C[

:: I see you like cutting. Don't cut at 'every' opportunity!  Since you have your power there maybe it is better to play from the other side (A). If you want to play here.

C: The idea of m3 isn't bad if you view it as preventing eyespace and can read the whole thing out.  If you can't then stick with simpler moves like A, they're often worth the same in the end.]
;W[mr];B[nq];W[mo]C[

:: That's why the cut is not that good.];B[np];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl]
C[

:: I think pushing just once would be enough for white here.

C: I disagree.  B8 is sente because it threatens eyeshape so b will almost certainly respond.  Secondly it is not ajikeshi since there are no other invasion points, and finally it changes b's descend from small sente to pure gote.]
;B[bk];W[ho]C[this seems smaller than s17 or m17 etc.]
(;B[go]C[pajaro: I tend to not play defensive moves like this one. It usually gives me a lot of trouble later, but, is it really necessary?


:: It seems so. See variations.

C: No it isn't necessary.  F3 is worth around 9 pts in gote (see variation that ends with the comment THIS VARIATION FOR W).  So all you have to do is find a 5+ point sente or reverse sente move and it is better (e.g. S17).]

yes, w would be better with h6];B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[kn];B[lm]
;W[dr]C[

:: Why this? To me it seems there are bigger plays on the board - like playing at the top.
This is not a urgent move, either.

:: The territorys are quite settled in this phase of the game. And you are right with the possibilities to link that group.

I marked the biggest endgame-moves I could find. In the order A-G.
Starting with F they are no sente-moves, though. (And C is not really, too)

There will be not much territory around the squares, though.

C: I wonder if b is bigger than a, though I'm not sure.  Oh, you forgot a13, probably bigger than G.  There is T7 too which is bigger than D.  Still, while I might disagree slightly about the order, Working out yose like this is an incredibly good way of improving your game.]
