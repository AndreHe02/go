GC[Hi,

I (wallace) was White in this game, and thanks to an endgame mistake of

my opponent I eventually won by a big margin. However the game was

quite close until that point (I think I was a bit ahead) and I'd like

you to point out our mistakes...]

C[[wallace\]:

ok, I think that what I did is pretty "standard", but nevertheless I'm

not sure how satisfied I should be with the result...];B[df]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[bb];W[gc];B[ie];W[ge]C[janr: everything standard, everybody satisfied]
;B[cn];W[fp]C[janr: probably black will next play on lower side, so perhaps consider f3 instead of f4 the 'complete' territory and make it more difficult for black to settle?]
;B[hq]C[[wallace\]

Before that move I wasn't feeling so well, but I suddenly felt I had am opportunity to do something. However I was quite hesitating in the way to handle that...]
;W[jq];B[ho];W[fn];B[dl]
(;W[hm]C[[wallace\] I'm

not so happy with White H7... I'm trying to induce B in making me build

territory on the lower side, but now my F4 stones seem a bit

"floating"...
janr:  once f4 is played, a sequence such as this one seems unavoidable. An alternative would be to play g3 to close of the corner and/or play k5 to make territory on the right bottom. (see variations)]

(;W[jn]C[[wallace\]

This doesn't seem very "sente", but I wanted to separate Black

(useless?) and to reinforce my lower left group...
janr: this is whites second gote move to surround the live black group.  Therefore i think it is a bit slow.  concerning the lower left group, i think living (b3) and running out (f8?) are two possibilities to save it, so that is not very urgent.  reinforcing the group on the right side (q10) and attacking the black group on the right seems more urgent.]

I live in "sente" but left B a huge top right, I really now NEED to

kill Q8 (seems easy)
janr: the variation given where white captures p9 gives black a similar top right but leaves the black q8 group almost dead.]

(;W[mg]C[trying to escape with these three useless stones is dangerous.
There are moves larger than 6 points (saving 3 stones) available.]

(;B[lh];W[mi];B[mj];W[li];B[lj];W[ki];B[lg];W[lf]C[[wallace\]

I didn't manage to read out all that, but I thought I should be able to

do something around L17 and link up to the top left, sacrificing some

stones here...
janr: saving three stones easily leads to a complicated fight.]

have been more agressive?

White wins by 19.5.
Black made several mistakes in this game. most importantly he let die his right side group.
but even without that group, the capture of k16 and the non-capture of b11 could have been sufficient to win.   White was lucky. he could have had a safer win by killing the black bottom right group earlier, protecting his right side stones better and reducing blacks territory more lightly.]
