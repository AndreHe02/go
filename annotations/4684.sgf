C[M:  Hi!  Thanks for submitting this game to be reviewed.  I'll preface my comments with "M:" for searchability.  

M:  My impression is that black played a bad opening but tricked you into fighting his style of game.  Black created many weak groups but put you on the defensive and sealed you in to create potential.  Later in the game, you did well during fights but did not always take the largest move when you had initiative.

0.  I was very pleased to see you counting!
1.  In the opening, consider the value of having access to the center (or creating influence) in addition to taking territory.  One example: don't play on the second line to secure territory during the opening.  
2.  Take the initiative.  Before you play a stone, ask, "Is this the biggest point?  Can I play elsewhere?"  For example, move 8 is a good example of not following black's lead.   Move 38 is an example of the opposite, where white reacts to black's move.  
3.  As always, practice your reading!  Both white and black made significant errors, and C14/C15 were much more interesting than either player realized in the game.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dq];W[pd];B[oc];W[pc]C[M:  Good.  Black's move is not good -- far too close -- and you have dealt appropriately by closing the corner.]
;B[nq];W[do]LB[cn:A]C[M:  I think this is a fine idea.  "A" is also worth considering here, since it discourages a black pincer (in exchange for the corner).]
;B[fp];W[cq];B[dp]LB[dn:3][eo:2][cp:1][cr:A]C[M:  Not a standard move.  The usual move is at "A".  The problem with this move is that it gives white a bigger corner and the natural followup (white 1, black 2, white 3) pushes white along the fourth line.]
;W[cp];B[pn]
(;W[qo]LB[oo:B][np:A]C[M:  I dislike this move because it strengthens black and traps white in the corner.  You want your stones to be out, and you want to keep black's two stones split.  

M:  Perhaps A?  Or B?];B[qn]
(;W[pr]C[blackenots: I am not sure about Q2. I feel an extension down S5 would have been good for sente and then go Q2.

M:  No, I would ignore S5.  You should not often be playing on the second line in the opening.  In this case, it is worth much more to be out in the center than trapped in the corner (for 10 or 12 points).]
;B[qj]C[M:  Black should seal white in instead of making a base.]
;W[qh]LB[qg:A]C[M:  This is an overextension.  The stone you played is too far from support to be safe (later in the game).  "A" is safer.  A play on the bottom right to escape into the center or attack black's O3 stone is bigger.]
;B[qq]
(;W[qr]LB[pq:A]C[M:  "A" is the correct move.  In general, when your opponent "peeps" at a gap in your stones, connect ... or at least, consider it as your first option.]
;B[ro]C[blackenots: S5 causing trouble for me. looking back i';m sure i should have extended down first insetad of Q2.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[rq];W[rp];B[op];W[rr];B[or];W[sq];B[oq]
;W[rn];B[po];W[so];B[jp]C[M:  Black has a lovely position on the bottom and has ruined the top.  White does not have equivalent potential elsewhere.]
;W[ri]LB[cf:A][eo:B]C[blackenots: this move wasn't urgent now that i think of it., black took initiative and extended.

M:  Correct.  This is another second line move -- not urgent.  "A" is probably the biggest move.  "B" is the shape move (the move black would like to make to fix his position on the bottom left).]
;B[cj];W[ej]C[blackenots: I capped here because i thought i could make a  wall along left side

M:  This move is used to reduce the potential of an opponent's moyo -- not to make territory.  It would be a bit too optimistic to hope that white could wall in the left.  In addition, if black extends toward the bottom, white's group there will feel some pressure.]

(;B[cn]LB[cm:A]C[M:  Threatening the cut is a good idea, but this is not the correct move.  "A" threatens the cut and helps C10.]
;W[dn];B[cm];W[dm];B[cl];W[co];B[jd];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce]
;W[de]C[M:  This should not work.]
(;B[cf]LB[be:A]C[M:  Black should "A."];W[db]
(;B[fc]LB[eb:A]C[M:  Another error by black.  Should be "A".]
;W[fb];B[cb];W[bb];B[eb];W[ca];B[ea];W[ed];B[ec]C[blackenots: when i counted here i estimated roughly that black had 70 points of potential territory and i had 30-40. so i knew I had to initiate an invasion. I saw two groups of blacks that were not connected.

M:  Very good that you are counting!  I believe you overestimate both side's potential (especially black's, as P17 is very weak), but yes, you are behind.]
;W[ch]LB[df:A]C[blackenots: answered C12 to cut two of blacks weak groups.

M:  A good idea, but black should be able to live on both sides (see vars).  The key move is "A" to save the top stones.   The stones in the middle can live or escape.]

(;B[di];W[dh]C[blackenots: kept pushing to give black the choice of saving the two stones on the top or the 5 stones on the bottom.]
;B[ei];W[df]C[blackenots: extended to claim invaded territory

M:  Black has been very generous.  :)  Nevertheless, these stones still have some potential (aji).]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[fe];W[dk];B[ck]C[blackenots: i was still down by quite a bit

M:  The game is not so uneven now.];W[fj];B[fh]LB[eh:A]C[M:  "A" is better, since it forces white to capture C14 securely.]
;W[eh];B[fi];W[dr];B[er];W[fo];B[ff]C[M:  Nice, if black sees it!]
;W[gp]C[M:  Black has a large move on top.  White gets some points on the bottom, but black destabilizes white's corner on top and saves the C14 stones.]

(;B[gq];W[fq]
(;B[eq]LB[hp:A]C[M:  Black should read ahead and cut losses.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[fs];B[gs];W[ep];B[hq];W[hp];B[iq];W[rj]LB[mc:A]
C[blackenots: this move i think was pre-mature. black will ignore to protect his framework on the top.

M:  Yes.  Black will make no points there because of S6 and S11.  

M:  How about "A"?];B[nd];W[ob];B[nb];W[od];B[nc];W[qk]C[M:  Small.  Black is building a large framework on top.  White only makes 5 points here.]
;B[nf];W[of]C[M:  This is a "thank you" move.  Black strengthens for free.]

;B[gj];W[gk];B[ij];W[ik];B[dl];W[el];B[dj]C[M:  How much is this move worth?  Should white play elsewhere?]
;W[ek];B[kn];W[km];B[jm];W[im];B[jl]C[blackenots: i'm surprised i misread this. instead i extended on the wrong side. J8 instead of L8 allowing black to capture my stone for nothing.]

(;W[bf]C[blackenots: I didn't need to do this i had enough liberties. third non-urgent move i've played.

M:  See var.  The point is, the stones at C14/C15 have a lot of potential.  They were not captured cleanly.  No more comments from here.]
