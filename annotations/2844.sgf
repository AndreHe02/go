C[This is my first game I post here. Thanks in advance for the time you spend at reviewing this.

I played black, white is played by 'Bakabot', a 10k computer program (the gnu thing). Because my rank at KGS is 19k? we played without komi.

Though I captured a lot of stones in the center, I lost by 11.5 moku. I lost too much in the top and the bottom left + top right corner. I already added some comments for the moves I was unsure about.

Hello! I'm r0n, KGS 11k at this moment. This is my first review and hopefully it would be beneficial to you. You can always feedback any comments to me @ ronnie_1e@hotmail.com =)

General Comments About the Game : You allowed the opponent to gain four corners, which is unacceptable usually but apparently u have made almost sufficient compensation from the centre. Also, you could have reduced the top group of white to possibly win this game. I feel that your loss is mainly due to a lack of a reduction or invasion to the top group of white.]

[de:A][cj:H][dj:G][cn:C][dn:D][fp:F][fq:E]C[r0n : An approach move at F3 is very common, but however other possibilities include ABCDFGH that i have listed here, though an approach at E is nowhere as urgent as an approach at A or B and that a move at G or H should be one of the biggest move on the board at this point.]
;W[de];B[dn]LB[eo:A]C[This is the first move I'm not sure about. I did not expect him to ignore my move. Was it right of me to play D6, or maybe D5, or should I have reacted to his extension in the top?

r0n:It is not uncommon for white to ignore this move in favour of an enclosure at the top for the D4 stone can still be alive with a play at A to break into the centre with more space for eye building

Alternatively your play at D6 you can choose to use it as a reduction of the top moyo or a point lower at C6, though this is still a possible move to play at this point.]
;W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[hp];W[fn];B[el];W[fm];B[hn]LB[kp:A][lp:D]
[kq:B][lq:C]C[Better L4?

r0n : Probably. Any of the four points ABCD would make good sense to consolidate the bottom for black.]
;W[jq];B[jp]LB[jo:A][mq:B]C[r0n : I feel that this is a bad move as white can easily play lightly to live around this area. My suggestion would be a capping move higher at A or a extension from the right at B]
;W[kp];B[iq];W[jo];B[ip];W[qo]TR[jo][kp][jq]C[r0n : To play the chinese fuseki means you must be prepared to handle invasions. Also, you must make sure that the two weak groups marked with triangle and square in the bottom right area must not form a stronger group when linked together.]
;B[po];W[eq]LB[cq:A]C[I think this is a very big move, especially because I reacted. Should I have just ignored this move, or perhaps go to P17 to secure the other corner?

r0n: I feel that this is a very big move to take the bottom left corner but actually an invasion at A would be a better response for it]
;B[fp];W[qn];B[pn];W[rq];B[qp];W[rp];B[ko]CR[pn][po][qp][pq]
C[r0n : This move is good, but only because you created a wall at the right of it. As a result you are able to make use of the wall to weaken the weak group that is unsettled in your area]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[jn];B[lp];W[ln];B[km];W[do];B[cn];W[jm];B[lm]
;W[jl];B[eh]LB[ch:A]C[Another mistake I think. Better D13, or is it possible to invade his territory at the top (K16)?

r0n : Probably so, because you extended three spaces, when extensions should be of even spaces to prevent an effective invasion in the middle of the extension. Also, the extension is probably too high, allowing a play by ur opopnent at A here to reduce underneath]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[bo];B[bn];W[ge]LB[jh:A]C[r0n : This is a very big move as it effectively seals the the top for the white. A play around the region A would be good to build a moyo for later to convert into territory]
;B[hk];W[co];B[kk];W[jg];B[lf];W[ki];B[if];W[pb]C[Again, white ignores my moves and takes the corner. I can't see why M14 and J14 are not good enough.

r0n : Most probably M14 and J14 may threaten the middle group of white, but the play is not as big as that of Q18 or B11,which reduces black's territory by a lot. In comparison black needed another move to seal the centre and is still vulnerable at the left side and right side, which means that white would benefit directly now also that it can still fight it's way through in the other areas.]

;B[jj];W[ih];B[hh];W[qc];B[qd];W[bi];B[cj];W[ql];B[pl];W[rl]
;B[rk];W[id]C[After this move I thought it was too late to invade the top. Should I have tried it earlier?

r0n : The white top should be invaded or reduced even before the play at G15. I feel that there is still a possibility that u can invade at C16, though i am unable to determine the exact status depending on how your opponent plays. Other than that, the white top is basically fixed and white can now seek to reduce black and also to save the white group in the middle.]
;B[lj];W[nh];B[mg];W[li];B[ji];W[ij];B[ik]C[Bad move?];W[nj]
;B[ng];W[kf];B[jh];W[ig];B[kh];W[nl];B[hf];W[mp];B[lq];W[nn]
;B[ke];W[pk];B[mo]C[Better Q7? Or maybe R7?

r0n : Definitely. N5 doesn't do anything except force white to connect to eat N5, which is essentially nothing =). A play at Q7 would separate the white group in the centre from the white group at the bottom right corner. Also since the black group that is surrounded by the white group is not dead, you can even attempt to kill the white group on the right of the centre black group, which will turn it to a massive win for black if that happens. So possibly this could be the losing move for black.]

;W[sl];B[ri];W[bj];B[bk]LB[ei:A][ck:B]C[I think this was overplay. Better C9?

r0n : not necessarily. But there is an empty triangle in the middle of the shape, which means that white can exploit this situation from either cutting point at A and B.]
